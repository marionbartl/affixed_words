For those of us who grew up in the pre-cable era , cartoons were a rare treat .
At best you could expect a couple of solid hours of toy tie - in animation after school on weekdays and a glowing Saturday lineup that always seemed to implode around noon .
What we typically did n't have , in those days before Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network , were cartoons shown in primetime .
The exceptions to this rule were the holiday specials : a then meager chain of seasonal shows that would regularly pop up in the autumn and winter months , much to the delight of animation - starved children of decades past .
Each year many of us watched the same handful of shows without fail , and along the way they became a viable part of our cultural heritage .
And while we often wax nostalgic about The Year Without a Santa Claus and How the Grinch Stole Christmas ! , it was the Halloween specials that always proved my favorite .
Submitted for your perusal are these five classic examples of old school animated specials .
Before The Simpsons ' Treehouse of Horror changed the game , they were all we had .
And we loved them in spite of their unbridled cheesiness .
- Garfield 's Halloween Adventure : Before Jim Davis 's lethargic feline had his own Saturday morning cartoon , he graced the small screen in a series of primetime specials including this 1985 fright - fest .
Garfield 's Halloween Adventure finds Garfield and Odie discovering a mansion haunted by ghostly pirates searching for a long - buried treasure .
While certainly spookier than your typical Scooby Doo villain , they ain't exactly Captain Barbossa .
The aged cabin boy who relates the tale of their blood oath , on the other hand , is moderately terrifying .
CSI Star Marg Helgenberger & Alan Rosenberg Split
CSI actressand her husbandhave reportedly ended their 19 year marriage .
He is the current president of the Screen Actors Guild and occasionally appeared in episodes of CSI alongside his wife .
A publicist for the actress has confirmed that Marg and Alan " have decided to take some time apart .
They love and respect each other and remain committed to their family . "
The couple have an 18 year old son Hugh .

This cuts to the heart of the CEO pay discussion , so thanks for raising it .
The argument made by this overpaid bunch always centers around the unfounded concept of “ high risk / high reward ” but there never is any risk at the top .
It ’s only about reward , with the risk being doled out in heavy doses to everyone else .
In the case of GM , outside of this boot licker , nobody in America sees current GM CEO Richard Wagoner , Jr. as the person to lead the company out of this mess .
If CEO ’s such as Wagoner are going to ask for the big bucks , either put up or shut up .
General Motors vice chairman and auto industry veteran Robert Lutz says saving America ’s auto industry must be a joint effort , and he thinks GM chief executive Richard Wagoner , Jr. , should not be made a “ sacrificial lamb ” in the process .
Lutz was responding to weekend calls , notably from Sen. Christopher Dodd , for Wagoner to resign .
Dodd said management changes have to be part of conditions for a bailout to help the companies restructure .
Dodd is chairman of the Senate ’s Banking Committee and a key architect of the bailout legislation being crafted in Congress .
During a Sunday appearance on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” he suggested that GM and Chrysler should probably merge .
One Dude Searches for Democracy in America , Only to Discover He's It ...

I finally got the chance to watch the final cut ( or so he says ) of John Wellington Ennis ' ingenious and inspiring Free For All ! over the weekend .
Taglined " One Dude 's Quest for Democracy " , the latest in the burgeoning election integrity documentary cannon offers yet another fresh look at our democracy on the precipice .
It 's also damned funny --- which is a very nice change of pace --- and brings both the soul and spirit of your favorite Saturday morning Schoolhouse Rock to the serious concerns of America 's mindblowing electoral dysfunction .
While previous films in the genre have often focused more narrowly on the filmmaker 's particularly favorite bête noire , such as voting machines , voter suppression , whistleblowers or the examination of specific aberrations of democracy ( such as Florida 2000 or Ohio 2004 ) , Free For All !
uses Ohio's 2006 election --- featuring ' 04 villain , OH Sec. of State J. Kenneth Blackwell 's quest for the Governorship --- to examine " all of the above " , as Ennis himself serves as the Michael Moore-ian " Dude " trying to figure out just what the hell has gone wrong with the system .
Answer : Just about damned near everything .
( Watch the FFA !
preview at right . )
Ennis even manages to close a bit of a loop on 2004 by bringing in the " Do n't Tase Me , Bro " FSU student who , in fact , was attempting to get a real answer from John Kerry on why he rolled over on the ' 04 election when he received a few thousand volts of thanks for his efforts .
Real ones .
As opposed to the imaginery ones that ABCNBCCBSCNNMSNBCFOX used on themselves to shut down reportage on one several of the greatest crimes of modern times .
Ennis also succeeds in offering a solution to many of the discovered woes ...
Near the end of his quest to figure out who is supposed to be watching over our public elections , to keep these nightmares from occurring , he discovers the answer --- in a government of the people , by the people , and for the people --- is actually citizen oversight .
" I'm the oversight , " Ennis notes in his revelation , before adding " that 's really depressing . "
But , as he quickly finds out , what 's actually depressing is doing nothing .
What 's empowering , on the other hand , is taking action , as Ennis himself did when he helped found the incredibly important Video The Vote movement .
VtV will , again this year , be out in force across the country , documenting our democracy for the world to see .
Please join that movement !
It takes little more than a video camera .
Even a cell phone will do !
And nothing could be less depressing .
Please add Free For All ! to your ever expanding election integrity documentary library !
And then get busy !
[ DISCLOSURE :
You should be forewarned that , yeah , I appear in this one too .
But , like many of the others , it 's good anyway ! ]
[ NOTE : Ennis will be joining me , along with Patty Sharaf , filmmaker of the frightening Murder , Spies & Voting Lies , this Thursday at Noon PT on KPFK --- 90.7 FM Los Angeles , 98.7 FM
Santa Barbara and streaming on KPFK.org --- as I host a fundraising hour for the Pacifica station , featuring live interviews with both filmmakers and DVD give - aways for supporters ! ]
FREEZE FRAME WITH RUSS SIMMONS DEAR JOHN Published 02/05/2010 - 12:00 a.m. CDT

With the exception of a couple of cameo appearances , the last time that Mel Gibson appeared onscreen was in the 2002 sci- fi curiosity , “ Signs . ”
Of course , he ’s been preoccupied by directing ( “ The Passion of the Christ , ” “ Apocalypto ” ) and with some highly publicized personal matters .
Choosing to keep a relatively low profile for a box office superstar , Gibson hoped to find a suitably lighthearted comedy script for his Hollywood comeback .
No such luck .
Gibson ’s return to the big screen is a violent , hardboiled conspiratorial thriller with lots of gnashing teeth , beads of sweat and throbbing forehead veins .

" Many people have wanted to see what you see , but did not see it . "
- Luke 10:24
With my dying breath as a game designer , I thought I 'd unleash my unique brand of creativity on a concept that you 'll never see anywhere else .
It 's an experience that billions of people have prayed for , but which no ordinary artist has the wherewithal to deliver .
A territory that many would have liked to explore , but which can only be navigated by one who has freedom and lacks fear .
You 've read the book , you 've seen the film , and you 've heard the music .
Now LIVE THE LIFE , and leave no stone unturned as you finally understand that which has been misunderstood by many ...
The Gospel According To You
Chances are you 've already made up your mind about this project .
You either think I'm a Bible - bashing preacher or a trouble - causing blasphemer .
As with all bold assumptions , neither one holds much weight .
The You Testament takes too many liberties with the text to be considered " preaching " , and yet its message is too sincere to be dismissed as " blasphemy " .
That leaves us somewhere in the middle , as you come face to face with spiritual principles and get to make your own mind up as to what they mean .
I 've always been fascinated with the idea of games as a metaphor for the relationship between body and soul , and this is the most overt exploration of that yet .
As your 3D character struggles to make sense of his existence , you might just come to make sense of your own ...
The Last Supper
As revolutionary as this all sounds , the gameplay itself should feel quite familiar .
It 's basically a biblical remake of Hard Time , where you make your way in a society consisting of hundreds of other fully interactive characters - all presided over by an authoritative regime .
Rather appropriately for my last project , it also doffs its hat to practically every other game I 've ever made !
The hand - to - hand combat is lifted straight from the wrestling games , the scenery is reminiscent of World War Alpha , and the survival concept has a lot in common with Wrecked ( not to mention the spiritual undertones ) .
You might dismiss this as lazy recycling , but it 's actually a deliberate ploy to show the cohesion in my work and the divine destination it was tumbling towards .
As the credits note , " No creative endeavour begins or ends in vain " ...
Swords And Sandals
Despite appearances , Jesus is n't actually the star of the show .
Instead , the game centres on a disciple of your own creation .
However you compose your character , you can be sure they 'll look different to how they did in any other game !
One of the biggest challenges with this project was creating a baggy robe - based costume for the average civilian .
It ran counter to the tight style of clothing I had become accustomed to in my wrestling work .
Although it 's not perfect , I developed the best system I possibly could without compromising the animations .
It 's certainly versatile .
Instead of offering you one preset piece of clothing , this game breaks it down into two parts - an undergarment and a sash wrapped over it .
You can then mix and match these as you wish to produce any colour scheme .
It even applies to headwear , which has separate upper and lower components for things like turbans .
And unique to this game is a cool little hood for that Obi Wan Kenobi look !
All the while , the Roman authorities stand out in the red and gold uniforms they sported in World War Alpha ...
Eye To Eye
In addition to the biblical costumes , another visual innovation for this game is that the characters now have REAL moving eyes !
It was the first ( and only ) detail to be released early in the game 's production and has gone on to be an effective part of the experience .
Not only does it allow characters to look at each other eye to eye , but it also allows them to express much more emotion while doing so .
The eyes squint in addition to moving , which - together with the eyebrows - helps to communicate anger and sadness .
It 's even possible for the eyes to close completely , which is good for both temporary winces of pain and being unconscious on the floor .
If nothing else , the simple act of blinking makes them feel more human .
And above all else , these eyes can of course be of any colour - from the darkest black to the palest blue - which ensures that even the same face can be made to appear different .
The only downside is that the eyes tend to look quite similar on a structural level .
They have to be in the same place on every skull , so it 's no longer possible to have some of the unique looks I created with images ...
Your Own Personal Jesus
One of the most interesting things about this game is that the entire cast can be randomized to look fresh .
I felt it was important to include a stereotypical Jesus ( whom you see in most of these shots ) so that people could at least relate to what was going on .
If you ever get bored of him , however , you can edit him by hand or ask the computer to generate an entirely random one !
This throws up the rather controversial prospect of a Jesus of any race or gender .
Although not historically accurate , it 's great for challenging your preconceptions and makes the teachings more important than the man .
The same applies for all the other key players - so John The Baptist and your fellow disciples can change each time too .
It 's even possible to discover that the Virgin Mary is actually a single father ?!
God 's Own Country
The look of the scenery has also evolved to match the improved characterization .
The game breaks ancient Palestine down into a staggering 32 separate locations .
To put that into perspective , Wrecked 's island consisted of 5 and Hard Time 's prison had 11 .
We 're talking about extremely sophisticated locations too - which range from sprawling outdoor terrain to indoor architecture ( and some that combine both ) .
As ever , it 's necessary to clear one scene and reload another every time you move on .
A necessary evil I 'm afraid .
However , as in Wrecked , the process is made less painful thanks to a map that charts your journey while you 're waiting !
Appropriate segments of this map also pop up during the game as you approach an exit path , which - along with clear signposting - helps to give you a sense of direction ...
The Tree Of Knowledge
The terrain should look and feel familiar to players of World War Alpha .
I 've taken the same basic premise and fleshed it out with all manner of additional scenery .
Most notably , the most diverse and realistic looking foliage yet - which ranges from big trees to tiny plants .
It 's achieved by displaying perfect 2D sprites instead of half - baked 3D models .
The only problem is that 2D sprites do n't look quite so " perfect " up close , but it 's worth it to see some nice scenery in the distance ( which is where it 'll be more often than not ) .
As ever , the game also brings additional atmosphere to the landscape with distinct times of day that come to pass in real time !
The lighting slowly shifts from day to night and back again to give you a sense of living in a real environment ...
The Eye In The Sky
You can enjoy the view with a revamped manual camera that 's controlled by the mouse .
Once you get used to it , it 's quicker and more intuitive than stabbing at keys .
Trust me , you 'll be reaching for it when the cameraman gets tied up from time to time !
The camera tracks your character from behind by default , but the scenes are so chaotic that it 's not always ideal .
The action is also accompanied by the most advanced music system yet .
Instead of banging you over the head with one main theme , this time I composed 4 distinct ones and got the game to the fade them in and out at random .
They 're even provided as high quality MP3's instead of bastardized WAV files .
That means it 's finally possible to have background music in one my games without getting a headache !
Although there is an option to break the volume down to zero if you disagree ...
The Greatest Story Ever Told
The game essentially involves following Jesus around these various locations and enjoying the most sophisticated storytelling mechanism my work has ever produced .
Most games tell a story with preset cut - scenes of some description , but here the actual game engine is used throughout .
Jesus and his co-stars have a set place to be at a set time , and the game will conspire to put them there waiting for you to make an appearance .
They will then act out a scene using the same input and animations that are available to you .
That 's both a blessing and a curse , because it opens up the possibility of the story being told BADLY !
But it 's worth it to have the sense that everything is real and anything can happen .
In addition to a main storyline that unfolds chronologically , there are also hundreds of sub -plots that are linked to your actions .
If Jesus sees you doing something or acting a certain way , he will give you an impromptu sermon about that - whether it's the folly of being violent or the benefits of a vegetarian diet .
Likewise , there are conversations to be had between you and the other civilians - many of which are open - ended as in Hard Time and can go either way .
A prime example is the issue of " denying " Jesus once he becomes unpopular .
You actually have a choice in this game ( although you WILL understand why Peter did what he did ! ) ...
The Kingdom Of God Is Within You
A project about Jesus is controversial in itself , but one of the game 's biggest revelations is that it attributes his powers to the Eastern art of meditation .
We often think of Jesus in Western terms , but the Eastern influence is plain to see for those that can relate to what he 's saying .
He mysteriously disappears between the ages of 14 and 28 , before returning with some radical ideas .
Some scholars place him in India during these formative years .
At the very least , it seems he was exposed to a pacifist Jewish sect which preserved the original teachings of Moses .
Far from being " controversial " , this is actually the key that unites ALL religions and unlocks their hidden meanings .
The simple premise of closing one 's two eyes to the outside world and opening one 's " third eye " to an inner world is key to mastering the human experience .
When one looks within , they are confronted with their psychological make - up and can set about purifying it by removing negative character traits .
This perfected being then takes control of life instead of being at its mercy .
Having sidestepped the illusion of existence , you find yourself able to " manipulate " it ...
Lifting Up The Serpent
As far as the game is concerned , meditation is a means of elevating yourself above the average man and living a more meaningful existence .
Once Jesus has initiated you , you can enter a meditative state at any time by holding the Space Bar .
You 're then treated to a sub - game where you direct spiritual energy throughout your body like a snake !
By directing it into certain chambers ( chakras ) , you can reap the benefits of up to 18 different powers that Jesus may have taught you .
I wo n't spoil the surprise by revealing them all , but they 're essentially legitimate " cheat codes " that you can invoke at will to make your life easier - such as conjuring items out of thin air , healing your wounds , becoming invisible , or being able to fly .
Although they 're exaggerated for the sake of entertainment , you'd be surprised how closely linked they are to the narrative .
There are also some cool riffs on the notion of it all being a " game " - such as revealing the polygons behind the graphics you see !
You essentially come to understand the real nature of things - much to the bewilderment of those that do n't ...
The Hand Of God
In addition to invoking powers from a seated position , you can also save them to your hand for a short time and use them while out and about .
There 's a whole button dedicated to that , which causes you to reach out with your left hand - even when you have no such powers !
If you do , however , you should notice that the power has taken on a whole other meaning - effectively doubling the number of miracles to 36 .
For instance , manifesting an item while seated puts it into your hands and gives you a choice - whereas the standing version fires items out of your hand like missiles !
Other powers are flipped on their head , such as being empowered to heal others instead of yourself .
Whenever you reach out , your hand automatically aims directly at the nearest candidate and allows you to manipulate them in some way .
Doing so may attract unwanted attention though - especially from the authorities who take a dim view of sorcery ...
Mind , Body & Soul
The ability to work miracles is reserved for the virtuous .
As in Wrecked and Hard Time , you 're charged with the responsibility of keeping your character alive by making sure their physical health and mental health is under control .
Losing all of your bodily health risks death , whereas losing your mind results in a nervous breakdown - which can be worse than death !
In that state , you literally lose control of your character for a short time and have to sit back while he wages war on others and ruins your reputation .
This game completes the holy trinity by giving you a " soul " to worry about too .
A spiritual meter fluctuates alongside your mind and body , increasing with every virtuous act and plummeting into minus figures when you indulge a life of sin .
It 's up to you , but you need positive energy to access the various powers - so a sinful man is doomed to be " normal " until he works off his bad karma .
That is , unless he 's so despicably evil that he can invoke the power of the devil !
A satanic character roams the world as surely as Jesus does , competing for your soul .
If you turn to the dark side and listen to him instead , your spiritual powers can have a sinister edge ...
Material Possessions
As ever , there are dozens of fully interactive items in the game to help you in your quest .
The difference here is that half of them are edible , as you once again put food to your lips to consume it as you did in Wrecked .
Your health is then boosted accordingly , which saves you having to recoup energy by sitting around .
There are different kinds though - ranging from fish and meat to fruit and bread .
Meat products are more nourishing , but they come at a spiritual cost because you 're encouraged to adopt a vegetarian diet and fast occasionally .
Likewise , liquid products are there to nourish your mind .
You 're supposed to drink from pools of water with the " Pick - Up " command , but handheld trinkets of wine are the sinful equivalent which have a greater effect !
Alcohol leaves you in a drunken stupor though , so it 's not always advisable .
Handling material possessions ( especially money ) also keeps your happiness afloat , but once again it eats away at your soul over time .
As you may have gathered , the game does a good job of simulating the spiritual life by making it extremely desirable and yet very difficult to attain !
Living By The Sword
Yet another controversy for a game about religion is that violence actually plays a major part in the proceedings .
Not because you 're supposed to indulge in it , but because there are lessons to be learned by being on the receiving end of it .
The system is trimmed down from anything we 've seen in dedicated fighting games , but it 's still possible to throw out the odd kick or punch .
Plenty of weapons are also available to give attacks extra impact .
It 's once again possible to steal too by using the " Pick - Up " command near a character that has an item in hand .
As you 'd expect , indulging in all of the above is a recipe for disaster because it amasses more bad karma than anything else - especially when your actions result in a fatality .
On the other hand , being a victim of crime is considered a virtue and helps to stimulate positive energy .
It 's a miserable existence though , and can only be pulled off with spiritual strength ...
Love Thy Neighbour
Another reason to refrain from a life of crime is that you have a unique relationship with every other character in the game and transgressions wo n't be forgotten !
The more enemies you clock up , the harder and more violent your life will become .
On the other hand , it 's just as easy to develop friendships with the other characters .
Using the " Drop " command near a potential recipient now hands an item to somebody else instead of dropping it to the floor , which is generally appreciated no matter what the item may be .
Likewise , it 's also possible to make friends by simply responding favourably to any conversations that arise .
As in Reach , friendly parties are also prone to hug each other as a gesture of goodwill !
It has mental and spiritual benefits in this game though , so it 's all part of a positive lifestyle .
Fraternizing with the opposite sex may have unexpected consequences though , because it 's possible to impregnate them !
After embracing a woman for too long , you may return to the scene to find that you have a wife and child to support .
Needless to say , this is not exactly the path to spiritual enlightenment !
They prevent you from meditating when they 're nearby , and they snatch any food that you have to hand ...
Into The Eagle's Nest
Your affections wo n't be returned by the occupying Roman soldiers who serve as a police presence !
Like the guards in Hard Time , they 're the first to react to any bad behaviour and will try to keep you in check .
In addition to preventing crime , they also like to maintain order by having you sit down at night and not during the day .
They 're also likely to be suspicious of any items you 're seen carrying , so it 's important to avoid detection if you intend to break the rules .
It 's not just a beating you have to fear .
As in Hard Time , they can issue a warrant for your arrest if you 're a repeat offender .
In these cases , they wo n't stop hunting you until they have you at their mercy - and then it's off to Pontius Pilate to face trial !
This nods to the Barabbas story , where you 're presented to the public alongside another criminal and pray that they choose to release you instead of him .
If they do n't , you could be on the receiving end of all manner of punishments - ranging from a stint in prison to having offending limbs cut off ...
They Know Not What They Do
Of course , the most horrific punishment of all is crucifixion - and it's not just reserved for Jesus .
Over the course of the game , you can see all kinds of characters crucified for one reason or another - people that were once walking among you .
You 'll feel their pain if it ever happens to you , because you literally have to hang there in a static state waiting to die !
Stray crosses also exist in the game as items that you can pick up and carry over your shoulder .
A cross might not be high on your Christmas list , but it 's a necessary prop for the story when Jesus has to carry his own cross to its destination .
It 's also quite chilling to see other characters dragging a cross around from time to time .
Doing so actually has spiritual benefits too .
Although it 's bad for your health and slows you down to a crawl , taking on such burdens will help to burn off bad karma ...
Final Thought
The controversial content of this game suggests that it 'll be seen by more eyes than any other , so it 's a shame that it 's not quite the most shining example of my work .
Although it 's as big and spectacular as an independent can muster , the concept itself may not hold up to much scrutiny .
At times , the " game " amounts to little more than following Jesus around and having fun with the odd miracle he teaches you .
As in Hard Time , the penchant for realism means that your existence can sometimes be as boring and frustrating as life itself !
That 's not exactly what we 've come to expect from escapist entertainment .
But for once , that 's not the point .
What we have here is an interactive story - and an important story at that .
At this point in human history , the double threat of cynicism and fanaticism has clouded the way we view religious figures .
The atheist 's ego gets a kick out of going against the grain and delights at rejecting that which others hold dear ( blissfully unaware that their pitiful attempts to appear " intelligent " are born of ignorance ) .
Meanwhile , the fanatic 's insecurity has him clinging to that which he loves so tightly that he almost kills it - alienating the very people he would seek to " save " .
Into the breach steps a man that sees the folly of both parties and ushers them onto a shared path - the only path that ever existed .
The You Testament gives you spiritual principles as seen through the veil of a computer program .
In this context , you will finally understand words that may not have made much sense on the page .
And upon understanding , ignorance will cloud your judgment no more .
If you happen to have a bit of fun along the way , that 's a bonus .
As we always seem to say when Christmas rolls around , it 's the thought that counts ...

At approximately 3 PM , Tuesday , July 2 , a 2008 Dodge Ram 2500 , pulling a new travel trailer , hit the corner of the Texas State Bank Drive - In on Tenaha Street , causing the complete awning to come to the ground .
Luckily , the driver of the Dodge , Mickey Miller , of Garrison and his 10 year old son were able to exit their vehicle uninjured .
According to Miller he was circling the bank to park on the other side when the corner of his travel trailer caught the corner of the bank awning .
Next thing he heard was a rumble as the awning started falling against his driver 's side door .
Somehow he was able to unbuckle the seat beat and exit the other side of his truck as it was falling .
Mark Ivy of Texas State Bank stated that the main lobby would be open for business while the drive - in is being repaired .

Son of Tenn .
Lawmaker Indicted in Palin E-Mail Hack
The son of a prominent Democratic Tennessee state lawmaker was indicted Tuesday on charges of hacking into the Yahoo !
Web mail account of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
David C. Kernell , 20 , of Knoxville , was indicted by a federal grand jury on a single count of accessing Palin 's e-mail without permission .
The FBI said Kernell turned himself in to federal authorities and will be arraigned today .
Kernell is the son of Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell , who acknowledged shortly after the incident that authorities had contacted his son in connection with the investigation .
According to the indictment , on Sept. 16 , Kernell broke into Palin's Yahoo !
account by guessing the answers to her pre-selected " Secret Questions " that must be answered before Yahoo ! will let users reset e-mail account passwords .
Authorities say Kernell read Palin 's e-mail messages and then made and posted online screenshots of the e-mail inbox , along with the new password to her account .
If convicted , Kernell faces a maximum of five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine , and three years of supervised release .
Wired.com 's Kim Zetter has a nice chronology of how the hack went down , which tracks a series of postings to the online community 4 chan.org Kernell allegedly made describing how he was able to reset Palin 's account password by looking up the answers to her secret questions online .
From that story :
after the password recovery was reenabled , it took seriously 45 mins on wikipedia and google to find the info , Birthday ?
15 seconds on wikipedia , zip code ?
well she had always been from wasilla , and it only has 2 zip codes ( thanks online postal service ! ) the second was somewhat harder , the question was " where did you meet your spouse ? " did some research , and apparently she had eloped with mister palin after college , if youll look on some of the screenshits that I took and other fellow anon have so graciously put on photobucket you will see the google search for " palin eloped " or some such in one of the tabs .
I found out later though more research that they met at high school , so I did variations of that , high , high school , eventually hit on " Wasilla high " I promptly changed the password to popcorn and took a cold shower ...
I 've advised readers to take caution when picking the answers to these secret questions and to avoid choosing answers that can easily be discovered through a background or simple Internet search .
When the option is available , the safest bet is to choose your own secret question and select an answer that only you would know .
Amazingly , Yahoo !
still does not allow new registrants to make up their own question for resetting their password .

I normally get these nutball comments in emails .
This one was less a personal attack and more a call for ... well , he wants to kill all of us .
David posted : I think it 's time for another holocaust .
This time , instead of Jews , how about atheists .
We urgently need to round up all atheists in the world and lead them to the chambers .
Our world would be such a better place .
This comment is number 17 on a post titled , Dad links son ’s suicide to “ The God Delusion ” .

Go ahead , tell me David is not a real Christian .
A paranoid schizophrenic who stabbed a work colleague in the neck because he thought he was an MI5 agent was ordered to be detained in hospital for an indefinite period yesterday .
Belfast Crown Court judge Mr Justice
Hart ordered that 24 - year - old Lewis Alexander Mawhinney be detained in hospital indefinitely because of the danger he believed he “ poses to others at present ... because of his reluctance to take medication ” .
The judge added that his sentence did not mean Mawhinney , from Knockburn Drive in Lisburn , will spend the rest of his life in a secure psychiatric unit , but rather the decision on whether he will be ever released “ must ultimately be one that can only be made on the basis of a lengthy period of psychiatric observation ” .
Last month a jury found that Mawhinney was not guilty of stabbing Stephen Hayes by reason of insanity , but found he had done the act .
Originally charged with attempting to murder Mr Hayes , the prosecution proceeded with a count of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm , in light of the medical evidence compiled on Mawhinney .
During the short trial , the jury heard that Mawhinney and Mr Hayes had been attending an induction course for a Belfast call centre on 21 September last year .
Mr Hayes was in the lift when Mawhinney jumped in as the doors closed and “ without warning , ” raised his right hand and stabbed him twice in the neck .
Although Mr Hayes defended himself by kicking at Mawhinney and getting him in a headlock , he reached up and stabbed him in the neck again before the lift stopped and two colleagues were able to disarm and restrain him until the police arrived .
Giving evidence , Consultant Psychiatrist Dr Gerard Loughry said that at the time of the attack , Mawhinney was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and would not have appreciated that what he had done was morally or legally wrong .
He said Mawhinney had claimed that while studying modern languages at Oxford University , he had been recruited by MI5 secret service and when he stabbed Mr Hayes , he was acting in accordance with instructions given by his handler .
Mr Justice
Hart said there was no doubt Mawhinney had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia from at least 2006 .
The judge described the case as “ sad and tragic ” for Hayes and Mawhinney who has “ outstanding ability , whose life has been blighted by ... this condition ” .

Carol Chomsky , a linguist and education specialist whose work helped illuminate the ways in which language comes to children , died on Friday at her home in Lexington , Mass .
She was 78 .
The cause was cancer , her sister - in - law Judith Brown Chomsky said .
A nationally recognized authority on the acquisition of spoken and written language , Professor Chomsky was on the faculty of the Harvard Graduate School of Education from 1972 until her retirement in 1997 .
In retirement , she was a frequent traveling companion of her husband , the linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky , as he delivered his public lectures .
Carol Chomsky was perhaps best known for her book , “ The Acquisition of Syntax in Children From 5 to 10 ” ( M.I.T. Press ) , which was considered a landmark study in the field when it appeared in 1969 .
In it , she investigated children ’s tacit , developing awareness of the grammatical structure of their native language , and their ability to use that awareness to extract meaning from increasingly complex sentences over time .
Young children , Professor Chomsky found , could distinguish no difference in meaning between superficially similar sentences like “ John promised Bill to shovel the driveway ” and “ John told Bill to shovel the driveway ”  they could not discern who did the shoveling in each case .
Older children , she found , could do so automatically , without having been formally taught .
HARARE , Zimbabwe ( AP )  Zimbabwe has declared a national emergency over its cholera epidemic and the collapse of its health system due the country 's economic crisis .
" Our central hospitals are literally not functioning , " Minister of Health David Parirenyatwa was quoted as saying by the state - run Herald newspaper on Thursday .
The Herald said Parirenyatwa declared the state of emergency at a meeting Wednesday of government and international aid officials in Harare .
He appealed for money to pay doctors and nurses , and for drugs , food and equipment for Zimbabwe 's hospitals .
" Our staff is demotivated and we need your support to ensure that they start coming to work and our health system is revived , " he was quoted as saying .
The United Nations puts deaths from the cholera epidemic at more than 500 .
The outbreak is blamed on lack of water treatment and broken sewage pipes in a country that once had a sophisticated infrastructure .
The deputy water minister , Walter Mzembi , who also attended Wednesday 's meeting , said his ministry had only enough chemicals to treat water for 12 more weeks .
The Herald said U.N. agencies , embassies and non-governmental organizations at the meeting pledged to help .
The European Commission had said Wednesday it was providing more than $ 12 million for drugs and clean water while the International Red Cross was also releasing more funds to deal with cholera in Zimbabwe .
" We need to pool our resources together and see how best we can respond to this emergency , " Agostinho Zacarias , the U.N. Development Program director in Zimbabwe , was quoted as saying .
Zimbabwe has been paralyzed since disputed elections in March .
President Robert Mugabe and the opposition are wrangling over a power - sharing deal .
The country is suffering from the world 's highest inflation and Zimbabweans face daily shortages of food and other basic goods .

On 19 March 2003 , we were on the roof of the Zanón ceramic tile factory , filming an interview with Cepillo .
He was showing us how the workers fended off eviction by armed police , defending their democratic workplace with slingshots and the little ceramic balls normally used to pound the Patagonian clay into raw material for tiles .
His aim was impressive .
It was the day the bombs started falling on Baghdad .
As journalists , we had to ask ourselves what we were doing there .
What possible relevance could there be in this one factory at the southernmost tip of South America , with its band of radical workers and its David and Goliath narrative , when bunker - busting apocalypse was descending on Iraq ?
But we , like so many others , had been drawn to Argentina to witness first - hand an explosion of activism in the wake of its 2001 crisis - a host of dynamic new social movements that were not only advancing a bitter critique of the economic model that had destroyed their country , but were busily building local alternatives in the rubble .
There were many popular responses to the crisis , from neighbourhood assemblies and barter clubs to resurgent left - wing parties and mass movements of the unemployed , but we spent most of our year in Argentina with workers in " recovered companies " .
Almost entirely under the media radar , workers in Argentina have been responding to rampant unemployment and capital flight by taking over businesses that have gone bankrupt and reopening them under democratic worker management .
It is an old idea reclaimed and retrofitted for a brutal new time .
The principles are so simple , so elementally fair , that they seem more self - evident than radical when articulated by one of the workers :
" We formed the co-operative with the criteria of equal wages and making basic decisions by assembly ; we are against the separation of manual and intellectual work ; we want a rotation of positions and , above all , the ability to recall our elected leaders . "
The movement of recovered companies is not epic in scale - some 170 companies , around 10,000 workers in Argentina .
But six years on , and unlike some of the country 's other new movements , it has survived and continues to build quiet strength in the midst of the country 's deeply unequal " recovery " .
Its tenacity is a function of its pragmatism : this is a movement that is based on action , not talk .
And its defining action , reawakening the means of production under worker control , while loaded with potent symbolism , is anything but symbolic .
It is feeding families , rebuilding shattered pride , and opening a window of powerful possibility .
Like a number of other emerging social movements around the world , the workers in the recovered companies are rewriting the script for how change is supposed to happen .
Rather than following anyone 's ten - point plan for revolution , the workers are darting ahead of the theory - at least , straight to the part where they get their jobs back .
In Argentina , the theorists are chasing after the factory workers , trying to analyse what is already in noisy production .
These struggles have had a tremendous impact on the imaginations of activists around the world .
At this point , there are many more starry - eyed grad papers on the phenomenon than there are recovered companies .
But there is also a renewed interest in democratic workplaces from Durban to Melbourne to New Orleans .
That said , the movement in Argentina is as much a product of the globalisation of alternatives as it is one of its most con tagious stories .
Argentinian workers borrowed the slogan " Occupy , Resist , Produce " from Latin America 's largest social movement , Brazil 's Movimiento Sin Terra , in which more than a million people have reclaimed unused land and put it back into community production .
One worker told us that what the movement in Argentina is doing is " MST for the cities " .
In South Africa , we saw a protester 's T - shirt with an even more succinct summary of this new impatience : " Stop Asking , Start Taking " .
The movement in Argentina is frustrating to some on the left who feel it is not clearly anti-capitalist , those who chafe at how comfortably it exists within the market economy and see worker management as merely a new form of auto - exploitation .
Others see co-operativism , the legal form chosen by the vast majority of the recovered companies , as a capitulation in itself - insisting that only full national isation by the state can bring worker democracy into a broader socialist project .
Workers in the movement are generally suspicious of being co-opted to anyone 's political agenda , but at the same time cannot afford to turn down any support .
More interesting by far is to see how workers in this movement are politicised by the struggle , which begins with the most basic imperative : Workers want to work , to feed their families .
Some of the most powerful new working - class leaders in Argentina today discovered solidarity on a path that started from that essentially apolitical point .
Whether you think the movement 's lack of a leading ideology is a tragic weakness or a refreshing strength , the recovered companies challenge capitalism 's most cherished ideal : the sanctity of private property .
The legal and political case for worker control in Argentina does not only rest on the unpaid wages , evaporated benefits and emptied - out pension funds .
The workers make a sophisticated case for their moral right to property - in this case , the machines and physical pre mises - based not just on what they are owed personally , but what society is owed .
The recovered companies propose themselves as an explicit remedy to all the corporate welfare , corruption and other forms of public subsidy the owners enjoyed in the process of bankrupting their firms and moving their wealth to safety , abandoning whole communities to economic exclusion .
This argument is , of course , available for immediate use in the United States and Europe .
But this story goes much deeper than corporate welfare , and that 's where the Argentinian experience will really resonate with us .
It has become axiomatic on the left to say that Argentina 's crash was a direct result of the IMF orthodoxy imposed on the country with such enthusiasm in the neoliberal 1990s .
In their book Sin Patrón : Stories from Argentina 's Worker - Run Factories , to which this essay forms the introduction , the Lavaca Collective makes clear that in Argentina , just as in the US occupation of Iraq , those bromides about private sector efficiency were nothing more than a cover story for an explosion of frontier - style plunder - looting on a massive scale by a small group of elites .
Privatisation , deregulation , labour flexibility : these were the tools to facilitate a massive transfer of public wealth to private hands , not to mention private debts to the public purse .
Like Enron traders , the businessmen who haunt the pages of this book learned the first lesson of capitalism and stopped there : Greed is good , and more greed is better .
As one Argentinian worker says : " There are guys that wake up in the morning thinking about how to screw people , and others who think : how do we rebuild this Argentina that they have torn apart ? "
In the answer to that question , you can read a powerful story of transformation .
Capitalism produces and distributes not just goods and services , but identities .
When the capital and its carpetbaggers had flown from Argentina , what was left was not only companies that had been emptied , but a whole hollowed - out country filled with people whose identities - as workers - had been stripped away as well .
As one of the organisers in the movement wrote to us : " It is a huge amount of work to recover a company .
But the real work is to recover a worker and that is the task that we have just begun . "
On 17 April 2003 , we were on Avenida Jujuy in Buenos Aires , standing with the Brukman workers and a huge crowd of their supporters in front of a fence , behind which was a small army of police guarding the Brukman factory .
After a brutal eviction , the workers were determined to get back to work at their sewing machines .
In Washington , DC , that day , USAID announced that it had chosen Bechtel Corporation as the prime contractor for the reconstruction of Iraq 's architecture .
The heist was about to begin in earnest , both in the United States and in Iraq .
Deliberately induced crisis was providing the cover for the transfer of billions of tax dollars to a handful of politically connected corporations .
In Argentina , they 'd already seen this movie - the wholesale plunder of public wealth , the explosion of unemployment , the shredding of the social fabric , the staggering human consequences .
And 52 seamstresses were in the street , backed by thousands of others , trying to take back what was already theirs .
It was definitely the place to be .
In 2004 , Naomi Klein and Avi Lewis released " The Take " , a film about worker - run factories in Argentina .
This essay is an edited extract from their introduction to " Sin Patrón : Stories from Argentina 's Worker - Run Factories " , written by the Lavaca Collective ( Haymarket Books , $ 16 )

J’Accuse ( Walter Block seeks justice from the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force , Loyola University New Orleans ; hah ! )
DIGG THIS
TO : Mr. Ted Quant , Director of Loyola ’s Twomey Center for Peace through Justice ; members of the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force , Loyola University New Orleans : Mr. Ted Quant , Professors Lydia Voigt , Wing Fok , Lisa Martin , Al Alcazar , James Hobbs , Kurt Bindewald , Artemis Preeshl , Karen Reichard , Anthony Decuir
CC : Ed Kvet , Provost , Loyola University New Orleans ; Bill Locander and David Luechauer , Deans , College of Business , Loyola University New Orleans ; Fr. Kevin Wildes , S.J. , President , Loyola University New Orleans ; Roger White , Associate Provost , Loyola University New Orleans ; plus the entire Loyola University New Orleans community ( well , at least as much of it as I can reach with this present message that cannot be broadcast to the entire student and faculty list because it would be considered " personal " ; hint , hint : please pass this on to all and sundry , particularly the law school faculty )
FROM : Professor Walter Block
Mr. Quant , I hereby formally charge you , personally , with bias , racism , sexism , anti Catholicism and anti Semitism for that letter to the editor you published at the Times Picayune on 12/3/08 ; and , also , I now make the same complaint against you and all other members of the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force , Loyola University New Orleans , for your / their ( undated ) " statement " about me .
I am writing to you now because of this automatic message I received from Professor Martin , in response to a letter I wrote on 12/18/08 to all the members of the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force , Loyola University New Orleans , including her , and then another addressed solely to her :
" Professor Martin will be out of the office until early February .
Should you have a bias - related incident , please report it to Ted Quant , Director of Loyola ’s Twomey Center for Peace through Justice . Quant@loyno.edu .
Phone ( 504 ) 861-5831 . "
Previous to reading this , I did n’t realize that the calumny that has been heaped upon me of late by you , personally , and by you and your colleagues on the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force constituted " bias , " plus racism , sexism , anti Catholicism and anti Semitism , and that there was an avenue open to me to seek redress for this vituperation .
Before I elaborate on the indictment against you and your fellow Task Force members , let me make several preliminary comments .
I. First , here are the two letters , in their entirety , that prompted Prof .
Martin ’s automatic message , and my present response ( these two letters were prompted by an initial longer letter , which I reproduce here ) .
12/18/08 1pm
Dear Students :
Please read this very important essay by Tom DiLorenzo about my recent speech at Loyola College in Maryland .
I would appreciate it if you could circulate this as widely as possible on campus .
I would be delighted if the Task Force on diversity would read this ; I am copying them on this message .
I wonder if they will read DiLorenzo ; they have not seen fit to reply to the list of questions I put to them in response to their “ statement . ”
This op ed of Prof DiLorenzo ’s is crucially important , since he exhibits in it the views of his students who actually attended my lecture .
If someone would forward this to the law school faculty in particular , I would greatly appreciate that .
Here is my own most recent publication on this event .
It links to most of the material on this thread , including the Diversity Task Force ’s “ statement ” and my response to it .
12/18/08 2pm
Dear Prof. Martin :
Thanks for your message that appears below .
I did n’t realize that I had this option .
As a matter of fact , I do have a “ bias - related incident ” to report .
It pertains to Mr. Quant , and to the entire Diversity Task Force of which he is a part .
In my view , they are all guilty of engaging in “ bias ” against me .
See here and here .
Can you please advise me as to how I can bring formal charges of bias against them ?
What campus mechanisms are there for victims of bias such as me ?
Surely , I cannot report this incident to Mr. Quant himself , as he would then be a judge in his own case .
Wait , I just realized that you , too , are a member of this Task Force .
Thus , you , too , would be precluded from judging my bias complaint .
But , as an expert in these matters , you could still advise me as to how to proceed .
What mechanisms are there in place to come to the rescue of victims of bias perpetrated by the very people in charge of ferreting out , and , presumably , punishing , “ bias ” ?
Would someone who is receiving this message please forward it to the law school faculty .
Surely , someone on that faculty could advise me as to how to bring a charge of bias against the defendants in this case .
Yours truly ,
Walter E. Block , Ph.D. Harold E. Wirth Endowed Chair and Prof. of Economics College of Business Loyola University New Orleans 6363 St. Charles Ave. , Box 15 New Orleans , LA 70118 tel : ( 504) 864-7934 fax : ( 504) 864-7970 wblock@loyno.edu
From : lmartin@loyno.edu [ mailto:lmartin@loyno.edu ]
Sent : Wed 12/17/2008 3:10 PM
To : Walter Block Subject : Out of Office
Professor Martin will be out of the office until early February .
Should you have a bias - related incident , please report it to Ted Quant , Director of Loyola ’s Twomey Center for Peace through Justice . Quant@loyno.edu .
Phone ( 504 ) 861-5831 .
II .
Second , is it not anomalous of me to bring a charge of bias , racism , sexism , anti Catholicism and anti Semitism against you , personally , and the Task Force , in general , when you are precisely the people in charge of publicizing , condemning and rooting out such acts in our community ?
Well , yes , I suppose it is .
But , such a charge is not without precedent .
After all , policemen are commonly thought to have the function of protecting society against crime ; yet , although happily rarely , there are policemen who have been found guilty of the selfsame criminal behavior they are sworn to end .
Similarly , the presumed goal of judges is to promote justice .
And , yet , there are indeed cases where judges , themselves , have been imprisoned , because they have suborned justice .
As well , it is the contention of some political philosophers ( not me , as it happens ) that racism , sexism , anti Catholicism and anti Semitism and other such perspectives are endemic in our society .
Well , if these outlooks are that widespread , this present claim of mine should not be seen as much of an anomaly as would otherwise be the case .
They can infect those , too , who are supposed to oppose them .
III .
Third , I am no lawyer , but I am acquainted with at least one element of law : it is improper for a judge , such as ordinarily you would be in these matters , to take on that role in a case where you are also the defendant , such as the case I am now bringing against you and your colleagues on the Task Force .
Thus , I hereby ask you to recuse yourself in this matter .
Who should take your place in this trial ?
Whatever the mechanisms already in place to deal with the situation would be satisfactory to me .
If this awkwardness has not been anticipated , then I would accept as my judge on these matters the university president , provost , any of the associate provosts , any dean or associate dean , except , of course , for Dean Anthony Decuir , who would also have to recuse himself .
IV .
Fourth , I have been accused of racism and sexism .
The burden of proof rests with those who make this hysterical allegation ; until and less they do , it is not required of me , the accused , to refute it .
However , I want to clarify the record .
I have a paper trail incompatible with these accusations .
Here is an article of mine published in January , 1993 , long before the present unpleasantness began , in support of black leader Malcolm X .
And here is a more recent op ed ( published on 5/16/08 , about six months before the brou ha ha that erupted in Baltimore ) supporting the candidacy of Barack Obama , versus his two main competitors at the time , Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
Then , too , I have written on several occasions in favor of reparations to present day black people , in compensation for past slavery ; see on this here , here and here :
These are hardly positions associated with racism .
Further , among my many co authors , several of my writing partners are black scholars .
Here , here and here are some of the publications we have co authored .
You will note that this evidence of my non racism is of long duration .
I have published in favor of slavery reparations to black people in 1999 - 2000 , 2002 and again in 2007 .
My explicit support for black leaders ( Malcolm , Obama ) stretches from 1993 to 2008 .
This bespeaks a long term dedication to this cause .
My co authorships with black scholars stretch from 1981 to 2007 .
Thus , I am no Johnny - come - lately to the non or anti racist banner .
My record on sexism is equally clear .
I would estimate that I have in excess of several dozen female co authors , going back to the 1990s .
I can supply a bibliography of these publications if needed .
At this point , let me mention only one citation : here is a publication that began as a term paper by one of my black female students .
Although I do not agree with a word of it , indeed , she explicitly criticizes my views in her paper , I took great pains to help her get it published .
V. Fifth , I want to give some background as to my teaching style .
If I had to summarize it briefly , it is inspired by John Stuart Mill ’s " On Liberty , " where he discusses the pedagogical benefits of students hearing all sides of any dispute .
That is precisely the way I run my courses .
For example , when I teach environmental economics , I try to instill in my students four different viewpoints .
I even place them on the blackboard like this :
Radical left ; moderate left ; moderate right , radical right
( Radical left indicates those who take a position similar to David Suzuki or Paul Ehrlich ; moderate left is roughly the Al Gore position ; moderate right portrays the University of Chicago watered down free enterprise viewpoint — Julian Simon might be a good exemplar of this ; and radical right , my own Austro libertarian views ) .
Then , I make a list of topics to be discussed , and place them down the first column of the blackboard , hence :
Species extinction
Overpopulation
Forests
Water
Recycling
Weather
Pollution
Note , that with four columns and seven rows ( I usually cover about 15 topics in my classes ) this creates a matrix of 28 boxes .
I tell my students that a great part of the term ’s work will be to fill in this checker board : they will learn the views of all four of the perspectives regarding all the topics to be discussed .
As evidence for this pedagogical style , I offer my seven years ’ worth of syllabi , which are on record at the College of Business .
( If a student writes a term paper from a perspective with which I disagree , I give it a high mark if I think it is a good example of that orientation . )
After my lecture in Baltimore , during the question period , I was asked why there is a black — white earnings gap .
As most economists would , I answered that this was a function , mainly , of productivity differentials .
The questioner persisted , wondering why these , in turn , existed .
In response I said there are two main theories that purport to explain this .
The first , I went on to say , was that lower black productivity could be traced back to slavery , to Jim Crow legislation , to poorer inner city schooling , diet , etc .
The second was IQ differentials .
I feel it is my duty as a professor , when confronted with student questions , to lay out all the relevant issues .
In my view , a student who has never so much as even heard of this IQ explanation is at a decided intellectual disadvantage , compared to those who have .
I go further : such a student has been cheated .
Now , even mentioning IQ in the typical university setting ( apart from debunking the entire concept ) is , for many , akin to shouting out the F word in the drawing room .
Indeed , it is simply not done in " polite " society , in their view .
I beg to differ .
Jesus claimed to be “ the Truth ” and that part of " putting on the full armor of God is to “ gird your loins with Truth “ .
The pursuit of Truth is an integral and recurrent commandment to the faithful Christian .
Well , it is true that some scholars explain productivity differentials in terms of IQ .
This is the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .
To evade this , to hide this from students , constitutes moral cowardice .
I search in vain for biblical or Jesuitical writing to the effect that the truth must be suppressed if it brings about hurt feelings .
Perhaps I will be corrected on this by those with greater theological credentials than I .
It is intellectual malpractice to act as if the Herrnstein - Murray book , The Bell Curve , simply does not exist .
It is a sin against the truth .
I will never be part of any such thing .
Rather , I take my stance with John Stuart Mill .
It is as if he presciently wrote , in On Liberty , about this very sort of thing :
" … the opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may possibly be true .
Those who desire to suppress it , of course deny its truth ; but they are not infallible .
They have no authority to decide the question for all mankind , and exclude every other person from the means of judging .
To refuse a hearing to an opinion , because they are sure that it is false , is to assume that their certainty is the same thing as absolute certainty .
All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility . "
Mill continues ( emphasis added ) :
" But when we turn to subjects infinitely more complicated , to morals , religion , politics , social relations , and the business of life , three - fourths of the arguments for every disputed opinion consist in dispelling the appearances which favour some opinion different from it .
The greatest orator , save one , of antiquity , has left it on record that he always studied his adversary ’s case with as great , if not with still greater , intensity than even his own .
What Cicero practised as the means of forensic success , requires to be imitated by all who study any subject in order to arrive at the truth .
He who knows only his own side of the case , knows little of that .
His reasons may be good , and no one may have been able to refute them .
But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side ; if he does not so much as know what they are , he has no ground for preferring either opinion .
The rational position for him would be suspension of judgment , and unless he contents himself with that , he is either led by authority , or adopts , like the generality of the world , the side to which he feels most inclination .
Nor is it enough that he should hear the arguments of adversaries from his own teachers , presented as they state them , and accompanied by what they offer as refutations .
That is not the way to do justice to the arguments , or bring them into real contact with his own mind .
He must be able to hear them from persons who actually believe them ; who defend them in earnest , and do their very utmost for them .
He must know them in their most plausible and persuasive form ; he must feel the whole force of the difficulty which the true view of the subject has to encounter and dispose of ; else he will never really possess himself of the portion of truth which meets and removes that difficulty . "
With these preliminaries out of the way , I now elaborate upon my indictment against you and the Task Force .
First , consider your own letter of to the Times Picayune .
It reads as follows :
White supremacy theory proved fatal and false
Wednesday , December 03 , 2008
Re : “ A tough sell in the marketplace of ideas , ” Other Opinions , Nov. 25 .
Loyola University professor Walter Block asserts that black people and women are less productive than white men because women have only “ average ” intelligence needed for motherhood but not for “ leading corporations ; ” he cites discredited research that asserts black people have lower IQs than white people .
Apparently the havoc wrought by 500 years of pseudoscientific “ proofs ” of white supremacy is not sufficiently instructive .
Millions of native peoples were slaughtered and Africans enslaved while theologians debated whether they had souls or were even human .
The racial theories of American eugenics led to forced sterilizations and Nazi racial policies that categorized certain peoples as “ life unworthy of life . ”
With great Aryan efficiency , millions were murdered .
There have always been academicians ready to provide “ scientific ” proof of white supremacy and a justification for racial and gender discrimination .
Will the next step be demanding the repeal of civil right laws to allow discrimination against those Block deems unproductive ?
This is the logic and legacy of such flawed analysis .
Ted Quant Director Twomey Center Loyola University New Orleans
Let me address this letter under the following five headings : bias , racism , sexism , anti Catholicism , anti Semitism .
1. bias .
You place in quotation marks the words “ average ” and “ leading corporations . ”
The context makes it plain that you are directly quoting me .
Yet , I challenge you to find such words in any of my publications with that precise meaning attached .
Your letter is almost a classic case of guilt by association .
Some supporters of forced eugenics used IQ to buttress their case .
Therefore , anyone who utilizes this IQ measure is guilty of advocating a similar rights violation .
Yes , the Nazis are properly associated with this sort of vicious thinking .
But Hitler was also an advocate of health foods , and environmental concerns .
Are we to condemn all those with these interests ?
Yes , if we believe in guilt by association .
As it happens , the Nazis were not the only supporters of eugenic measures .
Far from it .
Others who held these views include : H. G. Wells , Woodrow Wilson , Theodore Roosevelt , Emile Zola , George Bernard Shaw , John Maynard Keynes , William Keith Kellogg , Margaret Sanger , Winston Churchill , and Sidney Webb ; feminists Emily Murphy , Louise McKinney and Nellie McClung .
Here is yet another listing of famous people who supported this initiative : Charles Darwin , H.G. Wells , Margaret Sanger , Samuel Butler , Plato , Alexander Graham Bell , John D. Rockefeller , Theodore Roosevelt , John H. Kellogg , Charles Davenport , Lewis Terman .
Are we to denounce all those who are guilty of merely citing any of these people ?
Yes , if we believe in guilt by association .
Yes , if you apply the same logic to all of them as you have applied to me .
Do you indeed revile , as you do me , anyone who ever quoted any of these supporters of eugenics ?
Of course not .
Hence , your bias is demonstrated .
President elect Obama has called for people to " disagree without being disagreeable . ”
I have long tried to follow this advice , all throughout my intellectual career .
Can you honestly say that you have disagreed with me without being disagreeable ?
2. racism .
It is surely racist to accuse a well documented supporter of black leaders , and of a black cause ( reparations for slavery ) , and a co author with several black scholars , of cooperation with , or support for , the slaughter of millions of Africans , merely for attempting to shed light on why it is that there is a wage gap between whites and blacks .
If this is not an attempt to " suppress by authority , " in Mill ’s words , then nothing is .
3. sexism .
It is sexist to accuse me of saying this : " women are less productive than white men because women have only u2018average ’ intelligence needed for motherhood but not for u2018 leading corporations , " when I did not say this .
Indeed , when I was careful not to say this .
4. anti Catholicism .
I am already on record in documenting your anti Catholicism here , on grounds of violating paragraph 22 of the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius , which are the spiritual foundation of Jesuit life .
I now add to this indictment the charge that your letter runs contrary to Matthew 18:15 - 17 .
This passage lays out a clear process for resolving disputes :
A. Meet privately and lay out your grievance in private .
If there is a meeting of the minds , the dispute is over and the grievance healed .
B . If that does not work , then ( I would add only then ) bring two or three neutral parties and lay out your case again before people whose judgment and fairness you both accept ; e.g. elders of the church .
If this works , the dispute is over and the grievance healed .
C. If that does not work , then ( I would again add only then ) bring your grievance to the whole congregation ( make the grievance public ) .
You acted in a manner contrary to this biblical doctrine by immediately moving to step C , completely by - passing A and B .
5. anti Semitism .
I am Jewish .
You trashed me in this very public letter in a very humiliating manner .
My claim is that you would have not done so were I not Jewish ( I have as much evidence in support of this accusation as you had in defense of your claim that I am a racist ; namely , none .
But , I think it is salutary for you to be victimized by this sort of unwarranted outburst from time to time ) .
However , I make this charge under correction .
If you can show that you have treated at least one non Jew in the vicious way you have dealt with me , I will withdraw this charge .
For my further criticism of this Times Picayune letter of yours , see here and here .
Let us now consider the " statement " of the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force , Loyola University New Orleans , which I reprint here , typographical errors included :
From : raphael@loyno.edu Subject : Affirmative Action Diversity Tast Force Statement Info :
In reference to the Times Picayune article , “ A Tough Sell in the Market Place of Ideas ” , by James Gill dated November 26 , 2008 .
As Loyola University ’s Diversity Committee , we are dedicated to promoting an appreciation for the valuable contributions of all , instilling in every one of our students a desire to pursue excellence and to be women and men in solidarity with others .
We also hold to the Jesuit ideal of rigorous intellectual examination in the pursuit of truth and therefore , defend the right of academic freedom .
However , it is our responsibility to respond critically to statements made by members of Loyola University that run counter to our commitment to inclusion and that marginalize women and African Americans , a majority of our community .
Professor Walter Block ’s reductionist statements about the productivity of African Americans and women in the marketplace ignore critical factors and structural patterns of inequality .
His flawed remarks are dangerous , fueling those with prejudices to confirm their biased views .
We must recognize the reality of racism and sexism in our society , whose impact has had long - lasting consequences in the lives of African Americans and women .
The Diversity Committee encourages all members of the University to use this event as a catalyst to engage in meaningful dialogue that addresses these issues in a way that moves us closer to our Jesuit ideals .

As before , I will deal with this document under the following five headings : bias , racism , sexism , anti Catholicism , anti Semitism .
1. bias .
This " statement " incorporates very serious charges .
Yet , instead of making these accusations on the basis of what I had done , you based it on what a journalist wrote about a speech I gave , and an interview he did with me .
If this does not bespeak " bias " I do not know what does .
The fact that you would send out an official document , to the entire Loyola community , undated , and with typographical errors , is insulting .
I take it that this emanates from a bias against me ( I have no evidence to support this ; I just wanted you too see how it felt to have unwarranted accusations made against you . )
It is also biased to ignore a series of nine questions previously put to you , in response to this " statement . "
2. racism .
You never quite come out and directly accuse me of racism .
Instead , you meander around this charge with verbiage such as " reductionist " ( I still do n’t know what this means ; I have asked you about it , but I have not been vouchsafed any answer ) " flawed remarks " ( I know full well what this means ) .
I regard it as racist to accuse another person of racism , particularly one with my paper trail of anti racist publications , on the basis of no evidence whatsoever .
3. sexism .
I maintain that it is sexist to take the position , if only by innuendo , that I do not favor " instilling in every one of our students a desire to pursue excellence and to be women and men in solidarity with others . "
This implies I short - change our female students .
Not so ; not even close .
Here is a bit of evidence on that score .
I am inordinately proud that in my seven years at Loyola , 21 of the essays that started out as term papers for my courses have ended up , with my help , as publications in refereed journals .
Not bad for undergraduate students .
I list them here .
Of these 21 , fully 15 have been authored by women ; only 7 have men students as authors ( there is an over count by one since one of the papers was co authored by a male and a female student ) .
But , let me engage in some full disclosure : there are also another 6 articles that have been accepted for publication ; 5 of these are authored by male students .
The bottom line here is , at least based on this partial record , that I do indeed try my best to " instill … in every one of our students a desire to pursue excellence and to be women and men in solidarity with others . "
4. anti Catholicism .
You say you hold to the Jesuit ideal of rigorous intellectual examination .
Your statement is simply not compatible with that high ideal .
And , what about the Jesuit ideal of paragraph 22 of the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius ?
What about Matthew 18:15 - 17 ?
Is this incompatible with Jesuit ideals ?
Further , there is much in Paul ’s letters to the various churches ( Ephesus , Corinth , Rome , etc. ) and pastors ( Timothy , Titus , Philemon , etc. ) on the importance of the Truth , standing firm in the Truth , and being wise enough to give clear cogent answers when questioned about your beliefs and why you hold them .
Paul was speaking of the salvation of Christ , but the principles ( seek the Truth , know the Truth , study and understand the Truth so well that you can articulate your beliefs to any who ask ) seem applicable to any endeavor where the goal is to persuade ( not coerce ) another person to your point of view .
( I owe these theological insights to a theologian who wishes to remain anonymous . )
5. anti Semitism .
I make the same charge , here , against the Task Force that I made with regard to the published letter of Mr. Ted Quant .
I am Jewish ; this letter attacks me .
Therefore , it is an attack on all Jews .
Ergo , here is a case of anti Semitism .
Why should I show evidence in support of this charge ?
No , I content myself with making this claim which , for all I know might be true , and charge you with the responsibility of proving that it is false .
Hint : one way to demonstrate this is to show a case where the Task Force dealt so unfairly with a non Jew .
Just give me one such example , and I will withdraw this part of the indictment .
Here is a bit of friendly advice , in closing .
Next time , pick your target for unwarranted ill - treatment more carefully .
Do not choose a professor who is on sabbatical .
He has more time than usual to respond to your unjust allegations .
Better to abuse a faculty member with a full teaching load .
Even more efficacious , avoid those of us with tenure ; we are even more free to speak our minds .
Yes , focus on an untenured assistant professor with a full teaching load , who really wants to keep his job .
Go for the low lying fruit first , no ?
Let Rev. Martin Niemoller be your guide .
He said " In Germany they first came for the Communists , and I did n’t speak up because I was n’t a Communist .
Then they came for the Jews , and I did n’t speak up because I was n’t a Jew .
Then they came for the trade unionists , and I did n’t speak up because I was n’t a trade unionist .
Then they came for the Catholics , and I did n’t speak up because I was a Protestant .
Then they came for me and by that time no one was left to speak up . "
So , first come for assistant professors .
Then , associates .
Then , full professors .
Leave alone , until last , those of us with named endowed chairs , who have recently won the Dux Academicus , and have been singled out , at both the college and university level , for research and publishing awards .
Academics of this sort may well have encouraged female student publications and for many years published material on their own that undermines your charges .
That just makes you look inept .
Why put yourselves through the rigors of reading all that they have published ?
( Of course , if you find a " smoking gun , " all bets are off ; but , remember , such research takes time ) .
Better to try to bully faculty members with a shorter paper trail .

The students are instructed to bring all of their precious school supplies – their property – to the front of the classroom and put them into a huge box .
They are told that the supplies belong to all of the class now , and the teacher will assume the responsibility of distributing the supplies as they are needed .
" Whoaa !
Hold on a minute here !
These are my supplies .
My daddy bought them for me .
You can't have them !
They 're mine ! "
Nope .
Sorry !

Now all those supplies belong to – guess who ?

Behold the leading lights of the modern " intellectual " conservative movement .
TRIALS of mandatory internet censorship will begin within days despite a secret high - level report to the Federal Government that found the technology does not work , will significantly slow internet speeds and will block access to legitimate sites .
Commissioned by the Howard government and prepared by the Internet Industry Association , the report said schemes for blocking " inappropriate " content such as child pornography were fundamentally flawed .
If the trials are deemed a success , the Government has earmarked $ 44 million to impose a compulsory " clean feed " on all internet subscribers in Australia by late next year .
But the report says the filters would slow the internet ( as much as 87 per cent by some measures ) , be easily bypassed , and would not come close to capturing all of the nasty content available online .
They would also struggle to distinguish between wanted and unwanted content , leading to legitimate sites being blocked .
Entire user - generated content sites , such as YouTube and Wikipedia , could be censored over a single suspect posting .
It raises serious freedom - of - speech questions , such as who will be held accountable for blocked sites and whether the Government will be pressured to expand the blacklist to cover lawful content , including pornography , gambling sites and euthanasia material .

Inhofe says Treasury Secretary made dire warnings in conference call on September 19th
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , November 20 , 2008
Senator James Inhofe has revealed that Henry Paulson was behind the threats of martial law and a new great depression prior to the passage of the bailout bill , having made such warnings during a conference call on September 19th , around two weeks before the legislation was eventually approved by both the Senate and Congress .
As we reported at the time , on October 2 , Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman gave a stunning speech on the House floor during which he decried the fact that , “ Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday that the sky would fall , the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day , another couple of thousand the second day , and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no . ”
A few days before , Rep. Michael Burgess also told the House , “ Mr. Speaker I understand we are under Martial Law as declared by the speaker last night , ” referring to a temporary suspension of the rules and procedures of Congress by its leaders so that a bill can be passed quickly .
But the origin of the most dire warnings about physical martial law in America , to which Sherman was likely referring , has now been exposed .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Speaking on Tulsa Oklahoma ’s 1170 KFAQ , when asked who was behind threats of martial law and civil unrest if the bailout bill failed , Senator James Inhofe named Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as the source .
“ Somebody in D.C. was feeding you guys quite a story prior to the bailout , a story that if we did n’t do this we were going to see something on the scale of the depression , there were people talking about martial law being instituted , civil unrest …. who was feeding you guys this stuff ? , ” asked host Pat Campbell .
“ That ’s Henry Paulson , ” responded Inhofe , “ We had a conference call early on , it was on a Friday I think – a week and half before the vote on Oct .
1 . So it would have been the middle … what was it – the 19th of September , we had a conference call .
In this conference call – and I guess there ’s no reason for me not to repeat what he said , but he said – he painted this picture you just described .
He said , ‘ This is serious .
This is the most serious thing that we faced . ’ ”
Inhofe said that Paulson told members of Congress the crisis would be “ far worse than the great depression ” if Congress did n’t authorize the bill to buy out toxic debt , a proposal “ which he abandoned the day after he got the money , ” added Inhofe .
Inhofe is referring to the controversy last week when it emerged that the bailout money was not going to buy up toxic debt but instead Paulson , the former CEO of Goldman Sachs , had pulled a bait and switch and ordered the money be injected directly into banks .
Senator Inhofe has slammed the secrecy surrounding the destination of the bailout money , saying that Hank Paulson could have given it to his friends and that the “ blank check ” must be cancelled now .
Inhofe is now trying to rally support for a freeze on what ’s left of the initial $ 350 billion of bailout money with his “ roll back the bailout ” proposal , which will also require an affirmative vote on the part of Congress to approve Treasury ’s plan for the remaining $ 350 billion .
Watch the clip from Inhofe ’s interview below .

What Do They Have to Do to Lose Your Vote ?
* Click Here for a Counterargument by Norman Solomon
Watching the Democrats in the final weeks of the presidential election has been a lesson in revisionist history .
While they lament the terrible crimes perpetrated against the American people by George Bush and vow to keep fighting for our rights , they conveniently gloss over the fact that they have no standing to make such claims .
Indeed , the Democrats , including Senator Barack Obama , have actually voted with President Bush ’s agenda , making them complicit in his acts , not valiant opponents defending our liberties .
PELOSI ’S PROMISE TO END THE WAR
Democratic Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said that if she became the speaker of the House of Representatives she would end the war in Iraq .
Remember that ?
The Boston Globe noted , “ Pelosi vows no ‘ blank check ’ on Iraq funds . ” ( 1/8/07 ) .
In her own words : “ If the president wants to add to this mission , he is going to have to justify it .
And this is new to him , because up until now the Republican Congress has given him a blank check with no oversight , no standards , no conditions . ”
Rick Klein of the Globe noted “ Pelosi ’s comments mark the first suggestion by a Democratic congressional leader that Congress could use its authority over the nation ’s finances to hasten an end to the war .
Her remarks point toward an aggressive stance on Iraq from Congressional Democrats in their opening days of control of the House and Senate . ”
Yet after she became the speaker of the House in Jan 2007 , war appropriations actually went up by $ 50 billion , with no strings attached and no date for the withdrawal of troops .
This year , 2008 , they ’ve gone up by another $ 25 billion for a two - year total of $ 350 billion , with no end in sight .
So what happened to the promise of “ no blank check ? ”
REID ’S FILIBUSTER RULE
Sen .
Harry Reid , the leader of the Democrats in the Senate , has complained that the Republicans have filibustered ( a procedure used by the minority party to delay voting on legislation ) more times in the last two years than in the entire history of the United States to explain why he can’t move forward a progressive agenda .
First he said it was over 70 times , then adjusted it by saying it was 65 times ( Las Vegas Sun , 3/6/08 ) ; yet still the highest for any two - year period ( the previous record was 57 filibusters ) ( Politico , 3/6/08 ; Gov.Track.us , 4/15/08 ) .
But Sen .
Reid ’s frustration has proven to be a red-herring .
Did you know that Reid lets the Republicans filibuster telephonically , meaning that he does n’t require that they physically present themselves on the floor of the Senate ?
Why is he making it easy on them ?
Is this what an opposition party looks like ?
REPUBLICAN CLASS ACTION REFORM
Sen . Barack Obama , the Democratic Party nominee for president , has a long history of voting against the interest of the American people , and specifically , the working class .
Before entering the presidential contest , he supported the Republican Class Action Reform Bill , which made it harder for class - action lawsuits to be brought in the state courts .
State courts are exactly where consumer protection lawsuits and recent wage and hour claims have succeeded in improving the lives of workers and helped them obtain better wages and breaks during work hours have succeeded .
Progressive commentators at the time called it a thinly veiled special - interest extravaganza .
Journalist David Sirota noted : “ Opposed by most major civil rights and consumer watchdog groups , this Big Business - backed legislation was sold to the public as a way to stop ‘ frivolous ’ lawsuits .
But everyone in Washington knew the bill ’s real objective was to protect corporate abusers . ” ( The Nation , 6/26/06 ) .
So why did Obama vote for it ?
PATRIOT ACT & FISA AMENDMENT
Sen .
Obama supported one of the worst attacks on civil liberties in recent history , the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act , which extended an earlier law granting law enforcement expanded powers to search telephone , e-mail , and financial and medical records , in addition to granting the federal government a host of other powers to combat so - called domestic terrorism .
After saying he would oppose it if elected to the U.S. Senate ( NOW questionnaire , 9/10/03 ) , in July 2005 , Obama voted for it .
But this was n’t enough .
After entering the presidential race and running on a “ change ” message , Obama vowed in February of 2008 to vote against — and filibuster if necessary — the FISA bill amendment ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) that gave immunities to telecommunications corporations that cooperated with the Bush administration ’s warrantless surveillance program .
This eavesdropping program clearly violated the privacy of law - abiding Americans at the behest of the president , and made the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover seem tame by comparison .
Those voting in favor of the bill did n’t even first require full disclosure to see how deep the illegal conduct extended and agreed to apply the law retroactively .
Despite his promises to the contrary , and despite the vehement protests of many of his supporters , when the FISA bill came to the Senate for a vote this past July , Sen .
Obama voted for it without explaining how this vote fit in with his change message or reconciled with his repeated claims he was going to protect the American people from repeated assaults on civil liberties by President Bush .
Here was his chance to lead and make good on his promise , and what did he do ?
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) called the FISA bill “ an unconstitutional domestic spying bill that violates the Fourth Amendment and eliminates any meaningful role for judicial oversight of government surveillance ” ( ACLU press release , 7/9/08 ) .
Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office called the bill “ a Constitutional nightmare ” and noted “ with one vote , Congress has strengthened the executive branch , weakened the judiciary and rendered itself irrelevant . ”
Obama even voted to stop debate on the bill so he could get back to the campaign trail .
How ironic is it that he was in a hurry to give more speeches about change and hope but could n’t find the time or integrity to convert these ideas into action ?
On the eve of the vote MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow noted “ I ’m betting that [ Pres. Bush ’s ] wildest dreams did not include the prospect that Congress — a Democratic - led Congress — would help him cover up his crimes .
Yet that is exactly what the US Senate is poised to do . ” ( Countdown with Keith Olbermann , 7/8/08 )
OFF -SHORE DRILLING
As Sen . John McCain started to call for domestic drilling to ease our dependence on foreign oil , rather than debate the scientific and economic illogic of the position , Sen. Obama announced that he agreed with McCain .
Reversing a 25 - year ban on off - shore oil drilling , Sen .
Obama led his party ’s reversal , offering no explanation for how this would ease oil prices , particularly as experts noted that drilling would likely have an almost imperceptible impact on oil prices in the near future .
As Lester Brown and Jonathan Dorn of the Earth Policy Institute noted in “ Drilling For Oil Is Not The Answer ” ( 9/30/08 ) : “ The U.S. Department of Energy projects that lifting the Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) moratorium [ of the lower 48 states ] would not increase production before 2017 and that by 2030 production would only amount to 0.2 million barrels per day — less than 1 percent of current consumption . ”
Furthermore , “ The U.S. Department of Energy projects that opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) would lower gasoline prices at the pump by a mere 2 cents per gallon . ”
Even if we combined the two regions in question , it would n’t amount to much of an impact on oil prices : “ Lifting the moratoria on drilling in ANWR and the OCS would reduce the price of a gallon of gasoline by at most 6 cents — and this would not be seen for at least another decade . ”
Proponents of drilling have also exaggerated the environmental safety of current off - shore drilling and oil production technology in general .
There is widespread evidence that current drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is already leading to serious pollution and spills .
After reviewing data from the National Response Center , the Houston Chronicle found there had been 595 oil spills across four state coastlines , totaling roughly 9 million gallons spilled in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ( “ Spills from hurricanes staining the coast ” by Dina Cappiello , 11/13/05 ) .
So why is Sen.
Obama , who claims to care about the environment , now advocating off - shore drilling ?
DEATH PENALTY
In June of 2008 , the conservative Supreme Court struck down the use of the death penalty in cases of child rape ( Kennedy v. Louisiana held that states may not impose the death penalty for the commission of a crime that did not result in the death of the victim ) , a decision that surprised even death penalty opponents who hailed it as an important step toward full abolition of the death penalty .
Sen .
Obama ’s response ?
He quickly called a press conference to denounce the decision .
Obama stated that he agreed with the extreme conservative minority , comprised of Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito , Scalia and Thomas .
Despite the many known racial and class inequities inherent in the death penalty , a practice abolished and abhorred in most of the rest of the world , Obama celebrates that he has always been a supporter of it .
On the campaign trail , Sen . Obama likes to highlight death penalty legislation that he sponsored while a member of the Illinois legislature , to show his commitment to reform .
But let ’s be clear , he did n’t work on laws to address the disproportionate rate of death penalty convictions of African - Americans , but rather a law to require videotaped interrogations of death penalty suspects .
Yes , something we can applaud , but something many critics have noted merely greases the wheels of this injustice .
Most disquieting of all , as a state legislator , Obama voted “ to expand the list of death - eligible crimes ” ( Chicago Tribune , 5/2/07 ) , despite admitting in his own allegedly soul - searching memoir that the death penalty “ does little to deter crime . ” ( The Audacity of Hope , 2006 ) .
AFGHANISTAN
On foreign policy , Sen . Obama ’s approach is hawkish .
He wants to deploy more soldiers to Afghanistan , which will only further destabilize the Afghan - Pakistani border .
He simply ignores the historic reality that no invading army has ever managed to successfully win a war in this area or subjugate the Afghani people .
During its ill - fated 10 - year war , between 1979 and 1989 , the Soviet Union deployed 620,000 soldiers to Afghanistan and sustained 470,000 casualties ( sick and wounded , including infectious diseases such as hepatitis and typhoid fever ) .
Why does Obama want to ignore these facts and risk further destabilizing the area and creating another Vietnam / Iraq occupation there ?
IRAQ
With respect to Iraq , Sen. Obama has conceded the main argument of Sen.
McCain ’s campaign and said the so - called “ surge ” worked ( despite significant evidence and analysis to the contrary ) .
And he has vowed to keep soldiers in Iraq to fight counterterrorism .
John Podesta , former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who now leads the Center for American Progress , estimated this would take a 60,000 troop presence to achieve .
Moreover Obama “ will not ‘ rule out ’ using private security companies like Blackwater Worldwide in Iraq ” according to Democracy Now !
correspondent Jeremy Scahill .
And Obama did not plan on signing on to legislation that seeks to ban the use of such forces by the U.S. government by January 2009 , according to one of his senior foreign policy advisors .
( Democracy Now ! , 2/28/08 ) .
( This is one promise Obama unfortunately has kept , refusing to sign onto the Stop Outsourcing Security Act , introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont )
In an interview with Amy Goodman , Sen . Obama stated his intention of leaving 140,000 private contractors in Iraq because , “ we do n’t have the troops to replace them . ”
He also stated the need to keep an additional “ strike force in the region . . . in order to not only protect them , but also potentially to protect their territorial integrity . ”
Summarizing the interview , Amy Goodman concluded that it sounded as if Obama “ would leave more than 100,000 troops , close to 200,000 in Iraq .
‘ Troops ’ meaning U.S. soldiers and military contractors which some call mercenaries . ” ( 4/1/08 )
Even concerning a possible timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq , Obama has diminished his promises .
He now is committing only to “ reducing the number of combat troops within 16 months , ” presumably to “ bolster efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda . ” ( Obama / McCain debate , 9/26/08 )
What we know for certain , though , is when given a chance to commit to a complete withdrawal of troops from Iraq , Obama said “ no ” .
When Tim Russert asked him , during a debate in New Hampshire in September 2007 , if he could promise having American troops out of Iraq by 2013 , Obama would not do so .
MILITARY SPENDING
According to military policy analysts at the Arms Control Center , in their report “ U.S. Defense Spending , since 2001 ” military spending has risen from $ 333 billion in 2001 to $ 696 in 2008 ( including $ 189 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ) .
It ’s expected to rise even more in 2009 , to $ 706 billion .
Despite this , Sen. Obama has joined Sen. McCain and called for increased military spending .
“ I ’ve said that we have to increase the size of our military , ” Obama told ABC’s This Week ( 9/7/08 ) .
The details of which he has previously noted in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs : “ I strongly support the expansion of our ground forces by adding 65,000 soldiers to the Army and 27,000 Marines . ”
( “ Obama surrenders on military spending ” by Glen Ford , The Progressive , 1/15/08 ) .
WALL STREET CRISIS
The current financial crisis has generated perhaps the most fascinating political rhetoric of all .
Obama has blamed the Republicans for deregulation and in doing so his poll numbers have given him a healthy lead as we approach the final days of the campaign .
The only problem is that the economic crisis is not just the fault of the Republicans .
It is the direct result of bipartisan bills enacted into law by a Democratic president , Bill Clinton .
In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act .
This repealed the last vestiges of an important Depression - era law , the Glass - Steagall Act ( 1933 ) , which prohibited banking , brokerage , and insurance companies from merging together , thus compartmentalized the financial industry and protected it from future collapses .
Equally significant in 2000 , President Clinton signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act , which repealed 20 - year - old agreements between the Security and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , so that financial institutions could sell credit derivatives such as the now notorious “ credit default swaps ” without any oversight and with no regulation .
Two of its co-sponsors included Democratic Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Tim Johnson of South Dakota .
The measure had such bipartisan support that it was never even debated in the Senate and was passed by unanimous consent .
This resulted in the repackaging of mortgages into securities and the failure to regulate institutions that then over - leveraged themselves as they sold credit derivatives to investors who wanted protection from risky investments .
This is what led to this financial crisis whose ramifications we have only begun to understand .
Both Obama and McCain voted for the $ 700 billion taxpayer - funded bailout despite the plea of 200 economists ( including Nobel Prize winners ) urging them not to do so ( Open Letter to Congress regarding Treasury bailout plan , 9/24/08 ) .
Obama keeps emphasizing that the mess was the fault of Republicans alone .
But how is this argument credible when the law responsible for the financial meltdown enjoyed unanimous support from both parties ?
NAFTA
It was quite emblematic of Sen. Obama that he has changed his position on the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) to suit whatever situation he is in .
First , while running for the Senate in 2004 , he said he supported NAFTA and thought there should be more trade agreements like it .
( AP story 2/26/08 ) .
Then , while running against Hillary Clinton he blamed her for NAFTA ’s impact on workers in the “ Rust Belt ” states of Wisconsin and Ohio .
But once he won the primary things changed .
When asked if he would truly invoke the six - month clause in NAFTA for unilateral withdrawal , Obama showed his signature political reversal .
NAFTA created a trilateral trade bloc encompassing the United States , Canada , and Mexico , which was meant to foster greater trade between its members .
It primarily lifted tariffs on goods shipped between the three countries but has caused economic turmoil both among American and Mexican labor , with unexpected loss of jobs and negative environmental impacts .
Nina Easton , a Washington editor for Fortune , noted in a June 18 , 2008 article that “ the presumptive Democratic nominee backed off his harshest attacks on the free trade agreement and indicated he did n’t want to unilaterally reopen negotiations on NAFTA , ” something he had promised to do when locked in a close primary race with Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Asked directly about whether he would move the U.S. out of the trade agreement , Obama said “ Sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified . ”
Fortune magazine concluded that , despite once calling NAFTA “ devastating ” and “ a big mistake , ” Obama “ was toning down his populist rhetoric ” and had no intention of following through with his anti-NAFTA promises now that the primary battle was won .
In light of this evidence , can we believe any of the other commitments he ’s made ?
THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY
Those who think Sen. Obama will appoint good Supreme Court justices should just take note of his long history of supporting some of the worst Bush appointees to the federal bench , including Thomas Griffith ( D.C. Cir. ) , Susan Blake Neilson ( 6th Cir. ) , Milan Smith ( 9th Cir. ) , Sandra Segal Ikuta ( 9th Cir. ) , and Kent Jordan ( 3rd Cir . ) .
The Neilson vote was particularly troubling as both senators from her own state “ blue slipped ” her for being “ too extreme . ”
And even when he does manage to muster the courage to vote against conservative appointees , he does it in a lukewarm and perfunctory manner , refusing to join Democratic Party filibuster efforts .
This is deeply troubling .
He voted cloture ( to end any voting delay ) on Priscilla Owen ( 5th Cir. ) and Brett Kavanaugh ( D.C. Cir. ) both extremely conservative jurists , thus ensuring they would be confirmed .
SEN .
JOE BIDEN AS VICE - PRESIDENT
Obama ’s selection of Sen . Joe Biden as a running mate is particularly troubling and does not bode well for the decisions Obama is likely to make if elected president .
Obama has presented Biden as someone who never forgot his roots as a working class , regular guy .
The only problem with this characterization is Sen.
Biden ’s voting record .
He was one of the main supporters of the Republican Bankruptcy Reform Bill that Pres .
Clinton vetoed twice , only to have it signed into law by Pres.
Bush in 2005 with Sen. Biden ’s ardent support .
Criticizing the Bankruptcy Reform Bill , Arianna Huffington noted that the bill , “ makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection [ average annual income of Americans who file for bankruptcy is less than $ 30 K ] ; it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant ; it endangers child - support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post - bankruptcy income ; it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts ; it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the Enrons of the world ; it allows creditors to provide misleading information ; and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses . ”
( Salon.com , 3/05 )
Jackson Williams noted , in “ Joe Biden : No True Friend of Working Men and Women ” ( Huffington Post , 10/27/08 ) , that Biden , “ did n’t just vote for it , he helped carry the water on it .
Some Democrats tried to soften the bill with a series of amendments ; for example , exempting military personnel at war in Iraq .
Biden joined the majority of his colleagues — the Republicans and too many Democrats — in knocking down every possible change that was offered . ”
Sen .
Biden has built a reputation as someone who works tirelessly for credit card companies , with some critics even referring to him as the senator from MasterCard — rather than the senator from Delaware .
In addition , Biden voted for the War in Iraq and the PATRIOT Act , so it ’s hard to understand how Sen .
Biden is going to help bring about change in the new administration .
OTHER FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES
Obama called Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez an enemy of the United States and urged sanctions against him .
( Interview with Jorge Ramos , El Mercurio , 6/11/08 )
He heaped praise on the first George Bush saying , “ You know , one of the things that I think George H.W.
Bush does n’t get enough credit for is his foreign policy team and the way that he helped negotiate the end of the Cold War and prosecuted the Gulf War .
That cost us $ 20 billion dollars .
That ’s all it cost .
It was extremely successful .
I think there were a lot of very wise people . ” ( Larry King Live , 3/23/08 ) .
And in a much - anticipated speech to America ’s pro-Israeli government lobby , AIPAC ( The American Israel Public Affairs Committee ) , Obama towed the typical pro-Israel line .
He urged that Jerusalem would belong to Israel , despite peace efforts currently underway which would allow the holy city to be shared among both Israelis and Palestinians .
He unequivocally stated “ Israel ’s security is sacrosanct . ”
And “ Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel , and it must remain undivided . ” ( AIPAC speech , 6/08/08 ) .
MAKING A DEMAND
Before you vote for someone with such a checkered voting record , it might be worthwhile to make some demands on him , do n’t you think ?
Or at the very least we should ask him to explain why he ’s capitulated so many times .
I ’m sure Sen. Obama would find such questions uncomfortable .
In fact , even progressives find such inquiry bothersome : they are aware of Obama ’s lamentable history of capitulation on votes that take away our civil rights , but nevertheless cling to their wish that Obama will be something other than what he has already proven himself to be .
But it ’s not likely that he will be a transformative leader .
He ’s already announced economic advisors whose ideas are at the heart of the economic meltdown , like Austan Goolsbee , an aggressive free trader and subprime loan advocate , and former Clinton advisors , David Cutler and Jeffrey Liebman , supporters of market - oriented solutions to social welfare issues such as the partial privatization of Social Security .
( “ Subprime Obama ” by Max Fraser , The Nation , 1/24/08 ) .
He has foreign policy advisors who helped take us into war , like Colin Powell , who in 2003 addressed the United Nations on behalf of the Bush Administration , outlining the reasons the U.S. had to invade Iraq ( who also disturbingly , as a young Army Major , worked to suppress key evidence about the My Lai Massacre in Vietnam ) .
But that ’s not all .
Democracy Now !’s Amy Goodman spoke with journalists Allan Nairn and Kelley Beaucar Vlahos who discussed Obama ’s foreign policy advisors ( 2/10/08 ) .
They noted that Obama proudly brought on to his team old cold warrior and former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski , who has boasted of having created the whole Afghan Jihadi movement ; Anthony Lake , who was behind the U.S. invasion of Haiti during the Clinton years ; General Merrill McPeak , who delivered U.S. fighter planes to Indonesia shortly after the Dili massacre in East Timor in 1991 ; and Dennis Ross who has pushed to subordinate the rights of Palestinians to the needs of the Israeli government .
What do you think the likelihood is that Obama will listen to us , once we ’ve voted for him , without making any demands on him ?
As Robert Scheer , a noted columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle , noted on July 23 , 2008 , shortly after Obama voted for the FISA bill , “ Barack Obama is betraying his promise of change and is in danger of becoming just another political hack . ”
And Scheer made these remarks before Obama decided to support off - shore drilling , denounce a Supreme Court death penalty decision , and before he voted for the Wall Street bailout .
CONCERNING RALPH NADER
But we do n’t have to vote for either Senators Obama or McCain , do we ?
Ralph Nader has a more impressive legislative record as an outsider than do Sen. Obama and Sen. McCain combined .
And he has a proven record of fighting the culture of Washington .
Just think of the Freedom of Information Act , Clean Air , Clean Water , automotive safety , and the Environmental Protection Agency .
Yet despite these accomplishments , Obama and McCain do not believe they should even have to debate him .
What they do n’t tell you is that the so - called independent Commission on Presidential Debates is actually a private corporation run by former leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties .
The Commission , which was formed in 1987 , is currently led by Frank Fahrenkopf , a former head of the Republican National Committee , and Paul Kirk , the former head of the Democratic National Committee .
No wonder they wo n’t debate Nader or anyone else .
Of course they justify this by saying Nader is n’t polling well enough to include him in the debates .
Yet , interestingly , both McCain and Obama were losing their respective primary races until they were let into televised debates .
And there are well - known examples of how letting a candidate debate “ mainstream ” candidates can lead to a different outcome .
Jesse Ventura won the governor ’s race in Minnesota in 1998 when he was allowed to debate the Republican and Democratic Party candidates , going from 9 or 10 percent in the polls to ultimately winning the contest .
Ralph Nader polled at five percent and above at least four different times this year in national polls , and he even reached 10 percent in one poll in the state of Michigan ( conducted by Lansing - based EPIC - MRA , 4/15/08 ) .
This should have been sufficient to gain access to the presidential debates .
Ross Perot got in the debates in 1992 even though he was polling below 10 percent .
Perot went on to win 19 percent of the vote , and his warnings about NAFTA and deficit spending influenced Clinton policy and proved prescient .
Afterwards , the two parties retaliated by creating a 15 % threshold which ironically no candidate is likely to reach without being included in televised debates .
The worse part of the so - called presidential debates as they are currently produced is that two - party control ensures that the questions are not sufficiently hard - hitting .
Is n’t it appalling that we saw three debates between Obama and McCain at a time our country is suffering its worst economic crisis , and no one asked these men :
“ Why should Americans have any confidence either of you is the best choice to tackle these problems given that both of your political parties helped pass laws that made this crisis possible — or even inevitable ? ”
They also like to say that voting for Nader is throwing your vote away .
The Democrats often cite the 2000 election to blame Nader for Bush ’s victory .
But they noticeably never mention the 1992 election , when Bill Clinton won because Ross Perot “ spoiled ” the race for George Bush ’s father , an incumbent president .
By the way , Clinton got only 43 percent of the vote in 1992 compared to 48 percent by Bush in 2000 .
And they offer no explanation for why they have n’t worked on election reform since 2000 .
Imagine claiming your political party lost the presidency because the “ winner ” was declared even though he had n’t won a majority of the votes cast ?
Then imagine doing nothing to make sure it would n’t happen again .
Is n’t it odd that the Democrats have n’t worked on election reform in the past eight years ?
They never will change the system because the way things are now , they can be assured that they will be in office roughly half the time .
They also count on people to accept their arguments that Nader and other third parties are n’t polling high enough to get your vote ; that the real contest is between just two candidates .
If all else fails , they argue that it ’s the most important election of your lifetime .
I ’m 43 - years - old and I ’ve heard this argument each time the presidential race has come up .
If you accept these arguments , you are in effect rewarding the two parties for not fixing how we do elections in this country .
You reward them for creating the Commission on Debates .
You guarantee that things will not change .
And you ensure that candidates that support single - payer health care , decent wages and pensions for workers , controls on corporations and a foreign policy based on achieving peace rather than driven by self - interest cannot ever be heard .
Nader wants a more humane and democratic society .
He ’s seen that you ca n’t get anything done in Washington because senators like Obama and McCain ignore what ’s good for Americans in pursuit of their own interests .
Sure McCain talks like a maverick and Obama talks like a revolutionary but look closely and you will see repeated capitulations to the very entities our government needs to get away from if we are to build a more democratic society .
WOMAN’S SUFFRAGE & EUGENE DEBS
Eugene Debs ran for president several times in the early 20th century .
He advocated the right of women to vote at a time when it was not popular to do so and while other more successful politicians openly argued against giving women the right to participate directly in elections .
The general attitude among men was exemplified by Elihu Root , a former cabinet secretary to presidents McKinley and Roosevelt and winner of the 1912 Nobel Peace prize who said : “ Suffrage would be a loss for women .
I think so because suffrage implies not merely the casting of the ballot . . . but suffrage , if it means anything , means entering upon the field of political life , and politics is modified war .
In politics there is a struggle , strife , contention , bitterness , heart - burning , excitement , agitation , everything which is adverse to the true character of woman .
Woman in strife becomes hard , harsh , unlovable , repulsive … ” ( NY Constitutional Convention , 1894 )
President Theodore Roosevelt himself said , “ Personally I believe in woman ’s suffrage , but I am not an enthusiastic advocate of it , because I do not regard it as a very important matter . ” ( Letter to Dr. Lyman Abbott , 11/10/1908 ) .
And President Grover Cleveland said , “ Sensible and responsible women do not want to vote . ” ( 1905 )
Despite these sentiments Debs advocated this right .
Yet he never obtained more than six percent of the vote .
Let me ask you :
Were the men who voted with Debs throwing their vote away ?
If you had lived in that era , would you have voted for him ?
Or would you have come up with an excuse for why it was n’t important enough ?
CONCLUSION
On the street when I am approached by an Obama / Biden volunteer or someone who tells me they ’re voting for Obama , I usually ask “ What about the FISA vote ? ”
And each time I hear in return “ What ’s that ? ”
Or if I say , “ You know he supports the death penalty , ” I usually hear in response , “ No he does n’t . ”
At what point will there be intellectual honesty about what is happening ?
People are voting for Obama because they find him to be an engaging public speaker and like his message regardless of his history of being part of the very problem he professes to want to fix .
Most people do n’t want the actual facts to interfere with the desperate hope that he is everything they want him to be .
Do you really want to vote for someone who has already voted to take away your civil liberties because of some vague wish that he ’ll act differently as president ?
Obama himself , speaking of Sen. Hillary Clinton , made a remark that could just as easily apply to him , and , unwittingly makes the case for why no one should vote for him :
“ We ca n’t afford a president whose positions change with the politics of the moment .
We need a president who knows that being ready on day one means getting it right from day one . ” ( Salem , OR , 3/21/08 ) .
If voting for war appropriations and taking away civil liberties was bringing us closer to a more democratic and egalitarian society , well , I would advocate it .
But it is n’t doing that .
What is your breaking point ?
At what point do you decide that you ’ve had enough ?
What do they have to do to lose your vote ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A new national poll suggests that almost a quarter of Americans think that Dick Cheney is the worst vice president in American history .
Vice President Dick
Cheney says he 's comfortable with his accomplishments and is n't troubled by his ratings .
Twenty - three percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday say that Cheney is the country 's worst vice president , when compared with his predecessors .
An additional 41 percent feel that Cheney is a poor vice president , with 34 percent rating him a good number two .
Only one percent of those polled say that Cheney is the best vice president in U.S. history .
" On the Sunday talk shows , Cheney took on the job of making the affirmative case for the Bush legacy , " said Keating Holland , CNN polling director .
" But the messenger may be getting in the way of the message . "
Cheney steps down as vice president January 20 .
He will be succeeded by Vice President - elect Joe Biden .
Although extremely unpopular , Cheney will leave office as one of the most powerful vice presidents in history .
He played a crucial role in many of the Bush administration 's crucial policies and was a major proponent of using and expanding executive powers .
" Cheney still has a lot of fans in the Republican Party .
Most Republicans nationwide said Cheney had been a good veep , " Holland said .
" But six in 10 independents and eight in 10 Democrats gave Cheney a rating of ' poor ' or ' worst ever . ' "
In an interview Sunday , Cheney said he was not troubled by polls suggesting he was unpopular .
" I 'm very comfortable with where we are and what we achieved substantively .
And frankly , I would not want to be one of those guys who spends all his time reading the polls .
I think people like that should n't serve in these jobs , " Cheney said on " Fox News Sunday . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted Friday through Sunday , with 1,013 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
CNN 's Ed Hornick contributed to this report .

An Australian vet got the shock of his life when a cat gave birth to this two - headed kitten .
The tiny kitten , which was born at the Swan Veterinary Clinic in Perth , Western Australia , eats out of just one mouth , but both mouths meow simultaneously .
The kitten 's mother was taken to the clinic after suffering complications while in labour .
The kitten was one of three born in the litter , but its siblings were not born with any deformities .
Veterinary nurse Louisa Burgess told the Australian website InMyCommunity.co.au : “ I have seen cats with two tails and extra legs , but not this .
“ It has a full tummy and it survived the night so that is a good sign .
It seems content , it meows and purrs .
“ This is the result of a congenital deformity .
Something has gone wrong in the early embryonic development . ”
Approximately one in a million cats are born with two heads and the condition is thought to be more common among snakes and turtles .
In August a kitten with two noses , four eyes and one mouth was born in Ohio , but died after five days .

Deepening finance crisis causes global market panic Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday October 6 , 2008
Print This Email This by Rob Lever
WASHINGTON ( AFP ) - Desperate measures by governments in Europe and North America to steady the banking system failed to stem panic in global markets Monday amid deepening gloom at the scope of the financial crisis .
Nothing seemed to stop stock markets taking , in many cases , record falls .
Nigel Gault at Global Insight said the markets were seeing a realization of " the worst fear , " namely " that the financial crisis and the slowdown in economic growth would reinforce each other , dragging the economy into recession , perhaps a severe one . "
In Washington , Treasury officials said they would act quickly to implement a massive bailout plan for the financial sector , seeking bids by Wednesday for managers of toxic real estate assets at the root of the crisis .
The Federal Reserve and Treasury said they were studying the possibility of making unsecured loans in an effort to keep credit flowing in the financial system .
Wall Street came back from the edge of the abyss in a highly volatile session and European shares were hit hard in a round - the - world rout .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 800 points during the session , slipping below the key psychological level of 10,000 for the first time since 2004 .
The blue - chip index closed down 369 points ( 3.58 percent ) at 9,955.50 .
The Nasdaq skidded 4.34 percent and the Standard & Poor 's 500 index lost 3.85 percent , halving early losses .
The partial comeback on Wall Street was the only modest glimmer of hope in an otherwise horrific day for global markets .
" When will the slide end ?
It 's anybody 's guess , " said David Kastner at Charles Schwab & Co .
" But the aggressive actions being taken by the Fed , and increasingly by the central bankers in Europe and Asia , point to an eventual stabilization in confidence -- where the real crisis lies .
In the meantime , we expect sharp bouts of bargain hunting and more panic sell - offs . "
In Iceland , Prime Minister Geir Haarde said the government was ready to take control of the country 's banks , citing " a gargantuan crisis , which is part of a broader worldwide crisis " but were divided on a US - style bailout .
After a weekend summit of the European Union 's big four leaders in Paris , member states ' leaders issued a joint statement on Monday vowing to defend banks but remained divided on a US - style bailout fund .
" This is precisely why investors have become nervous over the capabilities of European officials to deal with the credit crunch in a coordinated , EU wide manner , " said Andrew Busch at BMO Capital Markets .
" Each action appears to be country - centric with no over - arching solution like in the United States . "
Russia 's RTS stock market closed down 19.10 percent in its worst fall in history .
Indonesian shares fell more than 10 percent and trading in Brazil 's stock market was suspended after massive declines of 15 percent , before the index pared its loss to 5.43 percent .
The London FTSE 100 index of leading shares fell 7.86 while in Paris the CAC 40 index shed 9.04 percent , its heaviest one - day loss since its creation in 1988 .
The Frankfurt DAX lost 7.07 percent .
In Dublin the Irish stock exchange 's main ISEQ index ended with a loss of 9.59 percent , with banks taking the hardest hit .
European governments appeared divided on whether guaranteeing all deposits was the best way to safeguard confidence , and the EU commission called on member states for better coordination .
Denmark , Portugal and Iceland guaranteed deposits , emulating Germany on Sunday and Ireland and Greece last week , adding pressure on other European governments to follow suit .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called a meeting of his " economic war cabinet . "
Finance minister Alistair Darling said the government would consider extending insurance guarantees .
Amid the turbulence , the euro fell to a 14 - month low of 1.3441 dollars .
Oil prices slipped below 90 dollars a barrel amid fears of a global downturn .
The turmoil emerged after the collapse of loans to would - be US homebuyers with dark credit histories and caused a chaotic chain reaction , revealing how cheap credit throughout the financial system had created a massive bubble .
The US government approved a law Friday to buy up 700 billion dollars of bad mortgages and other assets from banks , freeing them up to start lending again .
" The bank bailout has not worked , " said economist Peter Morici at the University of Maryland .
" The bank bailout will provide banks with much - needed liquidity but it does not address the compensation and management practices on Wall Street that drove irresponsible decisions and gave rise to the crisis . "
A few analysts tried to keep a brave face .
" Let 's try to rise above this depressing deluge of doom and review why the world might not come to an end , although it sure looks bad this morning , " said Ed Yardeni at Yardeni Research .
" There is an enormous amount of liquidity parked in liquid assets with near - zero interest rates .
Stocks are ridiculously cheap if the world is n't coming to an end . "
Central banks continued to pump tens of billions of dollars into interbank money markets that are now essentially on life - support from state institutions because commercial banks are too frightened to lend to each other .
In a bid to increase liquidity , the US Federal Reserve said it would begin to pay interest on bank deposits for the first time and expand its refinancing operations for commercial banks to 900 billion dollars by year - end .

There will surely come a day when Dubai runs the world 's reserves of hyperbole dry .
But in the meantime , we continue to draw a sharp intake of breath each time a new construction project is announced .
We have had ski domes built in the desert , seen vast artificial islands rise from the sea and watched several structures vying for the title of world 's tallest building .
Dubai represents the will , vision and ambition of our species .
Yet many believe it shines an unflattering light on our tendency for folly and hubris , too .
This week , it was reported that the Palazzo Versace hotel - the Emirate 's latest offering for those still in the market for exorbitant luxury - will boast , when completed in 2010 , a refrigerated 820sq metre swimming pool and a beach with artificially cooled sand to protect its guests from the excesses of a climate that can see summer temperatures exceeding 50C .
Wind machines will even be on hand to provide a gentle breeze .
" We will suck the heat out of the sand to keep it cool enough to lie on , " said Soheil Abedian , founder and president of Palazzo Versace , a hotel group with plans for a further 15 luxury hotels around the world to add to the one that already exists on Australia 's Gold Coast .
( I 'm a Celebrity junkies will know this as the hotel where the celebrities are sent once voted out of the " jungle " . )
" This is the kind of luxury that top people want , " he added .
The energy required to run this project can only be guessed at ( when questioned , Hyder Consulting , the British company hired by the hotel to build these facilities , said it has signed a confidentiality agreement with Palazzo Versace and therefore could n't comment ) , but it is likely to leave the world 's environmentalists with their heads in their hands .
First there is the energy required to power giant wind machines all day long , not to mention the electricity needed to pump coolant around tubes laid under the sand .
However , the most energy - intensive element of this plan is likely to be the power needed to refrigerate a whole swimming pool under Dubai 's baking sun .
Of course , in a place like Dubai , this kind of audacious project goes relatively unnoticed , among the many others currently underway .
To pick just one other example , 30,000 mature trees are scheduled to be shipped to Dubai to help landscape a new Tiger Woods - designed golf course that will be bordered by " 22 palaces and 75 mansions " .
Even without the twin threats of climate change and a global economic recession , Dubai 's grandiose plans might seem short - sighted to some .
Is it really wise to be building at all , let alone on this scale , in a place that the United Nations describes as one of the most " water - imperilled " environments on the planet , but where per capita water use is three times the global average ?
" It 's grotesque that while the world 's poorest people face the loss of their homes and livelihoods , as well as disease and starvation , because of climate change , the world 's richest people think it 's acceptable to waste precious energy so pointlessly on things such as artificially cooled beaches , " says Robin Oakley , head of climate and energy at Greenpeace UK .
" While Abu Dhabi , like Barack Obama , is betting on green technology as the engine for growth this century and even building a zero-emissions city , Dubai is apparently still stuck in the 1980s . "
Dubai 's ruling elite insists it now places " sustainability " at the heart of its plans for existing and future projects .
Last year , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Dubai 's ruler , spelled out the " Dubai Strategic Plan 2015 " in a speech .
He explained that oil now contributes only 3 % to Dubai's GDP and that his plan is to " sustain Dubai 's environment , ensuring that it is safe and clean " .
Each new construction project now boasts a paragraph in its brochure about how it will " follow environmental best practice " , but even if these new measures do materialise , Dubai is a place built on the ideology and convenience of cheap , free - flowing oil .
Its business model , particularly its ever - expanding tourist sector , is based on the premise that people will always be willing and able to fly long distances to get there .
( Some airlines now euphemistically describe Dubai as both a " long short - haul " destination and a " long - haul weekend break destination " . )
A new six - runway mega airport is being built to serve a predicted capacity of 120 million passengers a year .
These latest plans for an artificially cooled beach may be causing ripples around the world , but why is n't there more vocal opposition by environmentalists within Dubai ?
The simple answer is there are no environmentalists in Dubai ; not in the sense of a campaigning , placard - bearing activist that you might find elsewhere .
NGOs are barely tolerated within the United Arab Emirates , of which Dubai is a part .
When I visited Dubai two years ago to investigate the environmental and social impacts of its tourism industry for a book I was writing , no one was willing to talk to me on the record , such was their fear of speaking out against the ruling class .
The few environmental groups that do exist in Dubai rarely stray from a brief that seems largely limited to educating school - children about the importance of recycling .
The one place where dissent does seem to be allowed - or is harder to police - is the internet , where people can hide behind their anonymity .
Discussion forums are a popular way to vent criticism about the direction Dubai is taking , as are blogs such as Secret Dubai Diary .
One recent controversy is that over Sammy the Shark , a young whale shark that was caught in the Arabian Gulf and then transferred to the aquarium at the Atlantis Hotel , which opened last month with a £ 20 m party and firework display .
More than 16,000 people joined a Facebook group calling for its release , and one local newspaper started a campaign urging that the shark be returned to the sea .
A local radio DJ has even been playing a " Free Sammy " interpretation of Michael Jackson 's Heal the World .
But while Dubai 's citizens fight for Sammy to be freed , its leaders refuse to be diverted from realising their vision .
At the United Nations climate talks , held in Poland earlier this month , Dr Rashid Ahmad Bin Fahad , the UAE 's minister of environment and water , gave a speech in which he spoke of the need for his country to consider using nuclear power to desalinate its fresh water .
Well , how else are they going to keep those swimming pools filled and chilled ?
Their mean and moody expressions suggest :
Go on , punk , make my day .
And when any rival is foolish enough to stray on to their territory , the result is terrifying .
In scenes more like a violent Quentin Tarantino movie than a wildlife shoot , one Cape ground squirrel delivers a ferocious attack on an interloper .
Reservoir squirrels :
The fur flies as the battle rages
Ka-pow :
The fighters hit the ground
With its opponent on the floor , it does not hesitate to put the furry boot in as it protects its particular part of a camp site in Etosha , Namibia .
The images were captured a few days ago by award - winning British photographer David J. Slater .
Cape ground squirrels are found in the drier parts of Africa and live in colonies of up to 30 .
Flee :
One takes off but the other is in hot pursuit
They are poor climbers and tend to live in interconnecting burrows , which they sometimes share with mongooses .
The rodent uses its bushy tail to shield it from the sun and pumps it up and down as an alarm signal to other members of the pack .
When , that is , it is n't beating the living daylights out of the neighbours .
Fight club : A group of Cape Ground Squirrels watch the fracas
WASHINGTON --
The Supreme Court has turned down an emergency appeal from a New Jersey man who says President - elect Barack Obama is ineligible to be president because he was a British subject at birth .
The court did not comment on its order today rejecting the call by Leo Donofrio of East Brunswick , N.J. , to intervene in the presidential election .
Donofrio says that since Obama had dual nationality at birth -- his mother was American and his Kenyan father at the time was a British subject -- he cannot possibly be a " natural born citizen , " one of the requirements the Constitution lists for eligibility to be president .
Donofrio also contends that two other candidates , Republican John McCain and Socialist Workers candidate Roger Calero , also are not natural - born citizens and thus ineligible to be president .
At least one other appeal over Obama 's citizenship remains at the court .
Philip J. Berg of Lafayette Hill , Pa. , argues that Obama was born in Kenya , not Hawaii as Obama says and the Hawaii secretary of state has confirmed .
Berg says Obama also may be a citizen of Indonesia , where he lived as a boy .
Federal courts in Pennsylvania have dismissed Berg 's lawsuit .
Federal courts in Ohio and Washington state have rejected similar lawsuits .
Allegations raised on the Internet say the birth certificate , showing that Obama was born in Hawaii on Aug. 4 , 1961 , is a fake .
But state officials in Hawaii say they checked health department records and have determined there 's no doubt Obama was born in Hawaii .
The nonpartisan Web site Factcheck.org examined the original document and said it does have a raised seal and the usual evidence of a genuine document .
In addition , Factcheck.org reproduced an announcement of Obama 's birth , including his parents ' address in Honolulu , that was published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13 , 1961 .

I rarely read the Letters to the Editor in the reams of advertising ( with interspersed snippets of news ) that passes for the local newspaper , but this morning , as I was flipping the pages , a phrase caught my eye .
A reader , commenting on the bailout program , waxed indignant .
The writer claimed that we " will have to pay for this mess . "
He referred to the bailout scheme as a debt that our children , grandchildren , and great - grandchildren will be paying far into the future .
It ’s a familiar refrain , which we ’ve heard before and will hear again .
Maybe that ’s the problem : familiarity has bred contempt , or at least indifference .
So ignore the familiarity of the concept , and look at it as though for the first time : " we ( the citizens ) will have to pay for this . "
Have to ?
Says who ?
Going into debt is easy enough .
Everyone understands that using a credit card , or borrowing in any form , indebts the borrower .
It ’s equally well understood that if someone steals your credit card and uses it , pretending to be you , he does wrong , and injures you unjustly .
If I found your credit card on the street , and using it , bought a set of tires for my car , would you simply shrug and say , " I have to pay it ? "
If I made some really , really , expensive purchases , would you resign yourself to the fact that your children and their children would be saddled with the debt ?
How is it , then , that Americans seem resigned , if unhappy , about the fact that those pompous popinjays in Congress have taken all our credit cards and charged about 700 billion to them ?
Has that resulted in a debt that we " have " to pay ?
Even more remarkable is the idea that these officious strangers can place into debt individuals as yet unborn .
How in the world does that work ?
Is there a law that allows one person , or group , to place other persons , or groups , in debt ?
Would n’t that be tantamount to slavery ?
We ’re not talking about taxes here , even granting — for the sake of argument — the authority of Congress to tax us individually .
The money to be taken from us is not going to support government ( assuming we ’d want to do that ! ) but rather , to rescue the bankers from the collapse of the housing bubble which they created , and from which they profited greatly .
The government is acting as bag man , transferring the billions from us to them , but that function of government is clearly unlawful — as if anyone in government cared .
There ’s nothing new about the government doing as it pleases with no regard for the Constitution , to which all Congressmen have sworn adherence .
It has , in fact , become so commonplace that , again , familiarity has bred indifference .
We shrug and say , " So what ?
Just more of the same . "
The question , then , is this : how much will we endure before we stand up and say , to our public servants , " Enough !
We DO NOT have to pull your cronies ’ chestnuts out of the fire !
We DO NOT have to pay the bad debts of others .
We are sovereign ! "
Both of the individuals offered to us as presidential candidates support the bailout .
A vote for either one of them can only be construed as support for , and agreement with , that policy .
A form of protest that even the most timid among us can employ , without risk or danger , is to stay home on Election Day .
As those cunning Chinese are said to have observed millennia ago , a trip of a thousand miles begins with the first step .
In a journey to freedom , the first step for Americans might be a step away from the polling place .

Warning tonight for asthmatics from health boffins – do n’t go and watch a fireworks display on a snowy night , apparently .
Who would have thought that such seemingly innocuous pastimes as muttering “ Ooh , ahh ” while building a snowman could have such potentially dangerous consequences ?
Fireworks and snow can be a dangerous combination for asthma sufferers , researchers have found .
Barium , one of the metal salts used to produce spectacular bursts of colour from fireworks , is also known to constrict the airways .
Scientists in Austria found that after a firework display traces of the metal , which creates green effects , cling to snowflakes .
If the frosty particles were inhaled by asthmatics , it could aggravate their symptoms , the researchers believe .
Researcher Dr Georg Steinhauser and colleagues from Vienna University of Technology analysed fallen snow before and after a display in the Austrian village of Saalbach ,
" We found huge amounts of barium in the snow " , Dr Steinhauser told New Scientist www.newscientist.com magazine .
Concentrations were typically 500 times higher than they were in snow samples taken from the same sites before the display .
Fireworks have previously been linked to breathing difficulties in an Indian study .
During the Indian Diwali festival , a key part of which involves setting off firecrackers , the number of asthma cases rose by 12 % .
Some spectators without asthma had attacks of bronchitis .
Dr Steinhauser 's team is now trying to develop fireworks that are free of barium and perchlorate , which provides the oxygen for pyrotechnic combustion .
Perchlorate can contaminate water supplies and is known to impair thyroid function and harm foetuses .
Man and fetus die in chain saw home invasion
A man wielding a chain saw overnight carved a hole through the door of his estranged wife 's home and fired shots through the hole , critically injuring her , killing the fetus she was carrying and also killing her new boyfriend , Metro police said today .
Police have arrested 25 - year - old William Keck , on a charge of murder with a deadly weapon and a charge of attempted murder .
He has been booked into the Clark County Detention Center , police said .
Police said they were called about 1:10 a.m. today to the Fountains of Villa Cordova Apartments at 2800 Eastern Ave. , where they found a man shot to death in a bedroom .
Police said they believe Keck carved a hole in the apartment with the chain saw , then fired through the hole with an assault rifle .
The woman , who has not been identified , was taken in critical condition to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center .
Her 18 - week - old fetus died , Officer Jay Rivera said .
The dead man 's identity will be released by the Clark County coroner 's office .
OBAMA , Japan ( Reuters ) - Dancing , singing and playing the guitar , residents in the sleepy Japanese fishing port of Obama are readying to party for Barack Obama before Tuesday ’s U.S. presidential election .

Around 50 men , women and children wearing “ I Love Obama ” T - shirts practiced hula dancing over the weekend for the Honolulu - born Democratic candidate , hoping he will win the vote and one day visit the town as U.S. President .
“ I ’m 85 percent confident that Obama will win , ” said hotel owner Seiji Fujiwara , who heads a group backing Obama in hopes that the town , with a population of 32,000 , can share his fame and attract more visitors .
“ I think he ’ll be alright . ”
Shops in the town have been selling everything from T - shirts , fish burgers and steamed cakes to chopsticks bearing Obama ’s name .
“ We ’ve been dancing for Mr. Obama for more than six months , ” said Yuko Shirayama of the local “ Obama Girls ” hula dancing group , created to cheer on Obama .
“ So I hope he wins . ”
Her group traveled to Hawaii to celebrate Obama ’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic nomination for U.S. president earlier this year and the dancers hope to go to Obama ’s inauguration ceremony if he wins .
“ If Mr. Obama becomes president and gets a chance to visit Japan , we would like him to visit our city , ” Mayor Kouji Matsuzaki told Reuters .
Obama has drawn popularity not only in the town sharing his name , but also across the rest of Japan .
In a survey of 3,500 readers by the Asahi Shimbun daily , 73 percent said they would choose Obama if they could vote , while only 7 percent said they would pick Republican rival John McCain .
The town ’s residents will hold their breath as they watch the election results together on television , but they plan to dance and party regardless of the outcome .
The case has disturbing parallels with that of Austria 's Josef Fritzl , who fathered seven children with the daughter he locked in a dungeon for 24 years .
While Fritzl is still awaiting trial , the Sheffield man was on Tuesday ordered to serve 25 life sentences behind bars .
His daughters , whose identities remain secret , expressed relief that their harrowing ordeal was now over .
" His detention in prison brings us only the knowledge that he cannot physically touch us again , " they said in a statement .
" The suffering he has caused will continue for many years and we must now concentrate our thoughts on finding the strength to rebuild our lives . "
Sheffield Crown Court judge Alan Goldsack said the case was " the worst I have come across " in nearly 40 years .
" I have little doubt that many members of the public hearing the facts of this case will consider either you should never be released from prison or only when you are old and infirm , " he said as he handed down his sentence to the man , who had refused to leave his prison cell to attend the hearing .
" I agree with that view . "
The man , a self - employed businessman who liked to call himself the " gaffer " , was arrested after social workers learned in June about the decades of abuse his daughters suffered .
During a hearing last month , he admitted 25 rapes and four indecent assaults .
The court heard the abuse began when the man 's daughters were aged eight and 10 and that he " took pleasure " in the harm he knew he was doing to them .
The elder sister fell pregnant seven times , the younger 12 times .
Of their 19 pregnancies , 10 babies were lost because of miscarriage or abortion , while two died on the day they were born .
Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell , QC , said that , when either of the sisters tried to end the abuse , their father threatened to kill them and their children .
They tried offering him £ 100 a month from their child benefits to stop the abuse and tried to give him as much whisky as they could in the hope he would drink himself to death .
To ensure the abuse remained secret , the man repeatedly moved house with his family , including his wife and son .
His wife left in the early 1990s .
" All the family were frightened of him , " Mr Campbell said .
" His younger daughter told of the frightening habit her father had of putting her head next to the flames of their gas fire and that , when she struggled to get away , on certain occasions she burnt her eyes . "
In 1998 one of the sisters called a helpline run by the charity Childline and asked for a guarantee that she could keep her children if she came forward about the abuse .
But no guarantee was granted and the sisters ' suffering went unreported .
Police and social services have launched an independent review into the case and why the abuse was not detected sooner .
Ian Keates , for the Crown Prosecution Service in South Yorkshire , described the abuse the sisters had been subjected to as " beyond comprehension " .
" In his treatment of his victims the defendant sank to the most profound depths of depravity , " he said .

Last month BMW reported a sharp fall in profits German carmaker BMW has seen its global monthly sales fall by more than a quarter , as consumers tighten their belts amid the economic slowdown .
BMW brand sales fell 26.2 % in November from the same month a year ago , said the firm , while sales of its UK - based Mini subsidiary declined 20.8 % .
The firm has already said its Mini plant in Oxford will close on Friday for an extended Christmas shutdown .
It is closing the factory for four weeks instead of the usual two .
November sales at BMW 's luxury Rolls - Royce arm were down 18.5 % .
For the whole BMW group , sales fell 25.4 % to 96,570 in November , compared with a much slower decrease of 8.3 % to 113,005 in October .
Profit fall " During the period to the end of November the BMW group performed better than the overall premium segment , and has increased its market share in the segment , " said BMW board member Ian Robertson .
I do n't want to tell my children that I 've just lost my job
Worker at the Mini factory
Final day for Mini agency staff in the UK Last month BMW reported a sharp fall in its profits and said it could not provide a forecast for 2008 and beyond because of the uncertain economic climate .
The German firm said net profit fell 63 % for the three months to September to 298m euros ( $ 375.5 m ; £ 236.5 m ) .
During the quarter , sales dropped 9 % to 12.6bn euros , from 14bn euros in the same three month period a year earlier .
Almost all of the world 's carmakers have seen sales fall sharply since the summer , and Detroit 's " Big Three " firms - General Motors , Ford and Chrysler - have asked the US government for $ 34bn ( £ 23 bn ; 26.6bn euros ) in emergency loans .

Wired 's Joshua A Davis has a great profile of my pal Dan Kaminsky 's work on discovering and then helping to fix a net - crashing DNS bug earlier this year .
Davis really captures the excitement of discovering a major security flaw and the complex web of personal , professional and technical complications that come to bear when you 're trying to disclose the research in a way that minimizes harm to the net .
Dan does a lot of fun security - related stuff that does n't get talked about in public .
There 's this one thing he does —
But that would be telling .
The next morning , Kaminsky strode to the front of the conference room at Microsoft headquarters before Vixie could introduce him or even welcome the assembled heavy hitters .
The 16 people in the room represented Cisco Systems , Microsoft , and the most important designers of modern DNS software .
Vixie was prepared to say a few words , but Kaminsky assumed that everyone was there to hear what he had to say .
After all , he 'd earned the spotlight .
He had n't sold the discovery to the Russian mob .
He had n't used it to take over banks .
He had n't destroyed the Internet .
He was actually losing money on the whole thing :
As a freelance computer consultant , he had taken time off work to save the world .
In return , he deserved to bask in the glory of discovery .
Maybe his name would be heralded around the world .
Kaminsky started by laying out the timeline .
He had discovered a devastating flaw in DNS and would explain the details in a moment .
But first he wanted the group to know that they did n't have much time .
On August 6 , he was going to a hacker convention in Las Vegas , where he would stand before the world and unveil his amazing discovery .
If there was a solution , they 'd better figure it out by then .
But did Kaminsky have the goods ?
DNS attacks were nothing new and were considered difficult to execute .
The most practical attack–widely known as cache poisoning –required a hacker to submit data to a DNS server at the exact moment that it updated its records .
If he succeeded , he could change the records .
But , like sperm swimming toward an egg , whichever packet got there first–legitimate or malicious –locked everything else out .
If the attacker lost the race , he would have to wait until the server updated again , a moment that might not come for days .
And even if he timed it just right , the server required a 16 - bit ID number .
The hacker had a 1 - in - 65,536 chance of guessing it correctly .
It could take years to successfully compromise just one domain .
The experts watched as Kaminsky opened his laptop and connected the overhead projector .
He had created a " weaponized " version of his attack on this vulnerability to demonstrate its power .
A mass of data flashed onscreen and told the story .
In less than 10 seconds , Kaminsky had compromised a server running BIND 9 , Vixie 's DNS routing software , which controls 80 percent of Internet traffic .
It was undeniable proof that Kaminsky had the power to take down large swaths of the Internet .
( CNN ) --
With recent polls showing Sen. Barack Obama 's lead increasing nationwide and in several GOP - leaning states , some Republicans attending John McCain - Sarah Palin campaign rallies are showing a new emotion : rage .
An angry supporter confronts Sen. John McCain at a rally in Wisconsin on Thursday .
At a rally in Minnesota on Friday , a woman told McCain : " I do n't trust Obama .
I have read about him and he's an Arab . "
McCain shook his head and said , " No ma'am , no ma'am .
He 's a decent family man ...[ a ] citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues .
That 's what this campaign is all about . "
One man at the rally said he was " scared of an Obama presidency . "
McCain later told the man he should not fear Obama .
" I want to be president of the United States , and I do n't want Obama to be , " he said .
" But I have to tell you , I have to tell you , he is a decent person , and a person that you do not have to be scared as President of the United States . "
McCain 's response was met with boos from the crowd .
When asked about these outbursts , McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said that he did n't know who those people were and if they were there as supporters or to disrupt the rallies .
A day earlier , the same type of hostility toward Obama was evident at McCain - Palin rallies .
" When you have an Obama , [ House Speaker Nancy ]
Pelosi and the rest of the hooligans up there going to run this country , we have got to have our head examined .
It 's time that you two are representing us , and we are mad .
So , go get them , " one man told McCain at a town hall meeting in Waukesha , Wisconsin .
Another man was more pointed .
" And we 're all wondering why that Obama is where he 's at , how he got here .
I mean , everybody in this room is stunned that we 're in this position , " another man said at Thursday 's rally .
" I 'm mad .
I 'm really mad .
And what 's going to surprise you , it 's not the economy .
It 's the socialists taking over our country , " one said .
Watch more of the anger at the rallies »
McCain urged his supporters to be respectful of Obama .
" We want to fight and I will fight .
But we will be respectful , " he said .
" I admire Sen. Obama and his accomplishments .
I will respect him and I want everyone to be respectful , and let 's make sure we are . "
Watch McCain address attacks on Obama »
CNN contributor David Gergen , who has advised Democratic and Republican presidential administrations , said Thursday that the negative tone of these rallies is " incendiary " and could lead to violence .
" There is this free floating sort of whipping around anger that could really lead to some violence .
I think we 're not far from that , " he said .
" I think it 's really imperative that the candidates try to calm people down . "
On Friday , Obama said the " barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks " was a result of the Republican nominee 's failed economic ideas .
" They can run misleading ads , they can pursue the politics of anything goes .
It will not work .
Not this time .
I think that folks are looking for something different this time .
It 's easy to rile up a crowd , nothing 's easier than riling up a crowd by stoking anger and division .
But that 's not what we need right now in the United States .
The times are too serious , " Obama said at a rally in Chillicothe , Ohio .
Recently , McCain 's campaign launched a string of ads that question Obama 's judgment and character .
The McCain campaign calls Obama " too risky for America " in a new Web ad that focuses on his political relationship with Bill Ayers , a founding member of the radical Weather Underground .
" Barack Obama and domestic terrorist Bill Ayers .
Friends .
They 've worked together for years .
But Obama tries to hide it , " the announcer said in the 90 - second ad .
The now - defunct Weather Underground was involved in bombings in the early 1970s , including attacks on the Pentagon and the Capitol .
Obama was a young child at the time of the bombings .
Obama and Ayers , now a university professor , met in 1995 , when both worked with a nonprofit group trying to raise funds for a school improvement project and a charitable foundation .
CNN 's review of project records found nothing to suggest anything inappropriate in the volunteer projects in which the two men were involved .
CNN Fact Check : Is Obama ' palling around with terrorists '?
Obama , in an April debate during the primaries , called Ayers " somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago , when I was 8 . "
At a rally Tuesday in Clearwater , Florida , Sarah Palin said Obama was being " less than truthful " about his ties to Ayers .
" His own top adviser said they were ' certainly friendly . ' ... I am just so fearful that this is not a man who sees America the way that you and I see America -- as the greatest source for good in this world , " she said .
Palin told the crowd that she sees " a pattern in how our opponent has talked about one of his most troubling associations . "
Watch more of Palin 's comments »
One member of the Palin audience in Jacksonville , Florida , Tuesday shouted out " treason . "
And at another rally in the state Monday , Palin 's mention of the Obama - Ayers tie caused one member to yell out : " kill him " -- though it was unclear if it was targeted at Obama or Ayers .
At several recent rallies , Palin has stirred up crowds by mentioning the " liberal media . "
Routinely , there are boos at every mention of The New York Times and the " mainstream media , " both of which are staples of Palin 's stump speech .
Some audience members are openly hostile to members of the traveling press covering Palin ; one crowd member hurled a racial epithet at an African - American member of the press in Clearwater , Florida , on Monday .
And at a McCain rally in New Mexico on Monday , one supporter yelled out " terrorist " when McCain asked , " Who is the real Barack Obama ? "
McCain did n't respond .
Watch as McCain ramps up his criticism of Obama »
Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland , a Democrat , on Friday told voters that the McCain - Palin campaign " would want you to be afraid of Barack Obama . "
Some Republicans have also been critical of the McCain campaign .
Former Michigan Gov. William Milliken , a Republican , told the Grand Rapids Press he was " disappointed in the tenor and the personal attacks on the part of the McCain campaign . "
" He is not the McCain I endorsed , " Milliken said Thursday .
Some anger found at McCain - Palin rallies is directed at McCain for a different reason .
Watch analysts weigh in on the recent attacks »
" I am begging you , sir , I am begging you , take it to him , " another supporter said to the Arizona senator at the Wisconsin rally .
McCain , however , seems torn .
On one hand , he is going negative on the Ayers controversy .
" The point is , Sen . Obama said he was just a guy in the neighborhood .
We know that 's not true , " he said at the rally in Wisconsin .
" We need to know the full extent of the relationship because of whether Sen. Obama is telling the truth to the American people or not . "
On the other hand , McCain is trying to focus on the economic downturn plaguing the country .
" But I also , my friends , want to address the greatest financial challenge of our lifetime with a positive plan for action , " he added .
Also , the McCains said months ago they did n't want their son Jimmy -- a Marine serving in Iraq -- dragged into the campaign .
But on Thursday , Cindy McCain brought up her son .
She criticized the Illinois senator for voting against a bill to fund troops in Iraq , a regular line of attack from her husband 's campaign .
" The day that Sen .
Obama cast a vote not to fund my son when he was serving sent a cold chill through my body , let me tell you , " she told a Pennsylvania crowd before introducing her husband and his No. 2 .
The vote Cindy McCain is referencing came in May 2007 , when Obama was one of 14 senators who voted against a war - spending plan that would have provided emergency funds for American troops overseas .
A CNN fact check deemed the charge that Obama voted against troop funding " misleading . "
Obama supported a different version of the troop - funding plan -- one that McCain spoke against .
Fact Check : Did Obama vote to cut funds for the troops ?

Call it lightpainting , light drawing , or light graffiti – whatever the label , the work of NYC duo MRI is fun , energetic , and chock full of awesome .
Using a Canon 5D , a wide angle lens , 10 - 30 second exposures and lots of crazy lights , the team creates amazing images in which streaks and streams of light take center stage .
WebUrbanist recently had the opportunity to talk to Michelle McSwain and Ryan Warnberg , the two halves of MRI , about their unique photography method .
WU : How many tries does it usually take to get to the image you were hoping for ?
MRI : Quite a few …we will start with an idea and keep shooting it until it feels right .
WU : How and why did you start doing light drawing photography ?
Ryan : I had seen some lightpainting online at one point , and I fell in love … the only problem is I did n’t know how to do it in front of a camera .
I had just started dating Michelle , who was already an amazing photographer , so I asked her one day “ can we do this ?
Is this even possible ? ” and she knew exactly what to do .
So I got us our first LED light and we got to work .
Michelle : Yea , I remember the day Ryan sent me some images online to check out and we were both hooked .
I brought all my camera equipment to his rooftop one night and that ’s where we made those first images of the gun and wings .
WU : Do you always have a goal in mind when you start shooting , or are your photographs more spontaneous in nature ?
Michelle :
We usually start out with some what of a vague idea , but most of the time it is just trial and error .
Ryan : Yeah , we just get in front of the camera , and the ideas start flowing .
It ’s a blast .
And as we keep shooting , we just get more and more inspired , to the point that we are bouncing ideas off each other all night long .
[ Be sure to click on each of the photos below for a larger view and the artists ’ comments about the picture . ]
MRI : After that first night , our big idea for MRI ( Michelle and Ryan Illumination ) was to include other people , to offer our services for hire and let other people know how easy and fun it really is .
We do n’t think of art as a lofty , unattainable thing , we want to offer the opportunity to make some memorable images to everyone .
Last year , we had the opportunity to do a piece for Lyor Cohen , VP of Warner Music Group , we did some ads for a light company , and we really have the most fun when we include other people , getting them in front of the camera to flail some lights around and have a good time .

What Was Madoff Thinking ?
Former con artist , psychologists explain what it takes to pull off major fraud .
Dec. 15 , 2008  -- Bernard Madoff may be alone in the sheer magnitude of his alleged $ 50 billion fraud uncovered Thursday , but he was n't alone in devising and becoming cornered in an irreversible Ponzi scheme .
Norman Hsu and Lou Pearlman were charged for multimillion - dollar Ponzi schemes just within the last year .
Barry Minkow , a former Ponzi scam artist , and psychologists for the Wall Street elite offer very different motives behind why people dig themselves so deep into fraud for so long .
But all agree the path to high - stakes Ponzi schemes has less to do with money than emotions .
" We want to sleep at night too , " said Minkow , who served seven years in federal prison for his multimillion - dollar Ponzi scheme , but now investigates corporate fraud through the Fraud Discovery Institute , Inc. , which he co-founded in San Diego .
For five years during the 1980s , Minkow ran a Ponzi scheme behind the ZZZ Best Co. Inc. , once thought to be worth $ 300 million .
He appeared on " The Oprah Winfrey Show , " made headlines as a young entrepreneur and , according to his online biography , amassed more than $ 20 million in loans from banks with no real profitable business .
" We all have a cure , " he explained .
" The irony of white collar crime is we believe that we 're one good week in trading away and we 'll get enough to pay it all back . "
Ponzi schemes pay existing investors with the money from new investors rather than the profits from a legitimate company .
As long as new investors buy in , the old investors will see a " profit , " but eventually the pyramid becomes too large and the scheme collapses .
" We 're not going to give up in it -- you got to buy time until the cure , " said Minkow .
Before the cure , Minkow said he 's found that most high - profile Ponzi scam artists work through trust .
" Perpetrators of crime rely on imputed credibility , " said Minkow .
" Once you 've got that then people look at subjective criteria , not objective criteria to do business . "
So rather than looking at the profitability of the company or its practices , Minkow said people will go with the credibility from word of mouth , reputation , prominence or glamour .
Building Up a Ponzi Scheme
Minkow said he gained credibility through media appearances .
" Madoff was able to succeed because of his past position as chairman of NASDAQ , " he said .
Minkow has found a similarity between Ponzi scam artists when their lies start to unravel , too .
Rather than a change of heart , Minkow said there 's usually the " unknown variable " that exposes the crime .
" We all get caught because of the unknown variable .
It 's the thing that brings us down , " said Minkow .
" For me , it was an investigative reporter .
For Madoff , it was an economy that 's so bad people began asking for redemptions . "
Ironically , Minkow said the end of a Ponzi scheme can be the most psychologically therapeutic .
" The first good night sleep I got was in prison , " said Minkow .
" Because it was over , I did n't have to lie anymore . "
Stephen C. Josephson , a psychologist who treats many Wall Street clients in Manhattan , said he has seen similar greed and deceit in the financial world .
" There 's been an association between money and self - esteem , that they 'll do anything to keep it , " said Josephson , who is also a clinical associate professor at Cornell Weill Medical College and at Columbia University in Manhattan .
" I think he [ Madoff ] is a textbook , but extreme , example ; there are others like him out there , " said Josephson .
Josephson said in case of an extreme Ponzi scheme scam artist , there are certain behaviors that fall into psychological " themes . "
" From my perspective ... in my field we have a lot of labels that try to help us understand and study human behavior , " said Josephson .
" Although people do n't fit neatly on the boxes , Madoff has certain themes . "
Josephson said those " themes " include narcissism , which breeds a grandiose sense of self , greed and a lack of remorse .
" I would imagine that he 's probably quite narcissistic , " he said .
" Everybody has a personality , but when you take it to an extreme then you have a personality disorder , " said Josephson .
Disturbing Thoughts at The Top
Among scam artists of Madoff 's scale , Josephson said he can see " themes " of behavior of antisocial personalities .
" You have this other thing called antisocial personality disorder , " he said .
" These are people who break the law .
Typically they lack remorse . "
However , for all the " themes , " Josephson said he has seen a cultural shift since practicing therapy in 1978 that also contributed to all the recent crimes .
" There are definitely people with money who deal with it in a generous way , " he said .
" It 's not money that 's the problem , it 's values . "
Josephson said he 's noticed that across the board , both poor and rich , his clients have put more and more emphasis on money than on community values or even a sense of self .
He said this culture has only rewarded and enabled people at the upper echelons to put money first .
" Money has become equated [ with ] power , " he said .
" Look , if you have a large sum of money , and even if you obtained it in an unethical way , you 'll be welcome in the homes of politicians , in clubs , at events . "
In Washington , D.C. , Douglas LaBier has been a business psychologist and psychotherapist for senior executives in corporations for decades .
Like Josephson , LaBier sees the heads of these Ponzi schemes as extreme examples of a cultural problem .
" It 's a continuum and more extreme at the executive end , " said LaBier , who is president of Center for Adult Development in Washington .
" You 're in that stratosphere and everything you stand for is your career , " said LaBier .
" If your identity is so wrapped up in your career , when that starts to unravel , there 's no grounding and you 're in quicksand . "
LaBier said he 's seen a " careerist " culture blossom in past decades that connected a person 's value to their job .
While everyone may become party to it , the more success one has , the more danger they are in to only identify with that success , and protect it with questionable actions .
" It 's for any individual .
He [ Madoff ] is not in a vacuum .
He 's reflecting a larger culture , " said LaBier .
" It took the form of money because that 's the arena he 's in .
... but the personal collapse , the sense of who you are , gets destroyed . "
But Minkow said he does't buy the identity connection .
When asked if he had to reassess his identity after his fall , Minkow responded quite simply : " No . "

J. Falk's 4 in 1 Cat Stove
www.TrailGear.org
Created by : J. Falk , 2003
The last alcohol stove you 'll ever need !
Backpackers , Hikers , Campers and Survivalists are discovering this versatile backpacking stove .
This powerful little stove can boil 2 cups of water within 4 minutes and runs on denatured or 70 % rubbing alcohol .
This is a variation of the traditional Cat and Super Cat Stoves .
This version adds safety to the Super Cat Stove by incorporating a simple and stable pot stand .
Just a note on pressurized stoves and how they work .
These simple stoves create pressure when the cooking pot is placed on top of the stove , sealing the top opening .
This creates the simplest version of a pressurized stove I 've found .
As the stove heats up it vaporizes the alcohol which is ignited and continues to burn until exhausted .
I 'll also show you how to build two non-pressurized stoves , possibly the best all weather alcohol stoves around .
One of which is a Simmer Stove that can burn for close to an hour .
Let 's get started building this simple alcohol stove ...
TOOLS & MATERIALS : Safety glasses
Drill with 1/4 " drill bit or Uni-bit .
Bottle opener ( church key ) .
Tin snips or Dremel tool with cutting wheel
1 " wide x 12 " long strip of aluminum foil
Paper clip or small metal clamp
One 3 ounce can of cat food .
Two 5.5 ounce cans of cat food .
Cost - Less than $ 1.50 .
Build time - 20 minutes .
IMPORTANT : You need to purchase two 5.5 ounce cat food cans from the same supplier .
The diameter of the can is important to the design of this stove .
Not all brands are the same size , so it 's important to buy cans from the same manufacturer .
Note : I prefer name bands over generics because the quality of aluminum is better .
STEP 1 . PUT ON YOUR SAFETY GLASSES !!!.
Always use eye protection when working with metal .
Make the burner .
Take the 3 ounce can of cat food , remove the lid and drill 8 - 1/4 " holes around the center of the can .
Use your dremel tool to grind down the jagged edges on the inside of the drilled holes .
IMPORTANT : For best performance - do not alter the hole size or their placement around the can .
STEP 2 . Make the pot stand .
Take one 5.5 ounce cat food can , remove the lid , make 8 vent holes around the can using your bottle opener or church key ( puncture outside in from the top opening ) , trim off the punched tabs with your dremel tool .
Also , cut an exhaust hole ( using tin snips or dremel tool ) in the bottom center of the can .
In this example I made a square , but you can make a circle if you desire .
STEP 3 . Make the base for the Simmer Stove .
Take the second 5.5 ounce cat food can , remove the lid , cut an exhaust hole in the bottom center of the can .
In this example I made a square , but you can make a circle if desired .
Note - both exhaust holes ( step 2 & 3 ) must not exceed the inner diameter of the smallest circle in the bottom of the can ( note the black outline in picture 1 below ) .
Picture ( 1 ) Cut a narrow strip of aluminum foil ( 1 " wide x 12 " long , doubled over ) to wrap around the Simmer base .
Also , cut a half moon simmer plate out of one of the discarded lids or any scrap aluminum , bend up a corner so it 's easy to grab .
You 'll also need a paper clip or small metal clip to secure the aluminum foil strip ( to cover the 4 intake holes ) around the Simmer Base .
Picture ( 2 ) Drill 4 - 1/4 " air intake holes from 1/8 " to 1/4 " down from the top lip around the can .
For best performance - do not alter the hole size or their placement around the can .
FINISHED STOVES :
The following stoves are shown without windscreens .
I 'm assuming you 're familiar with building and using a windscreen .
If not , windscreens can be easily made out of aluminum foil or disposable aluminum pans used to cook large meats like turkey .
To build a simple windscreen use a piece of tin foil wrapped around the stove and cooking pot .
The tin foil should extend from the ground to about 1 " to 2 " up the side of the cooking pot , with a 1 / 4 " to 1/2 " gap around the cooking pot .
Puncture a few small holes around the bottom of the windscreen to let air into the stove .
Take a look at some windscreen examples in the stove section at www.HomeMadeGear.com or www.ZenStoves.net
The cooking times listed below are based on using denatured alcohol with perfect weather conditions at 78 degrees , no wind and limited humidity .
These times may fluctuate based on your environmental conditions .
Note : pressurized alcohol stoves have problems vaporizing the fuel in cold weather .
For cold conditions I recommend using my Wood Burning Trail Stove or my non-pressurized Stove # 3 below .
STOVE # 1 .
This is the Super Cat Stove configuration ( by Jim Woods ) which consists of only the 3 ounce burner with the cooking pot .
With this setup you 'll boil water in 3 to 4 minutes using 3 tea spoons of denatured alcohol .
Total burn time 4 to 5 minutes .
To start this stove ...
Place the stove on a safe , flat noncombustible surface .
Pour denatured alcohol ( 4 tea spoons max ) into the 3 ounce burner .
Carefully ignite with a lighter or match .
Wait about 30 seconds for the stove to heat then carefully place the cooking pot on the stove .
Problems :
The small 3 ounce can lacks stability , unstable platform for cooking pots .
Can not simmer .
Does not work well in cold temperatures .
Benefits :
Very simple , very efficient .
One piece pressurized stove .
Rapid boil times .
STOVE # 2 .
Here I show you my favorite setup using the 3 ounce can as a burner and the larger 5.5 ounce can as the pot stand .
With this setup you 'll boil water in 4 to 5 minutes using 3 tea spoons of denatured alcohol .
Total burn time 5 to 7 minutes .
VERSION 1 : Burner inside the pot stand .
To start this stove ...
Place the stove on a safe , flat noncombustible surface .
Place the 3 ounce burner inside the 5.5 ounce vented pot stand .
Pour denatured alcohol ( 4 tea spoons max ) into the 3 ounce burner .
Carefully ignite with a lighter or match .
Wait about 30 seconds for the stove to heat then carefully place the cooking pot on the stove .
- OR -
VERSION 2 : Pot stand over the burner .
Note - this version works best if you want to quickly switch to the Simmer Stove after the boil .
To start this stove ...
Place the stove on a safe , flat noncombustible surface .
Pour denatured alcohol ( 4 tea spoons max ) into the 3 ounce burner .
Place the 5.5 ounce vented pot stand over the 3 ounce burner .
Carefully ignite with a lighter or match .
Wait about 30 seconds for the stove to heat then carefully place the cooking pot on the stove .
Problems : Slightly longer boil times than stove # 1 ( Super Cat Stove ) above .
Two piece stove as opposed to one piece .
Can not simmer .
Does not work well in cold temperatures .
Benefits : Simple to use .
Larger diameter pot stand creates a more stable platform for cooking pots .
Acceptable boil times .
Longer burn times .
Pressurized stove .
STOVE # 3 .
Here 's an excellent all weather non-pressurized stove .
With this setup you 'll boil water in 4 to 5 minutes using 3 tea spoons of denatured alcohol .
Total burn time about 6 to 7 minutes .
This setup works best when it 's too cold for your pressurized stove .
This is my version of the original Cat Stove ( by Roy " TrailDad " Robinson ) .
Here 's a tip about the four air intake holes in the Simmer Base .
If you notice the boil times are too long , try increasing the air flow into the stove by placing the Simmer base on the ground , using a branch or twig , dig little trenches that extend under the stove base .
This will allow extra air into the stove ( under the bottom lip ) which will shorten the boil times .
Your other option is to make additional intake holes .
However , be careful if you add holes ( once you make them you 're stuck ) , too much air flow will cause the stove to burn out too fast .
Place the 5.5 ounce Simmer Base over the 3 ounce burner .
Place the vented pot stand on the Simmer Base then place the cooking pot on the stove .
Note :
To avoid spilling make sure the top vented pot stand is securely placed on the bottom simmer base .
This is why you need cans from the same supplier .
Mismatched name bands may not stack correctly .
To start this stove ...
Place the stove on a safe , flat noncombustible surface .
Pour denatured alcohol ( 4 tea spoons max ) into the 3 ounce burner .
Place the 5.5 ounce simmer base over the 3 ounce burner .
Now place the 5.5 ounce vented pot stand on the simmer base .
Carefully ignite through the top vent holes with a lighter or match .
Wait about 30 seconds for the stove to heat .
Carefully place the cooking pot on the stove .
Problems :
Three piece stove as opposed to one or two pieces .
To avoid spilling make sure the top vented pot stand is securely placed on the bottom simmer base .
Benefits : Simple to use .
Quick boil times .
The best all weather stove .
STOVE # 4 .
Here 's an excellent non-pressurized Simmer Stove .
Total burn time about 35 to 45 minutes using 3 tea spoons of denatured alcohol .
1 ) Wrap the strip of aluminum foil around the bottom of the Simmer base ( secured with a clip ) covering the four air intake holes .
Lost your foil strip ?
If you drilled the four intake holes as directed in step 3 above ( close to the lip ) you can cover the intake holes with dirt .
By choking the air flow into the stove you can produce a low temperature slow burning flame .
2 ) Place the 5.5 ounce Simmer Base over the 3 ounce burner , followed by the half moon simmer plate for adjusting the flame .
3 & 4 ) Place the vented pot stand on the simmer base then place the cooking pot on the stove .
Note :
To avoid spilling make sure the top vented pot stand is securely placed on the bottom simmer base .
To start this stove ...
Place the stove on a safe , flat noncombustible surface .
Pour denatured alcohol ( 4 tea spoons max ) into the 3 ounce burner .
Place the 5.5 ounce simmer base over the 3 ounce burner followed by the half moon simmer plate ( exposing the exhaust hole to its maximum size ) .
Now place the 5.5 ounce vented pot stand on the simmer base .
Carefully ignite through the top vent holes with a lighter or match .
Wait about 30 seconds for the stove to heat .
Carefully place the cooking pot on the stove .
Control the flame by adjusting the half moon simmer plate as desired using a piece if wire , twig or needle nose pliers through the holes in the vented pot stand .
Problems :
Three piece stove as opposed to one or two pieces .
To avoid spilling make sure the top vented pot stand is securely placed on the bottom simmer base .
Long time to boil water .
Benefits : Simple to use .
Adjustable flame control .
Extremely long cooking times .
All weather stove .
Perfect simmer stove .
BETTER POT STAND :
For those of you who would like a better pot stand ( for stoves 3 & 4 above ) , here 's a variation using the 5.5 ounce Simmer base over the 3 ounce burner .
Using heavy wire mesh screening , cut a strip 2.5 inches wide x 15 inches long .
Wrap the wire mesh around the Simmer base , overlapping the ends just a little .
Secure by hooking the tips of the outside wire into the inside overlapping mesh .
Now place the cooking pot on the pot stand .
This is the safest pot stand for stoves 3 & 4 above .
If you build this pot stand correctly it will fit inside the cooking pot for storage .
EXTINGUISH THE FIRE :
Since this is an alcohol fueled stove the only safe way to extinguish a burning fire is to place an opened ended can ( larger in diameter than the 5.5 ounce can ) over the top of the stove .
This will cut off the air supply and extinguish the fire .
DO NOT attempt to blow the fire out and DO NOT throw water on the stove , this will only spread the fire .
TIPS :
1 ) This stove is designed for use " only " with small backpacking cooking pots !!!
2 ) This stove uses alcohol based fuels like denatured or 70 % rubbing alcohol .
Be careful with alcohol stoves because the flame may not be visible in the light .
WARNING : Never use gas or petroleum based fuels in the stove .
3 ) Always wipe you hands of any spilled alcohol before lighting the stove .
Failure to do so could cause injury when you ignite the stove .
4 ) Always place the cooking pot on the center of the stove .
5 ) Keep all body parts and clothes away from the stove at all times .
6 ) To avoid flare ups , always remove the cooking pot slowly from the stove .
7 ) Always remove the cooking pot from the stove before stirring its contents .
PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS :
Problem :
Fire goes out after the cooking pot is placed on the stove .
Solution :
The stove is not hot enough to sustain the flame .
You need to pre-heat the stove .
Place a piece of tin foil under the stove .
Bend up the edges of the foil to make a bath tub around the stove .
Pour a little denatured alcohol in the tub .
Carefully light the tub and wait about 30 seconds .
This will pre-heat the burner , allowing the flame to continue when you place the cooking pot on the stove .
DISCLAIMER :
Use common sense and safety at all times when using any stove .

The Crook County School District has temporarily removed a book from classrooms after one parent complained to the school board that the National Book Award winner was " trashy " and " inappropriate . "
Written by Sherman Alexie , " The Absolutely True Diary of a Part - Time Indian , " which is based on Alexie 's own experiences , follows a boy who leaves the Spokane Indian Reservation to attend an all - white school " where the only other Indian is the school mascot " according to the book jacket description .
But Hank Moss , of Prineville , read the book his son was assigned to read and raised objections to the school board earlier this week , according to the Bend Bulletin .
Moss , reached today by The Oregonian , said the book includes " a reference about masturbation , and that it 's ok and no big deal . "
He added that he felt it was " inappropriate . "
Moss said he also was upset that the school did n't notify him that the book was being assigned , adding that it alerts parents when teachers are covering certain topics in health class , for instance .
Moss photocopied some pages and brought them to the school board meeting .
Based on Moss 's concerns and the pages , the school board issued a directive to the superintendent to look into how it was included in the curriculum , said Jeff Landaker , chairman of the Crook County school board .
As a parent , however , Landaker said the book concerned him .
" My objection was the graphic language and the graphic pictures , " he said .
The book includes cartoon - like drawings .
Alexie told the Bend Bulletin that the book " is actually a celebration of the compassion a small town of white conservatives showed ... an Indian boy , they ended up loving . "
He added that his autobiographical book is " about following your dreams .
...
It 's the story of an Indian kid dreaming of a bigger life .
It 's very American , " he said .
But Moss , the parent , said he does not think the book should be taught at any age .
" I do n't think it should be for anybody , " he said .
" I think it 's trash .
I do n't think a 50 - year - old ought to read it . "

01.27.20 - The Things We Believe
That are Untrue
J. Kim I ’ve often spoken of , in this blog , in the many things we believe that are untrue .
For example , many financial metrics in which we blindly believe , reported by the mainstream news , like inflation , GDP and unemployment statistics are patently false and not even close to being reflective of reality .
This holds true not just in the financial world but also extends to many other beliefs that have been sold to us as facts in the academic setting , but simply are not facts .
The things we believe that are untrue , depending on our critical thinking skills , may range from nearly all of , to the majority of , to the minority of our beliefs .
Even societal constructs like institutional academics as the only viable choice for education can be a construct in which we believe that is patently not the best option for us .

The neoconservatives are drifting back into the Democratic Party fold from whence they came , attempting to limit the terms of the discourse on foreign and security policy so there will be no surprises from the new administration .
Media neocons like Bill Kristol and David Brooks are jumping on the Hillary bandwagon , convinced that she will , if anything , prove to be more hawkish than her predecessor , Condoleezza Rice .
The mainstream media is also doing its bit .
The New York Times leads the way in stifling any real debate , recently featuring on its opinion pages a " Transitions " series that incorporates the views of designated " experts . "
The choice of contributors , including Madeleine Albright , William Cohen , and Peter Bergen , has guaranteed a consensus that America ’s use of its military might in the international arena is a force for good .
One piece , titled " Let Russia Stop Iran , " was written by three Israelis who are members of the Institute for International Security Studies , a think - tank in Tel Aviv dedicated to Israeli security .
Notable among the contributors are two leading neocons , Danielle Pletka and Reuel Marc Gerecht , both of whom support torture and war with Iran .
Pletka is vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) , and Gerecht is currently a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies ( FDD ) , a think - tank that focuses heavily on Israeli security .
Gerecht was also at AEI but recently lost his sinecure in a purge that reportedly was initiated by Pletka .
Michael Ledeen also was removed and wound up with Gerecht at FDD , and Joshua Muravchik is also reported to be leaving AEI .
Pletka is Australian born and is reported to be a close associate of Martin Indyk , also an Australian by birth , who became U.S. ambassador to Israel under Bill Clinton .
She was educated in the United States , worked in Israel and the U.S. as a journalist , and eventually found a niche on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , where she served as a staffer .
AEI regards her as an expert on the Middle East , though there is no evidence in her official bio that she speaks either Farsi or Arabic .
Pletka ’s " The Syrian Strategy " might be described as predictable in that it dismisses diplomatic attempts to improve relations with Syria , which would , inter alia , divide it from Iran and potentially remake the status quo in the Middle East .
Per Pletka , Syria has been " funneling killers into Iraq to oppose coalition forces , assassinating its opponents in Lebanon , arming Hezbollah to attack Israel , and starting a nuclear weapons program with help from North Korea , " all of which are assertions that intentionally narrow the terms of the discourse but are debatable or even manifestly false .
Pletka reasons that Syrian President Bashar al - Assad " can maintain his grip on power only as long as he is seen as a vital instrument of Israel ’s defeat , " and she rejects those who believe that Syria actually wants to become a " normal " state , asserting that it wishes to remain a pariah .
For Pletka , it ’s all about Israel , but not surprisingly she provides no evidence to support her claims about Damascus .
Nor does she appear to have an answer to the challenge posed by Syria apart from unrelenting hostility , a simplistic solution to a complex problem that is completely divorced from reality .
Her viewpoint would appear to be undermined by the Israelis themselves , who are talking to the Syrians in Turkey .
Gerecht is a more interesting character altogether .
A student of Bernard Lewis , he believes that the only thing that Muslims truly understand is the mailed fist .
He has said that Iranians have " terrorism in their DNA , " and he advocates negotiating with Iran only as a prelude to bombing .
He currently resides in Prague , where his wife , Diane Zeleny , is director of communications for Radio Free Europe , a position she was given after being on the receiving end of a grievance filed by the American Foreign Service Association in 2006 when she broke every rule in State Department assignments to obtain a godfathered appointment to head a media response center in Brussels .
Zeleny was allegedly a favorite of the redoubtable Karen Hughes , the self - styled soccer mom turned public diplomacy czarina whose gaffe - filled " listening tours " to the Muslim world were amusingly described in the world media .
Gerecht has been involved in trying to establish a neocon beachhead in Europe based in Prague , an effort that has produced several security conferences featuring celebrities such as Richard Perle .
Pletka approves of the torture of terrorist suspects , but Gerecht , as a former intelligence officer , has made a study of the practice and is heavily into its benefits .
Like many neocons , he is fond of the therapeutic effects of institutionalized violence but has never served in the military , preferring to leave the dirty work to others .
Unlike many of his neocon colleagues , Gerecht does speak Farsi and has some actual understanding of what is going on in the Middle East , though with the usual Likudist lean in terms of how he interprets developments .
It is astonishing that the New York Times would even print a piece advocating torture , but the article is just one more indication of the access that the neocons have to the nation ’s editorial pages .
Gerecht ’s " Out of Sight " argues that Barack Obama will undoubtedly recognize the utility of rendition , in which terrorism suspects are sent to their home countries to be interrogated , i.e. , tortured .
He sets his stage carefully , raising the specter of " the slaughter of civilians by Islamic holy warriors " and then posing a choice " between non-deniable aggressive questioning conducted by Americans and deniable torturous interrogations by foreigners acting on behalf of the United States . "
He dismisses the third option of non-coercive questioning of suspects , citing the imaginary , Jack Bauer - esque " ticking time bomb " scenario in which a terrorist has information that can stop an attack and " save thousands of civilians . "
Gerecht concludes by rejecting calls to close Guantanamo , because it would release an apparent horde of " enemy combatants " prepared to wreak havoc worldwide .
Curiously enough , in 2005 Gerecht was opposed to rendition .
He claimed in the Weekly Standard that torture is a useful interrogation tool , similar to his current position , and he also cited the ticking - bomb fantasy , but he insisted that the abuse be carried out by American interrogators rather than foreigners .
His preference was partly derived from his view that foreigners are intrinsically unreliable , but it was also shaped by his belief that the CIA should not be relinquishing control over potential sources of intelligence , or as Gerecht puts it , " willfully diminishing the flow of reliable information . "
The principal flaw in Gerecht ’s argument , if one might dignify it by calling it an argument , is that rendition and torture both are fallible processes that lack any mechanism to protect the innocent .
Fear of arbitrary action by government is why America ’s founders created a constitution that enshrined individual rights and liberties and why most Americans demand a rule of law with inbuilt safeguards , even for suspected terrorists .
That Bush and Cheney have managed to pervert the system and get away with it , a development that both Gerecht and Pletka applaud , does not change the fundamental moral and legal issues .
Nor is there any actual evidence that torture has ever saved anyone ’s life , much less " thousands of innocents . "
And it has not made the United States any safer .
Washington ’s torture of Muslims has created more enemies than friends around the world .
" Enhanced interrogation " can also lead to other abuses , including the mistreatment of American soldiers who are captured by militants who themselves have been tortured .
Selective use of torture lowers the bar for everyone .
Torture is disgraceful for the government and country that order it , and it dehumanizes the CIA officers called upon to do it .
Professional interrogators know that most people subjected to torture will say anything to stop the pain , meaning that the information obtained under duress just might not be reliable .
The process whereby one arrives in the torture chamber is also questionable .
It is not known how many of the hundreds of people rendered to other countries for torture were actually terrorists .
There are several well - documented cases of errors being made , and it has been suggested that very few renditions were justified , even if one accepts the perverted logic that established the rendition and torture programs in the first place .
One might also question Gerecht ’s presumption of the guilt of the prisoners at Guantanamo .
He assumes they are terrorists to justify keeping the offshore prison , but there is considerable evidence that many of the inmates were merely in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Ethically and legally there is also a long tradition of rejecting torture , which Gerecht and Pletka ignore in spite of the oft - repeated neocon insistence that policy be guided by " moral clarity . "
German and Japanese officers were executed after the Second World War for torturing prisoners , and the principle was firmly established that torture , including waterboarding , is a war crime .
The U.S. is signatory to the UN ’s anti-torture convention .
But then again , Nuremberg also determined a war of aggression to be the ultimate war crime , and since both Gerecht and Pletka embraced the invasion of Iraq and welcome yet another preemptive war against Iran , one presumes that they consider themselves to be above any conventional moral or legal restraint .
Gerecht and Pletka , both of whom are inordinately fond of Israel , should also note that the Israeli Supreme Court has banned torture , and the Shin Bet security service has discovered that interrogating prisoners without coercion actually produces more and better intelligence .
Many American interrogation experts would agree based on their own experience .
The most pathetic thing about neocons like Pletka and Gerecht is that they frame imposing arguments to sustain a worldview in which suffering inflicted on innocent people becomes an abstraction , like a model in a political science class , completely respectable and devoid of consequences .
One suspects that they can embrace torture because they know it wo n’t happen to them or to their friends hunkering down at their desks at AEI and FDD .
Only some hapless Arab or Afghan will get the chop , and what does it matter if he ’s innocent ?
Global warming may create " dead zones " in the ocean that would be devoid of fish and seafood and endure for up to two millennia , according to a study published on Sunday .
Its authors say deep cuts in the world 's carbon emissions are needed to brake a trend capable of wrecking the marine ecosystem and depriving future generations of the harvest of the seas .
In a study published online by the journal Nature Geoscience , scientists in Denmark built a computer model to simulate climate change over the next 100,000 years .
At the heart of their model are two well - used scenarios which use atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , the main greenhouse gas , as an indicator of temperature rise .
Under the worst scenario , CO2 concentrations would rise to 1,168 parts per million ( ppm ) by 2100 , or about triple today 's level .
The significance of media has been felt by all fields and it's being difficult to be kept out of sight these days .
As you read this , there are about 3,000 unionized workers -- down from about 15,000 two years ago -- employed by the Detroit 3 getting paid , despite the fact that they are n't working .
While it 's nice for America 's automakers to have access to a talent - pool of available workers , it 's also a major financial drain on an industry that 's already reeling from a distinct lack of profits .
And with new cutbacks and layoffs being announced almost daily , these " job banks " are increasingly tough to justify , even for the UAW .
It 's always been a bit of a competitive disadvantage , at least on paper , as non-UAW competitors like Honda Nissan and Hyundai do not keep such job banks .
To ease Detroit 's transition from bloated , money - losing corporations to lean " right - sized " competitors , UAW Prez .
Ron Gettelfinger has brought up the job banks and their possible elimination .
Will this be a part of the overall plan to become competitive that the Detroit 3 bring to Congress ?
We 'll find out soon enough .

Where Is Area 51 ?
Here 's how to find it & see the sights
Detroit
THIS week , as Washington has tried to decide whether to rescue the automobile industry , Americans have wondered what it looks like when a giant automobile company goes under .
The answer can be found in Detroit .
In the summer of 1956 , the once - mighty Packard Motor Car Company closed its doors .
Its headquarters and chief production complex still stand here , though , and their slowly decaying remains serve as a symbol for the fall of American manufacturing in general and the degradation of the auto industry in particular .
The Packard plant sits on East Grand Boulevard on Detroit ’s east side .
It is immense : 3.5 million square feet of space in 47 connected buildings .
The campus stretches for almost a mile north to south .
Since Packard ’s departure , there have been attempts to use the plant as an industrial mall , and at times dozens of small and medium - sized businesses operated within its walls .
Today there is only one small firm remaining , a chemical processing concern .
The City of Detroit and a private company have been fighting a long legal battle for ownership of the complex .
“ There ’s a counterintuitive motivation not to detect lies , or we would have become much better at it , ” said Angela Crossman , an assistant professor of psychology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice .
“ But you may not really want to know that the dinner you just cooked stinks , or even that your spouse is cheating on you . ”

The natural world is rife with humbug and fish tales , of things not being what they seem .
Harmless viceroy butterflies mimic toxic monarch butterflies , parent birds draw predators away from the nest by feigning a broken wing , angler fish lure prey with appendages that wiggle like worms .
Biologists distinguish between such cases of innate or automatic deception , however , and so - called tactical deception , the use of a normal behavior in a novel situation , with the express purpose of misleading an observer .
Tactical deception requires considerable behavioral suppleness , which is why it ’s most often observed in the brainiest animals .
Great apes , for example , make great fakers .
Frans B. M. de Waal , a professor at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center and Emory University , said chimpanzees or orangutans in captivity sometimes tried to lure human strangers over to their enclosure by holding out a piece of straw while putting on their friendliest face .
“ People think , Oh , he likes me , and they approach , ” Dr. de Waal said .
“ And before you know it , the ape has grabbed their ankle and is closing in for the bite .
It ’s a very dangerous situation . ”
Apes would n’t try this on their own kind .
“ They know each other too well to get away with it , ” Dr. de Waal said .
“ Holding out a straw with a sweet face is such a cheap trick , only a naïve human would fall for it . ”
Apes do try to deceive one another .
Chimpanzees grin when they ’re nervous , and when rival adult males approach each other , they sometimes take a moment to turn away and close their grins with their hands .
Similarly , should a young male be courting a female and spot the alpha male nearby , the subordinate chimpanzee will instantly try to cloak his amorous intentions by dropping his hands over his erection .
33 % of Consumers Want to Buy Greener Electronics
December 11th , 2008 by Jerry James Stone
[ social_buttons ]
According to Environmental Leader , via the Consumer Electronics Association ( CEA ) , thirty - three percent of consumers plan to buy greener gadgets over the next two years .
The report is based on an online survey of over 900 adults .
I wonder if any of them are mayors ?
The report shows that women are out - greening men , and that being eco-friendly is as important as cost .
The report also finds that 89 percent of people want their next TV to be more energy efficient .
One interesting find is that consumers desire an easier way to determine if products are certifiably green .
Well , if you ’re not finding the green gadget you want , create your own : Green Gadget Design Contest Offers $ 3 K Grand Prize .

Feds , Mormons denied radiation sickness downwind of 1950s Nevada nuclear tests [ audio 29min ]
In the early 1950s , life was peaceful in the almost exclusively Mormon community in the small town of St. George , Utah .
But then , radiation linked illnesses began to appear .
Families lost mothers and husbands , children died .
St. George and its people were the victims of radioactive dust , drifting over from atmospheric atomic tests , carried out in the Nevada desert .
Only in recent years has the government acknowledged weapons testing as the likely cause of killing or sickening civilians downwind .
The Justice Department started a compensation program that requires victims to prove they have a qualifying type of cancer and that they were residents of counties in southern Utah , Nevada , or Arizona .
Many victims have been compensated , but the money has run out and an estimated $ 70 million worth of claims are still unfulfilled .
Producer Wayne Brittenden of the British Broadcasting Corporation , talked to the ' downwinders ' and reports on the official cover - up by the U.S. government and the Mormon church .

Within five minutes , any intelligent , open - minded person can be convinced that the Holocaust gassings of World War II are a profitable hoax .
Fred A. Leuchter is America 's leading specialist on the design and fabrication of execution equipment , including homicidal gas chambers .
In 1988 , Leuchter scraped samples from the alleged gas chamber walls in Auschwitz , Birkenau and Lublin .
Cyanide residue would be clearly evident on all these walls if gassings did occur .
To his astonishment , Leuchter found no significant cyanide traces in any one of these rooms .
In 1991 , the Polish government repeated these tests to disprove Leuchter 's findings , but they as well found no evidence of any gassings ever occurring .
The structural integrity of these " gas chambers " is also extremely faulty .
These rooms have ordinary doors and windows which are not hermetically sealed !
There are large gaps between the floors and doors .
If the Germans had attempted to gas anyone in these rooms , they would have died themselves , as the gas would have leaked and contaminated the entire area .
Also , no equipment exists to exhaust the air - gas mixture from these buildings .
Nothing was made to introduce or distribute the gas throughout the chambers .
There are no provisions to prevent condensation of gas on the walls , floors or ceilings .
No exhaust stacks have ever existed .
Though six million Jews supposedly died in the gas chambers , not one body has ever been autopsied and found to have died of gas poisoning .
We have been shown piles of bodies from World War II , but most of these persons died of typhus or starvation or Allied bombings and a great many of those were murdered Germans , not Jews .
Roughly the equivalent of ten football fields should be packed full of gassed bodies to present as evidence , yet not one body has ever been discovered .
The Germans documented everything in meticulous detail from shrubbery to arbors , but no pre-war or wartime plans or documents exist that detail or even mention any gas chambers for reasons of genocide .
All documents ever presented were drawn up AFTER the war .
Even if we threw away all the evidence and accounted for every so - called gas chamber , it would have taken 68 YEARS to accomplish gassing six million Jews !
Even The Diary of Anne Frank is a hoax .
Portions of the diary were written with a ball point pen .
These pens were not in use at the time Anne Frank lived .
It is not denied concentration camps existed .
Tragically , many died of typhus or starvation , as often happens in such situations .
There is , however , no evidence that any gassings occurred for the reasons of genocide .
Israel continues to receive trillions of dollars worldwide as retribution for Holocaust gassings .
Our country has donated more money to Israel than to any other country in the history of the world over $ 35 billion per year , everything included .
If not for our extravagantly generous gifts to Israel , every family in America could afford a brand new Mercedes Benz .
Surely the American people would be outraged if they realized their hard - earned money is being squandered in these difficult times .
With all this money at stake for Israel , it is easy to comprehend why this Holocaust hoax is so secretly guarded .
The Jewish name for Holocaust is " Shoah . "
In Zionist circles , it is known as " Shoah Business . "
If nothing else , this unbelievable coverup demonstrates the irrepressible Zionist influence and control of our country .
Their only defense against the facts is to cry out " antisemitic , " " Skinhead " or " Nazi , " whereas the majority of those who question the Holocaust are ordinary citizens ... though you would never know it from the media .
In whatever way you can , please help shatter this profitable myth .
It is time we stop sacrificing America 's welfare for the sake of Israel and spend our hard - earned dollars on Americans .

Jewish wartime film producer .
There are compelling reasons to believe that the so - called holocaust never existed .
Page 223 , in The Diary of Anne Frank , ( Pan Horizons edition , Pan Books Ltd. , London , 1989 ) , indicates that the size of Auschwitz , the most notorious of all German work camps , WAS VERY SMALL , with only 11,000 people ( many of whom may not even have been Jews ) being evacuated by the Germans at the time of the Russian advance in 1945 .
Certainly , compared to Spielberg 's film , Schindler 's List ( which Emilie Schindler , Oskar 's widow , said was full of lies ) , and other Jewish propaganda , that millions upon millions of Jews were systematically exterminated , 11,000 people is a very small number .
Simple arithmetic tells us that the Germans would have had to have had hundreds of camps , or else they would have had to exterminate 137 people PER HOUR , in order for six million Jews to have been exterminated at such small camps as Auschwitz , a feat that would have been humanly impossible considering that , according to Douglas Reed 's Behind the Scene and The Controversy of Zion , a mere 850,000 soldiers and others were killed by the entire German and Japanese war machines combined during WW2 ( see p.397-400 of Douglas Reed 's book Controversy of Zion ) .
People who would believe the Jewish propaganda that six million Jews were exterminated by Hitler must KEEP IN MIND THE SMALL SCALE CONSTRUCTION OF AUSCHWITZ AND THE VERY FEW OTHER GERMAN WORK CAMPS THAT EXISTED DURING WW2 .
On July 13 , 1994 , a documentary on the life of Charles A. Lindbergh broadcast on the Public Broadcast System ( PBS - KENW - TV ) said that when Lindbergh visited one of these few camps in Germany following WW2 , he was told that 25,000 died in 1 - 1/ 2 years .
Again , simple arithmetic tells us that 25,000 times a half dozen camps does not equal 6,000,000 .
In fact , it does n't even equal 600,000 .
. . .
It is an interesting fact that the number of so - called persecuted Jews KEEPS INCREASING .
Hal Greenwald , program director for the Hillel Foundation at Duke University , a Jewish student group , has been promoting the idea that NINE MILLION JEWS WERE EXTERMINATED IN HITLER'S GAS CHAMBERS ( New York Times , Nov. 9 , 1991 , AP ) .
NOW IT'S 9 MILLION AND GROWING .
.. JUST LIKE OUR DEBT / TAX MONEY SUPPLY ... THE NUMBERS JUST KEEP COMING OUT OF THIN AIR .

The Holocaust Issue : Three Christian Views Christian Responsibility to Truth by Herman Otten
While most Revisionists appear to be opposed to the construction of the [ US government ]
Holocaust Museum in Washington , DC , right next to some of our nations 's most cherished monuments , I say : Let it be built !
One day it will serve as a monument to the stupidity of modern man , who can still accept a hoax as a fact .
Hopefully it will then serve as a reminder to study all the facts and evidence , and repudiate all hoaxes .
The day is surely coming when all the evidence showing that the Germans never exterminated six million Jews can no longer be suppressed .
Truth is not determined by majority vote .
I learned this lesson in high school , and since then have repeatedly discovered how the majority of scholars , even within our churches , can be in error .
That our presidents , senators and congressmen are all supposed to be convinced that the Germans killed six million Jews , that almost all of our nation 's professors and churchmen are said to maintain that the Holocaust is a fact , does n't make it a fact .
There is no dispute over the fact that large numbers of Jews were deported to concentration camps and ghettos , or that many Jews died or were killed during World War II .
Revisionist scholars have presented evidence , which " exterminationists " have not been able to refute , showing that there was no German program to exterminate Europe 's Jews , and that the estimate of six million Jewish wartime dead is an irresponsible exaggeration .
The Holocaust the alleged extermination of some six million Jews ( most of them by gassing ) is a hoax and should be recognized as such by Christians and all informed , honest and truthful men everywhere .
Here are the reasons that have impressed me as particularly persuasive in coming to my own conclusion that the Revisionist view of the Holocaust story is the correct one :
- There is no convincing or substantial evidence for the allegation of mass killings in gas chambers in the wartime German camps .
Careful investigation in particular that carried out by American engineer Fred Leuchter has thoroughly discredited the " gas chamber " extermination claims .
- The most reliable statistics available cannot be reconciled with the legendary " six million " figure .
The best evidence indicates that no more than a million , or perhaps a million and a half , European Jews perished from all causes during the war years .
- Neither the major Jewish organizations in the United States , nor the wartime Allied governments , nor the International Red Cross , nor the Vatican acted as if they seriously believed the wartime extermination propaganda .
- Although the German government kept extensive and detailed records of its wartime Jewish policy , not a single document has ever been found which substantiates or even refers to an extermination program or policy .
Instead , the voluminous German records confiscated by the Allies at the end of the war clearly show that the German " final solution " program was one of emigration and deportation , not extermination .
- Even prominent Jewish " exterminationist " historians now acknowledge that the stories of gassings and extermination in camps in Germany proper are not true , in spite of the fact that such claims were once seriously made , particularly at the great Nuremberg Trial of 1945 - 1946 .
- The Holocaust story now centers on just six former camps in Poland .
The so - called " evidence " presented to prove mass exterminations in these camps is qualitatively no better than the now discredited " evidence " once cited for extermination in the camps in Germany proper .
- Much of the so - called " evidence " presented by " exterminationists " over the years has already been thoroughly discredited .
For example , the well - known horrific photographs of piles of corpses taken in camps in western Germany at the end of the war are now acknowledged to be photos of victims of disease and malnutrition who perished as indirect victims of the war in the final weeks and months of the conflict .
Also , so - called " confessions " such as those of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Hoss have been shown to be untruthful and extracted by torture .
Many of the official reports and testimonies presented as " evidence " by the prosecution in the Nuremberg trials have since been shown to be lies .
- The fact that so many Jews " survived " German rule during the warmany of them even in so - called " extermination " centers such as Auschwitz - Birkenau is enough to show that there was no German program or policy to exterminate the Jews of Europe .
View of the swimming pool at Auschwitz ' Konzentrationslager ' Camp The Holocaust is a hoax .
The time has come for Christian scholars and pastors to recognize this , and to stop perpetrating a hoax as the truth .
A Christian is not free to believe and promote a lie about any person or nation .
True Christian scholars should at least read what the Revisionists write .
Many have said to us : " What difference does it make ?
The truth of the Holocaust is of no concern to Christians . "
Nonsense !
A Christian is not free to believe and promote a lie about any person or nation .
A Christian is guided by truth and facts , not emotions and majority opinion .
If Christians can accept as historical fact the Holocaust , despite all the powerful evidence that it is a hoax , what does that say about their ability to evaluate evidence ?
What about their scholarship ?
Is it any wonder that some Revisionists , who have made a careful study of the Holocaust , question the scholarship of Christians , so many of whom swallow as absolute truth what is clearly a hoax ?
I have been told numerous times , even by theologians who claim to be orthodox : " I do n't care whether it was six million or one Jew , even one is too many . "
Such an attitude shows contempt for the truth .
A Christian is to show true love , and the Apostle Paul tells us that love is " happy with the truth . "
( 1 Cor. 13:6 ) The writing of Proverbs tells us : " Speak out for those who can't speak , for the rights of those who are doomed .
Talk up , render fair decisions , and defend the rights of the poor and needy people . "
( Proverbs 31:9 )
A Christian bases his faith upon facts and absolute truth , not feelings and emotion .
A Christian recognizes that only God is all - knowing .
A Christian is willing to listen to evidence and evaluate various viewpoints .
He does n't close his mind to the facts and evidence .
He does n't start out with the assumption that the Jew is right and the German is wrong , or that the Jew is wrong and the German is right .
He looks at the evidence .
Those who say they do n't care if it was six million or one are showing a despicable attitude toward truth .
They are saying : " We do n't care about the truth . "
Such an attitude is sinful and worldly .
Is it any wonder that so many then go on to act as it they do n't care about another man 's wife or property ?
The truthfulness of the Holocaust is a moral issue .
Those who maintain that the Germans exterminated some six million Jews , most of them by gassing , are seeing to it that the Christian Church can no longer avoid speaking out .
Churches are being pushed , as never before , to have special services commemorating the Holocaust .
A Christian is ready to change his opinion if the evidence shows he is wrong .
Numerous times we have invited " exterminationists " to refute the Revisionists .
Some tell us that we have not shown love to the Jews , and that we are being racists and anti-Semitic when we publish articles by Revisionists questioning the Holocaust , and when we insist that Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven .
We have repeatedly emphasized in many editorials that the Bible teaches that there is no special chosen race .
All those regardless of color , race , nationality , sex , wealth , et ceterawho trust in the merits of Jesus Christ alone for their salvation are God 's chosen people and will go to heaven .
Those who tell Jews , Muslims , and any other non-Christian that they worship the true God , and can get to heaven without Christ , are not showing true love to the Jews and other non-Christians .
The so - called " fact " of the Holocaust is being used to deport innocent men from this country who , as teenagers , served with the German armed forces .
In some cases they have been sent back to certain death in Communist lands .
The [ US government 's ]
Office of Special Investigation is using the Holocaust as an excuse to force from the United States even such a reputable person as the scientist Arthur Rudolph .
Israel is using the " fact " of the Holocaust as an excuse to execute John Demjanjuk , an innocent Ukrainian - American .
" The Jewish people have a long score to settle with the Ukrainian people " says Dov Ben -Meir , a deputy speaker of Israel 's Knesset [ parliament ] .
According to this top Israeli official , " unaccounted numbers " of Ukrainians " collaborated with the Nazi regime , especially in the annihilation of hundreds of thousands of Jews . "
The " fact " of the Holocaust is being used by some to deny that Christianity is the only true religion , or that Jesus Christ rose from the dead .
Israel is using the " fact " of the Holocaust as an excuse to kill Palestinians in Israel .
This slaughter , together with the anti-scriptural notions of the Israel - first Millennialists , almost all of whom believe in the Holocaust , could lead to another bloody war .
The Holocaust is not some innocent hoax , such as children 's fairy tales that entertain and have no evil consequences .
The " chosen people " and " Holocaust " myths make mission work among non-Christians far more difficult .
Arabs , who are told that the Bible teaches that their land belongs to the Jews , find it more difficult to believe what the Bible says about Christ .

Celebrating Hannakkak at Westerbork ' Konzentrationslager ' Camp , in Holland " Victims Deserve Better " by Joseph Sobran
I have n't been to the new United States Holocaust Memorial Museum , but even a Washington Post reporter was shocked by what he describes its " outrageous " anti-Christian propaganda .
The exhibition apparently dates anti-Semitism from the birth of Christ .
And of course the implication of the Museum is that mass murder is worse when its victims are Jews .
Some surprisingly critical notes have been struck in the reviews of the Museum .
Kay Larson , art critic for New York magazine , objects that " the Germans depicted here . . . are almost exclusively Nazis . . .
Most American children who endure the walk - through will think of Germans as Nazi pigs . "
She continues :
The Jews endured the most dementedly calculated and well - documented but hardly the only case .
To separate the Nazi evil from other evils is understandable but Eurocentric .
It trivializes all suffering but its own .
. .
It awards special , extra -human stature to the victims .
Nothing that occurs inside Israel can be wrong , because Jews were gassed at Auschwitz .
And so people set themselves apart from , against , and above others .
She has caught the note of most Holocaust rhetoric : intense self - absorption .
This is a human reaction , and it can be excused up to a point .
That point comes when those whose rights have been violated begin disregarding others ' rights , as when Jewish apologists for Israel feel persecuted by criticism of Israel 's brutality toward non-Jews .
Even many pro-Israel Jews feel uneasy about the Museum being in America , on government land , paid for with tax money .
The implication of its presence is that all Gentiles , especially Christians , need to be instructed , to have their consciousness raised , even to be made to feel guilty about Jewish suffering .
As if we did n't know that murder and persecution are wrong !
As if Israel were a moral model for *us *!
In the same way , the implication of the word " anti-Semitism " is that the chief moral test for anyone is whether he has the correct attitude toward Jews .
And again , this is understandable  but also very narrow .
Murdering Ukrainians is every bit as evil as murdering Jews , after all .
But why should we even have to say that ?
The wrong lesson is being drawn .
You would think that the evil of Hitler was mere anti-Semitism as such , rather than mass murder .
But if anti-Semitism were confined to country - club snobbery , even Jews would n't mind it too much .
The real evil is the use of the state as an instrument of death .
Government , perverted from it modest uses , can magnify every crime unimaginably .
That is the real " lesson of the Holocaust , " the lesson our time still refuses to learn .
We think it 's only the Hitler or Stalin version of the superstate that is wrong .
But think how America 's conduct in World War II would have appeared to our ancestors .
It 's hard for us to feel the sheer monstrosity of bombing cities .
I recently heard some interesting testimony on this point .
During that war the US government commissioned a series of propaganda films from Frank Capra , which were made under the collective title " Why We Fight . "
One of them , " The Battle for China , " describes the barbarity of the " Japs , " also called " Nips , " and mocked them for their " grinning yellow faces . "
Among the horrors perpetrated by the Japs was the unprecedented atrocity of bombing cities , killing civilians by the thousands !
Of course Capra and his staff did n't know that the US government was planning to do exactly that to Japanese and German cities .
In their innocence , they assumed that only a savage , alien race could have stooped to such barbarism .
But we have supped full with horrors .
Evil bores us .
Its statistical extremes have long since lost their interest , and there is something ritually formulaic in the demands that we profess belief in , and abhorrence toward , Nazi and Communist abominations .
" Holocaust denial " has become the big thought crime , denounced by Christians who are quite tolerant of those who deny the Redemption .
No similar opprobrium , by the way , attaches to Gulag denial .
After all , nobody who really believes a thing wants to force others to profess belief in it .
Sincerity never demands hypocrisy .
Even the word " Holocaust " has come to seem a polemical appropriation of human suffering that verges on the indecent .
I remember an old Jewish woman I slightly knew who had a number tattooed on her wrist .
That told me all I needed to know about Hitler , and it would be pedantic to wonder whether a regime that was willing to brand Jews like cattle meant to kill them all .
But it would have seemed morally crass to call what that woman had been through as a girl " the Holocaust " :
It 's beginning to sound like a brand name , of special utility to glib hawkers .
All the victims of World War II , including Jews , deserve more respect than that .

" Examine All the Evidence " by Louis Vezelis
On April 22 , 1993 , an ugly , monstrous edifice was dedicated in Washington , DC .
It is a grotesque museum dedicated to the victims of evil .
The only problem is that the majority of people throughout the world have been conditioned like Pavlovian dogs to react irrationally to predetermined stimuli .
Those who refuse are summarily isolated from the rest of the dehumanized human herd through use of meaningless but emotionally - charged epithets .
It is quite easy to observe which newspapers are subservient to this modern day hoax .
The subject is the so - called " Holocaust Museum " built on public land " generously " donated by the US government ...
Insulting terminology in an editorial appearing in the left - wing , pro-Zionist , anti-Christian Democrat and Chronicle [ newspaper of Rochester , New York ] introduces the reader to the most obvious abuse of logic and good taste .
But , logic and good taste have systematically been expunged from the American mind during a period of more than thirty years .
Well - informed American citizens demonstrated [ in Washington , DC , on April 22 ] against the historically false accusations constantly made against the German people and other nationalities whose only real crime was resisting the international gangsters who facetiously call their brand of exploitation " Communism . "
The Democrat and Chronicle editorial starts out :
The mindless folks who were waving signs at the opening of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , DC , last week claiming that the Holocaust never happened merely demonstrate why the museum is so important : to preserve the facts , before they disappear in the mists of history .
These " mindless folks " include none other than well - educated professors and professional historians , investigative reporters and , in general , are among the most descent people of a civilized society .
It is their * right and duty * to examine all the evidence , and draw the truthful conclusions concerning what really happened in history .
There is already a strong indication that those who promote the Holocaust story are afraid of the truth .
That can only explain the need for ridiculing those who seek only to present the entire matter before an open world forum of unbiased and unprejudiced investigators .
Because the preponderance of objective and factual evidence shows the promoters of the Holocaust story to be libelous frauds , sneak tactics and irrational emotionalism must be used .
We are concerned for the truth .
Only those who are not of the truth must resort to lies and bloodshed .
Facts by themselves do not constitute truth .
Truth is in the judgment . . .
The Hollywood cosmetics exploiting the unfortunate victims of death do not prove anything .
For example , to film or photograph dead bodies , and then label them according to one 's political need is a travesty of justice and truth beyond the capability of morally responsible individuals .
Facts must be correctly interpreted before they can tell something of truth .
Another example is the famous " Anne Frank Diary " which has been foisted upon the American people at all levels .
We all wept at the Hollywood tear - jerker action on the silver screen .
Decent people reacted as expected by the unscrupulous falsifiers of fact .
It has come to the attention of more and more people that this diary is a fraud .
Yes , it has been proven to be fake .
Public school facilities are periodically used to foist this fraud upon unsuspecting citizenry to re-enforce the psychological brainwashing .
Anne Frank was not fake :
She really did live .
But everything else about her life is a melodramatic , money - making operation to overwhelm the world with hatred for a nation .
. .
No one says anything comparable about the children brutally murdered by the Soviets when they occupied the Baltic States in 1940 , and Germany in 1945 .
A French Professor whose love for truth is greater than his love for fame and life , Robert Faurisson , has proven that the alleged " diary " of Anne Frank could not have been written by her . . .
While the American people are being lulled into very dangerous apathy by being fed psycho- babble , a real holocaust , including child murder , is taking place every day in occupied Palestine .
. .
Could it be that someone is trying to put a guilt complex on the American people so they will not dare raise a loud voice of protest against greater evils ?

Children in Belsen ' Konzentrationslager '
Camp , 1945
from BBC documentary " In the Camps " You Have a Right to Know the Truth !
David Irving : Intrepid Battler for Historical Truth by Mark Weber
Soviet premier Nikita Kruschev might have had David Irving in mind when he once warned that historians are dangerous because they have the power to upset everything .
German Chancellor
Otto von Bismarck once said that the main thing is not to write history , but to make it .
Irving is a man who has been able to do some of both .
He is also living proof that the life of a historian need not be dull .
The leftist British daily The Guardian once commented , " If one can overlook his outrageously odious views , Irving like Hitlercan be a funny man .
The humor comes from a hint of self - mockery and an obvious delight in making liberal flesh creep . "
At the Eleventh IHR Conference in October 1992 as he had in his presentations at the IHR Conferences of 1983 , 1989 and 1990 this good friend of the Institute for Historical Review not only shed new light on important chapters of twentieth - century history , he delighted attendees with humorous updates on some of the new ways he had found to make liberal flesh creep .
In the three decades since he published his first book , Irving has firmly established himself as not only one of the most successful and widely - read historians of our time , but also as one of the most courageous .
He has an enviable track record of uncovering startling new facts about even supposedly well - known episodes of history .
His effectiveness is due in very large measure to his discovery of original source materials , such as diaries , original documents , and so forth , from both official and private sources .
He is tenacious in his ceaseless digging in just about every important historical archive in the western world .
A professional historian , Irving has little respect for taxpayer - financed scholars who are guilty of what he calls " inter - historian incest , " and who thereby help to keep alive dangerous myths and legends left over from wartime propaganda .
His first work , The Destruction of Dresden , was published in 1963 when he was 25 years old .
Since then , he has published more than two dozen books , many of them best - sellers , including biographies of Hermann Goring , Winston Churchill , and Erwin Rommel .
He is currently at work on a biography of Joseph Goebbels .
Several of Irving 's books have appeared in various languages , and several have been serialized in prominent periodicals , including the Sunday Express , the Sunday Telegraph and Der Spiegel .
Over the years , he has also contributed articles to some 60 British and foreign periodicals , including the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Express in London , the Mainichi Shimbun in Tokyo , and Stern and Der Spiegel in Hamburg .
Irving 's reputation first came under vicious attack following the publication in 1977 of Hitler 's War , a monumental work that was hysterically criticized for its contention that Hitler did not order the extermination of Europe 's Jews .
The mass killings must have been carried out by Himmler and his cohorts behind Hitler 's back , Irving concluded at that time .
As a journalist for Time magazine once told him , " Until Hitler 's
War you could n't put a foot wrong , you were the darling of the media .
After it , they heaped slime on you . "
So enraged was the Zionist Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith by this book that the shadowy organization promptly added his name to its ever - growing list of enemies .
As it turned out , the ADL 's troubles with Irving were only just beginning .
The international campaign against him became even more vicious following the publication in 1981 of Uprising , a history of the 1956 anti-Communist revolt in Hungary .
This book enraged the ADL crowd because it does not whitewash the significant Jewish role in the Hungarian Communist regime .
Irving has made several highly successful speaking and promotion tours in Germany , Canada , Australia , South Africa , the United States , and other countries .
German listeners in particular delight in hearing an Englishman say out loud what many in that country believe in their souls but have been intimidated into keeping to themselves .
In Germany , Irving has become a kind of conscience for a people who have been largely robbed of their own .
A startling climax in the second " Holocaust Trial " of Ernst Zundel in 1988 was the testimony of Irving , who was the last of 23 defense witnesses .
He stunned the completely packed Toronto courtroom by announcing that he had changed his mind about the Holocaust story .
During his three days on the stand , he explained in detail why he now endorses the Revisionist view of the extermination story .
In June 1989 , Irving published the British edition of The Leuchter Report .
This handsome , illustrated edition , for which he wrote a foreword , was launched by him at a press conference in London .
He told the journalists there that the infamous extermination gas chambers of Auschwitz and Majdanek did not exist , except , perhaps , as the brainchild invention of Britain 's wartime propaganda bureau , the Political Warfare Executive ( PWE ) .
A magnificent 860 - page Focal Point edition of Hitler 's War was published last year .
Taking account of his most recent research and insights , references to so - called " extermination camps " have been removed from this revised edition .
And in his introduction , Irving deftly tears apart one historical legend after another .
This work the product of decades of patient research and writing has proven particularly enraging to the enemies of truth in history .
In addition to the usual lies , his adversaries have even turned to criminal burglary and arson in their fitful and frantic efforts to silence him .
Not long ago , an official of the American Jewish Committee , a certain Kenneth S. Stern , declared that Irving " NEVER has been considered a serious historian . "
( The Oregonian , Portland , Oct. 7 , 1992 ) .
That is simply a baldfaced lie .
In fact , Irving 's remarkable abilities have been acknowledged by some of the most prominent names in the field .
British historian Hugh Trevor - Roper , writing in the Sunday Times of London , once declared , " No praise can be too high for Irving 's indefatigable scholarly industry . "
Trevor - Roper also called Irving one of the " few guides I would entirely trust . . . indefatigable in pursuit of the evidence , fearless in face of it , sound in judgment . . . "
Another prominent British historian , A. J. P. Taylor , once wrote of him : " David Irving is a patient researcher of unrivalled industry and success . "
David John Cawdell Irving was born in Hutton , Essex , England , on March 24 , 1938 , the son of an illustrator and Royal Navy commander .
His father and mother were both well - known writers .
After a liberal arts education at the four - century - old Sir Anthony Browne 's school in Brentwood , Essex , young Irving won a scholarship to study physics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London .
It did not take long , though , for him to realize that his life 's calling would not be in the hard sciences .
In 1959 he moved to Germany 's industrial Ruhr region to spend a year working in a steel mill to perfect his fluency in German .
Then , after a stint working as a clerk - stenographer with the US Strategic Air Command at an airbase near Madrid , he returned to England to study political economy at London 's University College .
Irving speaks fluent German , very good Spanish , and quite passable French , and reads several other languages .
On a personal note , he is the father of four daughters .
His hobbies are oil painting , travel , and cinematography , and his favorite song is the English naval hymn , " For Those in Peril of the Sea . "
He lives in the Mayfair district of London 's West End , although in recent years has spent quite a lot of time at a south Florida retreat , where he now prefers to do his serious writing .
You 'd need a pickup truck to carry away all the newspaper and magazine clippings that have appeared over the years about Irving .
In January 1992 , for example , a flurry of reports appeared in newspapers and television broadcasts around the world suggesting that he had abandoned his highly skeptical view of the Holocaust extermination story because of what he had found in the postwar " memoir " of Adolf Eichmann , the German SS officer who coordinated the wartime deportations of Jews .
Had Irving defected from the Revisionist camp ?
In the wake of this uproar , he told the IHR : " My position remains unchanged . "
There were " certain My - Lai- type atrocities " by German troops in the occupied Soviet territories , but the " gas chambers and factories of death are legend , " and there is no wartime evidence of an order by Hitler to exterminate the Jews .
In an interview at the time with the London Jewish Chronicle ( January 17 , 1992 ) , Irving said , " The Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time . "
Last May , a German court fined Irving 10,000 marks about $ 6,000 for public statements he had made challenging the Holocaust story .
His crime ?
At a meeting in Munich in 1990 , Irving had said that the building in the Auschwitz main camp that has been portrayed for years as an extermination gas chamber is a phony reconstruction ( or , in German , " Attrappen " ) .
The Munich district court refused to permit the defense to present even a single witness or exhibit .
For example , it would not permit Irving 's attorneys to call as a witness the director of the Auschwitz State Museum , Dr. Franciszek Piper , who has privately confirmed on several occasions that what Irving had told the meeting in 1990 is , in fact , the truth .
After his attorneys dramatically walked out of the courtroom to protest the judge 's outrageous rulings , Irving delivered a stirring plea for truth and justice that has since been widely circulated in Germany on audio cassette and as a leaflet .
( For more on this trial , see the July - August 1992 IHR Newsletter ) .
Also last year , Irving played the key and highly publicized role in bringing to light the long - suppressed diaries of Third Reich propaganda chief Dr. Joseph Goebbels .
Last July , the London Sunday Times , one of the world 's most influential papers , published extensive translated excerpts from the diary , which Irving found and transcribed .
( See report in the October 1992 IHR Newsletter ) .
International and British Jewish organizations lost no time in attacking the paper for employing Irving , and the resulting furor made headlines in newspapers and magazines around the world .
A report in the London Jewish Chronicle headlined " Sunday Times comes under pressure " ( July 17 , 1992 ) , described the extent of the campaign to punish the paper for its collaboration with Irving .
Officials of the American Jewish Committee added their voices to the worldwide pressure campaign , expressing particular anger because the historian has addressed several IHR conferences .
The Sunday Times capitulated , and in breach of contract , refused to pay Irving the agreed - upon fee of 83,000 pounds .
He is suing .
On July 3 , more than 300 Jewish demonstrators gathered outside Irving 's London residence to denounce him .
The next day , July fourth ( by the way , the ninth anniversary of the devastating 1984 arson attack against the IHR office - warehouse ) , a larger crowd of several hundred met at the same place to shout more insults .
Among the banners carried by the crowd of Marxists , Jews , homosexuals and Rastafarians were placards reading " Return to the Road of Lenin and Trotsky ! , " and " Build a Bolshevik Party , Tribune of All the Oppressed ! "
That same day , though , about 250 persons defied intimidation and threats to hear and cheer Irving and other speakers at a Revisionist seminar in London .
Besides Irving , the audience heard addresses by Kirk Lyons , Leuchter 's US attorney , and Georgia attorney Sam Dickson ( who addressed the 1986 IHR conference ) .
In all this , it is gratifying to note that it is a Revisionist historian who was once again at the forefront of historical discovery .
In spite of the well - organized international campaign to boycott and silence him , David Irving remains at the vanguard of his profession and , by the way , SOLELY on the basis of his indisputable knowledge , skill and industry .
It is also gratifying to realize that , as a result of each of those recent controversies , hundreds of thousands if not millions of newspaper and magazine readers around the world are now aware that a historian of recognized international stature rejects critical aspects of the orthodox Holocaust extermination story .

The AntiI-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith : Trapped in a Nazi Fantasyland by Bradley R. Smith
Marvin Stern , director for the Northwest regional branch of the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) , can't conceal his bewilderment over what he calls " the growing Holocaust revisionist movement . "
Mr. Stern expressed his dismay in a column published in The Oregonian , the largest - circulation daily in the Northwest .
His alarm was triggered by the appearance in that newspaper of our ad , " A Revisionist 's View of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum . "
He lays the blame for the growing influence of revisionism on the " ignorance " and " anti-semitism " of Americans .
He appears not to understand that he 's charging tens of millions of American citizens with being ignorant , anti-Jewish bigots ( a recent Roper poll reported 20 to 30 percent of adult Americans doubt they are being told the truth about the Holocaust story ) .
Spokesmen for the ADL have propagandized themselves into an empty intellectual corner .
Having refused to judge revisionist research on its merits , refusing still to admit that revisionists have any substantive arguments whatever , refusing debate or even an exchange of civility , the ADL 'ers are left with no intellectual tools to work with but invective , misrepresentation , slander , and a sickly dependence on playing their " nazi " card .
One result of this intellectually and psychologically stunted behavior is that many ADL - ers appear to be obsessed with nazis and nazism , neo -nazis , intimations of nazism , rumors about nazis and crazy nazi conspiracies to rehabilitate Adolf 's reputation .
Some ADL'ers , Stern appearing to be one of them , live in an imaginary nazi wonderland where they fantasize armies of nazis marching toward them from distant horizons , singing songs of conquest , whips in hand , about to leap through the ADL office window to lash the hapless drudges inside and mistreat them sexually .
Such fantasies must be traumatizing for those who suffer them , but to others they can appear comic and infantile .
The text of my ad , which prompted Stern 's response , makes at least two claims which admittedly are controversial .
It asserts that the Holocaust Museum exhibits no proof that homicidal gas chambers existed anywhere in Europe , and no proof that even one child , woman or man was " gassed " at any German camp liberated by the Allies .
I flew to Washington , toured the Museum , and that 's my assessment of its exhibits .
Mr. Stern writes that the best response to the " outrageous lies " of revisionism , that is , the text of my ad about the Museum , is to " reiterate the truth " and " repeat the facts . "
It 's good advice , but Stern avoids it like the plague .
Instead , he reveals the common ADL self - serving obsession with hate movements growing like cancers in American society .
He does n't even try to assure his readers that the Museum does , in fact , exhibit proof of one gas chamber or one victim of a gas chamber .
Why ?
The Marvin Sterns and the ADL face a conundrum .
They can continue to rail with empty irrationalism against legitimate revisionist research and watch the number of Americans who are increasingly unsure what to believe about the Holocaust story increase year after year .
Or they can turn to the orthodox scholars in the field for help in responding to revisionist questions .
That would be the adult thing to do .
The ADL 'ers however , true to form , have chosen to do the childish thing to substitute schoolyard insults for a grown - up exchange of ideas .
Stern 's article in The Oregonian ran under the head , " Holocaust Revisionists Should Be Challenged , Repudiated With Truth . "
Marvin and I are in complete agreement on this one .
Do it !
Challenge the claims in my ad with truth !
That has always been what I 've asked for .
It 's my invitation to the ADL 'ers and my challenge to them and to all others .
Respond to my ads with truth .
I do n't EVER want to run an ad that contains an inadvertent error of fact .
Why do the Marvin Sterns talk about repudiating revisionism with " truth " and always evade doing so ?
Here 's my guess .
While revisionists almost certainly are not right about everything , we 're not wrong about everything either .
No one is wrong about everything !
That 's what terrifies Marvin Stern and his ADL buddies .
The day they admit the possibility that revisionists are not wrong about everything , their psychological world will collapse .
They 'll have admitted that revisionists are human beings , that we eat our soup with a spoon just like they do .
And there 's the rub .
The ADL - ers can't afford to admit that revisionists are ordinary men and women that is , human beings .
The ADL committed itself to its nazi devil fantasy half a century ago and has ridden it so long so successfully it can't get off , no matter how broken down and exhausted the old nag is .
Marvin Stern is probably a nice guy .
He 's probably a smart guy .
When a smart guy goes over the line and becomes a true believer it 's almost impossible for him to change his mind .
When a true believer changes his mind he becomes an apostate .
He feels like a traitor .
A dumb guy can just change his mind and go about his business .
A smart guy who 's become a true believer has to work out a theory explaining how , being so smart , he could have believed something so dumb so long .
It 's not easy .
I know .
Marvin , I used to believe everything about the Holocaust story you believe now .
It 's not a sin to be wrong .
It 's human .
You have a theory you believe is true , I have a theory I think is true .
Let 's talk things over .
You know how it goes .
I listen to you .
You listen to me .
We have a beer .
We settle the world 's problems .

Holocaust Revisionists should be Challenged , Repudiated with Truth
by Marvin Stern
The changes in the world over the last five years have been breath - taking .
If anyone sought to deny the facts of the fall of the Berlin Wall , the crumbling of South African apartheid , the anti-Iraq coalition in the Persian Gulf War , the historic handshake on the White House lawn , he would be met with ridicule or ignored as a fool .
How then to explain the growing Holocaust revisionism movement , spearheaded by the California - based Institute for Historical Review founded by longtime anti-Semite Willis Carto of the Liberty Lobby to deny history 's most fully documented atrocity ?
There are two answers : the danger of ignorance and the power of anti-Semitism .
Consider how Holocaust denial reflects traditional anti-Semitic themes .
Typically , anti-Semites charge Jews with too much power , with conspiratorial control of events and institutions .
The best - known illustration of this is " The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion , " the notorious turn - of - the - century forgery .
Distributors of Holocaust - denial literature spread this hoax as well .
Deniers describe the Holocaust as a myth concocted by Jews to extract sympathy , money , and moral carte blanche ; they portray the Holocaust and the Nuremberg Trials as conspiracies to promote Jewish power and influence .
When Holocaust revisionists dispute the facts of the Nazi genocide , they are attacking what they assert is the Jewish stranglehold on academia , the media and international politics .
Another motive behind far - right efforts to deny the Holocaust is the rehabilitation of the reputation of Nazism and its leaders .
A third goal is to undermine the legitimacy of the state of Israel .
Indeed , revisionists have often referred to the Holocaust as Zionist propaganda .
How to respond to such outrageous lies ?
First , reiterate the truth .
Repeat the facts they are clear , hideous and plentiful as often as necessary .
Education is crucial .
The following noteworthy development at a major campus is instructive :
When the campus newspaper at Duke University published a large advertisement by Holocaust deniers , the university 's History Department published a unanimous rebuttal , criticizing the paper for treating such garbage as legitimate analysis .
" As historians , " they wrote , " we deplore this effort to use the language of scholarship to distort and obliterate an event which to our everlasting shame did occur .
We urge all members of the ( campus ) community to treat such advertisements with the contempt they deserve . "
In addition , we must demand the same sense of moral courage and principle from other intellectual and political leaders in the face of this hate movement masquerading as scholarship .
Otherwise it will continue to grow like an untreated cancer .
Clearly , today 's extremists are more subtle , deceptive and technologically sophisticated .
The Institute for Historical Review publishes a journal and holds conventions to mimic the formalities of legitimate learning .
Resourceful racists , anti-Semites and xenophobic haters around the world are using sanitized and computerized campaigns to exploit controversial social issues , to gain access to national debates , and to influence an all - too - often uninformed public .
In response to this propaganda , measures to preserve the memory of Adolf Hitler 's victims have taken on a new importance .
The Anti-Defamation League 's work in this regard includes the activities of the Braun Center for Holocaust Studies , the Jewish Foundation for Christian Rescuers and the Hidden Child Foundation , our yearly Holocaust symposium for high school students and teachers held in conjunction with the Oregon Holocaust Resource Center at Portland State University , as well as curriculum materials used in hundreds of school systems .
But a largely uninformed new generation presents Holocaust revisionists with an opportunity to exploit .
An increasing distance separates this generation from the events of World War II .
As the survivors pass from the scene , and as hollow comparisons proliferate , the danger posed by ignorance about the Holocaust grows .
We know that an awareness of the past is crucial to understanding its consequences in the present , and avoiding its tragedies in the future .
Understanding and communicating the uniqueness of the doctrines and methods through which the Nazis implemented their destructive agenda are crucial steps toward ensuring that such horror never recurs .
The task of the decent majority is to safe - guard historical memory , and to educate our neighbors and future generations against lies , hatred and the blandishments of evil .

A Revisionist 's View of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museumin Washington , D.C.
by Bradley R. Smith
After ten years in the planning , $ 165 million in start - up costs and a government guarantee of tens of millions more in tax subsidies , the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum demonstrates why , according to a Roper Organization poll , 22 percent ( some 25 millions ! ) of all adult Americans have doubts about the orthodox Holocaust story .
What are the facts ?
The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum displays no proof anywhere of homicidal " gassing " chambers and no proof that even ONE INDIVIDUAL was " gassed " at any camp liberated by Allied armies .
" Proof " for a gas chamber at Birkenau is a plastic model created by a Polish ARTISTE .
A plastic copy of a metal door is displayed as " proof " of a homicidal gas chamber at Maidanek .
And , INCREDIBLY , the Museum has simply " dropped " the Auschwitz gas chamber , the basement room visited yearly by hundreds of thousands of tourists in Poland .
There is no mention of the alleged gas chambers at Buchenwald or even at Dachau , where after World War Two American G.I.s and German civilians were assured that more than 200,000 victims were " gassed and burned . "
Human soap ?
Human skin lamp shades ?
Not a sign of them in this Museum .
These monstrous lies are now all gone straight down the memory hole !
The notion that eyewitness testimony given under highly politicized and emotional circumstances , which this museum relies so heavily on , is , PRIMA FACIE , true , was refuted by the Israeli Supreme Court when it acquitted John Demjanjuk of being " Ivan the Terrible . "
The Israeli Court found that the eyewitnesses who testified against Demjanjuk could not be believed !
Deborah Lipstadt argues in her much - praised Denying the Holocaust , that revisionists [ " deniers " ] should not be debated because there " can not be " another side to the Holocaust story .
She charges that it is " hateful " to listen to a defense of those accused of mass murder !
In essence , she argues that we bury America 's old civil virtues of free inquiry and open debate but to what end ?
The Deborah Lipstadts and there is a clique of them on every campus work to suppress revisionist research and demand that students and faculty ape their fascist behavior .
If you refuse to accept the Lipstadt clique as your intellectual FUHRERS , you risk being slandered as an " anti-semite . "
These quasi religious Holocaust zealots claim that because of the " purity " of their own feelings about the Jewish experience during World War Two , yours are soiled if you doubt what they preach as " truth . "
Winston Churchill , in his massive six-volume history of World War Two , and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his memoirs , both omitted all reference to " gas chambers " and their use in an alleged " genocide " of the Jews .
How do the Museum and the Deborah Lipstadts explain that ?
To many it will appear impossible that deception on such a grand scale can actually be taking place .
Yet such deception is not unusual in the realms of politics , ideology or religion .
We are being deceived for one reason , and one reason only we have refused to listen to the other side of the story .
The Operation and Technique of the Museum
The Museum 's exhibit technique is a mixture of sinister suggestion and dishonest omission .
The first display confronting visitors beginning the Museum tour is a wall - sized photograph of American soldiers looking at corpses smoldering on a pyre .
The " context " in which you see the photo suggests that the dead are " exterminated " Jews .
But were the prisoners killed or did they die of typhus or some other disease during the last terrible weeks of the war ?
Autopsies made by Allied medical personnel found that inmates died of disease .
Not one was found to have been " gassed . "
ALL SUCH RELEVANT INFORMATION IS PURPOSELY OMITTED FROM THE EXHIBIT .
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE DEAD PICTURED IN THE PHOTO ARE JEWS !
Unable to judge the significance of the photograph , and not wanting to believe the Museum would mislead you , you are moved to accept the false and manipulative suggestion that it represents the " genocide " of the Jews .
THE LAST BARRIER
Academic bureaucrats , career - driven professors and an opulent Holocaust Lobby of self - described intellectual " giants " are those who form the last barrier against a free exchange of ideas .
It is childish and dishonest to insinuate that open debate is " dangerous " to the Jewish community .
Do n't believe it !
Open debate BENEFITS Jews and Gentiles alike for precisely the same reasons !

THE HOLOCAUST CONTROVERSY : The Case For Open Debate
by Bradley R. Smith
THE CONTEMPORARY ISSUE
No subject enrages campus Thought Police more than Holocaust Revisionism .
We debate every other great historical issue as a matter of course , but influential pressure groups with private agendas have made the Holocaust story an exception .
Elitist dogma manipulated by special interest groups corrupts everything in academia .
Students should be encouraged to investigate the Holocaust story the same way they are encouraged to investigate every other historical event .
This is n't a radical point of view .
The premises for it were worked out centuries ago during a little something called the Enlightenment .
THE HISTORICAL ISSUE
Revisionists agree with establishment historians that the German National Socialist State singled out the Jewish people for special and cruel treatment .
In addition to viewing Jews in the framework of traditional anti-Semitism , the Nazis also saw them as being an influential force behind international communism .
During the Second World War , Jews were considered to be enemies of the State and a potential danger to the war effort , much like the Japanese were viewed in this country .
Consequently , Jews were stripped of their rights , forced to live in ghettos , conscripted for labor , deprived of their property , deported from the countries of their birth and otherwise mistreated .
Many tragically perished in the maelstrom .
Revisionists part company with establishment historians in that Revisionists deny that the German State had a policy to exterminate the Jewish people ( or anyone else ) by putting them to death in gas chambers or killing them through abuse or neglect .
Revisionists also maintain that the figure of 6 million Jewish deaths is an irresponsible exaggeration , and that no execution gas chambers existed in any camp in Europe which was under German control .
Fumigation gas chambers did exist to delouse clothing and equipment to prevent disease at the camps .
It is very likely that it was from this life - SAVING procedure that the myth of extermination gas chambers emerged .
Revisionists generally hold that the Allied governments decided to carry their wartime " black propaganda " of German monstrosity over into the postwar period .
This was done for essentially three reasons .
First , they felt it necessary to continue to justify the great sacrifices that were made in fighting two world wars .
A second reason was that they wanted to divert attention from and to justify their own particularly brutal crimes against humanity which , apart from Soviet atrocities , involved massive incendiary bombings of the civilian populations of German and Japanese cities .
The third and perhaps most important reason was that they needed justification for the postwar arrangements which , among other things , involved the annexation of large parts of Germany into Poland .
These territories were not disputed borderlands but included huge parts of Germany proper .
The millions of Germans living in these regions were to be dispossessed of their property and brutally expelled from their homelands .
Many hundreds of thousands were to perish in the process .
A similar fate was to befall the Sudetan Germans .
During the war , and in the postwar era as well , Zionist organizations joined with the Allied Governments and became deeply involved in creating and promulgating anti-German hate propaganda .
There is little doubt that their purpose was to drum up world sympathy and political and financial support for Jewish causes , especially for the formation of the State of Israel .
Today , while the political benefits of the Holocaust story have largely dissipated for the others , the story still plays an important role in the ambitions of Zionist and other organizations in the Jewish community .
It is the leaders of these political and propaganda organizations who continue to work to sustain the orthodox Holocaust legend and the myth of German monstrosity during the Second World War .
Those who would claim that these interpretations are anti-Jewish are reading into them something which simply is not there .
Revisionists do not claim that Jewish leaders or organizations did anything in the war and postwar era which the Allied Governments themselves did not do .
For those who believe that the Nuremberg Trials revealed the truth about German war crimes , it is a bracing shock to discover that the then Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court , Harlan Fiske Stone , described the Nuremberg court as " a high - grade lynching party for Germans . "
THE PHOTOGRAPHS
We 've all seen " The Photographs . "
Endlessly .
Newsreel photos taken by U.S. and British photographers at the liberation of the German camps , and especially the awful scenes at Dachau , Buchenwald and Bergen - Belsen .
These films are typically presented in such a way in which it is either stated or implied that the scenes resulted from deliberate policies on the part of the Germans .
The photographs are real .
The uses to which they have been put are base .
There was no German policy at any of those camps to deliberately kill the internees .
In the last months of the war , while Soviet armies were advancing on Germany from the east , the British and U.S. air arms were destroying every major city in Germany with saturation bombing .
Transportation , the food distribution system and medical and sanitation services all broke down .
That was the purpose of the Allied bombing , which has been described as the most barbarous form of warfare in Europe since the Mongol invasions .
Millions of refugees fleeing the Soviet armies were pouring into Germany .
The camps still under German control were overwhelmed with internees from the east .
By early 1945 the inmate population was swept by malnutrition and by epidemics of typhus , typhoid , dysentery and chronic diarrhea .
Even the mortuary systems broke down .
When the press entered the camps with British and U.S. soldiers , they found the results of all that .
They took " The Photographs . "
Still , at camps such as Buchenwald , Dachau and Bergen - Belsen TENS OF THOUSANDS of relatively healthy internees were liberated .
They were there in the camps when " The Photographs " were taken .
There are newsreels of those internees walking through the camp streets laughing and talking .
Others picture exuberant internees throwing their caps in the air and cheering their liberators .
It is only natural to ask why you have n't seen those particular films and photos while you 've seen the others scores and even hundreds of times .
Jewish internees playing football at Theresienstadt ' Konzentrationslager ' Camp .
British football team at Auschwitz .
There were also Scottish , Irish and Welsh teams .
The internees were not " worked to death " or ill - treated as claimed ; HUNDREDS of
other prisoners always watched and cheered .
Do they look undernourished , badly
treated , or over worked ?
I do n't think so either .
DOCUMENTS Spokesmen for the Holocaust Lobby like to assure us that there are " tons " of captured German documents which prove the Jewish genocide .
When challenged on this , however , they can produce only a handful of documents , the authenticity or interpretation of which is always highly questionable .
If pressed for reliable documentation , the Lobby will then reverse itself and claim that the Germans destroyed all of the relevant documents to hide their evil deeds , or it will make the absurd claim that the Germans used a simplistic code language or whispered verbal orders for mass murder into each others ' ears .
With regard to the alleged genocide of the European Jews , all available documentation indicates that there was no order for it , no budget , no weapon ( that is , no so - called execution gas chamber ) and no victim ( that is , not a single autopsied body at any camp has been shown to have been gassed ) .
EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY
As documentary " proofs " for the mass - murder of the European Jews fall by the wayside , Holocaust historians depend increasingly on " eye- witness " testimonies to support their theories .
Many of these testimonies are ludicrously unreliable .
History is filled with stories of masses of people claiming to be eyewitnesses to everything from witchcraft to flying saucers .
During and after the war there were " eyewitnesses " to mass murder in gas chambers at Buchenwald , Bergen - Belsen , Dachau and other camps in Germany proper .
Today , virtually all recognized scholars dismiss this eyewitness testimony as false , and agree that there were no extermination gas chambers in any camp in Germany proper .
Establishment historians , however , still claim that extermination gas chambers existed at Auschwitz and at other camps in Poland .
The eyewitness testimony and the evidence for this claim is , in reality , qualitatively no different than the false testimony and evidence for the alleged gas chambers at the camps in Germany proper .
During the war crimes trials many " eyewitnesses " testified that Germans made soap out of human fat and lamp shades from human skin .
Allied prosecutors even produced evidence to support these charges .
For decades , highly respected scholars at the most prestigious universities in the Western world sanctioned these stories , leading us to believe that they were " irrefutable truths . "
But with time , many such stories have become untenable , and in May 1990 Yehuda Bauer , director of Holocaust studies at Hebrew University in Tel Aviv , admitted that : " The Nazis never made soap from Jews . . . " ( quoted in The Jerusalem Post , International Edition , 5 May 1990 , p. 6 ) .
This is only one recent example where an " irrefutable " Holocaust " truth " has been exposed as a monstrous lie .
With regard to confessions by Germans at war crimes trials , it is now well documented that many were obtained through coercion , intimidation and even physical torture .
AUSCHWITZ
British Historian David Irving , perhaps the most widely read historian writing in English , has called the Auschwitz death - camp story a " sinking ship " and states that there were " no gas chambers at Auschwitz . . . "
The Auschwitz State Museum has recently revised its half - century - old claim that 4 million humans were murdered there .
The Museum now says maybe it was 1 million .
But what proof does the Museum provide to document the 1 million figure ?
None !
The communist propagandists who manage the museum have put on display piles of hair , boots and eyeglasses , etc .
While such displays are effective propaganda devices , they are worthless as historical documentation for " gassings " or a program of " extermination . "
Meanwhile , Revisionists want to know where those 3 million souls have been the last 45 years .
Were they part of the fabled Six Million ?
Those who promote the Holocaust story complain that " the whole world " was indifferent to the genocide which allegedly was occurring in German occupied Europe .
When asked why this was the case the promoters usually respond by saying that it was due to some great moral flaw in the nature of Western man .
At other times they make the absurd claim that people did not realize the enormity of what was happening .
It is true that the world responded with indifference .
How else should people have responded to that which they did not believe , and which for them was a non-event ?
It is certain that if there had been " killing factories " in Poland murdering millions of civilians , then the Red Cross , the Pope , humanitarian agencies , the Allied governments , neutral governments , and prominent figures such as Roosevelt , Truman , Churchill , Eisenhower and many others would have known about it and would have often and unambiguously mentioned it , and condemned it .
They did n't !
The promoters admit that only a tiny group of individuals believed the story at the timemany of whom were connected with Jewish propaganda agencies .
The rise of the Holocaust story reads more like the success story of a PR campaign than anything else .
Winston Churchill wrote the six volumes of his monumental work , The Second World War , without mentioning a program of mass - murder and genocide .
Maybe it slipped his mind .
Dwight D. Eisenhower , in his memoir Crusade in Europe , also failed to mention gas chambers .
Was the weapon used to murder millions of Jews unworthy of a passing reference ?
Was our future president being insensitive to Jews ?
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AND HOLOCAUST REVISIONISM
Many people , when they first hear Holocaust Revisionist arguments , find themselves bewildered .
The arguments appear to make sense , but " How is it possible ? "
The whole world believes the Holocaust story .
It 's just not plausible that so great a conspiracy to suppress the truth could have functioned for half a century .
To understand how it could very well have happened , one needs only to reflect on the intellectual and political orthodoxies of medieval Europe , or those of Nazi Germany or the Communist - bloc countries .
In all of these societies the great majority of scholars were caught up in the existing political culture .
Committed to a prevailing ideology and its interpretation of reality , these scholars and intellectuals felt it was their right , and even their duty , to protect every aspect of that ideology .
They did so by oppressing the evil dissidents who expressed " offensive " or " dangerous " ideas .
In every one of those societies , scholars became Thought Police .
In our own society , in the debate over the question of political correctness , there are those who deliberately attempt to trivialize the issues .
They claim that there is no real problem with freedom of speech on our campuses , and that all that is involved with PC are a few rules which would defend minorities from those who would hurt their feelings .
There is , of course , a deeper and more serious aspect to the problem .
On American campuses today there is a wide range of ideas and viewpoints that are forbidden to be discussed openly .
Even obvious facts and realities , when they are politically unacceptable , are denied and suppressed .
One can learn much about the psychology and methodology of Thought Police by watching how they react when just one of their taboos is broken and Holocaust Revisionism is given a public forum .
First they express outrage that such offensive and dangerous ideas were allowed to be expressed publicly .
They avoid answering or debating these ideas , claiming that to do so would give them a forum and legitimacy .
Then they make vicious personal attacks against the Revisionist heretic , calling him dirty political names such as " anti- Semite , " " racist " or " neo - Nazi , " and they even suggest that he is a potential mass murderer .
They publicly accuse the Revisionist of lying , but they do n't allow the heretic to hear the specific charge against him or to face his accusers so that he can answer this slander .
The Holocausters accuse Revisionists of being hate filled people who are promoting a doctrine of hatred .
But Revisionism is a scholarly process , not a doctrine or ideology .
If the Holocaust promoters really want to expose hatred , they should take a second look at their own doctrines , and a long look at themselves in the mirror .
Anyone on campus who invites a Revisionist to speak is himself attacked as being insensitive .
When a Revisionist does speak on campus he is oftentimes shouted down and threatened .
Campus libraries and bookstores face intimidation when they consider handling Holocaust revisionist materials .
All this goes on while the majority of faculty and university administrators sit dumbly by , allowing political activists to determine what can be said and what can be read on their campus .
Next , the Thought Police set out to destroy the transgressor professionally and financially by " getting " him at his job or concocting a lawsuit against him .
The courts are sometimes used to attack Revisionism .
The Holocausters often deceptively claim that Revisionist scholarship has been proven false during a trial .
The fact is that Revisionist arguments have never been evaluated or judged by the courts .
Finally , the Thought Police try to " straighten out " that segment of academia or the media that allowed the Revisionists a forum in the first place .
It can be an instructive intellectual exercise to identify taboo subjects , other than Holocaust Revisionism , which would evoke comparable responses from Thought Police on our campuses .
Recently , some administrators in academia have held that university administrations should take actions to rid the campus of ideas which are disruptive to the university .
This is a very dangerous position for administrators to take .
It is an open invitation to tyranny .
It means that any militant group with " troops at the ready " can rid the campus of ideas it opposes and then impose its own orthodoxy .
The cowardly administrator finds it much easier and safer to rid the campus of controversial ideas than to face down a group of screaming and snarling militants .
But it is the duty of university administrators to insure that the university remains a free marketplace of ideas .
When ideas cause disruptions , it is the disrupters who must be subdued , not the ideas .
CONCLUSION
The influence of Holocaust Revisionism is growing steadily both here and abroad .
In the United States , Revisionism was launched in earnest in 1977 with the publication of the book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century by Arthur R. Butz .
Professor Butz teaches electrical engineering and computer sciences at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois .
Those who take up the Revisionist cause represent a wide spectrum of political and philosophical positions .
They are certainly not the scoundrels , liars and demons the Holocaust Lobby tries to make them out to be .
The fact is , there are no demons in the real world .
People are at their worst when they begin to see their opponents as an embodiment of evil , and then begin to demonize them .
Such people are preparing to do something simply awful to their opponents .
Their logic is that you can do anything you want to a demon .
That logic will not succeed .

Auschwitz Director Comes Clean About Fraudulent " Gas Chamber "
An exclusive videotape interview Debunks a major part of the " Holocaust " story , and reveals the deception that is STILL GOING ON .
. . !
This is a video that will make you ask " Just how much of the ' Holocaust ' story can we believe ? " as you learn of falsified " proofs " and deceptive claims about " gas chambers , " not from the mouths of Holocaust " revisionists " but in the words of one of the most knowledgeable and ardent supporters of the orthodox " Holocaust " story .
This is a video that affirms what revisionists have maintained for years : that the Soviets and Poles made a practice of " creating " proofs of " homicidal gas chambers " AFTER World War Two , and that the hundreds of thousands of tourists who journey to Auschwitz each year to see for themselves proof of the " final solution " are being deceived .
In this unprecedented interview given to Jewish revisionist David Cole , ( who has debated the " Holocaust " nationally on the Montel Williams Show and has been profiled by CBS ' 48 Hours ) , Dr. Franciszek Piper , Senior Curator and Director of Archives at the Auschwitz State Museum states on camera that the alleged " homicidal gas chamber " at the Auschwitz main camp shown off to tourists from all over the world as being in its " original state " is , in fact , a RECONSTRUCTION , redesigned AFTER THE WAR to look like a gas chamber .
Dr. Piper reveals to David Cole , on camera , how walls were knocked down and holes with " Zyklon B induction chimneys " installed in the roof so that the building could be exhibited as a " proof " of the " final solution . "
And he does n't stop there .
For a solid hour Dr. Piper talks about other " proofs " at Auschwitz for the " final solution " which are ALSO " reconstructions , " and discusses details of the camp that only a man such as he , who has worked at Auschwitz for a quarter century , would know .
Then , in stunning footage , you 'll see David Cole , while on the official tour of Auschwitz , being told by his guide that the Auschwitz main - camp " gas chamber " is in its ORIGINAL STATE , the same and there 's no other word for itlie told to all tourists .
The uncomfortable conclusion cannot be avoided : the people who run Auschwitz tell people things that THEY THEMSELVES KNOW ARE NOT TRUE !
Will you be able to argue with the words of a respected " Holocaust " scholar when he states for the record that one of the main " proofs " of the " final solution " is NO PROOF AT ALL ?

A JEWISH REVISIONIST'S VISIT TO AUSCHWITZ by ( Jew ) David Cole ( Presented at the Eleventh IHR Conference , October 1992 )
When I decided last September to take a well - deserved vacation , I thought , what better destination than Europe .
After all , as a Revisionist , I 'd always felt it my duty to see the concentration camps in person .
My girl - friend , though , said that she 'd like to go to Europe to visit Euro - Disney , the new Disneyland theme park in France .
So I thought for a while about where to go : Auschwitz or Euro - Disney .
And as I looked around , and saw the miserable state of the world and this country , the political and social malaise and depression , I realized that if I did take a vacation , I wanted to go to a place as far away from reality as possible : a fantasy land of wondrous fairy tales .
So , of course , I chose Auschwitz .
Now that I 've gone through the Auschwitz main camp , Auschwitz - Birkenau , Majdanek , Mauthausen , and Dachau , I feel even more secure in my position as a Revisionist that there exists no convincing evidence that Jews or anyone else were taken EN MASSE into gas chambers and killed by the Nazis at these camps .
In fact , the remains that I inspected at the camp sites seem , in many different ways , to directly contradict these claims .
I returned to the United States with more than 25 hours of video footage from the camps .
At Majdanek I uncovered obvious tampering with the buildings exhibited as gas chambers .
This evidence was discovered when my attractive camerawoman busted a lock and got us into a room that is not open to tourists .
There we were able to view several items in their original state , most notably the doors , which were clearly constructed to latch from both the outside AND the inside .
( DAVID COLE [ is a Jew who ] was raised and educated in Los Angeles , where he lives and works .
Because of his support for Holocaust Revisionism , he was assaulted during a meeting at the University of California at Los Angeles on January 22 , 1992 , by thugs of the Jewish Defense League , who hit him in the face and bloodied his nose .
JDL leader Irv Rubin also tried to push Cole down a flight of stairs .
In April 1992 he appeared along with Journal editor Mark Weberas a guest on the Montel Williams Show , a nationally syndicated television program , to present the Revisionist view of the Holocaust story ) .
The high point of my visit , though , was my interview with Dr. Franciszek Piper , Senior Curator of the Polish government 's Auschwitz State Museum .
He has worked there for more than 26 years .
On tape , he admits that the so - called gas chamber in Crematory Building ( Krema ) I , which is shown to half a million visitors a year as a genuine homicidal gas chamber , is in fact a reconstruction even down to the holes cut into the ceiling .
Piper also admits that walls were knocked down and bathroom facilities removed .
He went on to tell us that the remains of the " white cottage , " supposed site of the first preliminary gassings at Birkenau , are also reconstructed .
This was hardly news to me .
Even a quick examination of the remains of the " white cottage " shows that the bricks are not connected in any way , but are simply laid on top of each other like children 's building blocks .
Piper has no problems with the Leuchter Report .
He told me that he agrees with Leuchter 's findings regarding traces of ferro- ferric - cyanide in the walls of Crematory Buildings ( Kremas ) I , II and III .
So what is his explanation for this lack of traces in the supposed homicidal gas chambers when , by contrast , there are significant traces in the non-homicidal delousing chambers ?
He told me that the amount of hydrogen cyanide ( from Zyklon ) supposedly used by Germans to kill people unlike the amount needed to kill lice in delousing chambers was not enough to leave blue ( ferro- ferric - cyanide ) staining , or appreciable traces .
This argument has problems , though .
For one thing , the supposed homicidal gas chambers at Majdanek ( which in reality were non-homicidal delousing chambers ) have abundant blue staining .
So according to Piper 's " Holocaust logic , " gassing people in Auschwitz did not leave blue stains , but gassing people at Majdanek did .
Talk about a Magic Kingdom !
As we spoke , I half expected to see Piper 's nose grow as long as Pinocchio's !
The importance of Piper 's revelations is obvious .
The burden of proof has now shifted decisively to the Exterminationist side .
For example , Piper 's admission that the four holes in the ceiling of Crematory Building ( Krema ) I were put in after the war makes ludicrous the oft - repeated claim of Auschwitz tourists that " Now I 've seen the gas chambers with my own two eyes . "
Now that the often - made claims about Krema I in its present state are no longer valid , can the Exterminationists produce ANY evidence a photograph , document , plan or order showing that the supposed gas chamber there was EVER used to kill people as alleged ?
Most likely not , but what else is new ?
We 've never been asked to accept the Holocaust story on anything but faith , and for me , that 's not good enough .
On the issue of the Holocaust and perhaps uniquely on this issue we are told : " Close the books , there will be no more learning , no more discussion , no more questions .
Not only will no questions be tolerated , but anyone who dares to ask such questions will be slandered and viciously attacked . "
Now , as someone who believes that part of being human is to learn something new every day , I respond : " How dare you tell me there will be no more learning ? "
The establishment that maintains the Holocaust story on life support admits that there is no direct proof of homicidal gassings .
No order , no document , no pictures , only " eyewitnesses . "
And what of these eyewitnesses ?
The Holocaust lobby insists that this is convincing evidence .
But what kind of evidence is this ?
In some European countries , a person who denies the gas chambers can be jailed , fined , or physically attacked .
He might lose his job , his standing in the community , maybe even his life .
Something similar has happened in Canada .
In the United States , he might be attacked and vilified .
And if he says that he comes by his knowledge from first - hand experience in other words from helping to run the camps during the war years then he might easily find himself deported to Israel or eastern Europe , where he might be sentenced to death or at least stripped of his US citizenship and denied due process .
In other words , we only hear of eyewitnesses from one side because witnesses from the other side have been strong - armed into silence .
This is governmental coercion of the worst kind , and on a worldwide scale no less .
One kind of eyewitness is encouraged , the other kind if warned that his words might lead to deportation , imprisonment , loss of livelihood , property , and even life .
Some great victory for the Holocaust lobby :
The game has been fixed !
Let people speak !
If for no one else , I demand this for my own sake .
I want to know what happened during World War Two , and yet how can I if those who might have firsthand knowledge are told : " Speak only the official line , or suffer the consequences . "
I insist on my human right to learn .
There are those who say , " Okay , so maybe the Holocaust is a bit exaggerated , but do we really want to destabilize society by openly talking about all this , possibly encouraging hostility against Jews ? "
This raises an important philosophical question :
Do you believe mankind to be so inherently cruel and stupid that people must be lied to in order to make them behave ?
If so , then the lies you tell them are only a small bandage to cover up a much greater evil : Lack of confidence in mankind 's ability to handle the truth .
And if you truly believe that people cannot handle the truth , but instead need a " Big Brother " to handle it for them , then surely democracy is the most dangerous thing on earth .
Of course , I understand that people can be cruel and stupid , but I also believe in the human ability to learn , and to grow with each new piece of knowledge .
Rather than censor information that we subjectively perceive to be " dangerous , " we should teach our children to think critically , to remain open - minded , and to look for truth rather than cling to emotionally appealing falsehoods .
And that is just about all we can do : teach our children and hope for the best , realizing that people cannot be programmed like robots .
Eighty years of failed Communism should have taught us that .
To use the power of the state to force men to be what the state defines as " good " creates a world far more hellish than the one that is supposedly being prevented .
I would rather live in a world where people are free to be cruel and stupid than one in which " goodness " is enforced at gun point .
Keep in mind also that truth , objective truth , does not need threats and intimidation to prevail .
We Holocaust Revisionists are often likened to those who said that the earth was flat .
But just the reverse is true :
It is the other side that acts like a Holy Inquisition , institutionalizing one viewpoint and punishing heretics .
Remember :
We only accepted that the earth is round after the debate was opened .
And since then , the round - earth adherents have not needed false news laws , hate crimes laws , and libel or slander laws to protect the truthfulness of their view .
Likewise , all we ask is that the Holocaust story either stand or fall according to the evidence or lack of it .
While we Holocaust Revisionists sit on a wealth of wonderfully heretical information , can we get it out to the general public ?
Can we " mainstream " Holocaust Revisionism before it 's too late , that is to say , before all those who have firsthand information of what really happened die off entirely ?
As a Jew , it would be wrong for me not to mention the issue of Jewish influence .
Influence is a very strange thing .
People spend so much time and energy to acquire it , and then an equal amount of time and energy denying they have it .
Jewish influence does exist .
If it did n't , why would billions of dollars be spent annually by Jewish lobbying groups ?
That money is n't to pay for dance lessons for Senators and Congressmen , of course , it 's for influence .
Jews must come to terms with the fact that they are not only a powerful and influential group , but have responsibilities that come with that particularly the responsibility not to abuse power , or , more specifically , to avoid abusing people with that power .
It is a testament to the strength of Revisionist research and scholarship , and to Revisionist tenacity , that all the Jewish influence in the world has not erased this movement .
Despite the best efforts of our most clever and determined adversaries , Revisionist books are still read , and the Institute for Historical Review continues to function .
But how much progress are we really making in getting our message to the public ?
Unfortunately , we 've been making only tiny , pussycat steps .
I am not a patient man .
Every day , I fool myself into thinking that I can be patient I can't .
I do n't want to be a guerrilla fighter of the political underground for the rest of my life .
The time has come , indeed has never been better , to take Revisionist scholarship to the rest of the world , and if the powers that be try to stop us , we either go around them or , if necessary , we go right through them .
TWO MORE YEARS !
That 's my new motto .
In two years ' time , Holocaust Revisionism should be in the mainstream , squarely in the public eye .
I am sure that we will eventually succeed in getting out our message .
Information can be suppressed for just so long .
But that 's not enough for me .
It 's not enough that fellow Revisionists recognize Professor Faurisson 's scholarship for the brilliant work it is .
I want it to be WIDELY recognized as such , and in his lifetime !
So let 's make a concerted effort .
Mindful of the recent Jewish New Year , I hereby make a Jewish New Year 's resolution :
Two more years !
No more sitting in the back of the ideological bus .
We 're loud , we 're proud , and best of all , we 're right !

Whitewashing Hitler Taking the Gas Out of Nazi Infamy by Jim Redden
Some historians say Hitler had no master plan to exterminate the Jews in World War II . . .
But what are Nazis without the Holocaust ?
Irving declares that he has never come across a document proving that Hitler ordered the total eradication of European Jews .
October 16 , 1992 : David Irving , a British historian specializing in World War II , is speaking at Mount Hood Community College near Portland , Oregon .
Irving is an advocate of Holocaust revisionism , a controversial movement that disputes the historical accuracy of the widely held version of what happened to European Jews at the hands of the Germans during Hitler 's Third Reich .
Police dressed in riot gear line the road that leads to the windowless building where Irving is scheduled to talk .
The police have been summoned to protect people who wish to attend Irving 's speech from an angry mob harassing everyone who tries to enter the building .
An elderly couple slips through the corridor of Plexiglass shields held by police and reaches the front doors .
From the mob , a young man yells , " We know where you live ! "
Shaken , the couple approaches a police officer stationed in the lobby .
" They said they know where we live , " the man says in a quavering voice .
The cop answers coolly , " I 'm sorry , sir , but there 's nothing we can do about that , " leaving the couple to wonder if a late - night fire bombing is the price they will pay for attending a history lecture .

At age 54 , David Irving has authored more than a dozen books on World War II .
Unlike many chroniclers of the past , Irving does not rely on the writings of other historians when researching his works , but insists on seeing original documents whenever possible .
According to the New York Times Book Review , " Mr. Irving is an indefatigable interviewer , a prodigy of enterprise and industry , a researcher who almost literally [ leaves ] no stone unturned and [ succeeds ] in digging up papers , letters and diaries which [ are ] believed to be lost or nonexistent , or which escaped , for other reasons , earlier writers .
His dogged persistence puts many professional historians to shame . "
After more than ten years researching declassified war records , Irving declares that he has never come across a document proving that Hitler ordered the total eradication of European Jews , no written or other correspondence proving that Hitler was aware of concentration - camp gassings , and no evidence that Hitler ordered the death of the Jews in any of the top - secret Nazi radio transmissions that were intercepted by the Allies during the war .
As a result of this research , Irving concluded that Hitler did not , in fact , order the notorious Final Solution .
Irving calls the Holocaust a legend .
" Historians have all been busy quoting each other .
They 've been pumping hot air into this bubble , and the bubble has been getting bigger and bigger and more and more unstable .
These professors know the truth , but they 're terrified that some irresponsible idiot is going to come along and prick that bubble .
And , " he adds with comic timing , " I am that prick . "
Mainstream historians acknowledge the lack of a documented Final Solution order from Hitler , believing the Fuehrer was too shrewd to leave behind palpable evidence of his evildoing .
" [ That Hitler would not sign a written order ] is hardly surprising considering the monstrosity of the crimes being committed , " notes British historian Alan Bullock .
In May 1988 Irving provided expert testimony on behalf of Canadian Ernst Zundel , who was charged with violating Canada 's " false news " laws by reprinting a 28 - page booklet titled Did Six Million Really Die ?
Irving produced a report prepared by Fred Leuchter , an American authority on gas chambers who performed forensic tests on the gas chamber at Auschwitz .
Leuchter 's report found no indication of traces of poisonous gas in the walls of the gas chamber and alleged the chamber was , consequently , a fake .
Irving testified that there were no grounds to support the existence of a Nazi plan to exterminate Jews .
Upon returning to Europe , Irving published a special edition of the Leuchter report , writing an introduction in which he boldly dismissed the traditional version of the Holocaust as a " well - financed and brilliantly successful postwar publicity campaign . "
Publication of the Leuchter report in Europe led to Irving 's arrest .
By alleging that the Auschwitz gas chamber was built AFTER the war , he was convicted of a serious crime in Germany .
In May 1992 , a Munich court fined Irving the equivalent of $ 7,000 for violating a German law against " defamation of the memory of the dead . "

Books and pamphlets challenging various aspects of the Holocaust began to appear shortly after the end of WWII .
One of the first revisionist texts was written by a French concentration - camp survivor named Paul Rassinier .
Rassinier 's books , Le Mensonge d'Ulysse [ The Lie of Ulysses ] , published in 1949 , and Le Drame des Juifs Europeens [ The Drama of the European Jews ] , published in 1964 , claimed Rassinier had not seen any evidence of the mass gassings that had come to light after the camps were liberated .
( Dr. Arthur Butz argued that although Jews were persecuted by the Nazis , they were not specifically targeted for mass extermination ) .
In the 1970s , Holocaust revisionism saw public debate in the United States .
In 1976 , Dr. Arthur Butz , an American professor from Northwestern University , published The Hoax of the Twentieth Century .
Butz argued that although Jews were persecuted by the Nazis , they were not specifically targeted for mass extermination .
According to Butz , less than half a million people died in Nazi concentration camps during WWII , and only a fraction of them were Jews .
Today , the central core of Holocaust revisionism in the U.S. is the Institute for Historical Review ( IHR ) in Costa Mesa , California .
Founded in 1979 by conspiracy theorist Willis Carto , the IHR largely functions as a clearing house for a broad range of revisionist propaganda , including such titles as Dealing in Hate : The Development of Anti-German Propaganda ; My Father , Rudolph Hess ; and Auschwitz : Truth or LieAn Eyewitness Report .
The IHR also holds annual conferences at which Irving and other revisionists present their latest findings .
The definition of the term HOLOCAUST lies at the heart of the revisionism controversy .
Since WWII , the expression has been used to describe a systematic Nazi efforteither originating with Hitler or approved by him to exterminate all of Europe 's Jews .
Commonly known as the Final Solution , the plan is thought to have culminated in the construction and operation of the gas chambers at Nazi concentration camps .
Opponents of Holocaust revisionism those who embrace the traditional version of the war ( the American Jewish Committee [ AJC ] and the Anti-Defamation League [ ADL ] in particular ) consider the fight against Holocaust revisionism a crusade against a growing army of neo -Nazis around the world .
In a series of extensively researched briefing papers , the AJC and the ADL argue that Hitler 's dream of an Aryan world did not die with him , but comprises a conspiracy that stretches from the U.S. to Europe and the Middle East .
They refer to their opponents not as Holocaust revisionists , but Holocaust DENIERS .
" The movement to deny that six million Jews were exterminated by the Nazis during World War II is a weapon of anti-Semitic extremist groups operating in the United States and abroad , " claims the ADL .
Jewish advocacy groups and their supporters admit that legitimate Holocaust reappraisal has occurred since the end of WWII .
For example , it was widely assumed after the war that 2.5 million Jews were gassed to death at Auschwitz alone .
Recently Yahuda Bauer , the director of the Division of Holocaust Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem 's Institute of Contemporary Jewry , announced that the actual number was probably closer to 1.35 million .
Though this revision raises questions about the total number of Jews killed by the Nazis , the questions raised by Holocaust revisionists are seen as part of a larger agenda of discrimination .
Irving denies that his views on the Holocaust are anti-Semitic .
" The revisionist scene [ incorporates ] people from the field of history , like myself , to people who are at the other end of the spectrum , who find in revisionism a [ means ] to vent their anti-Semitism , " he explains .
Holocaust revisionism is a common link between many overtly racist and anti-Semitic groups , such as the California - based White Aryan Resistance , which produces a cable - access television show called RACE AND REASON .
Some viewers claimed to be offended by an early episode of the program that opened with canned laughter playing behind WWII film footage of corpses at Nazi concentration camps .
But support for Holocaust revisionism comes from pro-Semitic sides as well .
A young Jew named David Cole visited Auschwitz in late 1992 and videotaped an interview with Dr. Franciszek Piper , the curator of the Holocaust museum at the camp .
In the interview , Piper admitted that the gas chamber shown to tourists was remodeled by the Soviets after the war .
In Cole 's view , this statement confirms Irving 's support of the Leuchter Report .
Mainstream historians supporting the traditional version of the Holocaust point to an abundance of eyewitness accou

The history of HoHoTO
HoHoTO began as a holiday party to raise sorely - needed funds for community initiatives .
Late in 2008 , a group of friends started talking on Twitter about the plight of the hungry in Toronto .
The idea for HoHoTO grew organically out of this discussion , fuelled by a shared belief among a relatively small group of like - minded people .
Using Twitter , Facebook , email , and our collected networks of close friends and loose ties , we kicked off a process that lit up the tweetstreams and blogvines ; quickly turning a much , much bigger group of people on to the same core idea :
That people in our great city are hungry and we can make a difference .
‍ The result , that first year , was an extraordinary party attended by more than 500 enthusiastic people from the local tech , media , digital marketing , social media , and PR communities .
The whole thing was organized in less than 20 days , sold out in nine , and went on to astonish all of us involved as we watched something bigger than we ’d ever dreamed take shape before our eyes .
HoHoTO became a hyper - connected social media movement and a remarkable example of the power of self - organizing online groups .
Along the way , we ’ve received messages of support from the likes of Twitter co-founder , Biz Stone , BoingBoing co-founder Cory Doctorow and many others .
We ’ve called in the troops ( the 48th Highlanders ) to help us deliver the donated food to Daily Bread so that their regular resources would not be redirected by our last - minute event .
We ’ve been cited as an example of social action by Queen Rania of Jordan and referenced as a case study in business books .
As an annual event , “ the party that Twitter built ” has raised more than $ 400,000 and collected around four tons of food for hungry Torontonians to date .
Donate now to continue supporting the Daily Bread !
Since 2015 , this great party has done even more by acting as the hub that connect organizations with our vibrant digital community in an effort to drive beneficial change in our technology ecosystem .
And through a series of initiatives , this party has transitioned into a year - round organization that serves youth , professionals , and organizations in shaping a more inclusive digital community .

Amero to become USA ’s new currency when dollar collapses
Pictures of the new currency that will supposedly replace the US dollar have appeared on the Russian Internet .
The United States is reportedly working on the new currency , the amero , which will be common for the USA , Mexico and Canada .
The unstable financial situation in the world , the collapsing oil prices and the growing foreign debt of the United States may eventually crush the US dollar as the world ’s major currency .
Needless to say that the US authorities reject the rumors and promise to keep the dollar afloat .
Amero to become USA ’s new currency when dollar collapses
Amero notes have no portraits of US presidents on them and resemble the Belarussian rubles .
For example , there is an image of a deer depicted on a 50 - amero note , whereas a picture of a pyramid of Mexican Indians can be seen on a 100 - amero note .
The amero follows the model of the European Union and its euro .
It brings up the idea that the new currency can be adopted by the USA , Canada and Mexico within the scope of the North American Union , which the Bush administration established in 2005 under the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) .
On April 6 , 2005 , the US Treasury announced the formation of the Financial Services Working Group to assist in the SPP ’s ‘ prosperity ’ plans .
According to its own press release , the US Treasury ’s Financial Services Working Group said it “ will play a critical role in the SPP . ”
Conspiracy theorists contend that the governments of the United States , Canada , and Mexico are already taking steps to implement such a currency , as part of a " North American Union ( NAU ) "
No current members of any country 's government have officially stated a desire to create such a body , nor introduce a common currency .
The idea for a North American currency union was first proposed in 1999 by Canadian economist Herbert G. Grubel .
A senior fellow of the conservative Fraser Institute think - tank , he published a book titled The Case for the Amero in September 1999 , the year that the euro became a virtual currency .
Another Canadian think - tank , the C.D. Howe Institute , advocates the creation of a shared currency between Canada and the United States .
After the report came out , center - left nationalist groups in Canada expressed their opposition to any currency union because they view it as an attempt by American businesses to gain access to Canada 's extensive natural resources while dismantling the nation 's social services .
The 100,000 member strong Council of Canadians , a progressive advocacy group , has declared one of its central issues to be the threat of " deep integration " .
Dr. Robert Pastor , in a 2001 book , suggested a common currency should be a foundation of " macro economic cooperation " among the three NAFTA countries .
However , the 2005 Independent Task Force on North America , which he chaired , did not recommend a common currency , nor does Pastor in the section for additional and dissenting views suggest a common currency should be a goal .
The Washington Post ‘s series on AIG Financial Products , the mostly independent derivatives operation that brought the downfall of the insurance giant , is among the best of the many tales of collapse being recounted in newspapers these days .
A passage at the beginning of today ’s second installment ( part one is here ) was especially appalling / compelling :
For months , several executives at AIG Financial Products had pulled apart the data , looking for flaws in the logic .
In phone calls and e-mails , at meetings and on their trading floor , they kept asking themselves in early 1998 : Could this be right ?
What are we missing ?
Their debate centered on a consultant ’s computer model and a new kind of contract known as a credit - default swap .
For a fee , the firm essentially would insure a company ’s corporate debt in case of default .
The model showed that these swaps could be a moneymaker for the decade - old firm and its parent , insurance giant AIG , with a 99.85 percent chance of never having to pay out .
The computer model was based on years of historical data about the ups and downs of corporate debt , essentially the bonds that corporations sell to finance their operations .
As AIG ’s top executives and Tom Savage , the 48 - year - old Financial Products president , understood the model ’s projections , the U.S. economy would have to disintegrate into a full - blown depression to trigger the succession of events that would require Financial Products to cover defaults
Yeah , everything ’s much easier to see with hindsight , but there are just so many red flags here :
First , that absurdly precise 99.85 % figure .
One ca n’t know from the article how the number was presented to AIG executives , or how seriously they took it .
Defenders of quantitative finance such as Eric Falkenstein often make the case that the quants who churn out such numbers are well aware of their limitations .
But the subsequent actions of both AIG Financial Products and AIG ’s top brass would seem to indicate that they took this particular risk assessment to the bank .
Second , the part about the U.S. economy having to “ disintegrate into a full - blown depression ” for the credit - default swaps AIG was selling to become big money - losers .
I was talking a couple of weeks ago to an executive from another big insurance company that thought about getting into selling CDSes but opted against it .
Its risk managers also concluded that it would take a systemic financial collapse for the CDS business to go sour .
But for them that was a reason to avoid it .
Insurance works financially when it protects people from smallish events that occur randomly — like fire , or burglary , or death .
The business turns problematic when it gets into regional debacles like hurricanes and earthquakes , and completely untenable when it faces a global or even national disaster .
That ’s why property insurance policies often include “ Act of God ” clauses that give the insurer an out in case of earthquake or meteor strike or Rapture .
It would have been interesting if AIG had tried to sell credit default swaps with such a clause — we ’ll pay up unless credit markets totally fall apart .
It did n’t , so it was essentially running a scam .
In the situation that market participants most needed insurance against , AIG would n’t be able to provide it .
At least not without a couple hundred billion in U.S. government aid .
Finally , there ’s the apparent disregard for the impact that AIG ’s CDS sales , and the growth of the CDS market in general , would have on loan quality .
It retrospect , it seems clear that buying credit default swaps allowed many lenders to believe that they could safely lower lending standards — because they ’d outsourced the risk to somebody else .
That rendered AIG ’s historical risk models completely useless .
If something like this had never happened before , AIG ’s failure to take it into account might be excusable .
But consider this tale from an earlier financial insurance pioneer ( nabbed from the manuscript of my forthcoming book ) :
Hayne Leland could see , almost from the moment portfolio insurance popped into his head in the den of his Berkeley house , that there was a catch .
The option - pricing formulas upon which he based the strategy depended on the portfolio insurer being a price taker .
That is , prices were set by the “ pervasive forces ” of the market .
The actions of an individual market participant were presumed to have no impact at all .
If Leland ’s idea hit it big enough , he realized , the actions taken by portfolio insurers trying to cut their clients ’ losses during a market swoon might drive prices down even more .
“ But I honestly thought , ‘ How long would it take and how big would we have to become before our trades affected the market as a whole ? ’ ” Leland recalled .
“ It turns out it was only seven years . ”
Update
Here ’s part three of the Post AIG series , with the verdict from Gerry Pasciucco , who was brought in by current AIG management to clean up the mess :
British boxer David Haye has angered world champion Wladimir Klitschko after appearing in a mock - up picture holding the Ukrainian 's decapitated head !
Wladimir Klitschko Wladimir Klitschko
" The secrets to my world champion KO success ! "
Heavyweight boxing world champion Wladimir Klitschko spoke to BILD about his KO success ahead of his title fight with Hasim Rahman on Saturday .
Klitschko ( 32 ) , who cemented his place as the world 's top heavyweight after a convincing win over former champion Hasim Rahman on Saturday , is angry over the photo shoot in UK magazine ' Men 's Health ' .
He had handed out a beating to American Rahman ( 36 ) in seven rounds , as more than 10 million people watched the fight in Germany alone .
Eventually , referee Tony Weeks stepped in to end the uneven contest with the champ 178 - 30 up on the judges ' score cards - it seemed Rahman only wanted to pick up his $ 1.1 million pay cheque .
Former cruiserweight Haye ( 28 ) has just moved up to the heavyweight division and is hoping to take on Klitschko or his brother Vitali for a world title next year .
And the Brit has already angered the Ukrainians .
Vitali , the WBC champion , said : " He showed me the photos while I was having lunch in a restaurant . "
Both he and his wife Natalie were shocked , and he grabbed Haye by the scruff of the neck .
“ He crossed the line .
It is more than tasteless and he will be punished for it .
I will do that without emotion . ”
Haye , a former undisputed cruiserweight champion , just smiled from underneath his cowboy hat .
“ I have already riled the boys , which they needed .
Wladimir ’s fight against Rahman was just boring .
A Tyson would have eaten him up in three rounds and spat him out .
That is exactly what I am going to do with the lame Klitschko . ”
Now it ’s just up to Vitali and Wladimir to decide which one of them is going to punish the cocky English boxer ...
Einstein is quoted as having said that if he had one hour to save the world he would spend fifty - five minutes defining the problem and only five minutes finding the solution .
This quote does illustrate an important point : before jumping right into solving a problem , we should step back and invest time and effort to improve our understanding of it .
Here are 10 strategies you can use to see problems from many different perspectives and master what is the most important step in problem solving : clearly defining the problem in the first place !
The Problem Is To Know What the Problem Is
The definition of the problem will be the focal point of all your problem - solving efforts .
As such , it makes sense to devote as much attention and dedication to problem definition as possible .
What usually happens is that as soon as we have a problem to work on we ’re so eager to get to solutions that we neglect spending any time refining it .
What most of us do n’t realize — and what supposedly Einstein might have been alluding to — is that the quality of the solutions we come up with will be in direct proportion to the quality of the description of the problem we ’re trying to solve .
Not only will your solutions be more abundant and of higher quality , but they ’ll be achieved much , much more easily .
Most importantly , you ’ll have the confidence to be tackling a worthwhile problem .
Problem Definition Tools and Strategies
The good news is that getting different perspectives and angles in order to clearly define a problem is a skill that can be learned and developed .
As such , there are many strategies you can use to perfect it .
Here are the 10 most effective ones I know .
1. Rephrase the Problem
When a Toyota executive asked employees to brainstorm “ ways to increase their productivity ” , all he got back were blank stares .
When he rephrased his request as “ ways to make their jobs easier ” , he could barely keep up with the amount of suggestions .
Words carry strong implicit meaning and , as such , play a major role in how we perceive a problem .
In the example above , ‘ be productive ’ might seem like a sacrifice you ’re doing for the company , while ‘ make your job easier ’ may be more like something you ’re doing for your own benefit , but from which the company also benefits .
In the end , the problem is still the same , but the feelings — and the points of view — associated with each of them are vastly different .
Play freely with the problem statement , rewording it several times .
For a methodic approach , take single words and substitute variations .
‘ Increase sales ’ ?
Try replacing ‘ increase ’ with ‘ attract ’ , ‘ develop ’ , ‘ extend ’ , ‘ repeat ’ and see how your perception of the problem changes .
A rich vocabulary plays an important role here , so you may want to use a thesaurus or develop your vocabulary .
2. Expose and Challenge Assumptions
Every problem — no matter how apparently simple it may be — comes with a long list of assumptions attached .
Many of these assumptions may be inaccurate and could make your problem statement inadequate or even misguided .
The first step to get rid of bad assumptions is to make them explicit .
Write a list and expose as many assumptions as you can — especially those that may seem the most obvious and ‘ untouchable ’ .
That , in itself , brings more clarity to the problem at hand .
But go further and test each assumption for validity : think in ways that they might not be valid and their consequences .
What you will find may surprise you : that many of those bad assumptions are self - imposed — with just a bit of scrutiny you are able to safely drop them .
For example , suppose you ’re about to enter the restaurant business .
One of your assumptions might be ‘ restaurants have a menu ’ .
While such an assumption may seem true at first , try challenging it and maybe you ’ll find some very interesting business models ( such as one restaurant in which customers bring dish ideas for the chef to cook , for example ) .
3. Chunk Up
Each problem is a small piece of a greater problem .
In the same way that you can explore a problem laterally — such as by playing with words or challenging assumptions — you can also explore it at different “ altitudes ” .
If you feel you ’re overwhelmed with details or looking at a problem too narrowly , look at it from a more general perspective .
In order to make your problem more general , ask questions such as : “ What ’s this a part of ? ” , “ What ’s this an example of ? ” or “ What ’s the intention behind this ? ” .
For a detailed explanation of how this principle works , check the article Boost Your Brainstorm Effectiveness with the Why Habit .
Another approach that helps a lot in getting a more general view of a problem is replacing words in the problem statement with hypernyms .
Hypernyms are words that have a broader meaning than the given word .
( For example , a hypernym of ‘ car ’ is ‘ vehicle’ ) .
A great , free tool for finding hypernyms for a given word is WordNet ( just search for a word and click on the ‘ S : ’ label before the word definitions ) .
4. Chunk Down
If each problem is part of a greater problem , it also means that each problem is composed of many smaller problems .
It turns out that decomposing a problem in many smaller problems — each of them more specific than the original — can also provide greater insights about it .
‘ Chunking the problem down ’ ( making it more specific ) is especially useful if you find the problem overwhelming or daunting .
Some of the typical questions you can ask to make a problem more specific are : “ What are parts of this ? ” or “ What are examples of this ? ” .
Just as in ‘ chunking up ’ , word substitution can also come to great use here .
The class of words that are useful here are hyponyms : words that are stricter in meaning than the given one .
( E.g. two hyponyms of ‘ car ’ are ‘ minivan ’ and ‘ limousine ’ ) .
WordNet can also help you finding hyponyms .
5. Find Multiple Perspectives
Before rushing to solve a problem , always make sure you look at it from different perspectives .
Looking at it with different eyes is a great way to have instant insight on new , overlooked directions .
For example , if you own a business and are trying to ‘ increase sales ’ , try to view this problem from the point of view of , say , a customer .
For example , from the customer ’s viewpoint , this may be a matter of adding features to your product that one would be willing to pay more for .
Rewrite your problem statement many times , each time using one of these different perspectives .
How would your competition see this problem ?
Your employees ?
Your mom ?
Also , imagine how people in various roles would frame the problem .
How would a politician see it ?
A college professor ?
A nun ?
Try to find the differences and similarities on how the different roles would deal with your problem .
6. Use Effective Language Constructs
There is n’t a one - size - fits - all formula for properly crafting the perfect problem statement , but there are some language constructs that always help making it more effective :
Assume a myriad of solutions .
An excellent way to start a problem statement is : “ In what ways might I… ” .
This expression is much superior to “ How can I … ” as it hints that there ’s a multitude of solutions , and not just one — or maybe none .
As simple as this sounds , the feeling of expectancy helps your brain find solutions .

As simple as this sounds , the feeling of expectancy helps your brain find solutions .
Make it positive .
Negative sentences require a lot more cognitive power to process and may slow you down — or even derail your train of thought .
Positive statements also help you find the real goal behind the problem and , as such , are much more motivating .
For example : instead of finding ways to ‘ quit smoking ’ , you may find that ‘ increase your energy ’ , ‘ live longer ’ and others are much more worthwhile goals .

For example : instead of finding ways to ‘ quit smoking ’ , you may find that ‘ increase your energy ’ , ‘ live longer ’ and others are much more worthwhile goals .
Frame your problem in the form of a question .
Our brain loves questions .
If the question is powerful and engaging , our brains will do everything within their reach to answer it .
We just ca n’t help it :
Our brains will start working on the problem immediately and keep working in the background , even when we ’re not aware of it .

We just ca n’t help it :
Our brains will start working on the problem immediately and keep working in the background , even when we ’re not aware of it .
If you ’re still stuck , consider using the following formula for phrasing your problem statement :
“ In what ways ( action ) ( object ) ( qualifier ) ( end result ) ? ”
Example :
In what ways might I package ( action ) my book ( object ) more attractively ( qualifier ) so people will buy more of it ( end result ) ?
7. Make It Engaging
In addition to using effective language constructs , it ’s important to come up with a problem statement that truly excites you so you ’re in the best frame of mind for creatively tackling the problem .
If the problem looks too dull for you , invest the time adding vigor to it while still keeping it genuine .
Make it enticing .
Your brain will thank ( and reward ) you later .
One thing is to ‘ increase sales ’ ( boring ) , another one is ‘ wow your customers ’ .
One thing is ‘ to create a personal development blog ’ , another completely different is to ’ empower readers to live fully ’ .
8. Reverse the Problem
One trick that usually helps when you ’re stuck with a problem is turning it on its head .
If you want to win , find out what would make you lose .
If you are struggling finding ways to ‘ increase sales ’ , find ways to decrease them instead .
Then , all you need to do is reverse your answers .
‘ Make more sales calls ’ may seem an evident way of increasing sales , but sometimes we only see these ‘ obvious ’ answers when we look at the problem from an opposite direction .
This seemingly convoluted method may not seem intuitive at first , but turning a problem on its head can uncover rather obvious solutions to the original problem .
9. Gather Facts
Investigate causes and circumstances of the problem .
Probe details about it — such as its origins and causes .
Especially if you have a problem that ’s too vague , investigating facts is usually more productive than trying to solve it right away .
If , for example , the problem stated by your spouse is “ You never listen to me ” , the solution is not obvious .
However , if the statement is “ You do n’t make enough eye contact when I ’m talking to you , ” then the solution is obvious and you can skip brainstorming altogether .
( You ’ll still need to work on the implementation , though ! )
Ask yourself questions about the problem .
What is not known about it ?
Can you draw a diagram of the problem ?
What are the problem boundaries ?
Be curious .
Ask questions and gather facts .
It is said that a well - defined problem is halfway to being solved : I would add that a perfectly - defined problem is not a problem anymore .
10 . Problem - Solve Your Problem Statement
I know I risk getting into an infinite loop here , but as you may have noticed , getting the right perspective of a problem is , well , a problem in itself .
As such , feel free to use any creative thinking technique you know to help .
There are plenty to choose from :
You may want to give yourself an Idea Quota of problem statements .
Or write a List of 100 problems to solve .
SCAMPER your problem definition .
These are just some of dozen techniques you can try .
Of course , how much effort you invest in defining the problem in contrast to how much effort you invest in solving your actual problem is a hard balance to achieve , though one which is attainable with practice .
Personally , I do n’t think that 55 minutes of defining a problem versus 5 minutes acting on it is usually a good proportion .
The point is that we must be aware of how important problem defining is and correct our tendency to spend too little time on it .
In fact , when you start paying more attention to how you define your problems , you ’ll probably find that it is usually much harder than solving them .
But you ’ll also find that the payoff is well worth the effort .

Postal Service To Announce $ 2.5 Billion Yearly Loss Officials blame loss on having to pre-pay $ 5 billion in retirement benefits .
September 23 , 2008  --
The United States Postal Service will announce a $ 2.5 billion dollar yearly loss tomorrow , ABCNews.com has learned .
But postal officials say it is unlikely to result in any increase in the cost of mailing a first class letter .
The price of a first - class stamp was raised one cent in May of this year , to 42 cents , following an even larger loss last year of $ 5.1 billion .
Postmaster General John E. Potter has said no further increase in the cost of first class stamps would be considered until May , 2009 at the earliest .
Postal service officials say the loss this year , and the year before , was due largely to a Congressional mandate requiring the Postal Service to pre-pay $ 5 billion in retirement benefits for postal workers .
But for that requirement , say officials , the Postal Service would have posted a $ 2.5 billion profit this year .
You already know the Vatican does n’t see gays in favorable light , refusing to join other European countries in signing a United Nations resolution to decriminalize homosexuality .
And while the Holy See is already an independent city - state , they ’re now taking their fight to go it alone to a new level :
The Vatican will no longer automatically adopt Italian law as its own … beginning tomorrow .
The Vatican will no longer automatically adopt Italian laws as its own when a new statute comes into effect on Thursday , according to Vatican daily Osservatore Romano .
Jose ’ Maria Serrano Ruiz , president of the Commission for the Revision of the Code of Vatican Law , said the move was motivated by the ” exorbitant number ” of Italian laws , as well as their ” instability ” and frequent contrast with ” the irreversible principles of the Church ” .
Although the Vatican is an independent city - state , its residents are largely recognised as Italian citizens .
Under the current statute signed by Pope Piux XI in 1929 , Italian laws are accepted by the Holy See except in cases where there is ” radical incompatibility ” with the basic principles of canon law , Ruiz said .
But the new statute signed by Pope Benedict XVI will mean all Italian laws will have to be examined by Vatican authorities before they are adopted as part of the city - state ’s own legislation .

Today 's supermarket bacon is OK .
I mean , you can't go too far wrong with bacon ; but to really know good bacon you either need to find a great artisan producer , or make your own .
Supermarket bacon is " wet cured " it is submerged in a vat of briny water and artificial smoke and other flavorings are added .
Real bacon is dry cured , and exposed to real hardwood smoke .
You wo n't believe how much better it is ; and how easy it is to make your own bacon at home .
It 's one of those things that sounds really hard , and will sure impress people when you tell them they 're eating your own home - cured bacon , but is actually really effortless !
You 'll need to source a couple of ingredients , but they 're probably both found at the same place ; you 're neighborhood butcher shop .
Tell your butcher what you 're planning to do , and ask for a piece of pork belly ( make sure you do n't get salt pork .
You want fresh peork belly . ) .
About 5 lbs is a pretty good place to start ( do n't make less than this or you will regret it later ! ) and also ask him or her for pink curing salt .
Pink salt is a mixture about 6.5 % sodium nitrite , and 93.5 percent kosher salt .
It is called pink salt as it is dyed pink to prevent accidental use as regular salt .
With these two items in hand , you 're ready to get started .
Great homemade bacon recipe
One 5 lb slab of pork belly , rind removed .
Ask your butcher to take of the rind .
1/4 cup of salt 1 tsp pink salt
Generous half cup of maple syrup or honey .
( You could also substitute a half cup of brown sugar if you prefer .
That 's it , there are only three ingredients needed !
Rub the pink salt all over both sides of the bacon and then slather on the salt andmaple syrup or honey as well , trying to get all exposed surfaces coated .
Pop the pork belly into a large Ziploc bag , and keep it in the fridge for a week , turning every day .
There will be some liquid accumulating in the bag ; this is normal , do n't remove it .
After a week , take the bacon out of the bag , wash off any salt that remains ... and voila , you have bacon .
Now fry a little piece cut out from the center of the belly .
It 's bacon after all , so it should be salty ; but if you think it is too salty , try soaking it in cold water for about an hour .
This will leach out some of the salt .
Repeat the tasting and if you still think it 's too salty , give it another hour in a new batch of water .
You now have great tasting bacon that 's ready to enjoy ; and you can either now slice it up and watch how fast it disappears from your fridge , or get ready to take it the next level by hardwood smoking it .
The smoking stage will make this bacon even better , but you 'll be amazed at how good the bacon already tastes .
All the excess water has been removed through the dry curing ; so the tastes are concentrated ... and you 'll never see your homemade bacon shrivel away to nothing in the frying pan .
Commercial bacon is pumped full of water , and when you cook it , all this water is released .
Adding water is a great way to make more money when you 're selling bacon by the pound , but not such a good way to make delicious bacon .
If you decide you want to smoke the bacon , you 'll see that 's its pretty easy as well .
Take a look at my ( link below ) hub on smoking for easy to follow instructions ... using a backyard BBQ !
There 's a great thread on the cooking forum at E - Gullet all about charcuterie , so check out their link below if you want to learn more about home curing .
A great book on homemade bacon , sausages , hams , etc. is Michael Rhulman 's Charcuterie .
People are raving about this easy to follow text on all sorts of different charcuterie .
It taught me a lot , and the bacon recipe above is loosely based on one from the book .
In his address to the Curia , the Vatican 's central administration , he described behaviour beyond traditional heterosexual relations as " a destruction of God 's work " and said that the Roman Catholic Church had a duty to " protect man from the destruction of himself " .

A toy boat demonstrates how waves benath the sea ’s surface can invisibly slow a ship ’s progress .
Does the same effect cause trouble for swimmers ?
It may sound like a superstitious excuse for a poor day ’s swimming , but it is not uncommon for triathletes to complain that the water is behaving badly – even that it is “ evil ” .
Now a study suggests what they are feeling is real .
Leo Maas , a fluid dynamicist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research , and colleagues found that “ dead water ” – an obstructive effect encountered by ships at sea – can strike swimmers too .
As ships sail over a layer of warm water sitting over saltier , or colder , layers , waves form in the boundary between the two layers .
As these waves grow , they form a gulf beneath the ship , sucking away its speed .
This effect can stall boats at sea , reducing their speed by up to 80 % .
Maas and his colleagues ran two experiments see if dead water could strike swimmers too .

Deadly layers ?
First , to measure any effect on arm power , they asked two subjects to use the front crawl stroke while lying on a carriage supported just above the water ’s surface .
They measured the resulting gain in kinetic energy of the carriage and found that it was far less in water where an upper layer of different density ( and of a depth close to arm length ) was present than in homogeneous water .
In the second experiment , four subjects were asked to swim a short distance in both homogeneous water and in stratified water .
The team found that with the same stroke frequency being used in both conditions , swimming speed in stratified water dropped by 15 % , with a 40 % loss of propulsive power .
“ We ’ve been considering the possibility that the drownings of strong swimmers in fair - weather conditions might be the result of dead water , but until now , we were n’t really sure if this phenomenon could strike something as small as a single human , ” says Maas .
“ Now it seems that it can . ”
While the discussion in terms of dead water is compelling , stratification would also affect how fluid moves around a swimmer ’s hands , explains Ted Johnson at University College London .
“ It would be great if future work could visualise these three - dimensional flow patterns , ” he says .

Lempel - Ziv-Welch ( LZW ) Encoding Discussion and Implementation by Michael Dipperstein
The need to explore a compression algorithm has struck again .
After playing with LZSS ( LZ77 ) I thought LZW ( LZ78 ) was something I should eventually get around to studying .
I 've played with several other things since having that thought , but it finally took hold , and became the thing that consumed " free time "
As with my other compression implementations , my intent is to publish an easy to follow ANSI C implementation of the Lempel - Ziv- Welch ( LZW ) encoding / decoding algorithm .
Anyone familiar with ANSI C and LZW or LZ78 should be able to follow and learn from my implementation .
I 'm sure that there 's room for improvement of compression ratios , speed , and memory usage , but this project is about learning and sharing , not perfection .
Click here for a link to my LZW source .
The rest of this page discusses LZW and my implementation .
Algorithm Overview
Like it 's predecessor LZSS ( LZ77 ) , the Lempel - Ziv- Welch algorithm uses a dynamically generated dictionary and and encodes strings by a reference to the dictionary .
It is intended that the dictionary reference should be shorter than the string it replaces .
As you will see , LZW achieves it 's goal for all strings larger than 1 .
Encoding
The LZSS algorithm uses a sliding window dictionary .
Each entry in the dictionary is a character .
LZSS code words consist of an offset into the dictionary and the number of characters following the offset to include in an encoded string .
Unlike LZSS , entries in the LZW dictionary are strings , and every LZW code word is a reference to a string in the dictionary .
Okay , so where does the dictionary come from , and why can't I find an entry for my whole file in it ?
The Dictionary and Encoded Strings
The LZW dictionary is not an external dictionary that lists all known symbol strings .
Instead , the dictionary is initialized with an entry for every possible byte .
Other strings are added as they are built from the input stream .
The code word for a string is simply the next available value at the time it is added to the dictionary .
An " encoded " string is used to add new strings to the dictionary .
The encoded string is built from the input stream .
The input stream is read 1 byte at a time .
If the string formed by concatenating the new byte to the encoded string is in the dictionary , the new byte is added to the end of the encoded string .
Otherwise a dictionary entry is made for the new string and the code word for the coded string is written to the output stream .
Then the byte that was just read becomes thet encoded string .
The Basic Encoding Algorithm
Based on the discussion above , encoding input consists of the following steps :
Step 1 . Initialize dictionary to contain one entry for each byte .
Initialize the encoded string with the first byte of the input stream .
Step 2 .
Read the next byte from the input stream .
Step 3 .
If the byte is an EOF goto step 6 .
Step 4 .
If concatenating the byte to the encoded string produces a string that is in the dictionary :
concatenate the the byte to the encoded string .
go to step 2 .
Step 5 .
If concatenating the byte to the encoded string produces a string that is not in the dictionary :
add the new sting to the dictionary .
write the code for the encoded string to the output stream .
set the encoded string equal to the new byte .
go to step 2 .
Step 6 .
Write out code for encoded string and exit .
Example :
The string " this_is_his_thing " is encoded as follows :
New Byte Encoded String New Code Code Output t t None None h h 256 ( th ) t i i 257 ( hi ) h s s 258 ( is ) i _ _ 259 ( s_ ) s i i 260 ( _i ) _ s is None None _ _ 261 ( is_ ) 258 ( is ) h h 262 ( _h ) _ i hi None None s s 263 ( his ) 257 ( hi ) _ s_ None None t t 264 ( s_t ) 259 ( s_ ) h th None None i i 265 ( thi ) 256 ( th ) n n 266 ( in ) i g g 267 ( ng ) n None None None g
In the example above , a 17 character string is represented by 13 code words .
Any actual compression that would occur would be based on the size of the code words .
In this example code words could be as short as 9 bits .
Typically code words are 12 to 16 bits long .
Of course the typical input stream is also longer than 17 characters .
Decoding
It should n't be a big surprise that LZW data is decoded pretty much the opposite of how it 's encoded .
The dictionary is initialized so that it contains an entry for each byte .
Instead of maintaining an encoded string , the decoding algorithm maintains the last code word and the first character in the string it encodes .
New code words are read from the input stream one at a time and string encoded by the new code is output .
During the encoding process , the code prior to the current code is written because concatenating the first character of the current code with the string encoded by the prior code generated a code that was n't in the dictionary .
When that happened the string formed by the concatenation was added to the dictionary .
The same string needs to be added to the dictionary when decoding .
The Basic Decoding Algorithm
Based on the discussion above , decoding input consists of the following steps :
Step 1 . Initialize dictionary to contain one entry for each byte .
Step 2 .
Read the first code word from the input stream and write out the byte it encodes .
Step 3 .
Read the next code word from the input stream .
Step 4 .
If the code word is an EOF exit .
Step 5 . Write out the string encoded by the code word .
Step 6 .
Concatenate the first character in the new code word to the string produced by the previous code word and add the resulting string to the dictionary .
Step 7 .
Go to step 3 .
Example 2 : Decode the stream ' t ' ' h' ' i ' 's ' ' _' 258 ' _ ' 257 259 256 ' i ' ' n ' ' g ' produced by the previous example
Input Code Encoded String Added Code String Output t t None t h h 256 ( th ) h i i 257 ( hi ) i s s 258 ( is ) s _ _ 259 ( s_ ) _ 258 is 260 ( _i ) is _ _ 261 ( is_ ) _ 257 hi 262 ( _h ) hi 259 s_ 263 ( his ) s_ 256 th 264 ( s_t ) th i i 265 ( thi ) i n n 266 ( in ) n g g 267 ( ng ) g
The decode string matches the original encoded string , so I must have done something right .
One of my favorite things about LZW is that the decoder does n't require any additional information from the encoder .
There 's no need to include extra information commonly required by statistical algorithms like Huffman Code and Arithmetic Code .
So compression ratios are never reduced by extra data cost .
Exception to the Rules
Whoever said that there 's an exception for every rule must have studied LZW .
It turns out that an exception may occur .
When decoding certain input streams the decoder may see a code word that 's one larger than anything that it has in it 's dictionary .
Fortunately for me others have figured out when the exception happens and how to deal with it .
The exception occurs if the dictionary contains an entry for string + character and the input stream is string + character + string + character + string .
When the exception occurs , concatenate the first character of the string encoded by the previous code word to the end of the string encoded by the previous code word .
The resulting string is the value of the new code word .
Write it to the output stream and add it to the dictionary .
Example 2 : The string " abcabcabcabcabcabc " demonstrates an occurrence of the special exception :
New Byte Encoded String New Code Code Output a a None None b b 256 ( ab ) a c c 257 ( bc ) b a a 258 ( ca ) c b ab None None c c 259 ( abc ) ab ( 256 ) a ca None None b b 260 ( cab ) ca ( 258 ) c bc None None a a 261 ( bca ) 257 ( bc ) b ab None None c abc None None a a 262 ( abca ) 259 ( abc ) b ab None None c abc None None a abca None None b b 263 ( abcab ) 262 ( abca ) c bc None None None None None 257 ( bc )
Wow !
That 's a lot of work to force an exception to occur .
The results still need to be decoded in order to witness the exception in action .
Input Code Encoded String Added Code String Output a a None a b b 256 ( ab ) b c c 257 ( bc ) c 256 ab 258 ( ca ) ab 258 ca 259 ( abc ) ca 257 bc 260 ( cab ) bc 259 abc 261 ( bca ) 262 Not In Dictionary abca abca NOTE :
The above step demonstrates the exception and how it is handled .
( New encoded string = old encoded string + the first character of the old encoded string = abc + a = abca ) 257 bc 263 ( abcab ) bc
There you have it , the exception and how it 's handled .
It can be made to occur with a shorter pattern of repeated 2 character strings like " ababababababab " , but I does n't make as nice of an example .
That 's all there is to the LZW algorithm .
There are a few more issues to consider when actually implementing the algorithm on a computer .
You should to read on if you care about them .
Implementation Issues
As I have stated the introduction , my intent is to publish an easy to follow ANSI C implementation of the Lempel - Ziv- Welch Encoding ( LZW ) encoding / decoding algorithm .
I have also tried to make the code portable .
Those goals drove much of this implementation .
Size of Code Word
One of the first things that needs to be decided when implementing LZW is how big of a code word to use .
The following items should be considered when choosing a code word size :
Code words must be bigger than a length 1 string of what ever is encoded .
All encoded strings ( including length 1 strings ) will require a code word to represent them .
Larger code words mean more entries may be contained in a dictionary .
Consider code word endian / byte order issues if the LZW is implementation will be used on different platforms .
I encode strings of bytes , so the size of a code word must be bigger than a byte .
That rules out any code words 8 bits or less .
I also do n't want the code word to be huge , because even size 1 strings will be written as a code word .
Example 1 encodes a 17 byte ( 136 bit ) string into 13 code words .
If the code words were only 9 bits long , the encoded data would be 117 bits .
However if the code words were 16 bits long , the encoded data would be 208 bits .
Typically , a larger data set must be encoded before longer code words produce any compression .
Code word size also has an impact on the maximum number of strings in a dictionary .
An n bit code word may have as many as 2n strings in it 's dictionary .
If you 're encoding bytes the first 256 of those strings will be single bytes .
Larger dictionaries can contain codes for more strings and that typically improves compression .
The downside is that the encoding algorithm needs to search the dictionary for matches to the current string .
Search time increases with the size of the dictionary .
With so many factors to consider , I ended up using 12 bit code words for my version 0.1 implementation .
It 's really easy to modify my version 0.1 implementation to use 9 to 15 bits .
I settled on 12 bits after trying all values between 9 and 15 on a random set of files between 1 K and 128 K in size .
The test was highly unscientific , but the 12 bit code words had the best average compression results .
I got a little fancier with my version 0.2 implementation .
I begin with a 9 bit code word , but allow the bit length to increase up to 15 bits as more code words are generated .
It is usually the case that a data stream can be compressed with code words that start at 9 bits and grow to n bits better than it can be compressed with a fixed n bit code word .
I use the word " usually " , because there is a little overhead required to indicate that the code word size has changed ( see Indicating Code Word Length ) .
Feel free to change the code word size for any reason that you might have .
If you increase it beyond 15 bits , things will blow up on machines with 16 bit integers .
If you increase the code word size to more than 16 bits , you 'll need to modify the routines that read and write code words .
Representing Strings in the Dictionary
The dictionary in the Lempel - Ziv- Welch algorithm provides a way of associating strings with code words .
Code words are of limited length .
However , the LZW algorithm does not impose a limit on the length of strings that are encoded .
One way to represent strings of arbitrary length is by a NULL terminated array .
With LZW , it 's possible to have thousands of strings thousands of bytes long .
As machine memory sizes increase , there may come a time when the memory requirements of NULL terminated strings is n't a big deal .
I 'm still using a vintage PC , so NULL terminated strings are out of the question .
Fortunately , somebody much smarter than me observed that all strings entered into the dictionary either have a size of 1 , or consist of a character appended to a string that is in the dictionary .
The string that 's already in the dictionary must also have a code word associated with it .
Rather then representing the new string as old string + character , it can be represented as code word for old string + character .
In Example 1 the code 263 represents the string " his " .
Rather than creating a dictionary entry for code word 263 and " his " , an entry can be made for the code word 263 , the prefix code 257 , and byte 's ' .
Every dictionary entry consists of the code word , the prefix code , and the last character in the string .
The big advantage to this scheme is that all strings in the dictionary are stored as a small , fixed length value .
The downside to this scheme is that you need to traverse the dictionary to determine what string a code word encodes .
263 encodes 257 + 's '. 257 encodes ' h' + ' i ' .
That 's not too bad with 3 character strings , but it 's not that fun with 1000 character strings .
Still , having a known fixed length for dictionary entries outweighs the need to traverse the dictionary .
Encoding Issues
The biggest considerations when implementing the LZW encoding algorithm are :
Writing of code words that are n't an integral number of bytes .
Indicating the length of a code word .
The layout of the dictionary .
Finding string matches in the dictionary .
Inserting new strings into the dictionary .
Fortunately , writing code words was n't that big of a deal .
I have a bit file library containing functions for writing files one bit at a time .
I use the same library for all of my other compression implementations , and it works just fine for LZW .
Indicating Code Word Length
The problem of indicating how long code words are only occurs when variable length code words are used .
If fixed length code words are used , there 's no question about how many bits the decoder should use when reading the encoded data .
I 'm not sure what the common practice is for variable length code words and leaving hints that allow the decoder to recognize a code word length change .
My implementation is based on some ideas that kept me up one night , and it works just fine .
There are two observations that lead me to my implementation :
Code words may be n bits long until the encoder is required to write a code word that needs n + 1 bits to represent it .
The indication that n + 1 bits are needed must be n bits long , because decoder is still reading n bits at time .
With those observations , everything fell into place .
When the encoder needs n + 1 bits to write out a code word , it writes an n bit indicator .
Then all code words from that indicator until the next indicator will be written using n + 1 bits .
Once an indicator signals increased code word size , there is no way to decrease code word size .
For my indicator I use a code word of all ones at the current code word length .
The consequence of using an all ones indicator is that the code word represented by that value also requires an extra bit .
Suppose the encoder is using 9 bits and it needs to output the code word 511 .
511 is 9 bits of all ones .
A single 511 will cause the decoder to switch to reading 10 bit code words without decoding code word 511 .
To get around this , the encoder must write an indicator ( 511 in this case ) to switch to 10 bits , then it must write the code word 511 using 10 bits .
Version 0.2 of my implementation starts out using 9 bit code words and allows the code word length to grow to 15 bits .
Dictionary Layout
Determining the layout of the dictionary most definitely impacts finding and inserting strings .
The dictionary stores strings represented as a code word prefix and a byte suffix .
Initially , the dictionary will contain one entry for every one character string .
However , the number of strings in the dictionary may grow as the encoding process proceeds .
Fortunately there is an upper bound on the number of strings that may be in the dictionary .
If code words are n bits long , there can only be 2n unique code words .
The only real requirement for an LZW dictionary is that it can store 2n code word / string pairs .
It seemed natural to use an array of 2n code word / string entries to me .
I started out with a dictionary that was an array of 2n entries , but as I started playing with the algorithm I realized that all strings 1 byte long are encoded by the value of the byte .
It 's much faster to just write out the value of the byte than it is to look them up in the dictionary .
So my implementation uses an array based dictionary only stores up to ( 2n - 256 ) strings .
Single byte strings were handled without using the dictionary .
As natural as an array based dictionary seems , it can be really slow to search when the dictionary fills up ( see below ) .
Recently I have replaced the array based dictionary with a binary tree based dictionary to speed up average search time .
Anybody who has seen a binary tree should be comfortable with my implementation .
Searching for and Inserting Strings in Dictionary
Though being able to store all the code words is the only real dictionary requirement , the ability to perform fast search and insertion operations is also desirable .
Every time the encoding algorithm reads a byte , it appends it to a string that it is building .
The first thing it does with the string is look for it in the dictionary .
If the string is n't in the dictionary and the dictionary is n't full , the encoding algorithm will insert the string into the dictionary .
There is one dictionary search for each byte in the uncoded data stream , and there will be one insertion for each new code word .
The simplest way to search an array based dictionary is by brute force , from start to finish .
Similarly the simplest way to insert strings into the dictionary is to start at the beginning and keep looking until an empty location is found .
These simple brute force approaches are O ( N ) , where N is the number of code words ( which is O ( 2n ) where n is the number of bits in a code word ) .
It would really be nice to have something faster without adding much computational overhead .
Others have successfully used hashing to speed up searches and insertions .
The ideal hash function will make searching and insertion O ( 1 ) operations .
I have n't come up with that function yet .
Rather than being creative I used a simple function to generate a hash key that is used as an initial index into the dictionary .
First I shifted the string 's code prefix by 8 bits and OR in it 's final character .
That gives me an n + 8 bit number .
I used that number modulo the size of the dictionary to get my initial key .
key = ( codeWord << 8 ) | lastCharacter ;
key = key % dictionary Size ;
The first dictionary index I checked is the value of the key .
Unfortunately collisions are possible .
In the case of searching for a match , a collision occurs when there 's a string already located in the dictionary position , but it does n't match the string that we 're looking for .
My collision resolution was simple , but no more efficient than a brute force source .
I search the next dictionary indices until I 've either : found a match , searched the entire dictionary , or found an empty dictionary location .
If the dictionary is full , the array based algorithm will take O ( N ) searches to discover that a string is not in the dictionary .
I realized that I could increase the size of the dictionary array , so that it will always include empty entries and stop the search if I arrive at an empty entry , but that just cuts the search time to an average of O ( N / 2 ) .
Rather than using a larger array , I chose to use a binary tree .
It takes an average of O ( log ( N ) ) searches to discover that a string is n't in the full dictionary .
I 'm not making much of an effort to balance my tree , so worst case is still O ( N ) , but I do n't think there will be many naturally occurring data streams that produce that result .
In order to keep the binary tree close to balanced , dictionary entries are ordered using a simple key .
I append the code for the prefix sting to the MS nibble of the new character , then I append the LS nibble to that .
key = ( lastCharacter & 0xF0 ) << ( codeWordLength )
key |= ( prefix << 4 ) ;
key |= ( lastCharacter & 0x0 F )
It 's possible that I may have future code release using balanced trees .
But that will take motivation and time .
One nice side effect of these methods are that they do n't require any additional work to find an insertion location for a new string .
Strings are only inserted into the dictionary when a match is n't found and there is room to insert the string .
If the array based search algorithm ends because it found an empty dictionary location , there was n't a match and the dictionary is n't full .
The new string and its new code word is inserted into the empty dictionary location where the search algorithm stopped .
In the case of the tree based search , when it ends without a match , the new entry is inserted as the child of the leaf where the search ended .
Idea for Super- fast Search / Insertion
The whole dictionary search and insertion process may be trivialized by increasing the size of the dictionary so that it has one index for every possible code word prefix / byte suffix string .
If code words are n bits long , then there are 2n + 8 different possible strings ; no more than 2n of which will actually be used .
The dictionary can then be implemented as a 2n + 8 array , where each entry is either empty or contains the code word for the code word prefix / byte suffix pair represented by that index .
Decoding Issues
The biggest considerations when implementing the LZW decoding algorithm are :
Reading of code words that are n't an integral number of bytes .
Determining the length of a code word .
The layout of the dictionary .
Decoding code words to strings .
As with writing code words , reading code words was n't that big of a deal .
I use my bit file library here too .
Determining Code Word Length
The problem of determining the length of code words is only an issue when variable length code words are allowed .
In the section on encoding , I discuss a method that uses an all ones indicator when code word bit lengths are to increase by one .
When my decoder reads a code word that is all ones bits , it must increase the code word length by one bit without decoding that code word .
All code words that follow are read using the new length and operation proceeds normally .
Version 0.2 of my implementation starts out using 9 bit code words and allows the code word length to grow to 15 bits .
Dictionary Layout
The dictionary organization used for encoding would work just fine for decoding , however it 's more complicated then it needs to be .
During the encoding process strings are created and the dictionary is searched to see if code words already exits for that string .
The decoding algorithm reads the encoded stream 1 code word at a time and uses the dictionary to find out how to decode a code word .
Simply restated , encoding searches the dictionary based on string value .
Decoding searches the dictionary based on code word value .
My decoding dictionary is just an array of 2n strings where the array index is the code word that encodes the string .
Decoding Code Words into Strings
After it reads a code word , the decoding algorithm will look up the code word in the dictionary and write out the encoded string that it encodes .
Normally that would n't be an issue .
However , strings in the dictionary are stored as a prefix code word + a suffix byte .
In order to decode a code word into a string of bytes , the prefix code of the string must also be decoded .
The process of decoding prefix strings continues until a prefix string decodes to a 1 byte string .
The process of decoding strings builds the string being decoded in reverse order .
The processes of decoding code words into another code word and a byte and writing all the bytes out in the reverse order of their decoding made me think of recursion .
I do n't have much of an opportunity to use recursion in my paying job , so the idea of implementing a recursive decode routine seemed " fun " .
If you 'd rather avoid recursion , store the decoded characters into an array that is at least 2n - 256 bytes long , then write out the results in reverse order .

He even provides source for a slightly different implementation .

Actual Software
I am releasing my implementations of the LZW algorithm under the LGPL .
If you 've actually read this page to get all the way down here , you already know that I have different implementations .
As I add enhancements or fix bugs , I will post them here as newer versions .
The larger the version number , the newer the version .
I 'm retaining the older versions for historical reasons .
I recommend that most people download the newest version unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise .
Each version is contained in its own zipped archive which includes the source files and brief instructions for building an executable .
None of the archives contain executable programs .
A copy of the archives may be obtained by clicking on the links below .
Portability
All the source code that I have provided is written in strict ANSI C .
I would expect it to build correctly on any machine with an ANSI C compiler .
I have tested the code compiled with gcc on Linux and mingw on Windows XP .
The software makes no assumptions about the endianess of the machine that it is executing on .
However , it does make some assumptions about the size of data types .
The software makes use of the #if and #error pre-processor directives as an attempt to check for violations of my assumptions at compile time .

Most women , even those who dream of having children , are afraid of childbirth .
It hurts much , you never know how long it will last and if there will appear complications .
My nephew ’s birth lasted about 7 hours , my sister - in - law , his mother , says , it was complicated , exhausting and very painful .
This is why anything ( that , of course , does n’t harm the baby ) that could help ease the pain and make childbirth faster is a dream of every pregnant woman .
Here ’s something that does help .
Brazilian scientists found out that taking water aerobics , or aqua aerobics , classes during pregnancy help significantly ease the childbirth pain as well as speed up the overall process .
Scientists from the University of Campinas ( Sao Paulo ) held a study which examined future mothers ( 71 women in total ) .
Half of the participants took 50 - minute exercise sessions at the pool three times a week .
According to the results , 27 % of women who exercised water aerobics required painkillers during childbirth , while this number in the control group was about 65 % .
Aqua aerobics and swimming are considered the most suitable types of fitness for the pregnancy period .
Water removes pressure from the spine , joints , and ligaments and provides optimal pressure on the pregnant woman ’s muscles and cardiovascular system .
In addition , pool exercises help relieve stress and learn how to breathe rhythmically .

NBC Invites Skeptics to Believe In Angels
Please watch this video from this 12/23/2008 episode of NBC's Today show .
We , as skeptics , are specifically invited by NBC to reconsider our belief that angels are unproven in light of new evidence .
In short , a woman sees an angel on a security camera monitor , and her daughter –who has just been taken off life support–recovers .
What could explain this other than angels ?
How about .. a poorly adjusted camera , medical science , and the natural ability of a body to heal itself ?
I see no evidence of angels there .
In fact , I do n't even know what an angel is .
Fortunately , NBC chose to ask that question , and the answer given by the post - modernist rabbi was ultimately " they can be anything . "
How nice .
I think I 'll stick with believing the only actual angels are ballplayers from Anaheim .
But let 's consider the facts here , as presented by this online version of the same story .
Chelsea Banton was born premature , has suffered from pneumonia many times in her life , and when the doctors said they could do no more , they removed life support and she started to recover .
And the credit for this goes to angels and god .
Why is it so easy for people to ignore the fact that doctors kept this child alive using the applied science of modern medicine ?
Why do n't the doctors get any credit at all ?
It angers me when a spontaneous health improvement occurs , and the doctors are portrayed as impotent and cowering in the presence of a miracle .
If miracles like this are real , why do we have doctors at all ?
In fact , what 's to explain the anti-miracle of the premature birth ?
It 's best not to speculate too much on these things .
I understand what they 're trying to do , and ultimately the rabbi is correct in one regard .
It promotes happiness to assume a stance of thankfulness in the wake of a tragedy .
I think that 's true .. and I really have no problem with it .
I was in a nearly fatal car accident in 1986 , and my immediate response was to climb out of the wreck , take my guitar onto the roof , and play the closing song from Harold and Maude .
Yeah , the cops asked my girlfriend ( at the time ) if I was OK , but in the end , it made us both smile .
The car was a wreck , but we were alive and we chose to be happy .
I think it was a positive and healthy response , and there were no angels or divine intervention in attendance .
My thanks go to the people who designed the guard rails and to Datsun , who built a very safe car .
I owe every happy moment since to those people .
So congratulations to Chelsea Banton and her family .
I wish them well , and hope the recovery contiues .
I also hope they take some time to thank the doctors who 've kept her alive all these years .
And I hope the hospital has taken the time to adjust that camera , or that CRT is going to suffer from terrible burn -in .
Essay
In the year 1929 I spent several weeks in the H�pital X , in the fifteenth
ARRONDISSEMENT of Paris .
The clerks put me through the usual third - degree
at the reception desk , and indeed I was kept answering questions for some
twenty minutes before they would let me in .
If you have ever had to fill
up forms in a Latin country you will know the kind of questions I mean .
For some days past I had been unequal to translating Reaumur into
Fahrenheit , but I know that my temperature was round about 103 , and by
the end of the interview I had some difficulty in standing on my feet .
At
my back a resigned little knot of patients , carrying bundles done up in
coloured handkerchiefs , waited their turn to be questioned .
After the questioning came the bath - - a compulsory routine for all
newcomers , apparently , just as in prison or the workhouse .
My clothes
were taken away from me , and after I had sat shivering for some minutes
in five inches of warm water I was given a linen nightshirt and a short
blue flannel dressing - gown -- no slippers , they had none big enough for
me , they said -- and led out into the open air .
This was a night in
February and I was suffering from pneumonia .
The ward we were going to
was 200 yards away and it seemed that to get to it you had to cross the
hospital grounds .
Someone stumbled in front of me with a lantern .
The
gravel path was frosty underfoot , and the wind whipped the nightshirt
round my bare calves .
When we got into the ward I was aware of a strange
feeling of familiarity whose origin I did not succeed in pinning down
till later in the night .
It was a long , rather low , ill - lit room , full of
murmuring voices and with three rows of beds surprisingly close together .
There was a foul smell , faecal and yet sweetish .
As I lay down I saw on a
bed nearly opposite me a small , round - shouldered , sandy - haired man
sitting half naked while a doctor and a student performed some strange
operation on him .
First the doctor produced from his black bag a dozen
small glasses like wine glasses , then the student burned a match inside
each glass to exhaust the air , then the glass was popped on to the man's
back or chest and the vacuum drew up a huge yellow blister .
Only after
some moments did I realize what they were doing to him .
It was something
called cupping , a treatment which you can read about in old medical
text - books but which till then I had vaguely thought of as one of those
things they do to horses .
The cold air outside had probably lowered my temperature , and I watched
this barbarous remedy with detachment and even a certain amount of
amusement .
The next moment , however , the doctor and the student came
across to my bed , hoisted me upright and without a word began applying
the same set of glasses , which had not been sterilized in any way .
A few
feeble protests that I uttered got no more response than if I had been an
animal .
I was very much impressed by the impersonal way in which the two
men started on me .
I had never been in the public ward of a hospital
before , and it was my first experience of doctors who handle you without
speaking to you or , in a human sense , taking any notice of you .
They only
put on six glasses in my case , but after doing so they scarified the
blisters and applied the glasses again .
Each glass now drew about a
dessert - spoonful of dark - coloured blood .
As I lay down again , humiliated ,
disgusted and frightened by the thing that had been done to me , I
reflected that now at least they would leave me alone .
But no , not a bit
of it .
There was another treatment .
coming , the mustard poultice ,
seemingly a matter of routine like the hot bath .
Two slatternly nurses
had already got the poultice ready , and they lashed it round my chest as
tight as a strait - jacket while some men who were wandering about the ward
in shirt and trousers began to collect round my bed with half - sympathetic
grins .
I learned later that watching a patient have a mustard poultice
was a favourite pastime in the ward .
These things are normally applied
for a quarter of an hour and certainly they are funny enough if you do n't
happen to be the person inside .
For the first five minutes the pain is
severe , but you believe you can bear it .
During the second five minutes
this belief evaporates , but the poultice is buckled at the back and you
ca n't get it off .
This is the period the onlookers enjoy most .
During the
last five minutes , I noted , a sort of numbness supervenes .
After the
poultice had been removed a waterproof pillow packed with ice was thrust
beneath my head and I was left alone .
I did not sleep , and to the best of
my knowledge this was the only night of my life -- I mean the only night
spent in bed -- in which I have not slept at all , not even a minute .
During my first hour in the H�pital X I had had a whole series of
different and contradictory treatments , but this was misleading , for in
general you got very little treatment at all , either good or bad , unless
you were ill in some interesting and instructive way .
At five in the
morning the nurses came round , woke the patients and took their
temperatures , but did not wash them .
If you were well enough you washed
yourself , otherwise you depended on the kindness of some walking patient .
It was generally patients , too , who carried the bedbottles and die grim
bedpan , nicknamed LA CASSEROLE .
At eight breakfast arrived , called
army - fashion LA SOUPE .
It was soup , too , a thin vegetable soup with slimy
hunks of bread floating about in it .
Later in the day the tall , solemn ,
black - bearded doctor made his rounds , with an INTERNE and a troop of
students following at his heels , but there were about sixty of us in the
ward and it was evident that he had other wards to attend to as well .
There were many beds past which he walked day after day , sometimes
followed by imploring cries .
On the other hand if you had some disease
with which the students wanted to familiarize themselves you got plenty
of attention of a kind .
I myself , with an exceptionally fine specimen of
a bronchial rattle , sometimes had as many as a dozen students queuing up
to listen to my chest .
It was a very queer feeling -- queer , I mean ,
because of their intense interest in learning their job , together with a
seeming lack of any perception that the patients were human beings .
It is
strange to relate , but sometimes as some young student stepped forward to
take his turn at manipulating you he would be actually tremulous with
excitement , like a boy who has at last got his hands on some expensive
piece of machinery .
And then ear after ear - - ears of young men , of girls ,
of negroes -- pressed against your back , relays of fingers solemnly but
clumsily tapping , and not from any one of them did you get a word of
conversation or a look direct in your face .
As a non-paying patient , in
the uniform nightshirt , you were primarily A SPECIMEN , a thing I did not
resent but could never quite get used to .
After some days I grew well enough to sit up and study the surrounding
patients .
The stuffy room , with its narrow beds so close together that
you could easily touch your neighbour 's hand , had every sort of disease
in it except , I suppose , acutely infectious cases .
My right - hand
neighbour was a little red -haired cobbler with one leg shorter than the
other , who used to announce the death of any other patient ( this happened
a number of times , and my neighbour was always the first to hear of it )
by whistling to me , exclaiming " NUM�RO 43 ! " ( or whatever it was ) and
flinging his arms above his head .
This man had not much wrong with him ,
but in most of the other beds within my angle of vision some squalid
tragedy or some plain horror was being enacted .
In the bed that was foot
to foot with mine there lay , until he died ( I did n't see him die -- they
moved him to another bed ) , a little weazened man who was suffering from I
do not know what disease , but something that made his whole body so
intensely sensitive that any movement from side to side , sometimes even
the weight of the bedclothes , would make him shout out with pain .
His
worst suffering was when he urinated , which he did with the greatest
difficulty .
A nurse would bring him the bedbottle and then for a long
time stand beside his bed , whistling , as grooms are said to do with
horses , until at last with an agonized shriek of " Je fissel " he would get
started .
In the bed next to him the sandy - haired man whom I had seen
being cupped used to cough up blood - streaked mucus at all hours .
My
left - hand neighbour was a tall , flaccid - looking young man who used
periodically to have a tube inserted into his back and astonishing
quantities of frothy liquid drawn off from some part of his body .
In the
bed beyond that a veteran of the war of 1870 was dying , a handsome old
man with a white imperial , round whose bed , at all hours when visiting
was allowed , four elderly female relatives dressed all in black sat
exactly like crows , obviously scheming for some pitiful legacy .
In the
bed opposite me in the farther row was an old bald - headed man with
drooping moustaches and greatly swollen face and body , who was suffering
from some disease that made him urinate almost incessantly .
A huge glass
receptacle stood always beside his bed .
One day his wife and daughter
came to visit him .
At sight of them the old man 's bloated face lit up
with a smile of surprising sweetness , and as his daughter , a pretty girl
of about twenty , approached the bed I saw that his hand was slowly
working its way from under the bedclothes .
I seemed to see in advance the
gesture that was coming -- the girl kneeling beside the bed , the old man's
hand laid on her head in his dying blessing .
But no , he merely handed her
the bedbottle , which she promptly took from him and emptied into the
receptacle .
About a dozen beds away from me was Num�ro 57 -- I think that was his
number -- a cirrhosis - of - the - liver case .
Everyone in the ward knew him by
sight because he was sometimes the subject of a medical lecture .
On two
afternoons a week the tall , grave doctor would lecture in the ward to a
party of students , and on more than one occasion old NUM�RO 57 was
wheeled in on a sort of trolley into the middle of the ward , where the
doctor would roll back his nightshirt , dilate with his fingers a huge
flabby protruber - ance on the man 's belly -- the diseased liver , I suppose
-- and explain solemnly that this was a disease attributable to
alcoholism , commoner in the wine - drinking countries .
As usual he neither
spoke to his patient nor gave him a smile , a nod or any kind of
recognition .
While he talked , very grave and upright , he would hold the
wasted body beneath his two hands , sometimes giving it a gentle roll to
and fro , in just the attitude of a woman handling a rolling - pin .
Not that
NUM�RO 57 minded this kind of thing .
Obviously he was an old hospital
inmate , a regular exhibit at lectures , his liver long since marked down
for a bottle in some pathological museum .
Utterly uninterested in what
was said about him , he would lie with his colourless eyes gazing at
nothing , while the doctor showed him off like a piece of antique china .
He was a man of about sixty , astonishingly shrunken .
His face , pale as
vellum , had shrunken away till it seemed no bigger than a doll's .
One morning my cobbler neighbour woke me up plucking at my pillow before
the nurses arrived .
" NUM�RO 57 ! " -- he flung his arms above his head .
There was a light in the ward , enough to see by .
I could see old NUM�RO
57 lying crumpled up on his side , his face sticking out over the side of
the bed , and towards me .
He had died some rime during the night , nobody
knew when .
When the nurses came they received the news of his death
indifferendy and went about their work .
After a long dme , an hour or
more , two other nurses marched in abreast like soldiers , with a great
clumping of sabots , and knotted the corpse up in the sheets , but it was
not removed till some dme later .
Meanwhile , in the better light , I had
had time for a good look at NUM �RO 57 .
Indeed I lay on my side to look at
him .
Curiously enough he was the first dead European I had seen .
I had
seen dead men before , but always Asiatics and usually people who had died
violent deaths .
NUM�RO 57's eyes were still open , his mouth also open ,
his small face contorted into an expression of agony .
What most impressed
me , however , was the whiteness of his face .
It had been pale before , but
now it was little darker than die sheets .
As I gazed at the tiny ,
screwed - up face it struck me that dlis disgusting piece of refuse ,
waiting to be carted away and dumped on a slab in the dissecting room ,
was an example of " natural " death , one of the things you pray for in the
Litany .
There you are , then , I thought , that 's what is waiting for you ,
twenty , thirty , forty years hence : that is how the lucky ones die , the
ones who live to be old .
One wants to live , of course , indeed one only
stays alive by virtue of the fear of death , but I think now , as I thought
then , that it 's better to die violently and not too old .
People talk
about the horrors of war , but what weapon has man invented that even
approaches in cruelty some of the commoner diseases ?
" Natural " death ,
almost by definition , means something slow , smelly and painful .
Even at
that , it makes a difference if you can achieve it in your own home and
not in a public institution .
This poor old wretch who had just flickered
out like a candle - end was not even important enough to have anyone
watching by his deathbed .
He was merely a number , then a " subject " for
the students ' scalpels .
And the sordid publicity of dying in such a
place !
In the H�pital X the beds were very close together and there were
no screens .
Fancy , for instance , dying like the little man whose bed was
for a while foot to foot with mine , the one who cried out when the
bedclothes touched him !
I dare say " JE PISSE ! " were his last recorded
words .
Perhaps the dying do n't bother about such things -- that at least
would be the standard answer : nevertheless dying people are often more or
less normal in their minds till within a day or so of the end .
In the public wards of a hospital you see horrors that you do n't seem to
meet with among people who manage to die in their own homes , as though
certain diseases only attacked people at the lower income levels .
But it
is a fact that you would not in any English hospitals see some of the
things I saw in the H�pital X . This business of people just dying like
animals , for instance , with nobody standing by , nobody interested , the
death not even noticed till the morning -- this happened more than once .
You certainly would not see that in England , and still less would you see
a corpse left exposed to the view of the other patients .
I remember that
once in a cottage hospital in England a man died while we were at tea ,
and though there were only six of us in the ward the nurses managed
things so adroitly that the man was dead and his body removed without our
even hearing about it till tea was over .
A thing we perhaps underrate in
England is the advantage we enjoy in having large numbers of well - trained
and rigidly - disciplined nurses .
No doubt English nurses are dumb enough ,
they may tell fortunes with tea-leaves , wear Union Jack badges and keep
photographs of the Queen on their mantelpieces , but at least they do n't
let you lie unwashed and constipated on an unmade bed , out of sheer
laziness .
The nurses at the H�pital X still had a tinge of Mrs Gamp about
them , and later , in the military hospitals of Republican Spain , I was to
see nurses almost too ignorant to take a temperature .
You would n't ,
either , see in England such dirt as existed in the H�pital X. Later on ,
when I was well enough to wash myself in the bathroom , I found that there
was kept there a huge packing case into which the scraps of food and
dirty dressings from the ward were flung , and the wainscodngs were
infested by crickets .
When I had got back my clothes and grown strong on
my legs I fled from the H�pital X , before my time was up and without
waiting for a medical discharge .
It was not the only hospital I have fled
from , but its gloom and bareness , its sickly smell and , above all ,
something in its mental atmosphere stand out in my memory as exceptional .
I had been taken there because it was the hospital belonging to my
ARRONDISSEMENT , and I did not learn till after I was in it that it bore a
bad reputation .
A year or two later the celebrated swindler , Madame
Han-aud , who was ill while on remand , was taken to the H�pital X , and
after a few days of it she managed to elude her guards , took a taxi and
drove back to the prison , explaining that she was more comfortable there .
I have no doubt that the H�pital X was quite untypical of French
hospitals even at that date .
But the patients , nearly all of them working
men , were surprisingly resigned .
Some of them seemed to find the
conditions almost comfortable , for at least two were destitute
malingerers who found this a good way of getting through the winter .
The
nurses connived because the malingerers made themselves useful by doing
odd jobs .
But the attitude of the majority was : of course this is a lousy
place , but what else do you expect ?
It did not seem strange to them that
you should be woken at five and then wait three hours before starting the
day on watery soup , or that people should die with no one at their
bedside , or even that your chance of getting medical attention should
depend on catching the doctor 's eye as he went past .
According to their
traditions that was what hospitals were like .
If you are seriously ill
and if you are too poor to be treated in your own home , then you must go
into hospital , and once there you must put up with harshness and
discomfort , just as you would in the army .
But on top of this I was
interested to find a lingering belief in the old stories that have now
almost faded from memory in England - - stories , for instance , about
doctors cutting you open out of sheer curiosity or thinking it funny to
start operating before you were properly " under " .
There were dark tales
about a little operating - room said to be situated just beyond the
bathroom .
Dreadful screams were said to issue from this room .
I saw
nothing to confirm these stories and no doubt they were all nonsense ,
though I did see two students kill a sixteen - year - old boy , or nearly kill
him ( he appeared to be dying when I left the hospital , but he may have
recovered later ) by a mischievous experiment which they probably could
not have tried on a paying patient .
Well within living memory it used to
be believed in London that in some of the big hospitals patients were
killed off to get dissection subjects .
I did n't hear this tale repeated
at the H�pital X , but I should think some of the men there would have
found it credible .
For it was a hospital in which not the methods ,
perhaps , but something of the atmosphere of the nineteenth century had
managed to survive , and therein lay its peculiar interest .
During the past fifty years or so there has been a great change in the
relationship between doctor and patient .
If you look at almost any
literature before the later part of the nineteenth century , you find that
a hospital is popularly regarded as much the same thing as a prison , and
an old - fashioned , dungeon - like prison at that .
A hospital is a place of
filth , torture and death , a sort of antechamber to the tomb .
No one who
was not more or less destitute would have thought of going into such a
place for treatment .
And especially in the early part of the last
century , when medical science had grown bolder than before without being
any more successful , the whole business of doctoring was looked on with
horror and dread by ordinary people .
Surgery , in particular , was believed
to be no more than a peculiarly gruesome form of sadism , and dissection ,
possible only with the aid of bodysnatchers , was even confused with
necromancy .
From the nineteenth century you could collect a large
horror - literature connected with doctors and hospitals .
Think of poor old
George III , in his dotage , shrieking for mercy as he sees his surgeons
approaching to " bleed him till he faints " !
Think of the conversations of
Bob Sawyer and Benjamin Alien , which no doubt are hardly parodies , or the
field hospitals in LA D�B�CLE and WAR AND PEACE , or that shocking
description of an amputation in Melville 's WHITEJACKET !
Even the names
given to doctors in nineteenth - century English fiction , Slasher , Carver ,
Sawyer , Fillgrave and so on , and the generic nickname " sawbones " , are
about as grim as they are comic .
The anti-surgery tradition is perhaps
best expressed in Tennyson 's poem , The Children 's Hospital , which is
essentially a pre-chloroform document though it seems to have been
written as late as 1880 .
Moreover , the outlook which Tennyson records in
this poem had a lot to be said for it .
When you consider what an
operation without anaesthetics must have been like , what it notoriously
WAS like , it is difficult not to suspect the motives of people who would
undertake such things .
For these bloody horrors which the students so
eagerly looked forward to ( " A magnificent sight if Slasher does it ! " )
were admittedly more or less useless : the patient who did not die of
shock usually died of gangrene , a result which was taken for granted .
Even now doctors can be found whose motives are questionable .
Anyone who
has had much illness , or who has listened to medical students talking ,
will know what I mean .
But anaesthetics were a turning point , and
disinfectants were another .
Nowhere in the world , probably would you now
see the kind of scene described by Axel Munthe in THE STORY OF SAN
MICHELE , when the sinister surgeon in top hat and frock coat , his
starched shirtfront spattered with blood and pus , carves up patient after
patient with the same knife and flings the severed limbs into a pile
beside the table .
Moreover , the national health insurance has partly done
away with the idea that a working - class patient is a pauper who deserves
little consideration .
Well into this century it was usual for " free "
patients at the big hospitals to have their teeth extracted with no
anaesthetic .
They did n't pay , so why should they have an anaesthetic --
that was the attitude .
That too has changed .
And yet every institution will always bear upon it some lingering memory
of its past .
A barrack - room is still haunted by the ghost of Kipling , and
it is difficult to enter a workhouse without being reminded of OLIVER
TWIST .
Hospitals began as a kind of casual ward for lepers and the like
to die in , and they continued as places where medical students learned
their art on the bodies of the poor .
You can still catch a faint
suggestion of their history in their characteristically gloomy
architecture .
I would be far from complaining about the treatment I have
received in any English hospital , but I do know that it is a sound
instinct that warns people to keep out of hospitals if possible , and
especially out of the public wards .
Whatever the legal position may be ,
it is unquestionable that you have far less control over your own
treatment , far less certainty that frivolous experiments will not be
tried on you , when it is a case of " accept the discipline or get out " .
And it is a great thing to die in your own bed , though it is better still
to die in your boots .
However great the kindness and the efficiency , in
every hospital death there will be some cruel , squalid detail , something
perhaps too small to be told but leaving terribly painful memories
behind , arising out of the haste , the crowding , the impersonality of a
place where every day people are dying among strangers .
The dread of hospitals probably still survives among the very poor , and
in all of us it has only recently disappeared .
It is a dark patch not far
beneath the surface of our minds .
I have said earlier that when I entered
the ward at the H�pital X I was conscious of a strange feeling of
familiarity .
What the scene reminded me of , of course , was the reeking ,
pain - filled hospitals of the nineteenth century , which I had never seen
but of which I had a traditional knowledge .
And something , perhaps the
black - clad doctor with his frowsy black bag , or perhaps only the sickly
smell , played the queer trick of unearthing from my memory that poem of
Tennyson's , The Children 's Hospital , which I had not thought of for
twenty years .
It happened that as a child I had had it read aloud to me
by a sick - nurse whose own working life might have stretched back to the
time when Tennyson wrote the poem .
The horrors and sufferings of the
old - style hospitals were a vivid memory to her .
We had shuddered over the
poem together , and then seemingly I had forgotten it .
Even its name would
probably have recalled nothing to me .
But the first glimpse of the
ill - lit murmurous room , with the beds so close together , suddenly roused
the train of thought to which it belonged , and in the night that followed
I found myself remembering the whole story and atmosphere of the poem ,
with many of its lines complete .

Completely redesigned user interface
Tight integration with online services such as Magnatune , Jamendo , MP3tunes , Last.fm and Shoutcast
Completely overhauled scripting API and plugin support to allow better integration into Amarok
Migration from the KDE 3 to KDE 4 framework , and utilization of core technologies such as Solid , Phonon , and Plasma
The world of digital music management has changed a great deal since the birth of Amarok four and a half years ago .
Amarok 1 established a reputation for innovation , but maintaining development with the old framework became more difficult as Amarok grew , often in directions we never imagined .
KDE4 brings many new technologies and design patterns , and we decided to use this opportunity to improve upon Amarok 's original design .
We thought about how to best design a program that would allow us to stay at the cutting edge of digital music management .
We also sought to distinguish Amarok in an increasingly saturated market of music players .
To achieve this we took the best ideas from the 1.x series , and brainstormed what else we could do to help our users " rediscover music " .
And then we started developing .
Now , after two years of development , we are proud to announce that Amarok 2 has arrived .
This arrival is just the beginning .
This new version brings with it a lot of changes :
The user interface has been redesigned to make context information like lyrics and albums from the same artist more accessible and allow you to decide which information you want to see by adding applets to the Context View in the middle .
The new Biased Playlists offer a way to let Amarok take care of your playlist in an intelligent way similar to Dynamic Playlists in previous versions .
A new service framework allows for a tight integration of online services like Jamendo , Magnatune and Ampache .
New services can easily be added via GetHotNewStuff in Amarok or from kde - apps.org .
More applets and scripts are being worked on and users are welcome to contribute more to make Amarok suit their needs .
The migration from the KDE 3 to KDE 4 framework allows us to make use of technologies like Plasma , Phonon and Solid which make Amarok easier to use and maintain and ready for the future of music on your computer and on the internet .
These are only some of the great new features of Amarok 2 .
Give it a try !
It is important to note that Amarok 2.0 is a beginning , not an end .
Because of the major changes required , not all features from the 1.4 are in Amarok 2 .
Many of these missing features , like queueing and filtering in the playlist , will return within a few releases .
Other features , such as visualizations and support for portable media players , require improvements in the underlying KDE infrastructure .
They will return as KDE4's support improves .
Some features , such as the player window or support for databases other than MySQL , have been removed because either they posed insurmountable programming problems , or they did n't fit our design decisions about how to distinguish Amarok in a saturated market of music players .
Amarok 2.0 is now available for all major Linux distributions .
KDE4 is still under heavy development especially on Windows and Mac OS X , and Amarok 2 is available as a " Beta " version on those platforms .
In the coming months , we expect to regularly release a series of bugfix versions in the 2.0 series .
Work on features , both old and new , has also continued .
So while Amarok 2 has already been a long journey for the Amarok team , for you , the users , it is just beginning !
Amarok 's journey has just begun and we are excited to have you join us for this event .
Change and improvement would not have been possible without the help of everyone who contributed to this ambitious project in the form of code , promotion , documentation , donations , and a lot more .
To all of you we say : Thank You !
Please consider contributing to our fundraiser , reading the Amarok 2 FAQ and of course do n't forget to celebrate with us

Many Christians are seriously annoyed at the way the holiday season has changed .
If you are among them , you are probably already annoyed at this article , because I did n’t say Christmas season .
It is Christmas , people point out , so why ca n’t we just say that ?
I received an e-mail the other day from Amazon.com headlined , " The 12 Days of Holiday , " and the official greeting we get from store clerks is " Happy Holidays . "
In fact , there are cases in which corporate higher - ups have ordered employees not to say " Merry Christmas . "
The idea that there is a " war on Christmas " has been promoted by Bill O’Reilly and other red - state talking heads for years , and they intend to fight back by demanding that private enterprise make Christmas overt and with legislation requiring governments to use the phrase " Christmas tree . "
That a shift in the culture has taken place is beyond doubt .
But the idea that there is some war going on is completely nuts .
In wars , there is always an enemy to be destroyed .
Who or what is the enemy in this supposed war ?
You hear dark warnings about how this is due to the influence of " the Jews " or the infiltration of American life by " radical Islam . "
But more generally , another enemy has emerged : commercial society itself .
As usual , capitalism — easy enough to blame for all things we do n’t like — is coming in for a beating .
Another criticism against commerce is that it has dissed Christmas by commercializing it .
The critics do n’t seem to realize that this is actually the opposite of a war .
Commerce is bombing us with x - treme Christmas starting the day after Halloween !
So are the shock troops fighting back against the " war on Christmas " congratulating capitalism for this ?
Not at all !
They attack commerce for its greed .
No matter what the merchants do , they are in big trouble with the kvetchers .
What we need to realize is that capitalism is responsive — to an extent greater than any other institution — to the values of the public .
Americans love Christmas in every way .
We love giving and receiving gifts .
We love the music .
We love the sense of contentment and happiness and the family time that comes with it .
We love the office parties , the elves , Santa , the reindeer , and all the images of Mary and Joseph and the babe in the manger .
It is a common wish on film and in popular culture that Christmas should last all year long .
This is precisely what the commercial marketplace is fulfilling .
This is n’t an imposition , a desire to loot people as much as possible for as long as possible .
On the contrary , all this hysteria reflects the effort to give people what they want — and that happens to be a long - lasting Christmas .
$ 30 $ 12
Now , to many sectors of Christian opinion , the problem goes much deeper .
In the Roman Rite , Christmas does not actually begin until December 25th .
The time prior is a different season : Advent , which is a time of penance and preparation .
In the Eastern Rite that uses the old Julian Calendar , Christmas is celebrated on January 7 , but there are splits within this rite too , with people who prefer the new form that syncs East and West .
Meanwhile , the idea of fully embracing Christmas is actually a relatively new one within Protestant circles .
The Puritans of New England banned it and punished anyone who celebrated it .
It was also true in England after Reformation sensibilities intensified .
As late as 1874 , the famed 19th - century Protestant English preacher Charles Spurgeon wrote ,
We have no superstitious regard for times and seasons .
Certainly we do not believe in the present ecclesiastical arrangement called Christmas .
First , because we do not believe in the mass at all , but abhor it , whether it be sung in Latin or in English ; and secondly , because we find no Scriptural warrant whatever for observing any day as the birthday of the Savior ; and consequently , its observance is a superstition , because not of divine authority .
Times have changed for this tradition , almost to the point of making up for lost time !
All of this is to say that the problem of a " commercial Christmas " is n’t with capitalism as such , but with the multiplicity of values of the consuming public .
Given that there is no universal agreement on when Christmas should be celebrated , when these celebrations should begin , when they should end , or whether we should be celebrating it at all , there is no sense in blaming capitalism or some dark forces in society .
One ca n’t insist that the whole of society celebrate Christmas your way and no other way , not so long as a free economy permits a multiplicity of traditions to express themselves .
Now to the equally substantial issue of the loss of " Merry Christmas " as a seasonal greeting .
For starters , let ’s be clear that the phrase has not , in fact , been lost to commercial society .
A quick Amazon search for " Christmas " turns up many thousands of items — hardly a surprise , since Amazon is out to do business in this niche market .
And get this : a Google shopping search turns up more than 4 million hits !
This is hardly a loss of the word .
But what about the use of " Happy Holidays " in greetings and salutations from marketing e-mails and the like ?
Firms try to cast the broadest net possible .
Not everyone is a Christian , and some people are n’t drawn to the idea of Christmas at all , so it makes sense that Christmas be commercially subsumed under the broader rubric of the " holy days " generally .
This is n’t a conspiracy , but just good customer relations .
True , it makes some people angry , but you have to appreciate the difficulty that this conundrum presents for business .
They want to contribute to the spirit of the season , if only to make a buck .
But no matter what they do , there is trouble waiting .
I promise you this : the instant it turns up that they are losing more revenue by saying " Happy Holidays " than by saying " Merry Christmas , " the policy will change .
But do n’t expect that to happen anytime soon .
Our society is ever more religiously diverse , and it is the genius of a free economy that it can absorb many traditions and still retain the peace among them all .
Still , if you are n’t satisfied with this argument on capitalism ’s behalf , there is something you can do .
There are many vendors that specialize in Christmas and appeal to every conceivable sensibility .
They sell cards , trees , ornaments , icons , books , and a million other items .
There is nothing wrong with favoring them over the mass market .
Capitalism has provided room for them , too , so you can do your part by buying from them .
A final word : Christmas is the worst time of the year to enter a holy war .
Make your peace with religious diversity .
Come to understand the driving forces behind a free economy and thank God for it .
Christ was born into a world that did not yet celebrate Christmas , and the kings from the East had to lie to the magistrate about the recipient of their gifts .
Christmas can survive and thrive even if it is not culturally dominant .
To be free to practice our faith should be our prayer .

Sunday November 2 , 2008 ( foodconsumer.org ) --
A new study released in October suggests that maternal exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA ) could eliminate or decrease the sex difference in certain behavioral responses .
The study adds to a growing evidence to suggest that exposure to BPA affects behaviors or the brain among others .
Those who have paid close attention to the safety of BPA may have noticed that the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the National Toxicology Program ( NTP ) have different views on the safety of the plastic chemical .
The NTP says in its comprehensive review that " The NTP has some concern for effects on the brain , behavior , and prostate gland in fetuses , infants , and children at current human exposures to bisphenol A . "
The FDA claimed in August however that bisphenol A poses no risk based on evidence currently available and suggested more research is needed to prove or disprove the notion that BPA is toxic .
A FDA subcommittee of Science Board said Wednesday that the agency 's review on the chemical widely used in baby bottles and other plastic containers for food and beverages was inadequate or flawed .
On Friday the FDA Science Board convened to review the subcommittee ’s report and concluded that the agency was wrong when it said in August that BPA poses no health risks at current exposure levels .
In response to the panel 's conclusion , Andrew von Eschenbach , FDA commissioner , was cited by the Dow Jonesnews service as saying " Let me be clear : There 's no shame for having " your hypothesis disproved .
The problem with the FDA opinion released in August is that the agency opted not to consider the studies that found harmful health effects of BPA .
The agency 's review was largely based a few industry - sponsored studies that found no risk associated with the exposure to the chemical .
The chemical industry defended the FDA 's opinion .
Steven G. Hentges , of the American Chemistry Council 's Polycarbonate / BPA Global Group , was quoted as saying at Friday 's hearing that the FDA 's August draft assessment is " consistent with the conclusions of other scientific and government bodies worldwide , such as the European Food Safety Authority , Health Canada , the European Union , and NSF International , all of which completed or updated their assessments this year .
We rely on their conclusions , which are that polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins are safe for use in food contact applications . "
What he did not mention is that Canada has decided to ban plastic baby bottles containing BPA and several U.S. states are considering legislation to limit use of BPA in food packaging .
FDA had its own explanation about the Canadian ban in a statement released on Wednesday .
The FDA said that Canadian regulators acted " out of an abundance of caution " and " Health Canada 's assessment of bisphenol A on newborns and infants up to 18 months of age concludes that exposure levels are below the levels that could cause health effects . "
Regardless of how the government says about the safety of BPA , evidence has been building up to indicate that BPA is harmful .
Just in October this year , an Italian study published in the Environmental Research showed that maternal exposure to BPA decreased or eliminated the sex difference in certain behavioral responses .
The study authors Palanza P. and colleagues from the University of Parma also found " exposure of female mice to BPA in both adulthood or during fetal life altered subsequent maternal behavior . "
In response to the conclusion of the FDA Science Board that the FDA ’s opinion on the BPA safety is flawed , Norris Alderson , associate commissioner for science at the FDA was cited as telling DowJones that the agency may start its own research early in 2009 to determine the toxicity of BPA on babies less than 1 month old .
It is unknown when such studies could be completed and it remains also unknown how the FDA would respond to the growing evidence to suggest that BPA poses a risk to young children .
Those who are concerned about the effect of BPA may consider eliminating or limiting their use of plastic water bottles and canned foods , a health observer suggested .
This estrogenic chemical is widely used in production of polycarbonate plastic , the nice and transparent type used to bottle water and epoxy resins lining food and beverage cans and in dental sealants , according to the NTP .
BPA has already been linked to increased risk of diseases or disorders in the brain , reproductive system and immune systems .
A number of major diseases like heart disease and diabetes have been associated with BPA exposure .

Nuclear Industry Growing Without Federal Handouts
Monday , December 15 , 2008
By Jack Spencer

Handouts !
Get your handouts , here !
Seems like the only way to get a business going ( or keep it going ) today is to get help from Washington .
That is , unless you ’re in the nuclear business .
While other industries are begging for taxpayer dollars , the nuclear industry is expanding at an impressive pace — without federal subsidies .
Although no plants have been officially ordered yet , enough utilities are moving forward with plans to do so that companies that supply the components and services necessary to design , build and man those plants have begun expanding already .
Ironically , one of the anti-nuke crowd ’s favorite cracks against nuclear is that it ’s too expensive to succeed without public funds .
Yet their favorites , like wind and solar , seem utterly dependent on the government dole , while nuclear is going gangbusters .
This growth is happening throughout the supply chain .
Uranium mining companies are prospecting nationwide and seeking permits to begin operations .
Opponents often portray this as a dangerous activity , but uranium is safely mined in places like Canada and Australia and can be safely expanded in the U.S .
Once mined , uranium must be enriched so that it can be turned into fuel .
Just a few years ago , the United States had very little enrichment capacity — and what it did have was inefficient and expensive .
Fast forward to today :
Two new enrichment facilities are under construction , with two more in the works .
Nuclear fuel , of course , is n’t worth much without new reactors .
Until recently , the U.S. did n’t have much of a commercial nuclear industrial base .
Indeed , there was no domestic capacity to manufacture the large components needed to build nuclear reactors .
But all of that is changing — and fast .
In 2006 , energy technology leader Babcock & Wilcox opened its doors to commercial nuclear manufacturing .
Global nuclear giant AREVA and the American shipbuilder Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding , meanwhile , recently announced a partnership to start building heavy nuclear components .
And then there are the jobs .
While visions of “ green jobs ” dance in the heads of Washington bureaucrats , the nuclear industry is creating thousands of high - skill , high - paying actual jobs .
Westinghouse , for example , has already created more than 3,000 new jobs and will create another 2,900 for a development in Louisiana it ’s building with The Shaw Group .
This facility will be used to construct modules to build nuclear plants .
To get these jobs , people need training — and America ’s university nuclear engineering programs are expanding to meet the challenge .
While some universities like Purdue , Texas A&M , and the University of Florida are growing their nuclear programs , others , such as the University of Virginia , are reestablishing theirs .
The push to develop a skilled nuclear workforce extends well beyond universities .
Community colleges are collaborating with private companies to offer education and training in skilled and craft labor .
For example , Progress Energy recently awarded a $ 60,000 grant to Florence - Darlington Technical College ’s Advanced Welding and Cutting Center , and New Jersey - based PSEG piloted an entry - level technical - trade program at Mercer County Community College that provides training and education .
To be fair , some subsidies are teed up for new nuclear plants .
The Energy Policy
Act of 2005 authorized a handful that would help about the first five or six plants ( as well as a host of other energy technologies ) .
But even if these did “ kick - start ” the re-emergence of nuclear power in the U.S. , they are not driving this industry - wide growth .
These investments are toward something much larger .
They are the result of basic economics .
There is growing demand for clean , affordable , reliable energy .
Nuclear addresses each .
It emits nothing into the atmosphere , and all of its waste is easily contained .
Though its capital costs are high ( like most other power projects ) , its operating cost are low , which means that it ’s very affordable over time .
And unlike wind and solar , which produce energy only when the wind blows or the sun shines , nuclear power plants produce lots of energy 24/7 .
That ’s why no new subsidies are needed for nuclear energy ( or any other energy , for that matter ) .
The Energy Policy
Act is doing its job .
The industry is clearly moving now .
The government does n’t have to worry about ponying up more money .
America ’s private sector is on the job .

Dec. 7 , 2008  --
One familiar sound during the holidays is the ringing of Salvation Army bells , beckoning passersby to spread good will and compassion for their fellow man .
But for Salvation Army Capt .
Johnny Harsh , that same sound signifies quite the opposite .
It is the sound of an entire life he will likely be forced to leave behind -- all because he fell in love and found himself in opposition to church doctrine that is nearly a century and a half old .
The Salvation Army , a church established in the 1860s and widely known for its charity work , expressly forbids officers to marry non-officers of the church .
That means that Harsh , after working for the church for 14 years , will have to forfeit his job in order to marry his girlfriend and non-member , Cia .
" This ruling , like a lot of other things in other churches , is a manmade rule , " Harsh told " Good Morning America . "
" God does not look at a Salvation Army uniform . "
In the Salvation Army , officers are analogous to clergy in other faiths and , according to church doctrine " must marry another Salvation Army officer or leave his or her officer status . "
Harsh knew and obeyed the rule during his 14 years of service , but when his first wife , who was a Salvation Army officer , died earlier this year and he met Cia , he decided to speak up .
" I asked God to bring me a woman who was pretty on the outside and on the inside and that 's exactly what God did , " he said .
" Something needs to change about this and I pray every future officer that loses their spouse does n't have to endure what I 've endured . "
In defense of the church 's doctrine , which also forbids members from drinking or smoking , Salvation Army Maj .
George Hood simply cited the longstanding tradition .
" Well , there 's a lot of things that we might do that people think are bizarre or crazy , but you figure for about 145 years we 've made it work , " he said .
While the Salvation Army has taken no official action against Harsh , he said he expects to be fired next week .
" They want my stuff packed up and taken out , " he said .

Insurers lay down a smoke screen COMMENTARY
Great American Insurance Company has given a whole new meaning to the term " smoke screen . "
Not to mention the words " great American . "
Earlier this week , the Houston Chronicle 's Mary Flood reported that the Cincinnati - based insurer asked a federal court judge to help it avoid a potential $ 25 million liability in a Houston office fire last year that killed three people .
Vocational nurse Misty Ann Weaver lit the fire to hide the fact that she had n't met a paperwork deadline .
Now Great American officials are trying to hide from responsibility in the deaths , which is n't as shocking as the legal argument they 're trying to employ .
Families of the fire victims should n't be compensated for their losses since the deaths were caused by smoke inhalation instead of actual flames , the company argued in a federal court brief .
The smoke , Great American maintains , is really " pollution , " which is excluded from coverage in the policy .
For the record , the policy 's " pollution exclusion " also mentions deaths due to fumes and soot .
Adding insult
The argument is akin to denying a wind damage claim for a house flattened by a hurricane because water lapped up on the porch first .
We hear a lot about the unscrupulous doings of plaintiff 's attorneys these days .
Here 's an example of an insurance company seeking to add insult to tragedy .
The fact is , where there 's fire , there 's smoke .
Rick Flanagan , executive assistant chief at the Houston Fire Department , told me at least 80 percent of the city 's annual fire deaths are due to smoke inhalation .
And " fire , lightning and debris removal " were the No. 1 causes for homeowners ' insured losses nationwide at nearly 35 percent in 2006 , the most recent year for which statistics were available from the New York - based Insurance Information Institute .
Meanwhile , insured fire losses made up 21 percent of commercial claims in 2007 , according to the institute .
A spokeswoman for Great American did n't return my call for comment .
Another high - ranking official I happened to get on the phone would n't be quoted , but when I explained the argument his company was making in this case , he called it " very strange , " and suggested the Chronicle may have misinterpreted it .
I wish that were the case , especially for the sake of the families who have filed wrongful death and injury lawsuits .
But Great American is n't the first company to try it .
In 2004 , the Supreme Court of Connecticut ruled that smoke that killed children in a house fire did n't qualify for the " pollution exclusion " and forced Allstate to pay the claim , said Tom Baker , an insurance law expert at the University of Pennsylvania Law School .
In that case , however , the word " smoke " was n't explicitly mentioned in the " pollution exclusion " like it is in the Great American policy , Baker said .
The Kansas Supreme Court came to a similar decision in 1997 , ruling that a pollution exclusion in a Northwestern Pacific Indemnity Company policy would n't help it avoid liability in fire losses suffered by a group of grocers .
In a brief stemming from that case , a plaintiff 's attorney accused NPIC of " unmitigated audacity " to insist on a literal interpretation of the policy .
" Do you really believe , " the brief states , " someone would buy an insurance policy which covers flame damage , but not damage caused by the smoke generated from a flame ? "
Common sense leads you to one answer .
Greed leads to another .
" In the kind of gladiator idea of litigation , it 's anything you can do until the Supreme Court of Texas says you can't , " said Baker .
He says property insurance basically originated centuries ago with fire insurance .
And the " pollution exclusion " originated after oil spills in the 1970s .
It was intended — surprise — to apply to real pollution and , for example , corporations whose actions led to scandalous pollution events .
The temptation to employ it to avoid responsibility was apparently too tempting for some companies .
Even Great American , an operation that traces its roots back to 1872 , and claims on its
Web site to be a " trusted " specialty insurance partner whose employees " are expected to conduct themselves with integrity in a legal , ethical and moral manner . "
What 's ethical and moral about not honoring fire insurance claims unless the victims literally burn to death ?
For the sake of every property insurance policyholder in Texas , let 's hope it's an argument U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal does n't hesitate to stamp out .

0. Arrows Albert Y. C. Lai
What Are Arrows ?
Many Haskellers begin by asking " what are arrows ? " I wo n't answer this question .
It distracts from the theory and practice .
First Arrow Program
Take a deep breath .
Now we plunge right into our first program using arrows .
Do n't panic !
It is short , and I will explain what it does and why .
So , take a deep breath again , and here we go !
You can also download it as lesson - 0.hs .
import Text.XML.HXT .
Core play :: Integer -> IO ( ) play arg = do { results <- runX ( dumb arg ) ; print results } dumb :: Integer -> IOSArrow XmlTree Integer dumb n = arr ( const n ) <+> arr ( const ( n+1 ) ) >>> returnA <+> arr (* 2 ) >>> is A ( <= 60 )
This program inputs an integer and outputs a list of more integers .
If the input is n , the output is [ n , 2 n , n +1,2 n + 2 ] --- but with a catch : numbers above 60 are thrown away .
This dumb example performs no XML processing , but it helps bootstrap a mental model of arrows in HXT .
If you see what 's going on in this dumb exercise , the real XML processors will fail to intimidate you !
So , please try to enjoy it ...
How to enjoy it ?
At a GHCi prompt , Prelude > : load lesson - 0.hs * Main > play 30
Try to run it , run it for various inputs and outputs , modify it for variations , stare at it , look up the arrow and HXT docs for the functions used ... until you are thoroughly satisfied or utterly confused .
Or just itchingly impatient .
Then you 're ready for my explanation .
Anatomy of The Program
Now let 's examine the program in pieces .
dumb :: Integer -> IOSArrow XmlTree String dumb 30 :: IOSArrow XmlTree String
I 'll spend some time on this type signature first .
It is very important to know how to read it because similar type signatures are everywhere among the real XML arrows .
I show the types of both dumb itself and after an integer parameter is provided .
The latter type says : an HXT arrow that takes a document tree as input and produces strings as output .
In general , most HXT arrows have types of the form IOSArrow x y and it says : an HXT arrow that takes input of type x and produces output of type y .
As a first step , you can understand it as a function from x to y .
What 's more , in the case of HXT , it is a multiple - valued function : internally it produces a list of y 's rather than a single y .
This is useful in many ways .
Beware : I am speaking of HXT arrows specifically here , not arrow types in general ; not all arrow types fit this mental model .
( IOSArrow x y is a shorthand for IOStateArrow ( ) x y .
More on this in a later lesson . )
In the case of dumb , y is String by our choice , but x has to be XmlTree because we use the HXT function runX to run dumb , and runX wants that .
For other arrows , such as those internal to dumb , we are free to choose x , as long as everything fits together .
An HXT arrow is not just a pure function , but also capable of various side effects .
We 'll have a chance to meet them in later lessons .
Now it 's a good time to see what our dumb arrow does .
dumb n = arr ( const n ) ... -- this line is IOSArrow XmlTree Integer
The job of arr is to convert an ordinary function into an arrow in the most expected way : the arrow behaves like the function .
Our function here has type XmlTree -> Integer , and so the arrow has type IOSArrow XmlTree Integer .
Our function is a constant function , mapping everything to the number 30 ( let 's say n is 30 ) , and so the arrow outputs 30 under any input .
( Yes , we are ignoring the input here . )
But an HXT arrow is supposed to output a list .
So the actual output is [ 30 ] .
( Although we do n't use the input , you may be itching to know what is in it .
This is provided by runX , and it is an XmlTree document tree consisting of one root node with no child . )
arr ( const n ) <+> arr ( const ( n+1 ) ) ...
The job of <+> , in HXT , is to run two arrows with the same input and concatenate the two output lists .
( Again , this mental model is specific to HXT and does not apply to all arrow types . )
Thus , the arrow on the left produces [ 30 ] , and the arrow on the right produces [ 31 ] , and so the whole line produces [ 30,31 ] .
arr ( const n ) <+> arr ( const ( n+1 ) ) >>> ...
The job of >>> is to chain up arrows .
If you write f >>>g , the output of f ( upstream ) becomes the input of g ( downstream ) .
But wait , f outputs a list , and g takes only one item , what 's going on ?
Answer : g will be run multiple times , once for each item in the output list of f ; furthermore , the output lists from the multiple runs of g are concatenated to form one big output list .
Whew !
( If this reminds you of the list monad , yes it 's the same deal . )
If this is still unclear , it will become apparent when we look at one more line of code for concreteness :
arr ( const n ) <+> arr ( const ( n+1 ) ) >>> returnA <+> arr (* 2 ) -- :: IOSArrow Integer Integer ...
So here I have to explain two things : what the downstream does in isolation , and what the chaining does in whole .
What the downstream does : returnA passes the input to the output without change ( except the output has to be a list ) , so if you input 30 you get [ 30 ] . arr (* 2 ) multiplies the input by 2 , so if you input 30 you get [ 60 ] .
Combining these two with <+> , if you input 30 you get [ 30,60 ] .
What the chaining does :
The upstream emits [ 30,31 ] .
Give 30 to the downstream , get [ 30,60 ] ; give 31 to the downstream , get [ 31,62 ] .
Combine , get [ 30,60,31,62 ] .
Whew !
So up to now you have a pretty good idea why I promised the program to output [ n , 2 n , n +1,2 n + 2 ] .
But I also promised to throw numbers above 60 away , so let 's see how .
... something outputting four numbers >>> is A ( <= 60 ) -- :: IOSArrow Integer Integer
isA tests the input against the given predicate , in this case ( <= 60 ) : if the test passes , the input is passed to the output ; if the test fails , the output list is empty .
So for example , with input 30 , the output is [ 30 ] ; with input 62 , the output is [ ] .
Combined with >>> , the effect is letting through certain inputs and blocking others .
E.g. , if the upstream gives [ 30,60,31,62 ] , the downstream is run four times , once for each of the numbers , and the outputs are [ 30 ] , [ 60 ] , [ 31 ] , and [ ] , respectively ; combining , the result is [ 30,60,31 ] .
Now that we see what the dumb arrow can do , let 's see how to bring it to life .
play :: Integer -> IO ( ) play arg = do { results <- runX ( dumb arg ) ; print results }
runX is the most convenient way to execute HXT arrows .
Its type signature says alot : runX :: IOSArrow XmlTree y -> IO [ y ]
It executes an HXT arrow and brings results back to the IO world .
Since an HXT arrow outputs a list internally , the IO world receives a list too .
The input type of the arrow has to be XmlTree , and the input value is provided by runX .
Usually this input goes unused ( e.g. , the arrow will read an XML file elsewhere instead ) , so we will pay little attention to it .
( But again , if you 're curious , it 's a document tree with a root and no child . )
Our dumb arrow outputs [ 30,60,31 ] ( if n is 30 ) .
runX runs our arrow and ends up with that list .
Then we print it and that 's what we get .
I encourage you to experiment with various modifications to this program to increase and verify your understanding .
Add more stuff or block more stuff in the arrow , for example .
New Friends from This Lesson
This video , taken after a Palin rally near Vegas this week , captures well the mood of GOP activists .
To be fair , many of the Republicans who show up at McCain and Palin rallies are well - behaved party activists or McCain fans just doing their part for the cause .
But campaign events also tend to draw the most passionate of partisans — casual voters do n't often take out time from their lives to listen to politicians speak — and the GOP mood is undeniably an angry one right now .
As I wrote after a McCain rally last week in Northern Virginia , they 're spoiling for a fight .
Much of their animus is directed at Obama , and for reasons far beyond what is publicly acceptable to McCain and his campaign .
Not only do rank - and - file Republicans want to talk about Jeremiah Wright , but some of them think the Democrat is barely American and may even be a terrorist .
So these events are like viral e-mails come to life .
While McCain is hammering Obama on taxes and spending on stage , safe and conventional attacks , some in the crowd prefer to talk about the Democrat 's middle name or his " Arab " ties .
And it 's not just at the rallies .
I 've heard anecdotes of Republican activists at local campaign offices raising these issues , only to be urged by campaign staffers to stick to the preferred message .
When asked about the comments by some of those who attend his rallies , McCain alludes to , without offering specifics , things said about him at Obama events and then notes that many of those who come to GOP events are veterans , as if to shame the questioner for raising the matter .
In short , he minimizes and largely avoids what is an uncomfortable issue .
To my mind , here is the difference between Republican and Democratic events :
Those who attend the latter are largely driven by passion and affection for Obama .
Many at the former show up as much out of opposition to Obama as in support for McCain .
This disparity evened up some after McCain tapped Palin , giving Republican activists something to be excited about , and she now routinely outdraws McCain when they 're campaigning apart and helps deliver major crowds when they 're together .
But Palin aside , the GOP rank and file seems to be in the same place where their counterparts were four years ago .
Democrats had little fire for John Kerry — there was one website that made this point in an especially pointed way but its lengthy title is not family friendly — and were far more driven by a desire to prevent four more years of a Bush presidency .
In this , the sometimes - aloof Massachusetts senator represented a means to an end — and the end .
The end of Bush , Cheney , Rove and the gang .
Similarly , McCain is now for many in the party a vessel , or , perhaps better put , a bulwark .
Republicans are n't terribly enthused about the idea of electing an unpredictable maverick .
But , in their minds , it 's a far better option than what Obama represents .
And that , an Obama presidency , is what they 're scared of and what is primarily motivating them right now .
McCain just happens to be the alternative to , and rhyme well with , " Hussein . "

This article mentions the Wikimedia Foundation , one of its projects , or people related to it .
Wikinews is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation .
Wikinews has learned at least six of the United Kingdom 's main Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) have implemented monitoring and filtering mechanisms that are causing major problems for UK contributors on websites operated by the Wikimedia Foundation , in addition to 1,200 other websites .
The filters appear to be applied because Wikimedia sites are hosting a Scorpions album cover which some call child pornography .
Scorpions are a German hard rock band who have used several controversial album covers and are perhaps best known for the song Rock You Like a Hurricane .
The measures applied redirect traffic for a significant portion of the UK's Internet population through six servers which can log and filter the content available to the end user .
A serious side - effect of this is the inability of administrators on Wikimedia sites to block vandals , and other troublemakers , without potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of innocent UK contributors who work on WMF sites in good faith .
The filtering is in response to the Internet Watch Foundation 's list of websites that host content reported to contain inappropriate images of naked children .
The IWF considers those images child pornography .
However , in the United States , where the websites of the Wikimedia Foundation are hosted , it is not considered obscene under the criteria of the Miller test , which requires that an obscene work lack " serious literary , artistic , political or scientific value " - as album art is used to " brand " the album , it is considered to be artistic .
Contributors or individuals attempting to view an affected image or file , depending on their ISP , may get a warning saying , " we have blocked this page because , according to the Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) , it contains indecent images of children or pointers to them ; you could be breaking UK law if you viewed the page . "
Other ISPs provide blank pages , 404 errors , or other means of blocking the content .
Due to a configuration mistake at one Internet service provider , some users have reported being totally unable to access Wikimedia sites to the Wikipedia technical help desk .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Is this action on the part of the IWF and various UK ISPs appropriate ?
Add or view comments
" The Protection of Children Act 1978 as amended in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 , makes it an offence to take , make , permit to be taken , distribute , show , possess with intent to distribute , and advertise indecent photographs or pseudo - photographs of children under the age of eighteen .
The ' making ' of such images includes downloading , that is , making a copy of a child sexual abuse image on a computer , so , in the UK , accessing such content online is a serious criminal offence , " says the IWF on their website in an article updated on November 28 .
The IWF say there are at least 800 to 1,200 websites on the list of those who host or contain offensive material .
The list is not public and the IWF never notified Wikimedia Foundation about the blocking of Wikipedia content .
The affected page does not display any message informing the user about blocked content on most ISPs , instead , a technical error message is shown .
However , Demon Internet redirects users to a block message on the IWF 's site explaining that the page was blocked as the organization suspects child porn or links to it to be present .
The IWF states that , " we do not notify site owners that their websites are on our list . "
1976 album cover for the Scorpions which also appears on Amazon.com and many other sites .
The concern for Wikimedia is for some images like an album cover from a 1976 record of the Scorpions titled Virgin Killer .
It displays an underage girl , posing nude , with a lens crack crossing over her genitals , but nothing blocking out her breasts .
The girl appears to be around ten years old .
In the U.S. , the band later replaced the image with one of the group .
The cover was uploaded to Wikipedia in 2006 , but Wikinews learned that on May 9 , 2008 at ( 21:17 UTC ) , despite a result of strong consensus to ' keep ' in a deletion request , the image was deleted , however for a different reason .
It was deleted due to a claim by an administrator that it violated Wikipedia 's policy for dealing with copyrighted images , which require that any images used under the doctrine of fair use must alongside other criteria , " significantly increase readers ' understanding of the topic , and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding " , with the administrator claiming that the article " lacked meaningful discussion " of the album art .
This result was overturned using the deletion review process .
Earlier , on December 6 , the image was put back up for a deletion request , but it was later closed as Wikimedia " does not censor " .
Another image that is questionable could be a screenshot from the 1938 film Child Bride .
Its goal was to bring to light the attempts at banning child marriages .
In the article on Wikipedia , a screenshot appears of then 12 - year - old Shirley Mills partially naked after skinny dipping .
In the photo , at least one of her breasts can be seen .
Other albums featuring nudity below the age of sixteen have previously caused controversy ; Blind Faith attracted criticism as did Houses of the Holy , and Nirvana 's Nevermind .
Multiple companies have gone public stating that they implement the recommendations of the Internet Watch Foundation .
Not all of these are known to have implemented measures against Wikimedia sites ; the major UK ISPs thought to have affected Wikimedia sites are Telefonica O2 / Be Unlimited , Virgin Media , Easynet , Plusnet , Demon , and Opal Telecommunications ( TalkTalk ) .
Wikinews has contacted Wikimedia 's legal counsel , Mike Godwin and the IWF for a statement , but neither have replied as of this time .

Did you know that statistically , only 25 % of businesses will survive more than 15 years ?
In recent years , many people took the opportunity to start new businesses in positive economic conditions .
However , as circumstances change , recessions hit , and markets adjust , businesses are faced with unexpected challenges .
How can you give your business the best chance of survival ?
One way is to develop productive time management habits .
A few simple tech tips can help you do this .
Why not take a minute to read our in - depth article to see how you can succeed .
1. Invest in Technology
Simply put , the world is more connected than ever before .
If you do not have the basic hardware needed to meet customer expectations then they will notice and register their disappointment .
The same applies to your website and software needs .
Some may have anxieties over their website size and capability .
They may worry about the safety of performing transactions on their first website .
They may even limit their content to text - only asking “ is adobe flash player safe ? ” .
This is a mistake .
You will gain from your initial technology investment .
It always best to avoid taking the cheap way out .
2. Plan Your Social Media Presence
No matter how smart or talented you may be , everyone on the planet has only 24 hours in the day .
The key is to make each minute count .
There are countless ways to grow your social media presence .
However , maintaining multiple accounts and constantly updating them may not be the best use of your time .
Start with one account and when you are happy that you are managing it successfully , open a second .
Use social media management tools to save more time .
The key is to stay well in control of your social media accounts rather than letting them control you .
3. Employ Analytics
Analytics are the numbers that tell you how well your business ’s online presence is performing .
You can learn about multiple aspects of your website and social media by tracking these statistics :
Does my landing page attract customers ?
How does my PPC advertising campaign perform ?
How many customers browse but do not buy ?
How many shopping carts are abandoned ?
Metrics will help you understand your customer ’s behavior and the success of each page of your website .
4. Mobile Optimized Site
Speaking of metrics , did you know that over 50 % of all web searches were performed from a mobile device ?
Yes , people are using mobile devices for serious business searches more than ever .
This means that your site should be optimized for mobile devices .
All the functionality of your full PC accessed site should be present on mobile devices too .
It should also as beautiful as on a large screen .
5. Use Cloud Technology
Investing in cloud - based business tools can save you time , money , and give you peace of mind .
Saving your data on the cloud means that it is guaranteed to backup automatically .
This means that you do not need to worry about manual backups or checking that your backup policy is being applied consistently .
Many cloud data management systems offer tiered access levels with appropriate pricing for each level .
The lowest level may be free and even on higher levels you only pay for the level you need .
If you were to use physical hard drives you would be required to maintain and replace them yourself .
This is not necessary for cloud technology .
When professionals are backing up and protecting your data , you have peace of mind that it will be safe and accessible at any time .
6. Take Accurate Notes
Simply put , when you start a business you will likely join a lot of meetings .
Get the very most out of these initial meetings by using notetaking technology to record every detail .
Recording a potential client ’s name , preferences or other personal information could be the first step in building a close professional relationship with them .
No doubt your secretary will use the useful functionality in these tools to quickly create meeting notes .
Many of these tools incorporate document sharing and even images and web page inclusion .
This will allow you to not only take basic text notes but record the entire context of the meeting or subject .
This is invaluable when making decisions and relaying information to others at a later date .
Many of these tools come with free options .
However , even investing ins a paid option that allows for larger uploads and faster sharing of information would be a good choice for a fledgling business .
7. Project Management Software
Evert business in the world manages projects every day .
A project could be large such as considering expansion into a new product range or adopting new technology .
Or it could be small such as planning an office party .
In every case , it will take communication , tracking , tasking , and responsibility .
This is where project management software can help you .
There are many kinds of project management software .
Gantt chart based software will fit all tasks into a timeline to allow you to see how each stage and collaborator will impact others .
Kanban inspired software displays tasks according to their stage , with each person moving their tasks from stage to stage to indicate their progress .
Each piece of software will provide different functionality and comes with different pricing .
Why not download free trial versions of each and play with them until you learn which will work best for you .

If you are n't preparing to celebrate Christmas in your household this week , then there 's a good chance that you are instead erecting a Festivus pole and warming up to face Uncle Joey for this year 's Feats of Strength .
And since you needed a Festivus miracle last year to pin the old man down , that 's where this Festivus meatloaf recipe comes in .
The traditional Festivus dinner is a meatloaf in red sauce ( or spaghetti ... no one really knows ) , followed immediately by the Airing of Grievances and , of course , the dreaded Feats of Strength .
The purpose of this Festivus meatloaf is twofold : it 's so good that your cooking skills will most definitely not be included in the Grievances , and you 'll be able to get Uncle Joey to the floor in a heartbeat with all that strength - endowing protein coursing through your veins .
The trick to good meatloaf is this : use good meat .
Preferably a lot of it .
For my meatloaf , I use three different kinds of meat : ground pork , ground beef and ground veal .
If the latter meat bothers you on some ideological basis , then just stick with the ground pork and beef -- do n't go trying to throw ground turkey in there because ... well , there 's a time and a place for " low - fat " meatloafs , and this is n't it .
That said , this meatloaf will be a welcome addition at any dinner table , not just at your Festivus meal .
Festivus Miracle Meatloaf
1 lb. ground beef
1/4 lb. ground pork
1/4 lb. ground veal
1 egg
1 finely minced shallot
1/3 tube crushed Ritz crackers
2 T. of ketchup
1/2 tsp. kosher salt
2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
2 tsp. tomato paste ( the tube kind , not the canned kind )
1/4 c. brown sugar
Since one of the secrets to a good meatloaf is not overworking it , it 's best to mix up the egg , shallot , Ritz crackers , 1 tablespoon of the ketchup , salt , 1 teaspoon of the Worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon of the tomato paste together first , then add the meats .
Mix all together just until combined , but do n't overdo it ... nobody likes tough meatloaf !
Put the meatloaf onto a piece of foil sprayed with Pam then put on a cookie sheet and form into a loaf with your hands .
Do not put the meatloaf into a loaf pan .
This is disgusting and will cause your meatloaf to stew in its own juices .
Cooking it freeform on a cookie sheet allows the fat to seep out and the outside to beautifully caramelize .
See how much nicer that sounds already ?
For the topping , combine the brown sugar with the remainder of the ketchup , tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl and mix well .
Spread all over the outside of the meatloaf ( prior to cooking , please ) .
Cook your meatloaf at 400 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes , or until a meat thermometer registers 155º .
Take it out and tent it for 15 minutes ( remember that carry - over cooking will continue to cook your meatloaf until the proper temperature of 160 - 165 º is reached ) .
Serve and enjoy as you finish plotting your wrestling moves for later .
Happy Festivus !

Award Winning Apfelwein Recipe ( German Hard Cider ) Apple Wine Recipe
First sanitize the carboy , airlock , funnel , stopper or carboy cap .
Open one gallon bottle of apple juice and pour half of it into the carboy using the funnel .
Open one bag of Dextrose and carefully add it to the now half full bottle of apple juice .
Shake well .
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 , then go to step 5 .
Pour in the mixture of Apple Juice and Dextrose from both bottles into the carboy .
Add all but 1 quart of remaining 3 gallons of apple juice to the carboy .
Open the packet of Montrachet Yeast and pour it into the neck of the funnel .
Use the remaining quart of juice to wash down any yeast that sticks .
I am able to fit all but 3 ounces of apple juice into a 5 gallon Better Bottle .
You may need to be patient to let the foam die down from all shaking and pouring .
Put your stopper or carboy cap on with an airlock and fill the airlock with cheap vodka .
No bacteria will live in vodka and if you get suckback , you just boosted the abv .
Saccharomyces said : Six months and it hits its stride .
Eight months and it'll blow your mind .

GENERAL QUESTIONS
Apfelwein - Fermenting Placed 1st in the Cider & Apple Wine category at the BJCP sanctioned Alamo Cerveza fest ( out of 11 entries ) and took 2nd place for Best of Show for the main category of Meads & Ciders ( out of 50 entries ) .
Ingredients5 Gallons 100 % Apple Juice ( No preservatives or additives ) I use Tree Top Apple Juice2 pounds of dextrose ( corn sugar ) in one pound bags1 five gram packet of Montrachet Wine YeastEquipment5 Gallon Carboy ( I use a Better Bottle ) Carboy Cap or Stopper with AirlockFunnel
There ’s no need to worry about filling up a carboy so full when you use Montrachet wine yeast .
There is no Kreuzen , just a thin layer of bubbles ( ) .
I 'm able to fit all but 4 oz .
of my five gallons in the bottle .
Ferment at room temperature .
It will become cloudy in a couple of days and remain so for a few weeks .
In the 4th week , the yeast will begin to drop out and it will become clear .
After at least 4 weeks , you can keg or bottle , but it is ok to leave it in the carboy for another month or so .
Racking to a secondary is not necessary .
It ferments out very dry ( less than 0.999 , see here Apfelwein really improves with age , so if you can please let it sit in a carboy for up to 3 months before bottling or kegging , then let it sit even longer .
Here 's what some folks think .
If you want to bottle and carbonate , ¾ cup of corn sugar will work fine .
Use as you would carbonate a batch of beer .
Remember to reserve judgment till after 3 glasses .
It grows on you .
It ferments quite dry .
Some people have tried different yeasts in order to achieve a sweeter taste .
It may take you a few glasses to get a feel for the flavor .
It is very reminiscent of a sort of apfelwein produced locally in Germany .
There really is no comparable product in the United States .
It 's drier and less sweet than commercial hard ciders .
It gets better with age and at 6 + months , the apple flavor really comes out .
Many folks back sweeten it with Wine Conditioner .
Wine Conditioner is a blend of sucrose and sorbic acid .
The addition of 2 - 4 oz .
per gallon adds sweetness and prevents renewed fermentation .
It can be purchased as any LHBS that caters to wine makers .
Others will use Splenda or lactose ( other non-fermentable sugars ) .
Germans who prefer it sweet ( or Suß as they say ) will add a splash of Sprite or 7 up to a glass .
This is the easiest method as you do n't have to make a whole " sweet " batch that way .
EdWort says , “ Most ciders are a bit sweeter .
Ciders and Apfelwein are about 6 % abv , but I like the little boost I give it with 2 pounds of Dextrose .
It adds no body or flavor and still tastes like Possmann 's Apfelwein , only it will kick your butt much quicker .
” No . Apfel Korn is a german liqeur made from wheat spirits .
Apfelmost is spontaneously fermented with fresh - pressed apples or apple juice .
It is probably similar , but the results may vary as a result of the spontaneous fermentation .
Either way , Apfelmost is most certainly has a lower alcohol content since the initial gravity is not increased by the use of concentrate or corn sugar .
Cider is made by pressing apples .
Juice is then filtered to remove all of the stuff that makes it cloudy .
Sure !
You can use whatever you want .
However , there is not enough information in this thread to give you any better details as to how it will turn out .
I recommend starting a new thread or ask more experienced cider - makers .
Ideally , you want to use 100 % natural apple juice with no preservatives .
The only acceptable preservative is ascorbic acid , which is a source of vitamin C and does not affect fermentation .
Pasteurized juice is preferred , since it will have less bacteria .5 gallons of Apfelwein can be made for between 20 and 25 dollars .
EdWort says , " this makes a great Grog in the winter time .
Take a quart in a sauce pan , add some rum , turbinado sugar , and float a cinnamon stick in it and simmer for a while .
Serve hot in mugs .
It 'll warm you right up . "
How much land is 16 acres ?
You could probably easily fit about 10 small houses in an acre so 16 acres is about the size of 1,600 160 small houses or 64 749.7028 meter squared for those of you in international countries .
Florida Gulf Coast University , a college opened in 1997 with a focus on the environment , was given $ 8.5 million by politicians to start a big solar farm of 16 acres on its campus .
The school ’s focus is environmental sustainability and it has a special center dedicated to that purpose , but Shepard said using renewable energy on campus had been largely ignored .
“ We were just focused on different things , ” he said .
“ We need to practice what we preach and think about reducing our dependency on fossil fuels . ”
During the 2008 - 2009 academic year , FGCU expects to spend more than $ 3.5 million on energy and uses an average of 1.4 megawatts per day .
The new solar farm , including the panels purchased with private donations , would generate 2 megawatts per day .
“ The sun is free so there ’s no risk the price will go up , ” Fenton said .
“ The more solar we can do , the better . ”

UXBRIDGE , Canada , Nov 11 ( IPS ) – A thousand points of light are being shone into the dark ocean depths as scientists from 82 countries work to complete the decade - long global research effort called the Census of Marine Life .
“ It ’s been a remarkable time of exciting new discoveries and frightening revelations of how quickly the oceans are changing , ” said Canadian deep - sea biologist Paul Snelgrove , a leader of a team integrating findings from all 17 census projects .
“ We were startled to discover small crustaceans never seen by scientists before completely blanketing the seafloor at 500 metres in the Gulf of Mexico , ” Snelgrove told IPS .
And during the eight years the census has run so far , scientists have documented that more than 90 percent of the oceans ’ top predators — large sharks , tunas , swordfish , cod and others — are now gone and those remaining are in serious trouble .
“ We ’re also seeing evidence of climate change with the shifting distribution of species , ” he said .
Equally important has been the international collaboration of over 2,000 scientists from North and South , according to the census ’s 2008 report presented this week at the World Conference on Marine Biodiversity in Valencia , Spain .
Previously scientists focused on regional or national concerns .
That resulted in the same fish population being counted two or three times as they traversed national boundaries , producing overestimates of their actual numbers .
The pairing of scientists from the North and South in the census will be one of its greatest legacies and crucial to future research and management of the oceans , Snelgrove said .
“ The release of the first census in 2010 will be a milestone in science …a scientific achievement of historic proportions , ” said Ian Poiner , chair of the census ’s International Scientific Steering Committee and chief executive officer of the Australian Institute of Marine Science .
“ Dedication and cooperation are enabling the largest , most complex programme ever undertaken in marine biology to meet its schedule and reach its goals .
When the programme began , such progress seemed improbable to many observers , ” Poiner said in a statement .
In Valencia , scientists learned about the discovery of a new predator living more than 7,200 metres deep in the Ryukyu Trench near Japan .
A new species of comb jellyfish , it “ flies like a kite on the end of two long ‘ strings ’ attached to the bottom ” in a region thought to be devoid of life , researchers reported .
Among the census ’s major exploration efforts currently underway are 18 scientific cruises in the Antarctic ocean as part of the International Polar Year .
“ Everything they ’ll do will never have ever been done before , ” said Ron O’Dor , a squid expert and a senior scientist with the census .
Another recent discovery is that the common ancestor of all of the world ’s deep - sea octopuses still lives in the Southern Ocean , O’Dor told IPS .
The timeline goes back 30 million years to a time when the oceans were very different than they are today .
“ You need many nations working together to do this type of research over such a large region as the Southern Ocean , ” O’Dor said .

Who won the ' war ' in Gaza ?
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was officially just for a week , set to end on 25 January .
There is no certainty about what will happen next .
People in the Gaza Strip are certainly desperate for the ceasefire to continue  they have seen enough blood spilt , most of it civilian , including the blood of almost 300 children killed by the Israelis during their 22 - day onslaught on Gaza .
Even before the bodies of dead Palestinians were dug up from underneath the shattered , rubble - strewn streets of Gaza , both Israel and Hamas were loudly claiming victory .
Hamas Prime Minister in Gaza , Ismail Haniya , claimed the war had ended in a popular victory for Palestinians , and other Hamas leaders claimed the Palestinian resistance was unbowed , while Israeli PM Ehud Olmert confidently reiterated that the Israeli military campaign in Gaza had more than achieved its stated goals .
The fact that an estimated 82 per cent ( or 1062 ) of the victims in Gaza were civilians had no tangible effect on either leaders bombastic claim of having beaten the other .
According to the Israeli press , Hamas presented Israel with four conditions to the week - long ceasefire ; the immediate withdrawal of Israel troops from Gaza , resumption of humanitarian aid into Gaza , the free flow of trade into and out of the Strip , and the opening of Rafah Crossing in the southern Gaza Strip in order for Palestinians in Gaza to secure freedom of movement without having to enter Israel .
Hamas claimed that , if these conditions were met , the ceasefire could be extended for up to a year .
The Israeli troops have already withdrawn to the Gaza border , and some humanitarian aid has entered Gaza this last week  but , although hordes of international journalists have crossed over Rafah into Gaza this week , the Rafah Crossing is still closed to Palestinians , bar a few critically injured civilians being transferred to Egyptian hospitals .
And the only free trade coming into Gaza at the moment is through the hastily reconstructed tunnels in on the Gaza / Egyptian border in Rafah .
Neither Israel nor Hamas would dare to be seen as yielding to the dark side in order to preserve the ceasefire , so the grim likelihood is an uneasy truce that will continue for a few months before rupturing into violence in the face of mutual mistrust and hatred .
For Hamas , civilian deaths are an inevitable part of the Islamic national struggle against the Zionist oppressor , and every martyr dies in the name of Palestine .
For Israel , its obsession with national security justifies the overwhelming number of victims in Gaza being civilian collateral damage .
These dangerously entrenched positions encapsulate their mutual obsession with defeating their mutual enemies : each other .
But ask any Palestinian civilians in Gaza who won this war and they will instead tell you who lost .
Gaza is hanging onto a semblance of normality by a fragile thread , and people are physically frightened about what could happen next if the ceasefire implodes .
My friend Mona lives in Tal Il Hawa , which was one of the brutally bombed areas of Gaza City .
She says she , her husband and their three young kids are lucky to be alive .
During the worst attacks in Tal Il Hawa , the streets surrounding her house were on fire , and her roof was partially destroyed by an Israeli rocket .
 They say the war in Gaza is over ,  she tells me over the phone .
 And here we are , alive , but back to having no electricity , no cooking gas , no fuel , and no certainty .
We have nothing left to stand on .
This was a war against the civilians here  and we lost . 

31st March — LEGACY of the VOID BETA STARTS !
Tourists will be banned from a vast area of the Australian outback for the first time this summer to prevent deaths from the extreme heat .
The government announced that the Simpson desert - situated in the dry , inhospitable heart of Australia - will be off limits from December 1 when temperatures are forecast to reach 139 Fahrenheit ( 58C ) .
The harsh and unforgiving region , which has become a rite of passage for many British travellers , spans three Australian states , and around 68,000 sq ml ( 176,500 sq km ) .
In the height of summer the temperature of the desert sand reaches a blistering 203 Fahrenheit ( 95C ) , capable of burning through shoes , said Joel Fleming , who has risked his life to rescue stranded tourists from the region .
" If you break down in that heat you 're dead meat , " said Fleming , who has lived in the region for 52 years .
" You have nowhere to hide , no air conditioning , no shade and no shelter . "
Tourists , who need to drink 15 litres of water a day , can perish within hours , he said .
The South Australian Department for Environment and Heritage said the closure of the area was necessary after a risk assessment showed increasing temperatures were dangerous for people attempting to cross the desert .
The ban will be enforced annually , and will take effect in the Simpson Desert Conservation Park and Regional Reserve , covering an area of more than 3.6 million hectares , from December to March 15 .
" There have been a number of near misses and we have had deaths in past years ... of overseas tourists who are not experienced and ill - prepared for the conditions , " said Trevor Naismith , the South Australian department regional operations director .
He said the government owed a " duty of care " to tourists who were ill - equipped for the the harsh realities of the outback .
" The Simpson desert is one of the most fascinating , majestic places in Australia , but in the middle of summer it's also one of the harshest and potentially one of the most dangerous places , " Naismith said .
Fleming , who runs four - wheel - drive tours in the region , but only in winter , said Australia 's epic drought had seen temperatures in the region rise marginally .
He said the desert dunes had softened , increasing the chance of vehicles becoming bogged down .
" The ban is a good thing , " Fleming said .
" The dangers are horrendous and they are putting other people 's lives at risk because they have to come and look for them . "
He said he had come across some " very terrified tourists " who had broken down .
" The anxiety is unreal because a couple of hours in the desert can seem like an eternity .
You know it 's the equivalent of a European country . "
Known as the " dead centre " , the Simpson desert is the driest part of Australia , with an average rainfall of 200 millimetres .
It has no official roads , just tracks which criss - cross some of the world 's longest sand dunes .
Mr Fleming said many European tourists , particularly Germans , tried to cross the Simpson desert each summer but only about 40 made it .
They did not understand the extreme remoteness , stifling heat or the tyranny of distance , and many were forced to turn back .
The Australian outback claims about 40 lives a year , mostly due to car accidents and hitting animals on the road .
A " handful " occur when ill - equipped travellers become stranded in the area where mobile phone coverage is patchy , Naismith said .
A reminder of its harshness is a desert memorial for a British family who perished in 1963 .
The Page family was crossing the desert when their car ran out of petrol on the Birdsville track near Maree , south of Lake Eyre , a popular tourist attraction in South Australia .
With no means of communication they died .
All five were buried in a makeshift grave and a simple cross marks the spot .
In 2006 a German man had a lucky escape after his 4WD became bogged down when driving through Lake Eyre , just south of the desert .
He was found dehydrated and highly distressed by workers from a local cattle station .
Dead centre
Australia 's vast outback has claimed its fair share of victims , as the combination of heat , inhospitable terrain and vast distances catch travellers out .
Dozens of people die each year , though the vast majority are from driving accidents .
Last month a man died of thirst after walking several miles from his vehicle .
The Australian writer and poet Henry Lawson summed it up in his poem Out Back : " It chanced one day when the north wind blew on his face like a furnace - breath , / He left the track for a tank he knew - ' twas a short - cut to his death ; / For the bed of the tank was hard and dry , and crossed with many a crack , / And , oh ! it 's a terrible thing to die of thirst in the scrub Out Back . "
Fears for new Bali bombings as thousands of angry mourners attend funeral of executed 2002 bombers
Fear of violence following the execution of the Bali bombers has led Indonesia to step up security around the resort island .
More than 3,500 police watched ports and tourist areas for any signs of reprisal attacks against Western visitors .
The three Islamic terrorists convicted for their part in the October 2002 Bali nightclub bombings were executed on Saturday by firing squad .
Defiance :
The body of Bali bomber Imam Samudra is carried into a mosque for prayers before his burial in Serang - more than 3,500 mourners came out in support of the bombers
Chaos :
The coffin of Imam Samudra is paraded between his local mosque and cemetery - western observers were verbally abused as ' infidels ' and ordered to leave the town immediately
Thirty Britons were among the 202 killed by the blasts .
Families of British victims said they did not believe justice had been served by the executions of Amrozi Nuhasyim , 47 , his brother Ali Ghufron , 48 and Imam Samudra , 38 .
Briton Susanna Miller , whose brother Dan was killed in the attacks , said : ' Justice is supposed to have two strands to it .
One is to pay recompense for the crime committed and the other is a deterrent . '
A member of the Bali Bombings Victims ' Group , she told the BBC :
If you undermine the deterrent by effectively encouraging , allowing these people to be seen as martyrs and encouraging the Islamist cause , then no , it makes a mockery of justice . '
Thirty Britons , some of them living abroad , were among the 202 people who died in the October , 2002 , bomb attacks on two nightclubs in the popular Kuta district of Bali .
Mukhlas , Amrozi and Samudra shouted ' Allahu Akbar ' - God is Great - just before they were shot
But Tobias Ellwood , Conservative MP for Bournemouth East , who lost his brother Jonathan , 37 , in the blasts , said that no British citizens had received compensation from the British Government and 'it remains the case that there is no compensation scheme available to Britons affected by overseas terrorism . '
Yet , he said , the UK paid compensation to all the injured , regardless of nationality , following the London bombings .
' Many countries , including the US , Spain , France , Italy and Australia have updated their laws to ensure their respective citzens are protected , ' he said .
Anger : Lulu Jamaluddin ( in white shirt ) , the brother of Imam Samudra , one of the executed Bali bombers shouts slogans during the funeral in Serang
The coffin of either ' Smiling Assassin ' Amrozi or his brother Mukhlas arrives in Tenggulun where grief and religious fervour boiled over into calls for revenge
Mr Ellwood pointed out that intelligence received by MI5 prior to the bombings warned of an attack on Bali and the threat level to British citizens should have been raised to ' high ' .
In Australia this weekend , where families of those who died and victims held beachside reunions in the wake of the bombers ' executions , the government had no hesitation in warning people intended to visit the island in coming weeks to think very carefully about their holiday plans .
As the warnings rang out around Australia , Bali police chief Inspector General Ashikin - who uses only one name - ordered 3,500 officers to watch every port and check every boat arriving at the island in case it carried explosives for a new attack .
Aftermath :
The destruction in a street in Bali after car bombs killed more than 200 people
The show of force is intended to deter supporters of the bombers , who are seen by many as martyrs and whose deadly cause to ' kill infidels ' - Westerners - must be continued .
But for the three killers , their voices ended shortly after midnight with a final shout of Allah Akbar - ' God is Great ' - before they were hit in the heart by police bullets as they remained roped , under spotlights , to wooden crosses in an orchard a few miles from their prison .
The killers were tied to wooden chairs in an orchard near the prison , then shot
Official sources present at the executions said that Amrozi , whose defiant smile had become a symbol of the disregard the three men held for the bomb victims , showed fear as he was led to his death .
Amrozi , said sources , was the least brave of the three men , looking ' pale and afraid ' .
The condemned men refused to wear blindfolds or hoods and stared back at their executioners .
There was chaos in the villages of the Amrozi and his brother and at the home of Samudra when the coffins bearing their bodies were flown in by helicopter for burial .
Hundreds of supporters screamed for vengeance for their deaths and police found themselves outnumbered as the crowds surged forward to touch the coffins before the bombers were lowered into their graves .
A relative said : ' We believe they will now be carried by green birds to meet Allah . '
There 's a story in today 's Page Six Magazine about sadsack clown Bill Murray 's supposed midlife crisis .
It 's brought him to random Brooklyn house parties and other odd , wistful New York places .
The most melancholy and peculiar detail comes from a story , an urban legend of sorts , about Murray playing a little game of hand - over - the - eyes Guess Who with a stranger in Union Square :
There 's an urban legend that 's gone around until no one is sure who it happened to , or if it happened at all .
It was late one night , a few years ago , when a young man was walking through Union Square Park .
He suddenly felt someone behind him , their hands over his eyes .
When he turned in surprise , there was Bill Murray , his creased face leaning in close .
Bill whispered , " No one is ever going to believe you , " and then just walked away .
by Brad Lancaster , Drops in a Bucket Blog , www.HarvestingRainwater.com, © 2008 , 2014
The following is one of my favorite water - harvesting stories .
It comes from the life experience of one of my mentors , Russ Buhrow , and has inspired me in much of my work .
It is amazing what Russ produced with stormwater , something too many people consider to be a waste or a liability .
However , as Russ shows , stormwater is actually a great resource .
In the summer of 1980 , plant - sciences graduate student Russ Buhrow decided to take a break from the books to gain hands - on knowledge through dry - farming in the middle of the simmering desert city of Tucson , Arizona , where annual rainfall averages 11 inches ( 280 mm ) .
Taking his cue from the ancient traditions of indigenous Tohono O’odham , Russ raised his crops solely on direct rainfall and runoff harvested from short bursts of sporadic summer monsoon rains .
Russ ’s situation was somewhat different from his Native American neighbors , though .
He did n’t farm alluvial flats of a healthy desert ecosystem where runoff from surrounding mountains flows down a braiding arroyo to a field .
Instead , he farmed a semi-urban vacant lot between a dry riverbed and cinder - block apartment buildings .
Rather than intercepting runoff from low - desert mountains and foothills , Russ learned to harvest runoff from rooftops , yards , parking lots , and a city street .
Russ began by observing the gradually sloping , arable vacant lot .
Wheel ruts crisscrossed it .
Random piles of compacted debris were strewn about , and dense weeds grew in depressions where rainwater and organic matter collected .
“ Ah ha ! ” thought Russ .
“ The weeds grow where the water is , so that ’s where my garden will go ! ”
With permission from the landowner , he dug several 8- x 8 - foot ( 2.4- x 2.4 - m ) sunken garden beds where the weeds grew tallest .
Berms stretched to either side on the downslope side of his basins , like open arms for rainwater runoff ( see Fig. 1 for the multi- year progression of Russ ’ fields , and Figs. 2 & 3 for the context in which these fields were located ) .
Russ planted seeds as the summer storms rolled in .
Thunder cracked , lightening flashed , and the rain came down in sheets .
He stood in the middle of it all and watched .
He saw water pool in the garden basins .
He also noticed water pouring off a parking lot just upslope of the basins , and quickly dug a ditch as a diversion swale to direct runoff from parking lot to garden .
After 40 minutes the rain stopped .
Planted in soil which had just been saturated , his seeds germinated in just 3 – 5 days .
Russ was full of adrenaline .
As he says , “ When you see the rain flow like that , it ’s a EUREKA moment .
You see the water and realize that this really works ! ”
The parking - lot ditch had just increased his water resources five - fold .
He went right to work , expanding his planting area to 700 square feet ( 65 m² ) .
From then on , no matter how far away he was , Russ always ran to the garden when rain started to fall .
“ It ’s amazing how much water you can catch in neighborhoods , ” he says .
“ You just need to watch the sheet flow when it rains . ”
Rain and runoff revealed the land ’s subtle slopes and depressions .
He saw how much water flowed and where .
Then he figured out how to catch and use it .
For Russ this was a rush — like playing “ flood ” in a huge sandbox , with lightening !
The unlocked car was always nearby so he could leap in when the lightening struck too close .
By fall , drought - hardy tepary beans , black - eyed peas , corn , squash , and devil ’s claw ( a fiber plant with edible seeds and okra - like immature fruit ) were harvested — all irrigated only by rain ( Figs. 4 , 5 , 6 ) .
In winter the fields went fallow , but Russ stayed active .
Once , standing in the rain , he saw excessive runoff rushing down Columbus Boulevard , an asphalted arterial street that dead - ended 400 yards ( 366 m ) from his garden .
“ FREE WATER ! ” Russ yelled .
He dug a 1/4 - mile ( 0.4 km ) diversion swale / ditch from the street to his garden ( Figs. 7A , 7B ) .
He reworked the old garden beds and added new ones .
When finished , the garden basins ranged from 100 to 700 square feet ( 9 to 63 m² ) each .
Together they resembled a series of stepped terraces that directed overflow water from the upper gardens to the lower gardens ( Figs. 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ) .
The combined planting area was now 1/2 acre ( 0.2 ha ) .
That summer , two big storms flooded the long swale with water 8 inches ( 20 cm ) deep and 2 – 3 feet ( 0.6 –0.9 m ) wide .
Both storms lasted less than an hour and had Russ running through the garden , euphoric from the water , terrorized by lightening , and exhausted by effort .
With the diversion swale running above ( upslope of ) the top of the terraced garden basins , Russ could temporarily divert the flow into a specific field by cutting an opening in the swale ’s berm and then blocking the water ’s flow within the swale at a location just downslope of the cut , to force more flow into this field .
He created this blockage by throwing wads of weeds and brush into the swale and packing them down with his shovel , his feet , and rocks , then piling dirt behind the brush .
Next , he ’d run down the swale to the next field , and make a new cut in the berm and a new barrier just downslope of it .
Running back up to the first diversion Russ would wait until the first field was well watered , then remove the original barrier of weeds , rock , and soil , and use this material to plug the cut in the berm so the water flowed down the main swale again .
That done , he ’d run down the swale to make sure the second cut and barrier were diverting water into his second field .
If all was well , he ’d dash off to the next field for another diversion cut and barrier .
And so on , until the water stopped flowing .
Russ estimates he was harvesting as much as 2 –3 acre - feet of runoff water a year .
That ’s 651,700 –977,500 gallons ( 2,467,000 –3,700,000 liters ) .
“ You had to be there when it rained , and haul ass ! ” Russ explains .
“ All could be over within 30 minutes of the first raindrop . ”
Russ was passionate about harvesting water , but he made sure he did n’t collect more than could infiltrate into the soil , since if water sits on the soil ’s surface for more than two or three days , it can activate a denitrifying bacteria ( caused by a lack of oxygen in the soil ) , which can decrease soil fertility .
Yellow spots in fields where water ponds for several days indicate denitrification .
Russ prevented such problems by spreading water throughout the landscape , improving the soil ’s water - absorbing capacity with organic matter and vegetation , and having adequate spillways for overflow water .
As surplus water overflowed from his fields and moistened the soil beyond and below his gardens , Russ expanded his garden by constructing new sets of terraced fields , each with raised berms to retain overflow water from the fields above ( Fig. 1 , above ) .
He soon had a full acre ( 0.4 ha ) cultivated with corn , tepary and lima beans , Mixta and Moschata squash , devil ’s claw , watermelon , sunflowers , cow peas , and , in a wet fall and winter , I ’itoi onions and artichokes ( Figs. 12 , 13 , 14 ) .
Just two decent summer storms , spaced well apart , were enough to support his crops .
Russ planted hardy heirloom seeds of dryland crops in coordination with the first good summer rain ( see Notes 1 and 2 below ) .
He harvested runoff from rainfalls as light as 0.1 inch ( 2.54 mm ) .
Only once in five years did Russ ’ fields fail .
The rains just would n’t cooperate .
They were too light , spaced too close together , or too far apart .
But when they did cooperate , the fields were very productive .
One year , Russ harvested 2 U.S. tons ( 1.8 metric tons ) of mature squash along with another U.S. ton ( 0.9 metric tons ) of calabacitas ( immature squash ) — 400 lbs ( 180 kg ) of which were picked in just one day .
In a good season , harvests of 17,000 devil ’s claw — the young fruits of are eaten like okra , and the dried fiber of which is used for traditional basketmaking — were common .
Russ had no money for tractors , pumps , pesticides , or water .
But he also had no debts since he took no loans .
Thanks to working with natural cycles , his only significant investment was his time .
Russ describes those times as some of the happiest of his life .
For ten years Russ farmed within the sprawling city of Tucson , relying solely on runoff from desert rains for water .
He did not contribute to groundwater depletion , while providing a lot of fresh produce for his family , friends , and neighbors .
He was connected with the natural elements : “ If you ’re not , you fail , ” he says .
For Russ , this connection was perhaps the greatest benefit of his work , making him feel rooted , part of the natural flow of wind , rain , and sun .
Through daily observation he gained numerous insights into the cycles of the Sonoran Desert .
Russ is rarely concerned about food these days .
He knows he can grow it — even in the low desert .
“ All you need is rain , ” he says , “ and we have enough . ”
Enough , that is , if we recognize and value it .
In 1990 Russ went to the Cape Verde Islands , off West Africa , where he used his experience as a resource for part of a USAID study of the islands ’ forms of agriculture and diversity of locally adapted food crops .
After 3 months he returned and took a full - time job as grounds curator at Tohono Chul Park , where he has created a number of water - harvesting features — including the Jardin Sin Aguas .
Russ gives presentations on water harvesting and has a private consultation and design business .

NOTE 2 : SPACING PLANTS TO STRETCH SOIL MOISTURE AND BUFFER WINDS
Russ spaced his plantings according to several factors : how much moisture was in the soil , the ability of the plants to withstand strong winds , and the expected size of plants at maturity .
Spring plantings were spaced farther apart than summer plantings , since the plants had to survive on residual soil moisture until the summer monsoons .
Plants that were easily blown over or snapped by the wind , such as tepary beans and corn , were planted in clusters to support one another .
By using wide spacing that took into account the plants ’ size at maturity , Russ had easy access for weeding between plants with his roto - tiller and could avoid the use and expense of herbicides .
Tepary beans were planted in groups of 5 seeds , each group 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) apart .
Squash seeds were planted in clumps with 3 seeds each , with clumps spaced 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) apart , or just 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) apart if planted late in the growing season , since they would n’t get as big before frost hit .
Devil ’s claw seeds were planted in clumps of 3 seeds , each 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) apart .
Plants can be spaced closer if soil is deeper and can infiltrate more water .
A silt / loam is good for this , while sand is often too porous .
Heavy to medium clay soils can work , but watch the percolation rate .
Most roots and nutrients will be in the top 2 – 4 feet ( 0.6 –1.2 m ) of the soil .
NOTE 3 : HOW MUCH RAINFALL PRODUCED HOW MUCH PRODUCE ?
In 1981 , Russ planted seeds at the end of March after the danger of frosts had passed .
He germinated the seeds on residual soil moisture from February storms that dropped 1.02 inches ( 25.9 mm ) of rain , and another 2.1 inches ( 53 mm ) of rain in March .
The plants got an additional 3.6 inches ( 91 mm ) in April , and 0.45 inches ( 11.4 mm ) in May .
Although this was a wet year for the desert , the plants had to survive without any more water for over a month and a half .
In July the rains started again , with 2.71 inches ( 68.8 mm ) falling that month , 0.26 inches in August ( 6.6 mm ) , 0.47 inches in September ( 11.9 mm ) , and no rain in October .
On that rainfall alone , the garden produced 9 U.S. tons ( 8.2 metric tons ) of Mixta squash per acre and 26,000 devil ’s claw , along with corn , watermelon , tepary beans , and sunflowers .
NOTE 4 : THE LOSS OF ARABLE LAND
Russ Buhrow ’s runoff farm no longer exists .
It has since been built over with a new housing development .
Houses are being built within the floodplain upon some of the area ’s most fertile soils .
If we keep building on — and paving over — our best agricultural land , where will we grow our community ’s food ?
NOTE 5 : POTENTIAL CONTAMINANTS IN STREET RUNOFF
I think more research is needed in the area of street - runoff toxins , and where they end up .
Russ tells me he experienced no problems on his farm or with his produce grown a 1/4 mile ( 0.4 km ) from the road itself .
I too have never had any problems with plant health where plants have been irrigated with street runoff .
The plants have thrived .
In street - side stormwater - harvesting basins , while I harvest the fruit from the plants irrigated with street runoff , I make sure none of the fruit has come into direct contact with the street runoff .
Thus I harvest fruit and legumes from trees ( mesquite pods , desert ironwood seeds , olives , pomegranates , etc ) .
I do not grow leafy green or tuber crops in these basins .

CNN compares winking Sarah Palin to Betty Boop David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 7 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's exaggerated winks during her debate with Democrat Joe Biden last week have received a great deal of attention and inspired a considerable amount of comedy .
CNN 's Jeanne Moos surveyed some of the reactions to Palin 's winks , from Alec Baldwin 's imitation on Real Time with Bill Maher to Tina Fey 's impersonation of Palin on Saturday Night Live .
The Huffington Post created a music video out of Palin 's repeated winks , Jay Leno joked about it , and Bill Maher got laughs just by reading out conservative Rich Lowry 's description of how he " sat up a little straighter " in response to the wink .
Conservatives , in turn , have been retaliating by accusing Biden of botox use , comparing his smooth forehead at the debate with a crinkled photo from a few years ago .
CNN asked people on the street about Palin 's winks , getting reactions ranging from " a nice fresh face " to " totally fake . "
However , CNN may now have found the ultimate Palin comparison -- a 1932 cartoon titled " Betty Boop for President , " in which Betty winks broadly while singing , " Some of you have money , while some are poor , you know .
If you send me to Washington , I 'll just divide the dough , oh ! "
No doubt Palin , who insisted at the debate that paying taxes is " not patriotic , " would consider Boop 's plans for income redistribution -- along with her promises that " we will get things for nothing , movies , cabarets and jazz ! " -- to mark her as a wild - eyed radical and probable associate of the Weather Underground .

When you fall short of meeting your obligations , it 's natural to feel bad .
In fact , it 's natural to want to not only meet the letter of your obligation , but also the spirit : to do what it takes to make the other person feel fairly treated .
These feelings are very human , and they work well when you 're interacting with humans acting as individuals .
When you 're dealing with businesses , though , they work against you -- and businesses will take advantage of that .
Nobody is much surprised when a corporation meets its legal obligations but goes no further .
People like to suggest that going beyond is often good business -- a reputation for providing good service is worth something -- but they do n't think it 's a moral failure when a corporation does only the legal minimum , because everybody knows that corporations are not moral entities .
With people , though , the rules seem different .
You see this distinction especially starkly with bankruptcy .
A person will often feel shame at the idea of bankruptcy .
Obviously , a corporation does not .
( The owner of a very small corporation might , but that 's just another example of confusing the person with the business . )
When a corporation files for chapter 11 and the court tells it that it does n't need to honor its gift cards or its pension obligations , no one imagines that they 'll be able to get better treatment by making the corporation feel bad .
Corporations , on the other hand , use this sort of moral suasion to try to control people all the time .
You see it , for example , with debt collectors -- they try to establish something that seems like a personal relationship , so that the borrower feels bad about being unable to meet his obligation .
You see it most often with employees , because the constant interactions between employee and manager create a circumstance where it 's natural to feel a personal relationship .
When a friend of mine quit one job to take another , his old employer offered a large raise and said a lot of nice things about how important he was and how highly valued his work was .
My friend was feeling bad about leaving and seriously considering changing his mind , because he wanted to do right by his moral obligation to his old employer , but then remembered that he'd had a salary review just a few months before , where the focus had been on his shortcomings and where the employer had put a dollar figure on the value of his work that was quite a bit lower .
Neither those critical statements nor the new complimentary ones were a reflection of what the corporation actually thought -- after all , corporations do n't think .
Rather , both were an attempt by management to get what they wanted -- my friend 's work at the lowest possible cost .
Another friend was hesitating to move to a much better job , because when she 'd been hired , her boss had asked her to " commit " to stay until the end of a project and she 'd done so .
I pointed out that there were many things her boss might have done to give her incentives to stay -- most obviously , he might have given her a contract with a completion bonus .
Not only had he not done that , he had n't given her a contract at all -- and I 'm sure he would n't have " committed " to keep paying her until the end of the project even if business turned down .
He had asked for a commitment because such a request costs nothing , and just might work .
Corporations would rather not do expensive things like paying competitive salaries , giving regular raises , and offering a pension to reward long - term service .
That costs money , and corporations would rather not spend money .
So , they usually start by trying to use a sense of personal obligation to get people to do whatever will help the business .
That 's why they ask people to " commit " to the company -- they do it because they know people will feel obliged to stand by their word , and because guilt is much cheaper than paying a project completion bonus .
This is true for relationships besides just that of employee -- customers , borrowers , clients , and venders are all subjected to similar efforts , where the corporation tries to structure things so that people feel ( and behave ) as if they were in a personal relationship with the business .
They do this because it works .
It works because people have trouble distinguishing between their legal obligations and their moral obligations , they allow their feelings to push them into making poorer choices .
Because this is all a deliberate effort by corporations to control you , it 's sometimes not quite clear what kind of relationship you 're in .
After all , even though your counterpart is a corporation , your interface with it -- boss , loan officer , salesperson -- is a person .
The whole thing is structured to make you feel uncomfortable if you leave him or her in the lurch .
Do n't be fooled .
None of this is to say that you 're not stuck with your legal obligations .
I 'm not suggesting that you cheat or steal or even engage in sharp practices or take advantage .
But do n't imagine that you have a moral obligation to a business .
Your moral obligations are to people .
We are pleased to present one of the first inside reports from participants in the upheavals that shook Greece after the police murder of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos in the anarchist neighborhood of Exarchia on December 6 .
How were the actions coordinated within cities ?
How about between cities ?
There are hundreds of small , totally closed affinity groups — groups based in longstanding friendship and 100 % trust — and some bigger groups like the people from the three big squats in Athens and three more in Thessaloniki .
There are more than 50 social centers in Greece , and anarchist political spaces in all the universities of the country ; also , the Antiauthoritarian Movement has sections in all major cities , and there is a network of affinity groups of the Black Bloc active in all Greek cities , based on personal relations and communicating via telephone and mail .
For all of them , Indymedia is very important as a strategic point for collecting and sharing useful information — where conflicts are happening , where the police are , where secret police are making arrests , what is happening everywhere minute by minute ; it is also useful on a political level , for publishing announcements and calls for demonstrations and actions .
Of course , we ca n’t forget that in practice the primary form of coordination was from friend to friend through mobile phones ; that was also the main approach used by young students for coordinating their initiatives , demonstrations , and direct actions .
What kinds of organizing structures appeared ?
All sorts of small companies of friends were making spontaneous decisions in the streets , planning actions and carrying them out themselves in a chaotic , uncontrollable manner : thousands of actions taking place at the same time everywhere around the country …
Every afternoon there was a General Assembly in squatted schools , squatted public buildings , and squatted universities …
Indymedia was used for announcements and strategic coordination of actions …
The various communist parties also organized their own confederations of students …
… And also , one especially influential federation was organized by the friends of Alexis , to organize the students ’ demonstrations and actions , the squatting of schools , and to publish general announcements from the students ’ struggle .
Were there any structures already in existence that people used to organize ?
For the young students who were in the streets for the first time , and also for the immigrants who participated , the telephone was more than enough ; this produced a totally chaotic and unpredictable element in the situations .
On the other hand , for anarchists and anti-authoritarians , the General Assemblies are the organizing tool they have used for the last 30 years during any kind of movement .
All affinity groups , squats , social centers , university occupations , and other organizations have their own assemblies , as well .
Some other participants included left political organizations and left and anarchist university political spaces .
During the fight , a lot of new blogs appeared , and new coordinating networks of high - school students .
What different kinds of people have participated in the actions ?
The majority were anarchists , half of them older ones , some at high risk as they had previous charges for actions and would have to face custody if they were arrested .
Beside them were thousands of school students 16 - 18 years old .
Alongside these groups were immigrants , thousands of university students , many “ gypsy ” [ Romani ] kids taking revenge for social repression and racism , and old revolutionaries with previous experience from other social struggles .
What different forms have the actions taken ?
Smashing , looting , and burning were the main actions that the young people used .
They often attacked the expensive shopping districts , opened the fancy luxury shops , took everything from inside , and set fire to it in order to counteract the effects of the tear gas in the air .
Many turned cars upside down to serve as barricades , keeping the police at a distance and thus creating liberated areas .
The police used over 4600 tear gas bombs — nearly 4 tons — but people set countless fires , enough to maintain areas in which you could breathe despite this chemical warfare waged by the state against the people .
When the thousands of people on the streets realized that the black smoke of the fires could cancel out the white smoke of the tear gas , they used the tactic of burning everything at hand as a protection from the tear gas .
Other techniques included the smashing of the pavement with hammers , to produce thousands of stones for people to use as projectiles ; and , of course , the personal initiative of producing and throwing molotov cocktails .
This last tactic was used especially to force the riot police to fear and respect the demonstrators , and also as a way of controlling the space and time of attack and escape .
Attacks with sticks , stones and molotov cocktails were carried out against countless banks , police stations , and police cars across the country .
In smaller cities , the banks and the police were the primary or only targets , as the small - scale society and face - to - face relations discouraged the smashing of shops , with the exception of a few multinational corporate franchises
Hundreds of symbolic occupations were carried out in all kinds of public buildings , municipal offices , public service offices , theaters , radio stations , TV stations , and other buildings by groups of 50 - 70 people .
Also , there were many symbolic acts of sabotage and blockading of streets , highways , offices , metro stations , public services , and so on , usually accompanied by the distribution of thousands and thousands of pamphlets to people in the area
Every day there were silent protests , art happenings , and non-violent actions in front of the parliament and in all cities .
Most of them were brutally attacked by the police , who used tear gas and arrested people
Leftists organized concerts in public spaces with the participation of underground bands and also politically conscious pop stars .
The biggest one in Athens involved more than 40 artists and drew over 10,000 people
Controlled student demonstrations were organized by the Communist Party .
Many of these attracted much less participation than the chaotic spontaneous student demonstrations .
How many of the participants in the actions have been involved in similar actions earlier ?
For how many of them do you think this is their “ first time ” ?
Many thousands of people were experienced anarchist insurrectionists , anti-authoritarians , and libertarian autonomists ; half of them were older anarchists who come into the streets only in very important struggles , as most of them have previous charges .
There were also many thousands of young people who were radicalized over the last three years in the course of the social struggles for Social Insurance and against the privatization of education , and also in the huge spontaneous demonstrations that took place during the fires that burned almost 25 % of the natural areas of Greece in the summer of 2007 .
We estimate that for about 30 % of the people , this was their first rioting .
Which of the tactics used in the actions have been used before in Greece ?
Did they spread in the course of this rebellion ?
If they did , how did it happen ?
Most of the tactics used in this struggle have been used for a long time now in Greece .
The most important new characteristic of this struggle was the immediate appearance of actions all over the country .
The assassination of a young boy in the most important area of anarchist activity provoked an instantaneous reaction ; within five minutes of his death , anarchist cells all over the country had been activated .
In some cases , the police were informed much later than the anarchists about the reason they were facing attacks from the people .
For Greek society , it was a surprise that the majority of young people in the country adopted the tactics of “ anarchist violence , smashing and burning , ” but this was a result of the generalized influence that anarchists ’ actions and ideas have had in Greek society over the past four years .
Have any conflicts emerged between participants in the actions ?
The Communist Party separated itself from anarchists and leftists , and organized separate demonstrations .
Also , the announcements that the Communist Party published , their appearances in the corporate media , their speeches to the parliament , and the negative propaganda that they carried on against all leftist organizations prove that they are a real enemy of any kind of efforts for social change .
What is the opinion of the “ general public ” about the actions ?
What is called “ general public ” during a period of tele - democracy is something that needs a lot of discussion .
Generally speaking , the “ general public ” feel fear when the TV says that we were “ burning the poor people ’s shops , ” but the people know well what kind of shops exist in the expensive districts where the riots took place ; they feel fear when the TV says that angry immigrants came out to the streets and looted , but also they know that the immigrants are poor and desperate , and also that it was only a minority of them that came to the streets .
There were many artists , theoreticians , sociologists , and other such personages who offered explanations about the revolt , and many of them were beneficial for our causes ; some were probably trapped by their need to participate in the spirit of the times , while others were using the situation as an opportunity to honestly express their real ideas .
The “ general public ” is angry about the murder of a 15 - year - old boy by a police officer , and they hate the police much more than before ; anyway , nobody liked the police in the first place .
The majority of “ normal ” people in Greece do n’t trust the right wing government or the past ( and probably future ) socialist government , and they do n’t like the police , expensive shops , or banks .
Now a new public opinion is appearing that offers all the social and ethical justifications of revolt .
If it was difficult to govern Greece before , now it will be much more difficult .
How important to the context of these events is the legacy of the dictatorship in Greece ?
How does it influence popular opinions and actions in this case ?
In 1973 , the young people were the only ones who took the risk to revolt against the seven - year - running dictatorship ; even if this was not the only cause of the end of dictatorship , it remains in the collective memory that the students saved Greece from the dictators and the domination of the US .
It is a common belief that young people will put themselves at great risk for the benefit of all , and this produces a feeling of hope and a tolerance of the students ’ actions .
Of course , this story is now an old story and though it influences the background of the fights , it is not mentioned in reference to this conflict .
Another influence comes from the student struggles of 1991 and 1995 against the privatization of education , which succeeded in changing the plans of the government and saved public education until today .
Granted , the revolt of December 2008 was probably the apex of the anarchist movement in Greece until now , as it appeared all around the country and with a great deal of influence on the actions and slogans and ideas of a general part of the society ; but the earlier student struggles , especially in Athens in 1991 were more visible and more generalized .
Do you think troubles in the economy are as important in these events as the corporate media is saying ?
The young people from the many rich areas of Athens also attacked the police stations of their areas , so even the class war Marxists have serious troubles to explain what is happening : the separation of the rich and poor does n’t seem to matter as much as long - existing solidarity and participation in the fight for equality and social justice .
On the other hand , Greeks between the ages of 25 and 35 cannot make families and have children , because of the economy .
Greece is the most underpopulated society in all Europe .
But we do n’t talk about that here as the cause of the revolt .
Young people are angry and they hate the police , capitalist cynicism , and the government in a natural , instinctual way that does n’t need explanations or a political agenda .
The local media tried not to speak in depth about social conditions here the way the English , French , or US media have .
The local corporate TV stations attempt to pass off lies about chaotic “ masketeers ” with no ideas and no social identity , because the moral influence of anarchists is so strong now in this society that if they start to talk seriously about our ideas on television , society could explode .
With the exception of some TV programs and newspapers , most of the mass media are trying to separate economic issues from the chaotic revolt .
Even the leftists from the May ’ 68 generation , when they speak to the media , say that the smashing and the riots are not political expressions of the needs and the hopes of the people — that the anarchists and young people do n’t have the ability to express a political agenda , and the people need other kinds of political representation .
Of course , all this has little influence on the young people who will participate in the social struggles of the future , as after this struggle there exists high tension and a great distance between the younger people and any kind of political leadership or authority .
What other motivations , besides anger against the police and the economy , do you think are driving people to participate ?
The personal and collective need for adventure ; the need to participate in making history ; the chaotic negation of any kind of politics , political parties , and “ serious ” political ideas ; the cultural gap of hating any kind of TV star , sociologist , or expert who claims to analyze you as a social phenomenon , the need to exist and be heard as you are ; the enthusiasm of fighting against the authorities and ridiculing the riot police , the power in your heart and the fire in your hands , the amazing experience of throwing molotovs and stones against the cops in front of the parliament , in the expensive shopping districts , or in your small silent town , in your village , in the square of your neighborhood .
Other motivations include the collective feeling of planning an action with your best friends , making it come true , and later hearing people tell you about this action as an incredible story that they heard from someone else ; the enthusiasm of reading about some action that you did with your friends in a newspaper or TV program from the other side of the planet ; the feeling of responsibility that you have to create stories , actions , and plans that will become global examples for the future struggles .
It is also the great celebrative fun of smashing the shops , taking the products and then burning them , seeing the false promises and dreams of capitalism burned in the streets ; the hatred for all authorities , the need to take part in the collective ceremony of revenge for the death of a person that could have been you , the personal vendetta of feeling that the police have to pay for the death of Alexis across the whole country ; the need to send a powerful message to the government that if police violence increases , we have the power to fight back and society will explode — the need to send a direct message to society that everyone has to wake up , and a message to the authorities that they have to take us seriously because we are everywhere and we are coming to change everything .
Are political parties succeeding in co-opting energy from the uprising ?
In “ real ” numbers , the Socialists have increased their lead over the right wing government , gaining an 8 % lead in the polls ; the “ European Social Forum communists ” lost 1 % even though they helped the revolt , but still they are in third place with 12 % ; the Communist Party has 8 % , the Nationalist neo- fascists 4.5 % , and the Green Party is holding steady at 3.5 % .
It is also interesting that the leader of the Socialists appears now to be regarded as first in “ capability to govern the country ” after many years with much less popularity than the right wing prime minister .
The riots had a great effect on the political scene : the political parties seemed unable to understand , explain , or react to the massive wave of violence and participation from every level of society .
Their announcements were irrelevant to what was really happening .
Their popularity decreased dramatically among the younger population , who do n’t see themselves in the logic and the politics of the political parties and do n’t feel represented by them .
What has been the role of anarchists in starting and continuing the actions ?
How clearly is their participation seen by the rest of society ?
Over the past few years , anarchists have created a network of communities , groups , organizations , squats , and social centers in almost all the major cities in Greece .
Many do n’t like each other , as there exist many significant differences among the groups and individuals .
This helps the movement , though , as the movement now can cover a great variety of subjects .
Many different kinds of people find their comrades in different anarchist movements and , all together , push each other — in a positive , if antagonistic , way — to communicate with society .
This communication includes creating neighborhood assemblies , participating in social struggles , and planning actions that have a meaning for the general society .
After 30 years of anti-social anarchism , the anarchist movement in Greece today , with all its problems , limitations , and internal conflicts , has the capability to look outside of the anarchist microcosm and take actions that improve society at large in ways that are readily apparent .
Of course , it will take a lot of effort for this to be obvious , but day by day nobody can deny it .
As for the role of anarchists in starting and continuing the actions … especially at the beginning — Saturday and Sunday , December 6 and 7 — and also in the continuation after Wednesday , December 10 , the anarchists were the vast majority of those who carried out the actions .
In the middle days , especially on Monday when the destructive Armageddon took place , students and immigrants played a very important role .
But the vast majority of students found it easy to feel satisfied after one , two , or three days of smashing , and then went home or attended demonstrations with a more pacifist atmosphere .
Likewise , immigrants had to face a very strong backlash from locals , and they were afraid to return to the streets .
So the 20,000 anarchists in Greece started it , and continued it when everybody else returned to normality .
And we have to mention that the fear of returning to normality helped us to keep up the fight for ten days more , putting ourselves into great danger as acts of vengeance for the assassination of our comrade transformed , in our fantasies , into preparations for a general strike .
Now European society knows once and for all what a social insurrection looks like , and that it is not difficult to change the world in some months .
But you need all the people to participate and play their roles .
The young people of Greece sent an invitation to all the societies throughout Europe .
We are awaiting their responses now .
How much visibility do anarchists have in Greece in general ?
How “ seriously ” is anarchism taken by the majority of Greek people ?
In a way , you can say that it is just three or four years now since anarchists started to take themselves “ seriously ” so we are seen that way in the broader society .
It is only in the past few years that we have succeeded in expanding beyond the limitations of the anti-police strategy that had characterized our efforts for 25 years .
According to that strategy , we attack the police , they arrest people , and we do solidarity actions , over and over again .
It took us 25 years to escape from this routine .
Of course , the anti-police attacks and fights continue , and the prisoner solidarity movement is stronger than ever , but the anti-social element inside the anarchist movement is under conscious self - control and we can speak , care , and act for the benefit of the whole society now , using actions and plans that can be comprehended much more clearly by at least a part of the society .
Many actions , like the attacks on supermarkets and the free distribution of stolen products to the people , became very popular and well - accepted .
The attacks on banks , especially now following the economic crisis , are well - accepted also , and the attacks on police stations have been adapted and utilized by high - school students around the country .
In one way or another , we have been the first subject in the news for the last 15 days .
Generally speaking , with our participation in students ’ or workers ’ struggles and also in ecological struggles , every week some action taken by anarchists attracts attention and offers visibility to the anarchist movement .
This does n’t mean that “ anarchism ” is taken seriously by the majority of Greek people , as most people still believe the lies of television that describe us as “ masketeers ” and criminals , and also the majority do n’t have any idea about how an anarchist society could ever function — that includes most of the anarchists , also , who refuse to address this question !
But our actions , critiques , and ideas have strong influence now on left and progressive people .
It ’s not possible anymore to say that we do n’t exist , and now our existence radicalizes the majority of the younger generation .
What role have subcultural groups — like punk , squatting , and so on — played in making the uprising possible ?
After ’93 we had a strong tendency in the Greek anarchist movement — accompanied by many serious internal fights — that eliminated the influence of “ subcultural ” styles inside the movement .
This means that there is no punk , rock , metal or whatever anarchist identity in the Greek anarchist movement — you can be whatever you like , you can listen to whatever music you like , you can have whatever style or fashion you like , but that is not a political identity .
In the street fights this month , many “ emos ” participated , together with hippy freaks and ravers , many punks , heavy metal boys and girls , and also trendy , normal kids and students that like Greek music or whatever .
It has to be social and political consciousness , social critiques and collective understandings that bring you to participate in the anarchist movements , not fashion .
Of course , for at least the last 19 years the Void Network and similar collectives have played the role of offering a cultural introduction to radical political spaces .
Such groups organize many cultural / political events , festivals , and parties every year and have the power to attract thousands and thousands of people to underground cultures .
But even Void Network does n’t create subcultural identities , does n’t separate the different subcultures , and tries to organize events that include most of the underground cultures .
It ’s true , though , that the majority of the people in the scene attend and participate in most of the events of the d.i.y.
underground culture ; many events are organized every month in liberated spaces .
What things have made the anarchist movement healthy in Greece ?
The separation from subcultural identity politics made people understand that to call yourself an anarchist it takes much more serious participation , planning , creativity , and action than just wearing a t - shirt with the antichrist on it and walking around in punk concerts drinking beer and taking hypnotic pills .
Now there is an understanding that to call yourself an anarchist you have to come to demonstrations , to come out into the streets with banners and black or red-and - black flags , shouting slogans together and manifesting an anarchist presence .
Also , that you should participate every week in one , two , or three different assemblies with people for one , or two , or three different preparations of different actions , plans , or struggles to call yourself an anarchist .
You have to be friends with people you trust 100 % to plan anything dangerous , you have to be aware and informed about anything that is happening in this world to decide what the proper course of action is , you have to be crazy and enthusiastic , to feel that you can do incredible things — you have to be ready to give your life , your time , your years in a struggle that will never end .
It is healthy not to have expectations , because then you do n’t get disappointed .
You do n’t expect to win .
You are used to appearing , fighting , and then disappearing again ; you know how to become invisible as a person and visible as collective power ; you know that you are not the center of the universe , but that any time you can become the center of your society .
In what ways do you think the anarchist movement in Greece could be better or stronger ?
We need to find more intelligent ways of explaining our ideas to people .
We need techniques of political communication with all of society , better and stronger ways to make the “ political translation ” of our actions and put the whole struggle in its social context .
In a tele - democracy , where the politicians are nothing more than television superstars , our refusal to communicate with or through the mass media is healthy , but we need to find new ways to overcome the mass media “ consensus reality , ” the media propaganda against us , and find ways to explain the causes of our actions to society .
As long as whatever the TV shows “ exists ” and whatever does n’t appear on TV “ does n’t exist , ” we will be there with our crazy ideas , the dangerous actions and the street fights to break the normality of the TV program , we will use the negative advertisement of our actions to kidnap the fantasies and dreams of the common people .
But how can we explain our positive ideas to everyone ?
How can we help people cease to trust the media ?
How can we come into contact with millions and millions of people ?
It will take millions and millions of posters and free pamphlets , traveling hand by hand in the streets ; it will take millions of invitations for demonstrations and participation in social struggles ; it will take more free public services in sections that the government do n’t want or cannot cover — free anarchist doctors and teachers , free food , free accommodation , information , underground culture , and so on — that can bring people closer to our ideas .
It will also take more and more squats and social centers .
If you can start a squat , that is better , but even if it ’s not possible to squat in your town , rent a building with your friends , take care of the bureaucracy , make a collective , start an assembly , and put the black or red-and - black flag in the entrance .
Start offering the people of your city a living example of a world without racism , patriarchy , or homophobia , a place of equality , freedom , and respect for differences , a world with love and sharing .
We need more “ Autonomia ” in the insurrectionism of the Greek anarchist movement , to make it shine as a paradigm of a new wave of social life and demonstrate this novel survival methodology in the metropolis .
How effective has police repression been in shutting down the anarchist movement ?
How have people resisted it ?
The dreams and plans of the insurrectionists came true : a huge wave of participation “ overpassed ” the anarchists , and for many chaotic days people traveled and fought in the city like never before , in an unfamiliar time and space of existence .
In the same days , of course , they came face to face with the limitations of insurrection .
The people now spend many hours in long discussions about how to expand popular understanding and invent practices , actions , and methods that will sustain and enrich the struggle .
Many people think about ways that will bring really close all the different elements of this revolt .
The police repression did n’t play a more important role in the conclusion of the riots than physical fatigue did .
All of us share a feeling of completion and a feeling of beginning , and these are feelings that the police can not touch .
What do you think the final result of the events of December will be ?
Ongoing struggle !
A never - ending fight for political , social , and economic equality !
Constant expansion of freedom !
In the future , neoliberal governments in Greece and throughout Europe will think very seriously before attempting to implement any kind of economic or social change .
The riots in Athens and the economic crisis ended the cynicism of the authorities , banks , and corporations , radicalized a new generation in Greece , and gave our society a chance to open a dialogue about the massive social struggles of the future .
As the slogan of December 2008 in Athens and Exarchia goes :
WE ARE AN IMAGE FROM THE FUTURE .

In computer graphics images can be represented in two ways — using raster graphics ( or bitmap ) or vector graphics .
The former is the representation of images as an array of pixlels , and the latter uses paths , points , lines , curves and shapes or polygons ( which are all based upon mathematical equations ) for the same purpose .
Raster images are based on pixels and thus scale with loss of clarity , while vector - based images can be scaled indefinitely without degrading .
In other words , vector graphics are resolution - independent and thus can remain the highest quality at any scale .

Today Americans have the opportunity to overthrow Big Media power and their stooge Barack Obama .
Americans will vote for their choice in 35 Senate races , 435 races for the entire House of Representatives , 11 governorship races as well as several odious ballot initiatives including a ban on gay marriage in California .
Exit polls will be released to “ news ” organizations at 5:00 p.m .
But we will know what the untrustworthy exit polls indicate much earlier because Big Media “ personalities ” will be twitching with glee if Obama is ahead .
If the race is tight they will be sullen and gloomy .
If McCain is ahead expect security guards to block window access and begin to confiscate razor blades .
Meanwhile Obama slumlord friend and bagman Antoin “ Tony ” Rezko made another suprise appearance with the latest revelations in today ’s Washington Times ( we ’ll have more on this in subsequent days ) .
Bill – The Bomber and Lousi Farrahkan also made an appearance today as they voted at the same school as Barack Obama .
Among the other voters who have shown up to vote at Shoesmith Elementary School this morning , where Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , will vote : Louis Farrakhan and William Ayers .
Seriously .
* * *
Schedule :
Indiana polls begin to close at 6:00 p.m.
Reports that the race in Indiana had McCain ahead appeared to be confirmed by last minute Obama campaigning there .
If McCain loses Indiana it is going to be a tough night for McCain .
The western part of Indiana will stop voting at 7:00 p.m. but we expect the same shenanigans in Lake County ( Gary ) that we witnessed during the Hillary victory during the Democratic primary there .
Florida and Virginia and Georgia polls close at 7:00 p.m. McCain needs to win Florida .
If Obama wins Virginia it will likely be a good night for Obama .
If McCain wins both states , it will be a long night for Obama and McCain but the chances for McCain will increase greatly .
McCain must also win Georgia .
Ohio and North Carolina close at 7:30 p.m. McCain must win Ohio .
If McCain wins Ohio and North Carolina Obama is in great trouble .
The respected Columbus Dispatch poll has Obama ahead but we recall that in 2004 the Columbus Dispatch poll came out on election day , unlike this year when the poll was published on Sunday .
Later polls are conflicted .
We believe McCain will win Ohio .
At 8:00 p.m. New Hampshire and Pennsylvania polls close .
Hillary voters will determine what happens in Pennsylvania and McCain still has a chance in that must win state .
A win for McCain in New Hampshire would be a surprise and a horror for Obama .
Voter intimidation by Black Panthers might or might not be a factor in Pennsylvania .
Also , in Pennsylvania there is no early voting provisions so late issues regarding Obama ’s plan to bankrupt coal operators in coal state Pennsylvania might have an impact .
John Murtha ’s ugly charges of racism might also mobilize voters against him and bring out a strong McCain vote in the western part of the state where Hillary did so well .
At 9:00 p.m. most of the eastern and midwestern time zones will have voted .
Colorado and New Mexico are the states to watch at this hour .
At 10:00 p.m. Nevada , Iowa , and Oregon finish voting .
Iowa and Oregon are a must win for Obama .
Contrary to conventional wisdom , we believe McCain has a good shot at Nevada .
By 11:00 when California polls close the election should be over ( except for Alaska at 1:00 a.m. ) .
* * *
Keep your eyes peeled for the divided electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska in the event of a tight race .
Obama hopes to get an extra vote in Nebraska and McCain hopes to get that extra vote in Maine .
A nightmare for Obama is a big popular vote win with huge victories in Illinois , New York , and California but McCain getting an electoral college victory .
Obama will have no cause to complain with his shenanigans in Michigan and Florida and his loss to Hillary in popular votes .
A British newspaper has this assessment of tonight ’s events :
The victor will need 270 electoral votes to win the Electoral College and capture the White House in Tuesday ’s election .
The president is determined not by the most votes nationally but by a majority of the Electoral College , which has 538 members allotted to all 50 states and the District of Columbia in proportion to their representation in Congress .
Each state , except Maine and Nebraska , awards its votes to the candidate who gets the most votes in the state .
Maine and Nebraska split them by congressional district .
Here are some battleground states with their electoral vote totals , 2004 results and recent details about the contests in each state .
* Colorado —
Nine electoral votes .
Bush beat Kerry 52 percent to 47 percent in the state in 2004 , but since then , Democrats have won the state Legislature and governor ’s office .
Two polls Thursday showed Obama leading by 6 and 4 points respectively .
* Florida — 27 electoral votes .
Bush beat Kerry 52 percent to 47 percent in a state known for the disputed result that decided the 2000 election .
Florida is a classic swing state with many older voters who could favor McCain along with Jewish voters who are normally Democratic but have been wary of Obama .
The two most recent polls both gave Obama a 4 - point lead , while some earlier polls had showed a narrower margin .
* Indiana — 11 electoral votes .
Bush beat Kerry by 20 points in 2004 in a state that last voted for a Democrat in 1964 .
But it borders Obama ’s home state of Illinois and he has poured resources into his Indiana campaign after finishing a strong second to Sen.
Hillary Clinton in the May Democratic primary .
The race remains a toss up , with one Thursday poll giving McCain a 3 - point lead , another showing Obama with a 1 - point edge , and a third saying the two candidates were dead even .
* Missouri — 11 electoral votes .
Bush beat Kerry 53 percent to 46 percent in 2004 in a classic battleground with a mix of cities and conservative rural areas .
McCain led in the two most recent polls with narrow margins of 3 and 2 points .
* New Hampshire — Four electoral votes .
Kerry beat Bush by 1 point in 2004 .
McCain ’s history of big primary wins in New Hampshire in 2000 and this year gives him hope he can take the state in November .
Democrats captured both the state ’s seats in Congress and gained control of the state Legislature in 2006 in an anti-Republican wave on which Obama hopes to capitalize .
A Thursday poll showed Obama up by 13 points , the latest in a string of surveys that have put his lead in double digits .
* New Mexico —
Five electoral votes .
Bush beat Kerry by fewer than 6,000 votes in 2004 .
As the senator from neighboring Arizona , McCain is familiar to many New Mexico voters , but he will have to battle Obama for the growing bloc of Hispanics , who make up more than 40 percent of the state ’s population .
A Wednesday poll gave Obama a 10 - point lead , while other recent surveys have shown him ahead by between 5 - 8 points .
* Nevada —
Five electoral votes .
Bush beat Kerry by 20,000 votes in 2004 in a state won by Republicans in eight of the past 10 presidential elections .
As in New Mexico , the burgeoning Hispanic population will be crucial — it now makes up nearly a quarter of Nevada ’s residents .
A poll on Thursday showed Obama with a 5 - point lead , while other polls in recent days have shown him up by as much as 12 points .
* North Carolina — 15 electoral votes .
Bush beat Kerry by 12 points in 2004 , even though the Democratic vice presidential nominee , John Edwards , was from the state .
More than one - fifth of the population is black and an influx of transplants to high - tech urban areas have given Obama a chance .
A Friday poll showed the race as a tie , while three others have given Obama slim leads of between 1 and 4 points .
* Ohio — 20 electoral votes .
Bush beat Kerry by about 120,000 votes in the state that ultimately decided the 2004 race .
No Republican has won the White House without Ohio , and McCain will have a hard time piecing together a win without the state .
One new Thursday poll gave Obama a 7 - point lead , while another had him up by 4 .
* Pennsylvania — 21 electoral votes .
Kerry beat Bush 51 percent to 48 percent in 2004 , but Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states won by Kerry where McCain ’s camp had seen a chance to reverse the result .
A poll on Thursday had Obama in the lead by 13 points .
* Virginia — 13 electoral votes .
Bush won fairly easily by 9 points in 2004 in a state that has not gone Democratic in a presidential election since 1964 .
But Virginia ’s trend has been toward Democrats in recent state elections amid dramatic growth in the Democratic - leaning northern suburbs of Washington , D.C. Two Thursday polls both gave Obama 4 point leads , narrower than in some earlier surveys .
* Wisconsin — 10 electoral votes .
Kerry won by 11,000 votes out of more than 3 million in 2004 , but Obama has held a lead for months in a state where he crushed Hillary Clinton in a February Democratic primary showdown .
Two polls on Thursday showed Obama ahead by 16 and 11 points respectively .
The American voter has the power .
Use it .

Obama may spell end of blank cheques for Israel Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday December 7 , 2008
Print This Email This JERUSALEM ( AFP )  Israel can no longer expect " blank cheques " from Washington once president - elect Barack Obama 's administration takes over in January , a former US ambassador to the Jewish state said on Sunday .
" The era of the blank cheque is over , " said Martin Indyk , director of the Centre for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institute who is considered close to incoming secretary of state Hillary Clinton .
" The Obama administration intends to be engaged , using diplomacy to try to bring about a safer and more peaceful place , that is different from the seven years of the ( George W. ) Bush administration , " he said on public radio .
" President Obama surely will want to work with Israel on this ( Middle East ) agenda .
But there are obligations on both sides ( Israel and the Arabs ) .
Both sides will have to respect these obligations , " Indyk said .
Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert held a " long conversation " with Clinton earlier this week and welcomed her nomination in Obama 's team , his office said .
She vowed to work for peace and stability in the Middle East .
It has been a while since the LittleBigPlanet launch , and although we 've seen some great user - created content and some spiffy downloadable costumes , new levels from the Media Molecule staff have yet to hit the game .
The company made it clear that more official levels would be on the way after release , and word has it that a " significant patch " will be bringing some of these new levels " very soon . "
Associate producer Eric
Fong dished the dirt on the forthcoming update over at the official PlayStation Blog .
" New levels have been in the works for a while ( but require a lot of testing / fixing / balancing ) , " Fong told readers .
" We working on a fairly significant patch .
Hope to have an update for everyone soon .
Keep checking back .
Finally giving up some ground to commenters , Fong confirmed that the patch would be coming " VERY soon … biting my tongue soon . "
Admittedly , the loss of user - created levels due to copyright infringement took a bit of the wind out of LittleBigPlanet 's sails .
Content creators had looked to imitate some of the finer points of pop culture and came up with some great ideas , but many of those levels have been removed from the game .
And though there are still plenty of worthwhile original levels , it does feel like the community was stung a bit by the moderation blow .
Hopefully some new official levels will pump creativity back into the creators .
The U.S. is not a theocracy , thank god .
Although there are members of Congress who want it to be one .
That would include South Carolina ’s Jim DeMint who wants the new taxpayer funded visitor center at the Capitol to have a more “ God ” in it .
Bob Geiger has the details ( and eviscerates DeMint in the process ) :
Showing once again that whenever a transformational leader like Barack Obama comes along to lead the nation into the future , the Republican party is always there to drag us backwards , Senator Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) tried to delay the grand opening of the new Capitol Visitor Center in Washington because be thinks there just is n’t enough mention of God in the facility .
Saying that the $ 621 million historical exhibit is “ left - leaning ” and leaves out America ’s “ history of faith , ” DeMint tried to use his Senatorial clout to delay the center ’s opening on Tuesday and , among other things , wanted the original national motto of “ E. Pluribus Unum ” — “ from many , one ” in Latin — replaced with “ In God We Trust . ”
“ The Capitol Visitor Center is designed to tell the history and purpose of our nation ’s Capitol , but it fails to appropriately honor our religious heritage that has been critical to America ’s success , ” said DeMint .
What DeMint ’s religious - right stunt leaves out is that the purpose of the center is to provide an “ …educational environment for visitors to learn about the unique characteristics of the House and the Senate and the legislative process ” and to teach about our system of Government — not to talk about the private religious practices of the nation ’s Senators and Representatives .
Prevent Early Form Submission by Hijacking the Enter Key
A customer asked me to create a timecard form a few years ago .
Everything with the form worked great but users would mistakenly press the enter key before their form was completed .
They asked that I make the enter key move the cursor to the next input instead of submitting the form .
This is how I 'd do that using MooTools JavaScript .
The MooTools JavaScript
var inputs = $ $ ( ' input.hijack ' ) ; $ each ( inputs , function ( el , i ) { el.addEvent ( ' keypress ' , function ( e ) { if ( e.key == ' enter ' ) { e.stop ( ) ; if ( inputs [ i+1 ] ) { inputs [ i+1 ] . focus ( ) ; } // last one ? if ( i == inputs.length -1 ) { $ ( ' submit-button ' ) .focus ( ) ; } } } ) ; } ) ;
When the customer hits the enter key , the cursor simply appears in the next input .
While I certainly would n't recommend this for every form , it definitely suited this customer 's needs .
Google leader sees green in white space FCC move will aid communication - and his company
Google co-founder Larry Page and Kevin Martin , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , lauded this week 's FCC vote to open up vacant broadcast spectrum for unlicensed use .
Larry Page , co-founder and president of products at Google , poses for photographers after arriving in Oviedo , northern Spain , October 24 , 2008 .
Page will be awarded with the 2008 Prince of Asturias for Communication and Humanities award at a traditional ceremony on Friday in the Asturian capital .
The Prince of Asturias Awards are held annually since 1981 to reward scientific , technical , cultural , social and humanitarian work done by individuals , work teams and institutions .

Google co-founder Larry Page and Kevin Martin , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , lauded this week 's FCC vote to open up vacant broadcast spectrum for unlicensed use - a move , they said , that carries enormous potential .
The new use of these " white spaces " could enhance people 's lives in much the way that Wi-Fi has become indispensable for laptop and mobile device owners , they said Thursday at a wireless conference in San Jose .
But it will take at least 18 months before devices are built to work on the spectrum .
The available airwaves are in the 700 MHz band and would be able to travel farther and through walls , making their use potentially more cost efficient than Wi-Fi .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" With white spaces you need many fewer ( transmitters than Wi - Fi ) and the cost difference is going to be astounding , hugely different , " Page said .
" In terms of how people use the Internet , how they communicate with each other , how rural areas will be able to have connectivity , this will be a tremendously important thing . "
Page said Google has taken the lead on the issue for reasons both economic and philosophical .
He said if wireless users can get cheap , pervasive Internet access that " just works " everywhere , it will mean more Google searches and a potential 20 to 30 percent increase in advertising revenue .
But he said the cause is also about ensuring that the same access to the Internet , which first catapulted Google from a garage project to worldwide success , is replicated in the mobile world .
" I do n't want people to forget about the Internet , " Page said .
" We 've been active in this area not for our own interests so much as making sure the culture of innovation and services can exist and continue to grow . "
Martin said the FCC went to great lengths to meet the concerns of broadcasters and live performers , who worried that utilizing white spaces would interfere with TV signals and wireless microphones .
Martin said Google was helpful in developing ways of using geo-location for devices , so they will be able to identify existing TV channels and wireless users and avoid interfering with them .
" We certainly benefited tremendously from people like Larry who came in and tried to explain both how it was to be done without interfering and how important it was to get the connectivity he was talking about , " Martin said .
He said the United States , with the FCC 's recent decision , can push the use of white spaces abroad , helping spur development in this area .
Page said the goal is to push down the price of chipsets that can handle white spaces to make them easy to deploy in mobile devices .
Ultimately , he'd like to see radios that could handle multiple wireless technologies , allowing people to stay connected wherever they went .
Both Martin and Page cautioned there is much to be done before the spectrum can be widely used .
Page acknowledged that no standards exist for white spaces , as they do for Wi -Fi .
But he hopes that will be done quickly , following the pattern of Wi-Fi .
He said if the pieces fall into place , it could help the United States regain its leadership position in broadband penetration and wireless innovation .
" We could be first , not in the middle , if we get all this right , " Page said .
" We 're set up to do that .
We have the technology and we have the innovation and a government that 's been doing a good job doing some of the regulatory things we need to make that happen .
So I 'm very optimistic . "
Every three months , Google ( GOOG ) reports the state of its $ 1 billion investment in AOL ( TWX ) in its quarterly report to the SEC .
Over the summer , Google admitted the investment " may be " impaired .
Now it says it " is " impaired .
But at the end of September , the company did n't believe the impairment was " other - than - temporary . "
That could change this quarter , Barclays analyst Doug Anmuth predicts in a note this morning .
Specifically , Anmuth thinks
Google will write down approximately $ 500 million of its $ 1 billion investment , resulting in a charge of about $ 1.17 in GAAP earnings per share .
Even that would value the investment at $ 10 billion , which , Anmuth notes , is higher than the $ 6 billion valuation he estimates .
Anmuth : " We are not surprised that Google would write down its investment in AOL given AOL ’s recent results of declining advertising revenues and our projection of continued declines for the remainder of 2008 and throughout 2009 .
Interestingly , while we project negative growth at AOL ’s display and Third Party Network over this period , we project AOL ’s search business , powered by Google , to grow . "
Anmuth 's commentary was part of a report in which he slashed his Q4 Google revenue estimate to flat quarter - over - quarter growth , based on a slowing ad market .
Anmuth expects Google to post $ 4.05 billion in Q4 sales , below the Street 's $ 4.31 billion consensus .

A five - step guide to understanding the events of the last 24 hours and what is likely to happen in the next few days : 1. THE ISRAELI OBJECTIVE : BREAK THE HAMAS SECURITY SERVICES , PUNISH THE POPULATIONThe rocket and mortar firings into southern Israel were not the cause of the Israeli action .
They were the pretext .
This is not to assert the " innocence " of Hamas and any other Palestinian groups sending those rockets .
This is not to ignore that more than 60 rockets were launched on Wednesday .
It is not to deny that missiles cause damage --- physical , psychological , and economic .
However , Daniel Levy asserts that from 19 June until yesterday , there was not one Israeli fatality from a Hamas attack , and life was improving in border cities like Sderot .
( I would be interested to know of any evidence countering this claim . )
The Israeli military operation , therefore , was not a defensive response to an imminent Hamas threat .
It was not directed against those sending the rockets into southern Israel .
Instead , it was designed to take out as many Hamas security personnel as possible : 32 police stations were attacked yesterday , and 2/3 of the casualties were Palestinian policemen .
That choice of targets , in turn , points to an Israeli decision to hit built - up areas , places where civilians would also be killed and wounded .
Police stations are usually located in the centre of towns and communities , not in isolated " military " areas .
The New York Times records the outcome
The center of Gaza City was a scene of chaotic horror , with rubble everywhere , sirens wailing , and women shrieking as dozens of mutilated bodies were laid out on the pavement and in the lobby of Shifa Hospital so that family members could identify them .
Or , in the words of Sami Abdel - Shafi in The Independent Mobile phones did not work , because of electricity outages and the flood of attempted calls .
I flipped the electricity generator on so that we could watch the news .
We wanted to understand what was going on in our own neighbourhood .
However , this was impossible .
Israeli surveillance drones flew overhead , scrambling the reception .
All I could do was step outside , where I found crowds of frantic people , lines of rising smoke and the smell of charred buildings and bodies that lay around targeted sites nearby .
Somebody said the bombs had been launched in parallel raids over the entire Gaza Strip .
What was the target here ?
Perhaps a police station about 200 metres away .
Other bombs annihilated blocks less than a kilometre away , where one of the main police training centres stood .
When the strikes began , a graduation ceremony for more than 100 recruits in a civil law enforcement programme was under way .
These were the young men trained to organise traffic , instil civil safety and maintain law and order .
Many of them were killed , it is said , in addition to the Gaza Strip 's police chief .
The attacks are continuing today , with the headquarters of Al - Aqsa Broadcasting and a mosque hit and a police station and a factory reportedly targeted .
They are likely to continue throughout the week unless Hamas is unexpectedly broken or asks for a renewed cease - fire .
The lingering issue is whether Israel ups its assault --- and thus the political ante --- by sending in ground forces .
2. THE US POSITION : GO , ISRAEL , GOThe BBC World Service politely called it a " green light " for the Israeli operation .
More bluntly , the Bush Administration is trying in its last days to provide political cover for the Israeli attempt to break Hamas .
The State Department 's press briefing could not have been more blatantly .
When Gordon Johndroe said , " These people are nothing but thugs , ” he was n't talking about the military personnel killing hundreds on the ground below .
Instead , it was evident --- and thus acceptable --- that “ Israel is going to defend its people against terrorists like Hamas ” .
The American position is a logical extension of its ongoing effort , since Hamas changed the political equation by winning elections in Gaza , to isolate the organisation and encourage either a takeover by the Palestinian Administration or another form of " regime change " .
The paradox , of course , is that this Israeli operation makes this far less likely because .... 3 . HAMAS APPEARS TO BE SECUREAmidst the death and destruction in Gaza , the political beneficiary is the Hamas leadership .
That 's not to say that the de facto Prime Minister , Ismail Haniya , is welcoming the pain being inflicted on the population , but --- if he avoids assassination by Israeli missile --- he can make statements about the resolve of his Government and assert that Hamas is still in control .
( I would think it 's a possibility that Haniya and his advisors , deciding not to renew the truce with Israel , calculated that this would be the Israeli response and that it would have the effect of rallying Gazans behind their leadership . )
Indeed , the longer that Hamas can hold out amidst the bombardment , it 's not a question of whether they are overthrown but whether they have " won " by not being toppled .
4. THE ARAB RESPONSE : WHAT ARAB RESPONSE ?
This one 's easy to set out : at the Governmental level , the Arab world are bystanders right now .
The Arab League has postponed its " emergency session " from Sunday to Wednesday on the grounds that Arab ministers are occupied in regular meetings .
That 's an excuse that even my nine - year - old daughter could shred in a heartbeat .
None of those in power from Cairo to Riyadh to Amman wants to see Israel succeed but none of them want to tilt fully behind a Hamas leadership which is in rivalry with the Palestinian authority .
So do nothing and let the Israelis make difficulties for themselves .
5. SIDE EFFECTS : THE US , EUROPE , AND THE UNITED NATIONSFor those looking at the world beyond Gaza , the European Union issued one of the most telling statements yesterday .
It unequivocally condemned attacks from all sides and called for an immediate cessation .
Of course , that call will have little effect upon Israel or rocketeers in Gaza .
However , given the US role in supporting the Israeli assault , this is a clear signal that the Europeans no longer want to be pulled along in a de facto " Western " acceptance of conflict .
A symbolic smackdown to a Bush Administration that faced down " Europe " to get its ill - fated war in Iraq in 2003 or a longer - term sign of a diverging European foreign policy from that of Washington ?
That may depend on what responding signals President Obama offers in the early days of his Administration .
Meanwhile , keep your eyes on the United Nations Security Council , which followed its emergency meeting early this morning with its own call for a cessation to hostilities .
Since Israel is unlikely to heed that demand , the issue will be whether a cease - fire resolution will be put before the Security Council , putting " Europe " ( will it continue to stand apart from the US ? ) , Britain ( dare it not break from Washington ? ) , and the US ( does it cast its veto and effectively endorse more attacks ? ) to the test .
LANSING — Anyone arrested for a violent felony in Michigan will be required to provide a DNA sample under legislation signed into law by Gov. Jennifer Granholm .
Granholm announced Monday she had signed the bill along with several others recently passed by the Michigan Legislature .
People arrested for murder , felonious assault , manslaughter , criminal sexual conduct , armed robbery , kidnapping and some other crimes will be required to submit DNA samples .
Previous Michigan law required only those convicted of certain crimes to provide the samples .
Granholm says she also signed bills aimed at cracking down on smugglers who redeem out - of - state pop cans and beer bottles for 10 cents in Michigan .
Nancy Grace Links Sevendust Song " The Past " To Alleged Caylee Anthony Murder
Nancy Grace has somehow linked the Sevendust song " The Past " to the alleged murder of Caylee Anthony .
On her show recently , Grace hinted Sevendust might be indirectly responsible for murder .
She was highlighting the song , " The Past , " alleging that Casey Marie Anthony may have used the song as inspiration to allegedly murder her daughter Caylee Anthony in Orlando , Florida when the girl was reported missing on June 16 of this year .
A statement by the band was released and reads : " After hearing the news that our song ' The Past ' was a topic of discussion on the Nancy Grace show yesterday , we would like to elaborate .
The song was written as a song of hope .
A song with positive message .
to look back on your life and reflect and to feel good about getting through the rough times that everyone goes through , the roller coaster of life so to speak .
We regret that we 've been linked to the horrible subject involving the disappearance of little Caylee Anthony .
Most of us have children and have been saddened by the story from the beginning .
We pray for the safe return of this beautiful young child and wish her family strength . "

Health groups are fuming at Hollywood 's continued taste for smoking .
A new study by the American Medical Association Alliance , the volunteer branch of the AMA , finds that over the past six years more than half of the movies geared toward children feature characters smoking .
In more than a quarter of the movies , actors light up cigars .
And officials say the Motion Picture Association of America has failed to deliver on its vow last year to weigh smoking in the ratings process .
Among the latest study 's findings :
• Since 2002 , out of 617 movies rated G , PG or PG - 13 , 57 % have featured smoking ; since 2007 , when the MPAA 's stricter policy took effect , 49 % have featured smoking .
• Out of 441 movies rated PG - 13 , 296 , or 67 % , have featured smoking of some kind .
That number has dropped to 56 % since last year .
Sandi Frost , president of the AMAA , says the group launched the study after noticing that most of the teen - oriented summer blockbusters , including " Iron Man , " " The Incredible Hulk " and " The Dark Knight , " featured cigar smoking .
" Hollywood has not responded to the call of the public to reduce the images of tobacco , " she says .
The MPAA " has n't fulfilled its promise . "
MPAA spokesman Seth Oster takes issue with the study .
He says his organization 's own four - year analysis of 3,400 films found that of the 1,938 movies that featured smoking , 75 % were rated R . In addition , he notes , the MPAA has added phrases such as " glamorizes smoking " and " pervasive smoking " in its ratings .
" We have incorporated smoking as a factor on par with other issues like language , violence and sexual situations , " Oster says .
" The motion picture industry takes very seriously the issue of smoking in films . "
The AMAA and American Lung Association are pushing for any film with smoking — other than a biographical film or a movie addressing the dangers of tobacco — to get an automatic R rating , which requires anyone under 17 be accompanied by an adult .
" Hollywood has been bombarding people with smoking messages for decades , " says Paul Billings , vice president of national policy and advocacy for the lung association .
" But they 're still allowed to send the wrong signal to kids , who are seeing their heroes smoking . "
The Supreme Court announced Friday that it will take up a controversial Bush administration legal policy and decide whether the president has the power to order the military to arrest and hold a civilian in the United States on the basis of suspected ties to terrorists .
The justices voted to hear the case of Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , the only person who remains in military custody in this country as an “ enemy combatant . ”
Administration officials say he came to the United States on a “ martyr mission ” for Al Qaeda .
The court will hear arguments in March , two months after the Bush administration has left office .
The case presents an interesting test for the incoming Barack Obama administration , which could defend the government ’s handling of Marri ’s case or change course and prosecute him in criminal court .
“ The Supreme Court ’s decision to grant review will compel the incoming Obama administration to quickly focus on U.S. detention policy , ” said Sharon Bradford Franklin , a lawyer for the Constitution Project .
“ We hope that President - elect Obama will resoundingly reject the current administration ’s breathtaking claim that the United States may hold a civilian in military detention indefinitely . ”

Marri , a native of Qatar , entered the United States with his family on Sept. 10 , 2001 , and said he was seeking a master ’s degree at Bradley University in Peoria , Ill .
He had earned a bachelor ’s degree there a decade earlier .
Three months later , the FBI arrested him and said agents found on his laptop computer information about cyanide and other poisonous chemicals .
Officials said they also learned that he had received payments from Al Qaeda financiers .
At first , the government intended to try Marri on charges of credit card fraud .
But in June 2003 , President Bush signed an order designating Marri as an “ enemy combatant , ” and he was taken to a military brig in South Carolina .
He has been held there in virtual isolation for more than five years .
The Supreme Court will not decide whether Marri is an agent of Al Qaeda .
Instead , the justices will decide whether the Bush administration had the legal authority to bypass the nation ’s civilian laws and to hold a civilian in military custody .
The 5th Amendment says “ no person shall be deprived of life , liberty or property without due process of law , ” and that constitutional protection has been interpreted to apply to all persons in this country , not just citizens .

In their appeal on Marri ’s behalf , lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union said his case raises “ a question of exceptional national importance . ”
Since the nation ’s founding , they said , the Constitution ’s due process provision has been understood to mean “ people arrested in this country have the right to a speedy criminal prosecution . ”
Reacting to the court ’s announcement , ACLU Legal Director Steven R. Shapiro said he was hopeful the justices would “ ensure that people in this country cannot be seized from their homes and imprisoned indefinitely simply because the president says so . ”
The Marri case is separate from the litigation over detainees at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Those prisoners were captured abroad and have not officially entered the United States .
Earlier , Jose Padilla , a native New Yorker , had been held in military custody in the U.S. as an enemy combatant .
He had been arrested at O’Hare Airport in Chicago in 2002 , on his return from Pakistan .
The Supreme Court did not rule on his case , however .
One of his appeals was on its way to the court when the administration switched course and brought criminal terrorism charges against Padilla in Florida .
He was convicted and imprisoned .

Bush administration lawyers had urged the court not to hear Marri ’s appeal .
They said his “ military detention is lawful given [ his ] close association with Al Qaeda and entry into this country for the purpose of committing hostile and war - like acts . ”
They argued that the president was given the power to hold “ enemy combatants ” when Congress adopted the Authorization for the Use of Military Force : S.J.RES.23.ENR : a week after the 9/11 attacks .
It says the president may use “ all necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations , or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 . ”
Some Democrats in Congress have said that the resolution gave the president the power to use military force abroad but did not change the law in the United States .
In July , the U.S. Court of Appeals in Virginia issued a fractured ruling in Marri ’s case .
The court ruled 5 - 4 that the president could indefinitely hold an alleged terrorist in military custody .
By the same margin , the court also said Marri deserved a hearing before a judge to review the evidence against him .

Pepperdine Law Professor Douglas Kmiec said the Supreme Court ’s vote to hear the case “ is quite a surprise . ”
He said the justices could have allowed the hearing to continue , while the Obama administration formulates a new policy on how to handle such cases .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government is refusing to make public the security pact it has signed with Iraq , even though it has already been published in full in an Iraqi newspaper , a congressional hearing was told on Wednesday .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice were holding a closed briefing for U.S. House of Representatives members on the pact signed on Monday that sets a 2011 deadline for U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraq .
Rep. Bill Delahunt , chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations and Human Rights , before the closed briefing called it “ insulting and an after - thought , ” after the Bush administration earlier rebuffed calls for Congress to be consulted during year - long negotiations on the agreement .
The administration has said it will not seek congressional approval for the deal .
It has been in a hurry to finalize the pact , which Iraqi lawmakers still must approve , before the U.N. mandate under which U.S. troops operate expires on December 31 .
Delahunt , who has urged President George W. Bush to renew the U.N. mandate rather than sign a bilateral agreement with Iraq , held the eighth in a series of hearings on the Status of Forces Agreement .
He said the Bush administration had turned down an invitation to attend the open hearing , saying it was a “ sensitive time . ”
Experts testifying before his subcommittee were forced to rely on an unofficial English translation of the security deal .
“ Even now the National Security Council has requested that we do not show this document to our witnesses or release it to the public .
Now that ’s incredible -- meantime the Iraqi government has posted this document on its media website , ” Delahunt , a Massachusetts Democrat , said .
He was referring to the Iraqi government - funded al - Sabah newspaper , whose Arabic version of the deal is also the source of the only known unofficial English translation , by the anti-war American Friends Service Committee .
“ There is something bizarre about the text being disseminated to the Iraqi people and we are being told we cannot distribute the English - language version of the agreement , ” said Rep. Howard Berman , a California Democrat who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
JOINT MILITARY CENTER
According to the unofficial version , the United States and Iraq are to set up a joint committee to oversee and coordinate all offensive U.S. military operations .
“ All such military operations that are carried out pursuant to this agreement shall be conducted with the agreement of the government of Iraq .
Such operations shall be fully coordinated with Iraqi authorities , ” the translated document says .
Oona Hathaway , a law professor at the University of California , Berkeley , said it appeared the agreement would give the joint committee operational control over U.S. military operations .
If so , that would be “ unprecedented and extremely unusual , ” she said .
“ The president can enter into agreements on his own but this agreement goes far beyond the president ’s independent constitutional powers , ” Hathaway said .
She said challenging the legality of the agreement was compounded by the vagueness of much of its wording .
She said standard SOFAs are several hundred pages , but the Iraqi one was a little over 20 pages .
On the controversial issue of Iraqi criminal jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers , the unofficial English version says Iraq will have that right “ when such crimes are committed outside agreed facilities and outside duty status . ”
It does not define “ duty status . ”
But any U.S. service members arrested or detained by Iraqi forces will be kept in U.S. custody pending trial , it says .
In the future , U.S. forces will not be able to arrest Iraqis without Iraqi approval , and those detained must be handed over to Iraqi authorities within 24 hours , requirements that could potentially complicate military operations , Michael Matheson , a former State Department legal adviser told the hearing .

In the staid red velvet , white marble setting of the Supreme Court Tuesday the justices talked dirty words — without using any .
Their case traced to a 2003 Golden Globes award show in which U2 lead singer Bono uttered an expletive in his acceptance speech televised on NBC .
The incident led the Federal Communications Commission to reverse longstanding policy targeting only repeated expletives on the airwaves .
It declared in a 2004 order that any one - time use of certain vulgarities associated with sexual or excretory functions could be sanctioned as indecent .
In a sweeping subsequent order , the FCC found several incidents , including a 2002 outburst by Cher on a Fox Billboard Awards show , indecent under the new policy .
Fox Television Stations and other broadcasters sued , saying the new limits on so - called " fleeting expletives " violated federal law and the Constitution 's First Amendment .
A lower federal court ruled that the FCC lacked sufficient grounds to suddenly target so - called " fleeting expletives . "
While not ruling directly on the First Amendment question , the court strongly suggested the policy would be unconstitutional .
Hearing the government 's appeal Tuesday , none of the justices , nor the lawyers who argued before them , invoked any of the four - letter words at issue .
They instead employed euphemisms and the single first letters of particular bad words .
In many ways , their questions were similarly ambiguous in revealing how they might rule in the case that could have great consequence for TV viewers .
Some justices such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared open to the networks ' argument that the FCC policy was arbitrary in violation of federal law .
" There seems to be no rhyme or reason , " she said , for some of the decisions the FCC has made regarding challenged programs .
She noted that it had found material in a Blues music documentary indecent but not expletives in the TV airing of the World War II movie Saving Private Ryan .
Other justices , including Antonin Scalia , appeared strongly supportive of FCC efforts to curtail coarse words on TV , even when it was a single utterance .
Yet other justices did not signal their positions , and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas asked nothing .
U.S. Solicitor General Gregory Garre defended the new FCC policy .
He said that although regulators are now examining single instances of bad words , they look at them in context .
He said the commission considers the explicitness of the description , as well as whether the material is used to titillate or for shock value .
He used , as example , vulgarities uttered by celebrities at televised award shows .
News programs , Garre said , would be treated differently because of their inherent First Amendment value .
Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether certain vulgarities may be associated with sexual activities but invoked in a non-sexual way .
Garre said that even in non-literal use a particular four - letter word would be coarse and indecent .
Appearing to support Garre 's position , Chief Justice John Roberts later added that such words are often used for emphasis simply because they are dirty words .
" That 's what gives ( the word ) its force , " Roberts said .
Ginsburg questioned whether , despite the lower court 's ruling avoiding the constitutional question , the high court should take on " the big elephant in the room . "
Garre said the government would want the case returned to the lower court for a full hearing on the First Amendment issue .
Carter Phillips , representing Fox Television Stations , urged the justices to keep in mind the free speech context even as it considered whether the FCC had failed to justify its policy under statutory procedures .
Phillips said the FCC's new policy was having a " chilling effect " on broadcasters , particularly in their airing of live entertainment and sporting events .
If the policy is not reversed , he told the justices , " It 's going to just get worse . "

During this US election cycle we are hearing a lot from the pundits and candidates about " heartland voters , " and " white working class voters . "
What they are talking about are rednecks .
But in their political correctness , media types cannot bring themselves to utter the word " redneck . "
So I 'll say it for them : redneck - redneck - redneck - redneck .
Like a Texas cowboy - delegates hang on every word
The fact is that we American rednecks embrace the term in a sort of proud defiance .
To us , the term redneck indicates a culture we were born in and enjoy .
So I find it very interesting that politically correct people have taken it upon themselves to protect us from what has come to be one of our own warm and light hearted terms for one another .
On the other hand , I can quite imagine their concern , given what 's at stake in the upcoming election .
We represent at least a third of all voters and no US president has ever been elected without our support .
Consequently , rednecks have never had so many friends or so much attention as in 2008 .
Contrary to the stereotype , we are not all tobacco chewing , guffawing Southerners , but are scattered from coast to coast .
Over 50 % of us live in the " cultural south " , which is to say places with white Southern Scots - Irish values - redneck values .
We fry things nobody ever considered friable - things like cupcakes , banana sandwiches and batter dipped artificial cheese even pickles
They include western Pennsylvania , central Missouri and southern Illinois , upstate Michigan and Minnesota , eastern Connecticut , northern New Hampshire
So when you look at what pundits call the red state heartland , you are looking at the Republic of Redneckia .
As to having our delicate beer - sodden feelings protected from the term redneck ; well , I appreciate the effort , though I highly suspect that the best way to hide snobbishness is to pose as protector of any class of folks you cannot bear .
Thus we are being protected by the very people who look down on us - educated urban progressives .
And let 's face it , there 's plenty to look down on .
By any tasteful standard , we ain't a pretty people .
Uppity and slick ?
Not us ...
We come in one size : extra large .
We are sometimes insolent and often quick to fight .
We love competitive spectacle such as NASCAR and paintball , and believe gun ownership is the eleventh commandment .
We fry things nobody ever considered friable - things like cupcakes , banana sandwiches and batter dipped artificial cheese even pickles .
Her daughter had a baby out of wedlock ?
Big deal .
What family has not ?
And most of all we are defiant and suspicious of authority , and people who are " uppity " ( sophisticated ) and " slick " ( people who use words with more than three syllables ) .
Two should be enough for anybody .
And that is one of the reasons that , mystifying as it is to the outside world , John McCain 's choice of the moose - shooting Alaskan woman with the pregnant unmarried teen daughter appeals to many redneck and working class Americans .
We all understand that there is a political class which dominates in America , and that Sarah Palin for damned sure is not one of them .
And the more she is attacked by liberal Democratic elements ( translation : elite highly - educated big city people ) the more America 's working mooks will come to her defence .
Her daughter had a baby out of wedlock ?
Big deal .
What family has not ?
She is a Christian fundamentalist who believes God spat on his beefy paws and made the world in seven days ?
So do at least 150 million other Americans .
She snowmobiles and fishes and she is a looker to boot .
She 's a redneck .
Guns , cars and fried food - and a defence of home American ethos
The term redneck indicates a lifestyle and culture that can be found in every state in our union .
The essentials of redneck culture were brought to America by what we call the Scots Irish , after first being shipped to the Ulster Plantation , where our , uh , remarkable cultural legacy can still be seen every 12 July in Ireland .
Ultimately , the Scots Irish have had more of an effect on the American ethos than any other immigrant group .
Here are a few you will recognize : Belief that no law is above God 's law , not even the US Constitution .
Hyper patriotism .
A fighting defence of native land , home and heart , even when it is not actually threatened : ie , Iraq , Panama , Grenada , Somalia , Cuba , Nicaragua , Vietnam , Haiti and dozens more with righteous operations titles such as Enduring Freedom , Restore Hope , and Just Cause .
A love of guns and tremendous respect for the warrior ideal .
Along with this comes a strong sense of fealty and loyalty .
Fealty to wartime leaders , whether it be FDR or George Bush .
Self effacement , humility .
We are usually the butt of our own jokes , in an effort not to appear aloof among one another .
Belief that most things outside our own community and nation are inferior and threatening , that the world is jealous of the American lifestyle .
Personal pride in equality .
No man , however rich or powerful , is better than me .
Perseverance and belief in hard work .
If a man or a family is poor , it is because they did not work hard enough .
God rewards those who work hard enough .
So does the American system .
The only free country in the world is the United States , and the only reason we ever go to war is to protect that freedom .
All this has become so deeply instilled as to now be reflexive .
It represents many of the worst traits in American culture and a few of the best .
And that has every thinking person here in the US , except perhaps John McCain and Sarah Palin , worried .
Very worried .

While I was researching the " Cemetery Safari " chapter for my upcoming book Weird Oklahoma , I came across an unusual burial site west of Tulsa that was entirely enclosed within a strip - mall parking lot .
Once sacred ground , it 's now a conspicuous patch of grass in a sea of asphalt , a quirky spectacle to the shoppers forced to drive around it on their way to Radio Shack .
The handful of graves had become an absurd sight gag that punctuated the often indiscriminate momentum of American progress .
And it got me thinking : were there others like it ?
Surely this was n't the only time the deceased had stubbornly spoiled the aesthetics of a well - drafted parking lot .
I mean , the good spots had already started going to the handicapped ; it was only a matter of time before the dead horned in on the action , too .
And you know what ?
I was right .
In fact , I found even more than I expected ...
Tullahassee Creek Indian Cemetery – Sand Springs , Oklahoma
Situated right between an ATM and a postal drop box , this Indian cemetery comprises about 1 / 4 acre of isolated turf in a parking lot outside Tulsa .
It was founded in 1883 and took less than a century to become the inadvertent centerpiece of a strip mall .

Burr Cemetery – Commack , New York
According to the Huntington ( New York ) Historical Society , the Burr family arrived from England in 1630 , later establishing themselves on Long Island , where they purchased 166 acres of land and proceeded to become prominent , wealthy American citizens .
The Burr family farm once encompassed an area of Commack , New York , near the modern - day intersection of Lakefield Road and the Jericho Turnpike , where they , at some point , established a cemetery , which appears to have been used up until 1878 .
During World War I , the land was turned into Brindley Field , a 90 - acre training facility for pilots .
The airfield was deactivated in 1919 .
Then , around the 1950s , Modell 's Sporting Goods built themselves a franchise nearby , swallowing up the cemetery in the process .
Today , the cemetery lies just outside the doors of the local Home Depot .
Bettis Family Cemetery – Memphis , Tennessee
In 1819 , Tillman Bettis and his family settled in what would later become Memphis , the second family to do so after the Chickasaw Nation ceded the land to the U.S. government .
In 1826 , his wife , Sally Carr Bettis , died during childbirth and was buried in what is believed to be the first marked grave in Shelby County .
In the decades that followed , modern Memphis swallowed up the Bettis homestead , eventually cramming the family cemetery amid the Center City Shopping Center .
The graveyard was enclosed by a three - foot - tall wall and , according to the Memphis Business Journal , became filled with graffiti , drug paraphernalia " and worse . "
Locals looked into the possibility of moving the graves , but doing so would have cost at least $ 35,000 , and nobody had the money .
So , when The Home Depot bought the property in 2002 — that 's right , another cemetery next to a Home Depot — they vowed to clean up the cemetery and look after it once they built their new outlet .
The cemetery now lies right behind the new Home Depot , butted up against the neighboring Piggly Wiggly .
The Grave of Mary Ellis – New Brunswick , New Jersey
Not only is the grave of Mary Ellis embedded in a parking lot , it 's also the focus of a terrific legend .
Mary , who came to New Brunswick in the 1790s to live with her sister , fell in love with a sea captain who promised to marry her once he returned from his next voyage .
The captain then left Mary his horse and sailed off down the Raritan River .
Every day , Mary rode her lover 's steed down to the river , hoping to meet him at the water 's edge .
For years , she gazed at the river , waiting for his return .
In 1813 , she purchased a plot of land overlooking the river , where she maintained her vigil until her death in 1826 .
And there she was buried , forever waiting for her captain .
Meanwhile , commercialism swept through , establishing a series of retail businesses , including a popular flea market , all sharing space with Mary .
Today , Mary 's grave is entrenched in the parking lot of a Lowes movie theater .
In 2004 , the property was purchased by a retail developer who plans to renovate the location with new retail space , parking garages and hundreds of luxury condos .
He hopes to move Mary 's grave out of his way and closer to the river .

Mystery Cemetery – Warner Robins , Georgia
Little information exists regarding this cemetery .
Long forgotten , it was discovered in 2005 listed on some old plats by an archaeologist who was researching the site for a commercial developer .
The cemetery , abandoned and unmarked , sat right where Wal - Mart had planned to erect a brand new Supercenter .
But , since state law did n't prohibit developing around cemeteries , so long as the graves are preserved , they just worked around it .
A retaining wall was installed , the land was regraded and the surrounding surface was paved and striped .
Crowley Mausoleum – Decatur , Georgia
According to a member of the RootsWeb community , James Crowley received about 500 acres of land in the Georgia Land Lottery of 1822 , where he built a home for himself and his family .
When he died in 1828 , he was buried on a hill just north of his home where he was later joined by six other adults and four children .
The homestead changed hands a number of times over the years and was eventually leased to a developer in the 1960s , who built a mall on the property .
Unfortunately , to make a parking lot possible , the hill on which the cemetery stood had to be leveled , so the developer made the unusual decision to leave the graves at their original elevation , build a wall around them about 20 feet high and remove the surrounding earth .
As a result , the only way to access the cemetery is through a locked gate and up a stairway .
No one 's sure who now has the keys .
The mall closed in 2001 and was demolished a few years later to make way for another Wal - Mart and a few satellite stores .
Developers kindly added a grassy buffer around the mausoleum , but it still lies in the middle of a parking lot , right behind a NAPA Auto Parts .

Not her personally , of course .
Just the stupidity and close - mindedness that she so ably personifies .
Via Sullivan .
For over two centuries , meteorologists were puzzled by the observation that atmospheric pressure in the tropics peaks at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. nearly every day .
In the late 1960s , a theory was proposed that these surface pressure variations result from waves that are generated by the sun 's heating of the upper atmosphere .
The waves , called solar tides , propagate to the ground as they travel around the globe .
Strong support for this theory has now been presented in a study by a US - Japan team of scientists spearheaded by University of Hawai'i ( UH ) Professor Kevin Hamilton , Interim Director of the UH climate research center , the International Pacific Research Center .
Hamilton reasoned that if the proposed explanation was correct , then the pressure variations should be affected systematically by topography .
Since mountains cast a kind of shadow for the atmospheric wave as it propagates westward ( following the sun ) and downward , he predicted that the pressure variations should be weaker on the west than the east side of steep mountains .
Working with Wataru Ohfuchi of the Japanese Earth Simulator Center in Yokohama , Hamilton was able to show that this topographic effect is seen in very sophisticated computer model simulations of the global atmosphere .
One of the most dramatic examples of the shadow effect in the computer model results occurs with the tall mountains of the Big Island of Hawaii .
Fortunately , the Mauna Loa Observatory ( MLO ) had deployed a network of pressure sensors on the Big Island in 2004 .
Together with MLO scientist Steve Ryan , Hamilton was able to show that the shadow effect is seen in these real pressure observations as well [ photo : Ryan and Hamilton ( right ) ] .
The Hawaii results thus shed light on an important feature of the global atmosphere .
The International Pacific Research Center ( IPRC ) of the School of Ocean and Earth Science at UH Manoa conducts research to gain greater understanding of the climate system , the nature and causes of climate variations in the Asia - Pacific region , and how global climate changes may affect the region .
Established under the " U.S. - Japan Common Agenda for Cooperation in Global Perspective " in October 1997 , the IPRC is a collaborative effort between the UH and agencies in Japan and the United States .

A view of the LHC tunnel .
Map of the LHC ( the large circle ) and the area underneath which it lies .
The European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) said on Monday that repairing the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) will cost up to € 16.6 million or US $ 21 million .
The LHC , which is the world 's largest and highest - energy particle accelerator , is located near the border of France and Switzerland and crosses the border four times .
It has a diameter of 27 km ( 17 miles ) .
It is designed to simulate the conditions shortly after the Big Bang , but it broke down on September 19 due to an electrical failure .
Most of the repair time is covered by previously scheduled maintenance time , and CERN originally hoped to have the machine up and running again by early May .
However , CERN officials now believe that it may take until the end of July or longer .
CERN spokesman James Gillies said : " If we can do it sooner , all well and good .
But I think we can do it realistically by early summer . "
The machine operates at temperatures colder than outer space and must be gradually warmed up for experts to assess the damage , causing much of the delay .
CERN expects the repair cost to fall within the annual budget for the project .

Obama calls for Blagojevich to step down Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 10 , 2008
Print This Email This Updates : Every Senate Dem calls for Gov 's resignation ; Deputy governor quits
President - elect Barack Obama is calling for his home - state governor to step down , his spokesman said .
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was arrested Tuesday in a wide - ranging public corruption probe in which he was accused of trying to sell an appointment to fill Obama 's vacated Senate seat .
" The President - elect agrees with Lt. Governor Quinn and many others that under the current circumstances it is difficult for the Governor to effectively do his job and serve the people of Illinois , " Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said Wednesday .
" The President - elect believes that the general assembly should consider the issue and put in place a process to select a new senator that will have the trust and confidence of the the people of Illinois . "
Blagojevich has so far refused to step down after his arrest Tuesday in a wide - ranging public corruption investigation .
The governor and his chief of staff were charged with conspiring to solicit bribes in exchange for the an appointment to the Senate seat Obama has vacated .
The charges give no indication Obama was involved in the scheme , and Blagojevich at times complained of his inability to get the transition team to play ball .
The Associated Press first reported Gibbs ' statement , which was confirmed by RAW STORY .
Reid calls for governor to resign ; Deputy governor quits " Senator Harry Reid is drawing a fairly bold line in the political sand in regards to the ethical missteps surrounding Rod Blagojevich , " Sam Stein reports for Huffington Post .
Stein continues : " On Wednesday , the Majority Leader and Sen. Dick Durbin drafted a letter -- which they subsequently urged their Democratic colleagues to sign -- that calls on the Illinois Governor to not just remove himself from office but to ' under no circumstance ' make a last - minute appointment to fill Barack Obama 's vacant Senate seat .
Should Blagojevich disregard these warnings , Reid and Durbin write , the Senate would " be forced to exercise our Constitutional authority under Article I , Section 5 , to determine whether such a person should be seated . "
Also ,
The Associated Press reports that one of Blagojevic 's top aides has resigned .
" Spokeswoman Kelley Quinn on Wednesday said Deputy Gov. Bob Greenlee resigned , " the AP reports .
" The reason for his resignation was n't immediately clear . "
The AP adds , " Greenlee was promoted to be a top aide to Blagojevich in June , replacing former Deputy Governor Sheila Nix .
Greenlee had been a top administration aide previously .
State records indicate the 33 - year - old Greenlee lives in Chicago and earned $ 149,000 a year .
" Update : 50 Dem senators urge resignation
In a letter sent Wednesday night to Blagojevich , all 50 current members of the Senate Democratic caucus urged the embattled governor to resign .
Under no circumstances , the senators wrote , should Blagojevich appoint Obama 's replacement Dear Governor Blagojevich :
We write to insist that you step down as Governor of Illinois and under no circumstance make an appointment to fill the vacant Illinois Senate seat .
In light of your arrest yesterday on alleged federal corruption charges related to that Senate seat , any appointment by you would raise serious questions .
It is within the authority of the Illinois legislature to remove your power to make this appointment by providing for a special election .
But a decision by you to resign or to step aside under Article V of the Illinois Constitution would be the most expeditious way for a new Senator to be chosen and seated in a manner that would earn the confidence of the people of Illinois and all Americans .
We consider it imperative that a new senator be seated as soon as possible so that Illinois is fully represented in the Senate as the important work of the 111th Congress moves forward .
Please understand that should you decide to ignore the request of the Senate Democratic Caucus and make an appointment we would be forced to exercise our Constitutional authority under Article I , Section 5 , to determine whether such a person should be seated .
We do not prejudge the outcome of the criminal charges against you or question your constitutional right to contest those charges .
But for the good of the Senate and our nation , we implore you to refrain from making an appointment to the Senate .

Hubless wheels work by fixing the rotating parts ( brake ring , bearings , hubless rim ) onto the outer side of a non-rotating inner ring that attaches to the motorcycle 's swingarm or forks .

Advantages include decreased unsprung weight , reduced structural stress ( no spokes to transmit forces through ) , increased braking leverage , more accurate steering , reduced vibration and a lower center of gravity .
Hubless wheels also look bitchin ' , which , we 're guessing is the main motivating factor in Amen 's decision to use them .

Since this bike is a clichéd raked out chopper , any pretense of performance or functionality is thrown out the window in the name of extremely questionable style .
We 're guessing the immense complication , need for extreme precision and high maintenance needs of the hubless design are the least of Amen 's concerns , as this motorcycle was n't designed to be ridden .

Studies Suggest More Gains for Green Building in 2009 December 11 , 2008
December 5 , 2008
As reported in CoStar Advisor
Written by Andrew C. Burr
New Numbers Revealed on Worker Productivity , Cost Premiums , Energy Efficiency
It is difficult to imagine economic turmoil as a good thing for any business sector , but as markets have steadily worsened this year , the outlook for the green building industry appears to be trending the opposite direction .
November was an exceptionally robust month for the publication of green building data , with more than 10 surveys and reports exploring an array of topics such as worker productivity in LEED buildings , the impact of construction declines , cost premiums and payback periods , and perceptions of the business case for green .
Though polling and research has increased in the past few years , new data has been even more in - demand lately as property stakeholders attempt to gauge how the credit crisis and a full year of recession have affected green building .
Almost universally , the data points to another good year in 2009 .
One of the more insightful reports is the “ Green Building Impact Report 2008 ” from Greener World Media , which quantifies the overall effects of LEED on industry and the environment .
In its boldest conclusion , the report said that companies in LEED building have realized annual employee productivity gains exceeding $ 170 million as a result of improved indoor environmental quality — a cause and effect that has been difficult to quantify .
That figure is predicted to jump well into the billions by 2015 as the number of employees in LEED buildings grows more than 10 - fold , the report said .
On the industry side , LEED - certified projects have specified more than $ 10 billion of green materials to date , which has been a boon for the manufacturing sector , according to the study .
Environmentally , LEED buildings have cumulatively saved 400 million vehicle miles traveled , 9.5 billion gallons of water and 0.03 quadrillion quads of energy .
The report predicts an overall “ flattening ” of the rate of LEED growth as it begins to saturate markets , but continued growth in the amount of floor area that is certified .
“ The current economic situation coupled with increased stringency in the LEED requirements will contribute to an expected slowdown ” in LEED growth , the report said .
Three studies report on how the downturn in construction will affect green building development — which is not very much , they conclude .
McGraw Hill ’s “ 2009 Green Outlook ” study said green building seems to be insulated from the recession and is growing “ in spite of the market downturn . ”
The value of green construction increased five - fold from $ 10 billion in 2005 to as much as $ 49 billion this year , and could triple by 2013 to nearly $ 150 billion , the study reported .
In Turner Construction Co. ’s “ 2008 Green Building Market Barometer ” , more than 80 percent of real estate executives said they would be “ extremely ” or “ very likely ” to seek LEED certification for new projects in the next three years .
And at an Ernst & Young roundtable of construction company financial executives , 99 percent of survey respondents said interest in green development would increase next year , or at least remain the same as it is this year .
All of that is good news for architects , who were polled in the recent “ 2008 Autodesk / AIA Green Index ” survey by the American Institute of Architects ( AIA ) trade group and architecture software firm Autodesk .
For the second year in a row , architects said that sustainable design is being driven by client demand , which is in turn being driven primarily by perceived energy savings and marketing benefits .
More than 20 percent of architects also said that “ market demand ” was motivating clients to build green .
Only 10 percent said that was a factor last year .
Nearly three - fourths of architects polled were concerned that clients are still not willing to pay cost premiums for green design , although according to a new global study written by sustainability expert Greg Kats , premiums for new buildings average just 2 percent .
Called “ Greening Buildings and Communities : Costs and Benefits ” , the report found that most green buildings cost less than 4 percent more than conventional buildings , with the greatest concentration of premiums in the 0 percent to 1 percent range .
As a CoStar study revealed earlier in the year , key indicators of building value such as occupancy , sale prices and lease rates tend to be higher in green buildings than in conventional buildings , the Kats study reported .
It also said that green buildings reduce energy use by an average of 33 percent , and that cost savings from energy efficiency would more than offset the green development premium , often in five years or less .
Kats said those factors have made green buildings remarkably resilient to the economy .
“ The deep downturn in real estate has not reduced the rapid growth in demand for and construction of green buildings .
This suggests a flight to quality as buyers express a market preference for buildings that are more energy efficient , more comfortable and healthier , ” he said .
That notion is not lacking for supporters .
Eighty percent of respondents in a survey by the Building Owners and Management Association ( BOMA ) International , the U.S. Green Building Council ( USGBC ) and the publication Real Estate Forum said that energy efficiency measures have defrayed costs , and 65 percent said their green investments have generated a positive ROI , which is up about five percent from last year .
Nearly 70 percent of corporate real estate executives responded that sustainability is a “ critical business issue ” in a survey by Jones Lang LaSalle and corporate real estate trade group CoreNet Global in a recent survey , which is up almost 20 points from last year .
And a majority of North American corporate sustainability executives believe capital remains available for sustainability projects , respondents told Panel Intelligence , a research company , in a survey last month .
Apparently however , green building data could afford to spend a little more time away from the office .
Autodesk and research firm Harris Interactive recently asked 2,600 U.S. adults if they knew that buildings are the nation ’s leading source of greenhouse gas emissions .
About 4 percent said they did .
Our Perspective
The movement to Go Green is coming to the forefront .
With the growing demand for energy and the lack of facilities to support this growing demand , steps are finally being taken to address this issue .
The alternative energy market is poised to explode and this will also lead to more energy efficient buildings being built or retrofitted .
This issue should not be taken lightly , America faces a grave challenge in the near future .
We must all work together to spread the awareness and present viable solutions .

Sacred 2 allows players the chance to champion the powers of good , saving the planet , or evil , plunging it into further chaos .
With new character classes , new powers , and a brand - spanking new 3D engine , can Sacred 2 possibly live up to the success of the original ?

Loved
Move , Click , Kill : Sacred 2 is an isometric 3D RPG , and it does n't try to be anything different .
It 's your standard click to kill affair , which can be quite addictive if you 're of the right mindset .
I oftentimes found myself planning on stopping for the evening only to be strung along by more enemies off to the side of my mini-map .
It 's no Diablo III , but until that comes along this will do quite nicely .
Making The Character Your Own :
The wide variety of character customization as you level means that any three Seraphim characters at level 30 are bound to be three completely different builds .
Choosing your skills and upgrading them , allocating attribute points , the equipment you choose , your choice of deity to worship , and the combat combinations you create together create an experience that can be different between play throughs and players .

Stuff To Do : Sacred 2 will keep you busy for quite a long time .
Between the six different characters , differing story lines for good and evil characters , and tons of optional quests , those stepping into the world of Ancaria best plan on an extended stay .
The fact that enemies level with you means that nothing is off - limits , so you wo n't run into griding problems or level obstacles - you 're free to do what you want , any old time .
A Fully Realized World : While Ancaria echoes with themes familiar in usual ROG fare , as a whole it's an interesting blend of science fiction and fantasy , a world all it's own .
This is evident in monster design , player character choices ( go , go Robot Anubis ! ) , and some of the locations you 'll visit throughout your travels .
The beautiful graphics only highlight the unique artistic design of the game .

With Tongue Firmly Planted :
The humor that pervaded the original Sacred is back in full force , with sight gags , text gags , and character expression gags attempting to make the player smile , with varying effect .
Both your character and the enemies you fight often display the knowledge that they are merely actors in a game .
Quite often a dying bandit will exclaim , " I knew I was only an extra ! " , while upon leveling up you might hear your character mentioning their stats improving .
Your mileage may vary , but I found it a pleasant change from more serious RPG outings .
Lutes , Harps , And Electric Guitars :
The unitiated might be a bit put off by the opening cinematic , which features a theme song created by German heavy metal group Blind Guardian , who also appear throughout the game as NPCs , but in this age of sweeping orchestral RPG themes I could n't help but smile at the cheesiness of it all .
The remainder of the game 's music is rather pleasing fantasy music , but it certainly starts off with a bang .

Drop In Anytime : Co-op multiplayer means you never have to go it completely alone .
Playing the game in co-op mode is just like continuing your single - player campaign , only with more people running about .
Loot is time - locked to your specific player , so you never need worry about ninja-looters .
It 's a pleasant way for the more MMORPG - oriented among us to not feel quite as completely isolated as we do when playing the game offline .
Hated
We Got Lost : With 22 square miles of real estate to explore , it is n't always easy to get from point A to point B in the world of Sacred 2 .
The sometimes buggy map is your on again , off again friend , especially when you discover the fifth route you are trying to use to get to a quest objective is just as blocked as the first four .
Mounts and teleports help ease the problem , but the pain lingers .
Advertisement
Artificially Stupid : Stupid AI is n't limited to the enemies in Sacred 2 , who seem to possess only the most limited fight or flight responses .
You 'll often find yourself traveling with NPCs meant to fight by your side , but instead insist on fighting anything the get their eyes on , which makes you question the whole nature of your follower and leader relationship .
NPCs you protect during escort quests are either mentally deficient or supremely confident of your ability to save them from the hordes of enemies they generally wind up running away towards .
Voices Of The Damned : Ladies and gentlemen , the Peachtree High School Drama Team presents Sacred 2 : Fallen Angel , a dramatic reading .
Seriously , the voice acting in Sacred 2 is horrendous .
I 'm not sure if this was done on purpose , or whether it was just something lost in translation .
The original German voice track might be spectacular for all I know .
The English track most certainly is not .

Sacred 2 is exactly the type of PC game I like to play .
A lovely mixture of mindless hack and slash with the odd bit of leveling strategy thrown in to keep your mind from melting into a puddle of bandit - killing goo .
The combat is repetitive , yet entertaining enough that you do n't really mind .
Some of the quest challenge the worst fantasy MMO titles in terms of banality , but the chance at progressing your character and the promise of more battles eggs you on .
The main story itself is n't the most compelling I 've come across , but it certainly gives you something to do between bouts of senseless carnage .
It 's the type of game that does n't try to break the mold , resulting in a familiar yet solidly entertaining title .
Mainly Sacred 2 : Fallen
Angel is just a good time to be had that does n't take itself too seriously .
It 's the perfect diversion for the PC action RPG fan looking for something to do between now and Diablo III .

BEIJING  A noxious cocktail of soot , smog and toxic chemicals is blotting out the sun , fouling the lungs of millions of people and altering weather patterns in large parts of Asia , according to a report released Thursday by the United Nations .
The byproduct of automobiles , slash - and - burn agriculture , cooking on dung or wood fires and coal - fired power plants , these plumes rise over southern Africa , the Amazon basin and North America .
But they are most pronounced in Asia , where so - called atmospheric brown clouds are dramatically reducing sunlight in many Chinese cities and leading to decreased crop yields in swaths of rural India , say a team of more than a dozen scientists who have been studying the problem since 2002 .
“ The imperative to act has never been clearer , ” said Achim Steiner , executive director of the United Nations Environment Program , in Beijing , which the report identified as one of the world ’s most polluted cities , and where the report was released .
The brownish haze , sometimes in a layer more than a mile thick and clearly visible from airplanes , stretches from the Arabian Peninsula to the Yellow Sea .
In the spring , it sweeps past North and South Korea and Japan .
Sometimes the cloud drifts as far east as California .

Deficit Spending and Long - Term Interest Rates
December 22 , 2008
Warnings have begun that U.S. long - term interest rates will turn higher by the second half of 2009 , possibly significantly , under the weight of massive government deficit spending .
This of course did not happen in Japan , so a brief review of that economy ’s experience seems timely .
Japan ’s housing bubble burst in the early 1990’s .
There was a plunge in stock prices .
Non-performing bank assets soared , disabling banks ’ ability to lend .
Economic activity limped along for more than ten years , entering and leaving several recessions .
The initial policy response came from the fiscal side .
Eight stimulus packages during the final eight years of last decade summed to 118 trillion yen , equal to $ 1.3 trillion at the current dollar / yen rate and $ 1.0 trillion at prevailing exchange rates back then .
By far , Japanese public finances were the worst among G - 7 countries , and fears were expressed at the time , like now , that all that deficit spending ( about 25 % of GDP ) could send long - term interest rates soaring .
Japan ’s ten - year JGB yield averaged only 2.68 % in the eight years to 2000 and dropped to an even lower 1.43 % average during the past eight years since and including 2001 .
The rate today touched a low today of 1.20 % despite planned government spending of around $ 1.0 trillion next year resulting in a deficit that will likely exceed 6.5 % of GDP in fiscal 2009 .
The progression of annual average yields is shown below .
Year 10 - Year JGB , % , Annual Mean 1991 6.41 % 1992 5.13 % 1993 4.05 % 1994 4.23 % 1995 3.29 % 1996 3.02 % 1997 2.14 % 1998 1.29 % 1999 1.73 % 2000 1.76 % 2001 1.35 % 2002 1.27 % 2003 1.00 % 2004 1.50 % 2005 1.38 % 2006 1.74 % 2007 1.68 % 2008 1.50 %
The lesson from Japan ’s earlier experience for U.S. and Japanese bond yields in 2009 is not that they will categorically remain low but rather that nobody really knows what is going to happen .
Heavy deficit spending per se does not translate into high and rising bond yields .
Context is key .
World economies are so out of kilter that many normal economic cause - and - effect relationships have broken down .
To the extent that recessions do not end by next summer , credit conditions are still abnormal , and inflation is below target , rising long - term rates will probably remain a concern but not become a reality .
In Japan last decade , deficit spending provided only temporary and generally ineffective relief .
Officials should have first recapitalized the banking system and used other incentives to encourage banks to unload bad loans .
For the United States , the full extent of bad assets will not be known until housing prices stop falling , and a housing market bottom is not yet in sight .

REYKJAVIK , Iceland – Iceland 's coalition government collapsed Monday , leaving the country in political turmoil amid a financial crisis that has pummelled its economy and required an international bailout to keep the economy afloat .
Prime Minister Geir Haarde said he was unwilling to meet demands from his coalition partners in the Social Democratic Alliance , which insisted upon the post of prime minister in order to keep the coalition intact .
Haarde has been prime minister since 2006 .
Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Gisladottir , who heads the Social Democrats , was expected to start talks with opposition parties in an attempt to form a new government .
That government would sit until new elections are held , likely in May .
Haarde had previously said he would n't lead his Independence Party into new elections , because he has cancer .
He told reporters Monday that he had proposed Education Minister Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir , of Haarde 's own party , be appointed Iceland 's new prime minister – but Gisladottir rejected that offer .
" It was an unreasonable demand for the smaller party to demand the premiership over the larger party , " Haarde said .
Iceland has been mired in crisis since the collapse of the country 's banks under the weight of debts amassed during years of rapid expansion .
Inflation and unemployment have soared , and the currency , krona , has plummeted .
Haarde 's government has nationalized banks and negotiated about $ 10 billion US in loans from the IMF and individual countries .
In addition , Iceland faces a bill likely to run to billions of dollars to repay thousands of Europeans who held accounts with subsidiaries of collapsed Icelandic banks .
The country 's commerce minister , Bjorgvin Sigurdsson , quit Sunday citing the pressures of the economic collapse .
Sigurdsson , a member of Gisladottir 's party , said Icelanders had lost trust in their political leadership .
Thousands have joined noisy daily protests in the last week over soaring unemployment and rising prices .
Mirror's Edge
Screenshot courtesy Electronic ArtsBy now you have probably heard the warning : Playing Mirror 's Edge will make you vomit .
The hot new videogame is a sort of " first - person runner " :
You 're a courier who travels across the rooftops of a locked - down , police - state city , delivering black - market messages by using acrobatic feats of parkour .
You 're constantly leaping over gaps 40 stories in the air , tightrope - walking along suspended pipes and vaulting up walls like a ninja .
It does n't do justice to call the action in Mirror 's Edge " intense " :
It quivers , like a hummingbird , and your first - person view is constantly whipsawing like a paranoid cameraman hunting for the best shot .
Only 15 minutes into the game , my mouth began overproducing saliva , and I had to pause the action for a few seconds to avoid carsickness .
I would feel like a total lamer , but apparently even the Penny Arcade guys wrestled with nausea .
Still , it made me wonder :
What makes Mirror 's Edge so different ?
Sure , the action is swoopy and vertiginous , just as it is in many other games .
But I 've played plenty of first - person shooters that required me to navigate ridiculous , zero - G boss lairs that were suspended over improbable heights , and none of those ever made me feel nauseated .
Why does this game get its hooks into my brain so effectively ?
Why does it feel so much more visceral ?
I think it 's because Mirror 's Edge is the first game to hack your proprioception .
That 's a fancy word for your body 's sense of its own physicality — its " map " of itself .
Proprioception is how you know where your various body parts are — and what they 're doing — even when you 're not looking at them .
It 's why you can pass a baseball from one hand to another behind your back ; it 's how you can climb stairs without looking down at your feet .
Most first - person shooters do not create any sense of proprioception .
You may be looking out the eyes of your character , but you do n't have a good sense of the dimensions of the rest of your virtual body — the size and stride of your legs , the radius of your arms .
At most , you can see your arms carrying your rifle out in front of you .
But otherwise , the designers treat your body as if it were just a big , refrigerator - size box .
Worse , in most games your virtual body cannot do even the most simple things that it ought to be able to do .
Every time I 'm playing a first - person shooter , I 'll inevitably try to jump or walk up onto an object — a ledge , a curb , a railing along a wall — and discover that I can't .
The designers decided they did n't need to worry about those subtle physics , and the resulting limitation completely breaks the illusion that I 'm in that virtual body .
Mirror 's Edge , in contrast , does something very subtle , but very radical .
It lets you see other parts of your body in motion .
When you run , you see your hands pumping up and down in front of you .
When you jump , your feet briefly jut up into eyeshot — precisely as they do when you 're vaulting over a hurdle in real life .
And when you tuck down into a somersault , you 're looking at your thighs as the world spins around you .
What 's more , the Mirror 's Edge world feels tactile and graspable .
Because the game is designed around the concept of parkour , or moving through obstacles , most times when you see something that looks like you could jump on it , you can .
The gameplay requires it .
The upshot is that these small , subtle visual cues have one big and potent side effect :
They trigger your sense of proprioception .
It 's why you feel so much more " inside " the avatar here than in any other first - person game .
And it explains , I think , why Mirror 's Edge is so curiously likely to produce motion sickness .
The game is not merely graphically realistic ; it 's neurologically realistic .
Indeed , the sense of physicality is so vivid that , for me anyway , the most exhilarating part of the game was n't the obvious stuff , like leaping from rooftop to rooftop .
No , I mostly got a blast from the mere act of running around .
I 've never played a game that conveyed so beautifully the athletically kinetic joys of sprinting — of jetting down alleyways , racing along rooftops and taking corners like an Olympian .
It 's an interesting lesson of game physics :
When you feel like you 're truly inside your character , speed suddenly means something .
The opposite is also true .
Without a sense of physicality , speed feels lifeless .
In Halo , you 're playing as the cyborgically enhanced Master Chief , so your top speed at an open run is — according to Halo nerd canon — 30 mph or something .
But it does n't feel very fast at all , because your avatar does n't appear to be actually exerting himself .
When you run , your body bobs along not much differently from how it moves when you 're walking , except the scenery goes by more quickly .
The combat in Mirror 's Edge felt more believable than doing battle in Halo , too .
When the cops were shooting bullets at me and I was frantically racing to escape , I kept thinking : " Damn , I 'm going so fast I might just escape ! "
In most first - person games , I usually wonder the opposite : How are these guys not hitting me ?
So the brilliant physicality of Mirror 's Edge is n't just a boon to the game 's physics .
It also makes the narrative and drama more plausible .
So yes , by all means , I 'll keep on playing Mirror 's Edge , even though it occasionally makes me want to vomit .
In the past , I 've often wanted to retch because a game is so bad — but I 've never felt sick because it was so good .

The NS Government had the ability to make the third Monday in every February Viola Desmond Day , but instead designated it Heritage Day .
Last year it switched from celebrating Viola Desmond [ 2015 ] to Joseph Howe [ 2016 ] .
I think it should be Viola Desmond Day every year .
What do you think ?
As he leaves Iraq this week , the outgoing US commander , General David Petraeus , is sounding far less optimistic than the Republican presidential candidate , John McCain , about the American situation in Iraq .
General Petraeus says that it remains " fragile " , recent security gains are " not irreversible " and " this is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill , plant the flag and go home to a victory parade ... it 's not a war with a simple slogan . "
Compare this with Sarah Palin 's belief that " victory in Iraq is wholly in sight " and her criticism of Barack Obama for not using the word " victory " .
The Republican contenders have made these claims of success for the " surge " – the American reinforcements sent last year – although they are demonstrably contradicted by the fact that the US has to keep more troops , some 138,000 , in Iraq today than beforehand .
Another barometer of the true state of security in Iraq is the inability of the 4.7 million refugees , one in six of the population , who fled for their lives inside and outside Iraq , to return to their homes .
Ongoing violence is down , but Iraq is still the most dangerous country in the world .
On Friday a car bomb exploded in the Shia market town of Dujail , north of Baghdad , killing 32 people and wounding 43 others .
" The smoke filled my house and the shrapnel broke some of the windows , " said Hussein al - Dujaili .
" I went outside the house and saw two dead bodies at the gate which had been thrown there by the explosion .
Some people were in panic and others were crying . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Playing down such killings , the Iraqi government and the US have launched a largely successful propaganda campaign to convince the world that " things are better " in Iraq and that life is returning to normal .
One Iraqi journalist recorded his fury at watching newspapers around the world pick up a story that the world 's largest Ferris wheel was to be built in Baghdad , a city where there is usually only two hours of electricity a day .
Life in Baghdad certainly is better than it was 18 months ago , when some 60 to 100 bodies were being found beside the roads every morning , the victims of Sunni - Shia sectarian slaughter .
The main reason this ended was that the battle for Baghdad in 2006 - 07 was won by the Shia , who now control three - quarters of the capital .
These demographic changes appear permanent ; Sunni who try to get their houses back face assassination .
In Mosul , Iraq 's northern capital and third largest city , with a population of 1.8 million , the government was trumpeting its success only a few months ago .
It said it had succeeded in driving al - Qa'ida from the city , while the US said the number of attacks had fallen from 130 a week to 30 a week in July .
But today they are back up to between 60 and 70 a week .
Two weeks ago , insurgents came close to killing Major - General Riyadh Jalal Tawfiq in Nineveh province , of which Mosul is the capital , with a roadside bomb .
The perception in the US that the tide has turned in Iraq is in part because of a change in the attitude of the foreign , largely American , media .
The war in Iraq has now been going on for five years , longer than the First World War , and the world is bored with it .
US television networks maintain expensive bureaux in Baghdad , but little of what they produce gets on the air .
When it does , viewers turn off .
US newspaper bureaux are being cut in size .
The result of all this is that the American voter hears less of violence in Iraq and can suppose that America 's military adventure there is finally coming good .
An important reason for this optimism is the fall in the number of American soldiers killed .
( The 30,000 US soldiers wounded in Iraq are seldom mentioned . )
This has happened because the war that was being waged against the American occupation by the Sunni community , the 20 per cent of Iraqis who were in control under Saddam Hussein , has largely ended .
It did so because the Sunni were being defeated , not so much by the US army as by the Shia government and the Shia militias .
Sunni insurgent leaders who were nationalists or Baathists realised that they had too many enemies .
Not only was al - Qa'ida trying to take over from traditional tribal leaders , it was also killing Sunni who took minor jobs with the government .
The Awakening , or al - Sahwa , movement of Sunni fighters was first formed in Anbar province at the end of 2006 , but it was allied to the US , not the Iraqi government .
This is why , despite pressure from General Petraeus , the government is so determined not to give the 99,000 al - Sahwa members significant jobs in the security forces when it takes control of – and supposedly begins to pay – these Sunni militiamen from 1 October .
The Shia government may be prepared to accommodate the Sunni , but not at the cost of diluting Shia dominance .
If McCain wins the presidential election in November , his lack of understanding of what is happening in Iraq could ignite a fresh conflict .
In so far as the surge has achieved military success , it is because it implicitly recognises America 's political defeat in Iraq .
Whatever the reason for President George Bush 's decision to invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein in 2003 , it was not to place the Shia Islamic parties in power and increase the influence of Iran in the country ; yet that is exactly what has happened .
The surge only achieved the degree of success it did because Iran , which played a central role in getting Nouri al - Maliki appointed Prime Minister in 2006 , decided to back his government fully .
It negotiated a ceasefire between the Iraqi government and the powerful movement of Muqtada al - Sadr in Basra , persuading the cleric to call his militiamen off the streets there , in March and again two months later in the Sadrist stronghold of Sadr City .
It is very noticeable that in recent weeks the US has largely ceased its criticism of Iran .
This is partly because of American preoccupation with Russia since the fighting began in Georgia in August , but it is also an implicit recognition that US security in Iraq is highly dependant on Iranian actions .
General Petraeus has had a measure of success in Iraq less because of his military skills than because he was one of the few American leaders to have some understanding of Iraqi politics .
In January 2004 , when he was commander of the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul , I asked him what was the most important piece of advice he could give to his successor .
He said it was " not to align too closely with one ethnic group , political party , tribe , religious group or social element " .
But today the US has no alternative but to support Mr Maliki and his Shia government , and to wink at the role of Iran in Iraq .
If McCain supposes the US has won a military victory , and as president acts as if this were true , then he is laying the groundwork for a new war .
This week , we 're really happy to be sharing some work we 've commissioned to deliver BBC content ( mainly radio shows from the BBC Audio & Music team ) on demand for users of GNU / Linux .
In RAD , we 've wanted to experiment with non-DRMed content for a while - and managed to assemble some content which was available to access in a number of ways .
One of the complex things about putting content on desktops or OSes ( apart from the two closed operating systems ) is the number of options available .
Free software 's all about choice - but for a large corporation like the BBC , sometimes choices take time .
So , in my team , RAD , we have made initial discussion about our work with a number of vendors , and selected Canonical ( who produce the Ubuntu flavour of GNU / Linux ) for this piece of work - other work in a similar vein is currently under discussion with other vendors / distros .
Of course , this work is also available for people / vendors to port to the two closed operating systems , should they wish to do so .
We then worked with colleagues around the BBC and selected a list of available , updated , current content which we could make available both in and outside the UK , a feed of this content using the URI play metadata framework , with our partner MetaBroadcast .
We then worked with Canonical and their software partners Collabra to deliver this feed to the Totem media player , and Gstreamer multimedia platform , to display available content in a simple , browsable window using a free software plugin , where the feed is updated using the Internet , when the user starts the player .
Click for full size
Lots of this work involved changes to the underlying infrastructure of Gstreamer , as well as developing the plugin for Totem .
We then moved on the adding content to the feed , and helping to optimise the playback experience - eg to download suitable codecs if they were available to the end user .
As the service develops , we will start supplying content in several different formats - some of these are totally free and open , some are n't - we 've reflected the wishes of content owners here , obviously .
We 're happy with this first iteration , and are already seeing patches to the upstream software sources , to allow other OSes and distros to use these improvements .
Longer term , we 'll be looking to improve the content sources , as well as optimise the UI - to show channel or programme icons , for example .
Because this is free software , we can make changes to this - and so can you / other users !
The whole stack is free software - from URI play through to Totem , the media player .
Some codecs will involve a download , and in some territories ( mainly outside the UK ) may be restricted , but the underlying framework is free and open .
Click for full size
This , quite clearly , is not a competitor to BBC iPlayer .
It surfaces a lot of BBC content that is already available , but you wo n't see Doctor Who or Dragons '
Den on there anytime soon .
What you will see is an increasing list of content , in both audio and video formats , that we can share with you in an experimental way , allowing us to explore and test new ways of viewing and listening to some of our TV and radio shows .
Some of the blog posts already online have mentioned that this involves all BBC content - that 's incorrect - it's a limited subset designed for us to explore and evaluate how new platforms might need new distribution systems .
I 'll be posting more technical information explaining how URI play fits into the system , and our other plans for it , later this week , as well as sharing some of our plans for work with other free software partners .

But a $ 14 billion emergency bailout for U.S. automakers collapsed in the Senate Thursday night after the United Auto Workers refused to accede to Republican demands for swift wage cuts .
Detroit 's carmakers have said repeatedly in recent weeks that they are opposed to Chapter 11 filings , and many politicians have been on their side , fearing that bankruptcy for any of the Big Three would have far - reaching consequences for nationwide employment and the overall economy .

Stewart : Jail more likely for Illinois governors than murderers David Edwards and Diane Sweet
Published : Thursday December 11 , 2008
Print This Email This The Daily Show's Jon Stewart poked fun at the scandal surrounding Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich on Wednesday 's show .
After noting in a segment ' for children ' that 3 of the last 7 Illinois governors have ended up in jail , Stewart explains that statistics show if you grow up to become the governor of Illinois , you 're more likely to go to jail than if you commit murder .
Calling the job of governor for the state of Illinois a " dead end " and " a ticket to nowheresville , " he says if Blagojevich is convicted , that will total " 50 % who end up in jail " while " If you commit murder , only 48 % end up in jail for their crime . "
After a montage of various media reporters trying to pronounce ' Blagojevich , ' Stewart notes " Lou Dobbs ca n't pronounce a foreign sounding name .
What a surprise ! "
The media clips continue as each reporter highlights one of many of the governor 's alleged misdeeds , to which Stewart queries " What is n't he charged with ? "
At that point , a clip from the film ' Fletch Lives ' begins with the line " Molesting a dead horse . "
As Stewart asks if surely Blagojevich did n't do anything " that rises to the same levels as necrophilic beastiality ? " a news clip recounts the alleged charge of Blagojevich attempting to ' shake down a children 's hospital . '
Stewart retorts that " You 're better off bleeped word a dead horse . "
The Daily Show's Jason Jones joins in at the end of the program to recount a Daily Show interview with Blagojevich in Februrary of 2006 to discuss his executive order that pharmacists must dispense any drugs for which a customer had a valid prescription , including birth control pills and Plan B .
This controversial measure was being challenged on the show by state legislator Ron Stephens from Greenville .
A clip of the appearance is shown where Blagojevich is told to talk on the phone as he would if discussing his executive order on birth control , but the governor talks into the phone saying only a few words about someone named ' Tony ' and ' Rocky ' that the show then compares with a clip from ' Goodfellas . '
Blagojevich was interviewed by Jason Jones during that show , who repeatedly pretended to be unable to pronounce Blagojevich and simply called him " Governor Smith " .
This prompted Blagojevich to turn to the camera and ask " Is he teasing me or is that legit ? "

The good news is your home may be worth more than the rock - bottom price that your neighbors ' houses fetched .
The bad news :
No one but you might think so .
The one point of widespread agreement in the real - estate industry is that there is no single accurate index of home prices .
They are all over the map , cover different sets of homes and may exclude parts of the country or be unduly influenced by the mix of homes sold in a given month .

DjVu(デジャヴと読む ) は、テキストや画像を含むドキュメント向けのファイル形式である。テキストと背景画像のレイヤー分離や高速な表示、圧縮率の高さを特徴としている。1996年、AT&Tで開発された。
すでにお気づきの方もいるように、DjVuはAdobe PDFへの対抗馬として世に送り出されたものである。実際、DjVuは多くの場合、同じドキュメントからクオリティを落とさずにPDFよりも小さなサイズのファイルを生成することができる。DjVu開発者による比較では、PDFで1.14MBだったファイルがDjVuでは0.88MBになったそうだ。PDFより約25%も小さなファイルを生成できた、ということになる。視認性も往々にしてPDFより高い。2002年にはFlip Book やPDFと並 びInternet Archiveの公式フォーマットの一つに採用されたし、米名門誌The New Yorkerの全バックナンバーを収めたDVDではファイル形式としてDjVuが採用された(japan.internet.comの記事)。最近だとOLPCの公式文書フォーマットにもなったので、そちらで初めてDjVuの名前を耳にしたと言う方も多いかもしれない。実は現在DjVuの権利を持っていて商用利用を進めているのは日本の会社セラータムなので、いくつかの日本の政府機関や企業などでも使われているようである。
なんだかんだ言っ てAdobeにがっちりコントロールされていて、一皮剥くとnon-freeなあれやこれやが剥き出しとなるPDFと違い、DjVuは完全に自由なフォーマットであるということも、私のようなフリーソフトウェアの支持者にとっては大きなメリットだ。仕様もリファレンスライブラリも公開されており、特許の問題もない。GNU
GPLが適用されたフリーの実装、DjVuLibreも存在する。スタンドアロンのブラウザや各種ウェブブラウザ向けのDjvu表示プラグインなども一通り揃っている。また、私たちCJK言語圏に住む人間にとっては、Adobeのnon-freeなCMapだのなんだのが常に付きまとうPDFと違い、文字の表示にフォントを必要としないというのもメリットであろう。
こうして見てくると、今頃は世の中の文書の8割くらいがDjVuになっていてもおかしくないわけだが、残念ながらDjVuの知名度は現在でも非常に低く、世にあるドキュメントの圧倒的多数はPDFである。こうなった理由はもちろんいろいろあるが、その一つはライセンシングの問題だったと私は思う。それも、実にくだらない。
現実問題として、今は言うに及ばずDjVuが登場した時点でも、この世に存在する多くのドキュメントはPDFあるいはPostScript形式であった。よって、PDFなりPSなりからDjVu形式に変換するユーティリティが必要となる。この用途のために開発されたのがDjVuDigitalであった。DjVuDigitalは、当時DjVuの商業展開を行っていた(そして後に先ほど出てきたセラータムに買収された)LizardTech社が開発したものである。
このDjVuDigitalは、バックエンドとしてGhostscriptを使う。というより、Ghostscript自体に手を入れてDjVuを吐くドライバを追加したものを呼び出すというのがその実態である。このドライバ部分はAT&Tが開発したもので、GSDjVuと呼ばれている。
DjVuDigitalそのものは2004年、LizardTechからDjVuLibreプロジェクトに寄贈され、フリーソフトウェアとなった。GSDjVuもやや遅れて2005年、AT&Tからフリーソフトウェアとして公開された。話だけ聞くと万々歳のように見えるでしょう、ところがそうでもなかったんだな。
DjVuDigital はDjVuLibreの一部となり、GNU
GPL の下で公開されている。よって、こちらには何の問題もない。問題はGSDjVuのほうで、どういうわけかAT&Tはこれを、IBMのCommon Public License Ver. 1.0 ( CPL ) の下で公開してしまったのである。
CPLは確かにOSI 認定のオープンソース・ライセンスだが、特許の扱いや準拠法に関してGPLとぶつかる条項を含んでいるため、GNU
GPLとは両立しない( incompatible )。よって、GPLが適用されたGhostscriptの一部として、GSDjVuを取り込んだバイナリを配布することができないのである。もちろん、ユーザが自分でGSDjVuのソースコードを拾ってきてGhostscriptのソースにパッチをあて、自分の手元でビルドすることは可能だが(Gentooはそうやっているようだ)、面倒なことには変わりがない。当然Debian/UbuntuやFedoraといった有力GNU/Linuxディストリビューションの公式なGhostscriptバイナリパッケージにGSDjVuが含められるということはないし、Ghostscriptの公式なソースコードにGSDjVuが含められるということもありえないのである(Ghostscriptのほうでライセンシングに例外を設けるという手もあるが、Ghostscriptの開発陣は現時点では極めて消極的だ)。DjVuLibreの開発者らは数度に渡ってAT&Tにライセンスの変更を頼んでいるようだが、何せ相手は図体の大きな企業、どうもいろいろなところをたらい回しにされているような気配で、あまり期待できそうにない。最近になって、ようやくGSDjVuを必要としないpdf2djvuのような変換ユーティリティが登場するようにもなったが、DjVu普及の出端は完全にくじかれたという感は否めないのである。
この話が悲喜劇的なのは、GSDjvuが純然たるフリーソフトウェア/オープンソースだということだ。元々プロプライエタリというなら諦めもつくが、フリーソフトウェアであるにも関わらず、ライセンスの問題でまっとうな利用ができないということなのである。こんな間の抜けた話があろうか。Ghostscriptは大概のUnix系OSにインストールされているだけに、もしGSDjVuがGhostscriptにきちんとした形で取り込まれていれば、どのコンピュータでもDjVu形式のファイルが扱えるという状況にぐっと近づいたはずなのである。それは、AT&Tにとってもプラスにこそなれマイナスにはならない状況のはずだ。また、実のところGSDjVuはDjVuのみならずGhostscriptによるPDFの生成や印刷にもプラスになる部分があり、DjVuの普及云々は抜きとしても取り込みたい部分ですらあった。ようするに、AT&TとしてGSDjVuをオープンソースにしたい、しても良いという心持ちがあったのは明らかにも関わらず、不注意のため(おそらく狙ったものではないだろう)全く本質的ではないところでつまづいてしまったということになるのだ。
この話から得られる教訓は、私が思うに二つある。一つは、当たり前だがライセンスは慎重に選べ、ということだ。オープンソースのライセンスといってもいろいろある。変なものを選んでしまうと、元々自分が達成したかった目標の達成など到底おぼつかない。よほど特殊な理由がない限り、GNU
GPLかBSDライセンスのどちらかにしておくのが無難というものである。もう一つは、これは教訓というよりはお願いに近いが、企業がオープンソースに乗り出すのであれば、外部からの要望にきちんと反応してくれる人なり部署(私自身はIR、Investor RelationsをもじってHR、Hacker Relationsと呼んでいる)なりを用意して、周知してほしいということである。私自身、いくつかの大企業とこの手の交渉をした/試みたことがあるが、そもそも誰にコンタクトを取ったらいいのかがよく分からないことが多かった。エンジニアのレベルでは知り合いがいないわけでもないが、彼らがこの手のライセンシングに関して決定権を持っていることはほとんどない。逆に法務部などは、そもそも何が問題になっているのかすら分からないことがよくある。何が問題になっているかをある程度理解した上で、話をうまくしかるべきところにつないでくれる人がいると、聞き入れられるにしろ断られるにしろ話がスムーズに進んで非常に助かるのである。今回のケースも、AT&Tの中でちょっと汗をかいてくれる人さえいれば、案外あっさり解決したはずなのだが。
The Opera Browser running on
what is patently not an iPhone
Although in numbers it lags behind Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Safari , the Opera web browser is known for having a devoted fanbase .
Opera has made inroads into gaming consoles and mobile platforms including the Wii , Nintendo DS , and approximately 40 million cell phones .
So , you 'd imagine that Opera would be a perfect match to the iPhone .
Unfortunately , Apple thinks otherwise .
A New York
Times story from this week says that an iPhone version of Opera failed to make it past Apple 's gatekeeper , " [ Founder Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner ] said that Opera 's engineers have developed a version of Opera Mini that can run on an Apple iPhone , but Apple wo n't let the company release it because it competes with Apple ’s own Safari browser , " the Times wrote .
Opera is known for being fast and secure , as well as accessible to a wide range of users .
The mobile version of Opera can dynamically reformat web pages to better fit handheld displays using the company 's small screen rendering technology .
And , even though Opera representatives state that this rejection was due to duplicated functionality , Opera would have had a tough time getting through a different gate : Apple will not allow programs to interpret code .
Opera , being a full - featured browser , interprets JavaScript downloaded from the Internet , an absolute App Store no -no .
This is n't the first time that Apple has rejected software for duplicating core functionality .
In September , Apple said no to MailWrangler , a program that simplified accessing multiple Gmail accounts .
Around the same time , the company also declined to host Al Sokirynsky 's Podcaster app , which allowed users to download podcasts and play them on the iPhone .
Because of this , we do n't find Opera 's rejection particularly surprising , although it is a bit disappointing .
Mobile Safari is a great mobile platform , but it would have been nice to have an iPhone version of Opera to play around with .
Update : Gruber says the app probably was n't even submitted .
When Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared Hamas responsible for all the killings in Israel ’s attacks on the Gaza Strip , it was easy to dismiss it as an expression of the Bush Administration ’s “ special relationship ” with the Israeli government and knee - jerk support for any killings with the word terrorist remotely linked to them .
Yet it seems there may have been a more practical concern of culpability at play .
When he Israeli government was bombing every police station in the densely populated strip , some of those attacks were coming by way of US - supplied GBU - 39 smart bombs .
It is unclear how many of the hundreds of people killed in the Gaza Strip in the past 48 hours died at the hands of American munitions , but to the extent that the carnage has gotten some television coverage in the United States , direct American involvement is likely to be unpopular with a war - weary nation .
And while the Bush Administration is unreservedly in support of the attacks , the incoming Obama Administration , just weeks from inauguration , is using it ’s default cop -out excuse to avoid commenting , with David Axelrod declaring that “ only one president can speak for America , ” and “ that president now is George W. Bush . ”
But for the rest of the world , outside of the US and British governments , most urge both sides of the conflict to stop their attacks and return to the bargaining table .
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni lashed out at the calls for peace , demanding that the international community “ support things that are not easy to support , ” in this case the evisceration of the Gaza Strip .
She insisted that only through backing the Israeli attacks will the offensive be short .
2008 was the year that Web 2.0 became more mainstream .
More ad agencies , businesses , and non-profits used Web 2.0 tools as a way to build community and relationships , cross promote products and issues , and integrate their online and offline marketing strategies .
Some like Zappos were extremely successful and nailed their Web 2.0 strategy while others like the makers of Motrin were burned by mommy bloggers for not doing proper research on their target audience .

With the economy in a slump and budgets being cut in traditional print and TV advertising campaigns many will be looking to the Web 2.0 world to reach their constituents .
So what should be on your Web 2.0 radar for 2009 ?
Web 2.0 gurus give you the low down .
Chris Brogan : New Marketing Labs
“ 2009 sees a few things : site mergers / acquisitions for some of the weaker social network platforms , and a stronger push towards identity portability and friend ( social graph ) portability .
We love our social networks , but why should I suddenly develop amnesia when you and I join a new one ?
It should know we ’re friends and treat us accordingly . ”
Chris Brogan ’s Website and Blog Mary Hodder , Founder of Dabble.com and VP of Product Development , Apisphere “ The future of social media is user ’s owning their data , deciding who to send it to .
Look for more companies that currently host the user ’s identity to have less control over that , as things like Open ID take over and more companies try to compete by giving users more control over themselves .
Look for ways users can own their own data , and companies that might offer that , sort of like a personal information bank .
The changes may seem subtle but I think we ’ll see companies now , like Facebook , who try to be everything to you : your bank account for info , your identity , your tools for publishing , and your bar / restaurant for socializing , having to give up some of those roles or hold them less powerfully .
And I do n’t think it ’s natural for one company to hold all that power .
It leaves you with very little control over your online self .
Of course , Facebook will fight this to the last , so they wo n’t be the first to give up some of this control .
Others will and eventually to compete Facebook will follow .
But they are the great example of the problem .

The other big change will be in companies finally building for revenue in the social and any other space online , as they build for growth in their free or social products . ”

“ Social Media will cease to be such an ‘ experimental ’ field in marketing and will start to become part of the main core of good campaigns .
Web 2.0 is the participatory web – which means that the power of this time is that we are all producers .
In former days of marketing , companies delivered messages and goods and customers were meant to consume them .
Not so much any longer .
Customers are major players in the arena of marketing – I would argue more so than the marketing professionals themselves now – so it is important to realize that and shift the marketing program to be more about how you interact and empower those customers rather than how you control and spread the message . ”

“ I see social media in 2009 becoming more and more accessible to mainstream audiences .
Twitter , seesmic , YouTube and other tools we saw as playgrounds for the young have moved into the digerati toolbox and are migrating to the mainstream .
This means that everyone will experience what bloggers and gamers learned at least 5 years ago–following people online is a great way to virtually know and screen potential contacts and friends , as well as a tool to maintain connections .
As for tech , I ’m excited about personal devices–smart phones , integrated devices –I want to see them come down in price and go into wider distribution so people do n’t need to rely so much on computers . ”

“ From a mapping perspective , you can expect to see much richer integration of “ location - aware ” services with a variety of devices .
For example , mobile devices ( such as those powered by Android ) now commonly include GPS .
Of course this can be used for applications like “ find pizza places near me ” , but also can be used , for example , when a natural disaster hits .
Imagine that local people on the ground will be able to easily map and share where bridges are out , roads are closed , or where emergency shelters and medical care are available .
Keep in mind that in the developing world , people have far more phones than laptops .
In terms of social media , I think we are just at the beginning of “ collaborative mapping ” – people working together with friends and colleagues to build shared maps of places they care about .
Also , the grassroots environmental organization Appalachian Voices has combined social networking and mapping in an interesting way on their advocacy site to end mountaintop - removal coal mining : here ’s a map of all the people referred to the site by actor / activist Woody Harrelson , including their “ degree of separation ” from Woody .
We might be seeing more “ social maps ” like this in 2009 . ” Rebecca Moore ’s Website Nate Ritter : Entrepreneur and Web Developer
“ The biggest changes have already started , but we ’ll see the tech take shape and make more money in 2009 .

(1) Location based services will proliferate and become more useful to the end user .
( 2 ) Aggregation services will change from just “ drinking from the fire hose ” to become very specific aggregation tools , perhaps with very specific use cases .
The amount of data we can consume as humans stays limited , but filtering that data to become useful for specific reasons is not only something that ’s doable , it has an incentive … targeted customers .
Those customers might be businesses or consumers , but the days of shooting from the hip with a shotgun approach are quickly ending .
Shooting from the hip will stay , because it ’s fast , easy and cheap ( and will get faster , easier , and cheaper ) to build web applications .
But being fast does n’t mean you ’re being smart .

“ I ’m not sure that things will evolve the way people have seen in the
past .
I predict that it ’ll mostly be about trying to figure out what users
really want and what they find most important then fine - tuning things based
on that feedback .
The pace of evolution may really slow down by
comparison , but the user experience will be far better .
We ’ll also see a shakedown of Web 2.0 companies – some will survive ,
but many will just shut down .
The ones that survive will have figured
out a revenue model , or are simply critical to their user base ’s
day - to - day lives . ”

A new poll of more than 21,000 people in 21 countries shows that American impressions of the United States government ’s behavior in the Middle East differ drastically from the impressions of the rest of the world .
A majority of Americans ( 56 percent ) believe that the US “ shows respect ” to the Muslim world , but just 16 percent of worldwide respondents feel this way .
Exactly two - thirds of the world feels the United States acts disrespectfully toward the Islamic world .
Roughly half who feel this way believe American disrespect is born out of “ ignorance and insensitivity ” and half say the disrespect is shown on purpose .
Importantly , majorities in Iran , Egypt , and Pakistan believe the United States intentionally tries to humiliate Muslims , with near majorities of Palestinians , Turks , and Jordanians agreeing .
( Looks like Karen Hughes did n’t accomplish all that much . )
American and worldwide opinion is similarly at odds on the question of America ’s global military footprint .
Seventy percent of Americans believe it is a good idea for US naval forces to be stationed in the Persian Gulf , but just 22 percent of the worldwide public agrees .
Huge majorities in Gulf states disagree .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Taiwan ’s Acer Inc surged past global champion Hewlett - Packard Co in European personal computer sales in the third quarter , in the clearest sign of the move toward cheap , small mini-notebook computers , research firm Gartner Inc said on Tuesday .

Worldwide PC shipments rose 15 percent in the quarter , with HP in the lead , followed by Dell Inc .
The July - September period was marked by strong growth in the lower - cost mini-notebook category , which Acer has been focusing on , Gartner analyst Mika Kitagawa said .
This helped bolster the overall PC market in he face of slumping consumer spending .
Acer ’s market share gains in the quarter were driven by surging sales of its mini-notebooks , a segment in which HP and Dell do not have a strong presence , she said .
Mini-notebooks , also known a netbooks , refer to PCs with screen sizes of five to 10 inches .
They usually cost less than $ 500 , while standard laptops can cost two to four times as much .
Kitagawa estimated that less than 5 percent of overall PC shipments are mini-notebooks , but she said the market seems to be growing .
Overall , worldwide PC shipments rose 15 percent from last year to 80.6 million units .
At the same time , U.S. shipments rose 4.6 percent to 17.4 million units .
HP shipped 14.8 million units in the quarter , for a market share of 18.4 percent , barely changed from a year ago .
Dell was in second place with a share of 13.6 percent , down 0.5 percent from last year , while Acer ’s piece of the market jumped to 12.5 percent from 9.7 percent .
Kitagawa also noted that Acer saw 16 percent U.S. shipment growth from the second quarter , while Dell and HP struggled .
“ In general the U.S. market felt the impact of the economic downturn very much , so especially those vendors that are in the professional market , it had much impact , ” she said .
An eminent French doctor believes he has found not just a treatment for compulsive drinking but a miracle cure .
The claims , made by Dr Olivier Ameisen in a book which has jumped into the best - sellers ' list in France , have created a huge stir in the European medical establishment .
Fellow doctors in France and Switzerland -- often under pressure from patients -- have tested his methods and say that they were " astonished " by the results .
Other specialist doctors and anti-alcoholism campaigners are sceptical and even angry that Dr Ameisen -- a leading cardiologist -- should claim there is a simple pharmaceutical solution to what they insist is a complex physical , mental and social disease .
Nonetheless , anti-alcoholism clinics are being besieged by demands for treatment with the drug prescribed by Dr Ameisen in his book , ' Le Dernier Verre ' ( ' The Last Glass ' ) .
An English translation will be published next year .
The French government agency which tests new drugs has taken the unusual step of deciding to examine the doctor 's claims -- unusual because the drug he has " discovered " is not new .
Baclofen is a cheap drug which has long been known as a cure for muscle spasms , especially among sufferers of cystic fibrosis or people who are partly or wholly paralysed .
Dr Ameisen says his own experience and that of other patients suggests it can also be used to ease and then destroy an intolerable craving for alcohol .
It is so effective , he claims , that alcoholics can go back to social drinking without fear of renewed dependency .
" Mine is the first case in which a course of medicine has completely suppressed alcohol addiction , " Dr Ameisen said .
" Now I can have a glass and it has no effect .
Above all , I no longer have that irrepressible need to drink . "
Besieged
Another doctor who has tested it is Dr Renaud de Beaurepaire of the Paul - Guiraud hospital at Villejuif near Paris .
" I prescribed it to two alcoholics who were at the end of the road , " he said .
" It was pretty miraculous . "
Another alcoholism specialist , Philippe Michaud , is less convinced .
" This book has really dropped us in it , " he said .
" We are being besieged by calls and letters from people who want the same treatment . "

A Colbert Christmas : The Greatest Gift of All has redefined the holiday special for the new millennium .
But it may also have redefined holiday songs for the 21st century as well , especially Willie Nelson and Stephen Colbert 's " Little Dealer Boy . "
Think " Little Drummer Boy " 2.0 , substitute the phrase " finest gifts " for marijuana , and you 're there .
Or better yet , just check out the video of the entire song at right .
It 's a double - exposure romp that might make Jesus blush , if he was n't already rumored to have used cannabis himself .
After all , as Willie sings in the duet , cannabis is a " plant that smokes more sweetly than either frankincense or myrrh . "
If you like the tune , you 're probably going to love the rest of the bizarro standards found A Colbert Christmas , out now as an iTunes - only digital EP .
Heck , you might even dig Toby Keith 's War - On - Christmas shocker " Have I Got a Present For You , " the very track that had me worried that Colbert 's holiday special might suck .
Boy , was I wrong about that .
Meanwhile , " Little Dealer Boy " has caught some flak on Colbert Nation , but I think it is one of the finest Christmas tunes ever laid down .

Hacking the Food Problem
A perennial problem for my wife and I run into while bootstrapping our business is the lack of time .
It seems like the daily grind of cooking , cleaning and shopping tends to eat up most of our available time that we have .
As much as I 'd love to take credit for this , it was my wife 's idea .
She was fed up with the day after day worry of what to cook and the drudgery of meal prep .
So she came up with this system .
I think it ’s a great hack and an elegant solution to the food supply problem , so I thought I 'd write a post about what she came up with .
We try to eat at home 5 - 6 days a week but my wife hates thinking about what to cook every day .
Hates it .
We do n’t have the money for a personal chef , so she found the idea for Once a Month Cooking ( OAMC ) on the web and we picked it up and ran with it .
The basic premise of OAMC is that the majority of the effort of cooking is spent in planning and food prep .
If that work can be consolidated into one big event , the process can be made repeatable and much more efficient .
How does it work ?
Find 8 - 10 recipes that will freeze well and preferably share common ingredients .
Think chopped garlic , onions , cubed Chicken , strips of beef , etc ...
, etc ... Quadruple each recipe , creating 32 - 40 meals total
Create a shopping list of ingredients
Go crazy at Costco and the Farmer ’s Market
Come home , do all the food prep at once .
Chop all the garlic , onions , peppers , chicken , beef , etc … for all the meals , all at once
Divide ingredients into individual meal portions and place them in freezer storage bags
Label each freezer bag
Create cooking instructions for each recipe and include a copy with each meal
Freeze all meals
Thaw a meal a day , follow instructions on label to heat and eat .
Dude , that 's wierd .
Why do this ?
In a nutshell :
We save a lot of time .
The sheer convenience of having a freezer full of tasty meals that can be ready in 30 minutes is wonderful .
All that my wife does to plan the entire week ’s meals is look at the list of meals in the freezer and decide which to prepare .
It ’s a big time saver at the end of a long day .
Time saved on cooking is time we can spend on the business .
Once the research is done on the 8 - 10 recipes and the shopping list is made , those can be recycled next month .
At this time , we have a library of about 40 - 50 recipes that we reuse so we do n’t get tired of eating the same things all the time .
At some point I plan to put this in a database , but I have n’t gotten around to it yet .
We save a lot of money .
We save a lot by buying items in bulk .
When flank steak or chicken thighs are on sale , we can buy a bunch of them , and make our budget go a lot further .
We also save money by avoiding restaurants .
When we go to a restaurant and order a comparable meal , we pay 2 - 3 times as much .
Saving money on food frees up money for the business .
We both have specific diets we need to follow .
My wife is on a diet and I ’m allergic to dairy .
When we do n’t do Once a Month Cooking , we really struggle to figure out what to eat .
A lot of restaurant food or frozen TV dinners are n’t really friendly to either of our diets .
By planning things ahead of time , we save a lot of that stress and headache .
We eat better .
We ’re foodies , and we like knowing what is in our food and what is n’t .
We do n’t need all the extra sodium , preservatives or flavor enhancers that come with store bought prepared foods .
We buy our produce from our local farmer ’s market and it ’s so much tastier than the stuff at the grocery store
You have food when the in - laws come to visit .
If you have meals in the freezer , it ’s really not a problem when family comes over for the holidays .
There ’s really no reason that the in - laws need to know that your delicious holiday meal came out of your freezer .
How to get started
Double or triple your next meal .
That 's probably the easiest way to dip your toes in the OAMC pool .
into portions before cooking , and package and freeze the extra meals .
Then pull them out in a couple of days and cook them .
If the process worked , you ’ve found a recipe that freezes well and can be reused .
There is a learning curve associated with the process and it ’s best to go easy on yourself at first .
You need to figure out what meals freeze well and what meals do n’t .
Some sauces or marinades do n’t freeze well .
Nothing ’s worse than spending 8 hours putting meals in the freezer , only to discover three weeks later that the marinade you made for your Thai lemon chicken has transmogrified your Thai lemon chicken into Thai sour shoe leather .
The down side
It ’s a lot of work .
In doing this , you ’re essentially you ’re doing all the planning and food prep ahead of time .
In 8 - 12 hours , my wife and I can do planning , shopping and food prep for the month .
That saves us about an hour a day of cooking x 40 meals , so it ’s a net time saver .
But , the day that we do the Once a Month Cooking tends to be a long day .
It takes a while to build up a repertoire of recipes .
A lot of the recipes online for doing OAMC are casserole type dishes that are heavy on the cream based sauces and smothered in cheese .
Ever since we moved to California , however we ’ve decided to give up casseroles for Lent .
Our tastes run quite a bit different than what we find online , so we ’ve had to work hard to find a series of recipes that work for us and freeze well .
You get addicted to kitchen gadgets .
It does n’t take too many times of chopping 12 cups of onions , or 3 whole heads of garlic , before you start to realize that your life would be so much easier if you had that shiny new DeWalt / Kitchen Aid 24 quart , 12 horsepower food pulverizer that you just saw on America ’s Most Macho Kitchens .
Since we started OAMC , we ’ve bought a 16 quart food processor , a 4 quart mixer with an engine powerful enough to propel a pontoon boat , a Food Saver vacuum pack system , and we shop at restaurant supply stores for our food packaging materials .
You need freezer space .
We now have 2 chest freezers and two refrigerators .
We have a 14 cubic foot chest freezer we bought last year , a 7 cubic foot freezer that we owned while we lived in a one bedroom apartment and we recently purchased an extra fridge for the garage .
We use it to store beverages as well as the multiple flats of meat that we purchase when we go to Costco .
I ’m pretty sure we ’ve gone overboard .
And , you do n’t need this much freezer space .
But if you start doing OAMC , the puny 3 cubic foot freezer in your refrigerator will start to look anemic and pathetic compared to the manly full - sized chest freezers at the Sears Appliance Store .
Finally
You can outsource this .
I add , that sometimes we do n’t feel up to doing all of this work ourselves , and there are companies that do similar things for you .
The Dinner A’Fare and Dream Dinners both have stores where you can either go in and do the meal preparation in their kitchens yourself , or for a fee , they will prepare the meals for you to put in your freezer .
We do that from time to time as well .
You do n't save as much money , but we do save a lot of time that way .
My wife and I have been doing this and refining this process in one form or another for the past 10 years , although it ’s only been in the past 2 years that we ’ve really tried to do it full time .
Now , we ’re at the point , where if we do n’t do Once a Month Cooking , I find myself wandering aimlessly from freezer to freezer to fridge wondering what to eat .
If people are interested , we ’d be happy to post some example recipes , shopping list and cooking instructions .
We ’re due for our Once a Month Cooking Extravaganza this next weekend .

Carbon dioxide has been seen on a hot planet outside our solar system , another piece of evidence supporting the possibility that life could develop elsewhere , astronomers say .
The US space agency NASA said its Hubble Space Telescope has discovered carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of " hot Jupiter " planet HD 189733 b , which orbits a nearby star 63 light - years from Earth .
The planet is itself too hot to support life - its surface temperature is about 1,000 degrees Celcius .
But the astronomers said the observations are a proof - of - concept demonstration that the basic chemistry for life can be measured on planets orbiting other stars .
In March , they found the ingredients for methane on the planet , one of about 300 planets so far found circling stars other than our own .
Evidence has also been found for water vapour there .
" These atmospheric studies will begin to determine the compositions and chemical processes operating on distant worlds orbiting other stars , " said Eric Smith , Hubble Space Telescope program scientist at NASA .
Mark Swain of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California used Hubble 's near - infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer to study infrared light from the planet .
He was able to identify carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide , which absorb certain wavelengths of near - infrared radiation .
" The carbon dioxide is the main reason for the excitement because , under the right circumstances , it could have a connection to biological activity as it does on Earth , " Mr Swain said in a statement .
" The very fact we are able to detect it and estimate its abundance is significant for the long - term effort of characterising planets to find out what they are made of and if they could be a possible host for life . "

JRuby 1.1.6 is now available for download ( JRuby 1.1.6 release notes ) .
A major feature is the Ruby 1.9 parser support committed in late November .
As the release notes state , JRuby comes with most of Ruby 1.9 libraries , with full support planned for Q1 2009 .
The Ruby 1.9 support can be turned on with the -- 1.9 command line switch .
JRuby embedders can set the version , for instance , with a org . jruby .
RubyInstanceConfig instance , which can be passed to the JavaEmbedUtils.initialize ( List loadPaths , RubyInstanceConfig config ) method .
The release notes also note improvements to the org.jruby.javasupport.JavaEmbedUtils class , which is useful for everyone embedding JRuby in regular Java code .
Interacting with JRuby can require the use of internal JRuby APIs which are prone to change between releases .
Solutions for this have been available eg. with BSF , or the JSR 223 hosting API introduced in Java 6 .
Using the BSF requires the BSF library , whereas JSR 223 will tie the code to Java 6 .
The JavaEmbedUtils class allows to initialize a JRuby instance , call methods , convert Ruby types to Java types , etc. without dependency on either BSF or JSR 223 .
The release notes further list :
- An evergrowing list of dead IO references bug fixed
- Much faster Array.sort
- Run gems out of jar files without having to unpack them .
- Store gem repositories in jars and load them via the classpath .[.. ]
- Removed two measurable memory leaks during RC process
- 74 bugs fixed since 1.1.5
A sample of the fixed bugs is
JIRA -3189 " java.lang .
Iterable should have an each method "
JIRA -3230 fixes Hpricot which was broken in the 1.1.5 release
JIRA - 3233 fixes a problem with instantiating Java objects with Rails 2.2.2
JIRA - 3126 " Allow Rubygems to be loaded and used from within jar files "
Finally , Ruby 1.1.6RC1 was the JRuby version used in the latest Ruby shootout .
( CNN ) --
In recent years , Alec Baldwin has been on top of the world -- and buried beneath its weight .
Alec Baldwin received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance on the TV show " 30 Rock . "
Professionally , Baldwin has hit a new level of success with his Emmy award - winning turn as corporate honcho Jack Donaghy on " 30 Rock . "
( His performance also earned him a Golden Globe nomination Thursday . )
The actor also earned critical praise for supporting turns in the movies " The Aviator , " " The Departed " and " The Cooler . "
Personally , however , Baldwin 's life became fodder for the tabloids , particularly during his protracted divorce battle with ex-wife Kim Basinger .
In 2007 , an angry voice mail Baldwin had left for his daughter was made public by the gossip Web site TMZ.com .
At the time , Baldwin and Basinger were in an angry custody fight related to their 2001 divorce .
The outspoken Baldwin has now written a book , " A Promise to Ourselves : A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce " ( St. Martin 's Press ) , about the psychological toll of divorce , as well as the much - debated concept of " parental alienation . "
He talked to Joy Behar on " Larry King Live " about the book , his divorce , politics and Sarah Palin , and how he feels about the public eye .
The show is scheduled to air at 9 p.m. ET Wednesday .
Following are excerpts from the interview , which have been edited for clarity : Watch Baldwin talk about Basinger , suicide »
Joy Behar : I really thought this was a very compelling book .
Alec Baldwin : Did you like it ?
Behar : Yes . ...
You write very well , I thought .
Baldwin : I find , for people who went through that , or someone close to them went through that , they got a lot out of it .
For ordinary people that have n't dealt with that , it might be a little dry .
Behar :
But where are you at now , in your head ?
I mean , how is everything in your heart and your head ?
Baldwin : Good .
Behar :
It 's good ? ...
You 're in a good place ?
Baldwin on ' King ' Alec Baldwin talks about his painful divorce , his new book and a sketch with Sarah Palin on " Larry King Live . "
Tonight , at 9 ET see full schedule »
Baldwin : I mean , I feel happy .
I have -- the job that I have is a fun job .
Behar : A great job .
Baldwin :
It 's a great job .
Behar :
You 're hilarious on it .
Baldwin :
We have fun .
... I just -- I really can't complain about anything .
I really -- and you look at the economy , and you see how many people are struggling and do n't have a job .
...
And I have a job .
Behar :
That could happen .
Baldwin :
Who would have thought ?
Behar : I know .
It 's true .
But I think I thought that you were with your daughter , Ireland ...
Baldwin :
Yes , she 's here with me , yes .
Behar : ... who is a beautiful girl .
She 's here with you , so that 's all better .
Baldwin : Yes .
- - - - -
Behar : OK .
We 're back with Alec Baldwin .
Alec , let 's talk about your marriage now , OK ?
I think that ...
Baldwin :
Do we have to ?
Behar : Well -- because you 're in a good place about it .
You have distance now .
Baldwin : Yes .
Behar :
You can talk -- tell me about Kim .
What was it about Kim Basinger that attracted you to her , besides ...
Baldwin : Let 's talk about something else .
Behar : ... her obvious beauty ?
Baldwin : Right .
But I mean , but ...
Behar :
What was it ?
Baldwin : ...
To me , none of that matters .
What I 've learned is that there are relationships .
And this is why I wrote the book " A Promise to Ourselves , " ...
Behar : Right .
Baldwin : ... from St. Martin's Press .
Behar : Yes .
Baldwin : I wrote the book , because there are people I know who , they can have a collaborative divorce .
They can have a divorce in which everybody has some dignity , and they can resolve these issues without lawyers and judges and court - ordered therapists ...
Let 's put it this way .
So much of what I went through the last eight years , it was unnecessary .
It was completely unnecessary .
It costs a fortune .
And more the psychic toll .
I mean , I aged like 20 years in the last eight years .
It really -- it killed me .
I was really tired .
Watch Joy and Alec talk about the effects of divorce »
Behar : I know .
The book -- it comes through in your book .
Baldwin :
Yes , it 's pretty heavy .
...
But that 's behind -- in other words , all of that is behind me now ...
Behar : Yes .
Baldwin : ... to the extent that I think that people do get tired .
I mean , I can't think of anybody I have less respect for than some of the lawyers involved with my case , and some of the judges .
Behar : ... You say something about 50 - 50 custody .
I 'm not sure if I agree with that particularly .
Baldwin : Why ?
Behar : I do n't know if that 's ...
Baldwin :
What about it ?
Behar :
Well , because why -- why should it be 50 - 50 ? ...
Baldwin :
Well -- but here 's the thing .
And that is that , I believe that 50 - 50 custody should be the default position for men who want and earn 50 - 50 custody .
If during a divorce proceeding or a custody proceeding , you determine that the father was never there , he 's only doing it to spite the mother .
He 's only taking half of something that he does n't want , to spite -- to reduce someone else 's time .
Well , like in -- West Virginia has a very important law right now , where custody is allocated after an analysis is done of what the parenting -- of how the parenting duties were divided during the marriage .
So , for example , if you and I are married and we have a kid , and you go off to work every day ...
Behar : Yes .
Baldwin : ... and I come -- and we get divorced , and I say , " I would like to have 50 - 50 custody , " and you say , " No .
You worked all the time , " I can go to court in West Virginia and say , " Well , you worked all the time , too .
We both had careers that took us away from the child .
So , it was n't like you parented more than I did . " ...
I do n't want anybody to automatically get custody .
I want qualified men , who want it -- because many men do n't want it .
That 's a very important issue as well .
Behar :
Do you remember the moment when your marriage fell apart ?
Because I can almost remember mine .
...
Baldwin :
You know , I do n't really -- I can't really remember it .
It 's all like a blur to me now , you know .
And it does n't really matter to me .
I feel like I met someone , and they were someone who was an incredibly alluring person .
And I was new in my business .
I met someone who was very interesting .
And I was at an age ...
Behar :
How old were you ?
Baldwin : I was -- when I met her , I was 32 . ...
I was 32 .
And I got married three years later .
I was 35 .
My daughter was born when I was 37 .
So , all of it was ...
Behar :
How long did you know Kim before you got married ?
Baldwin :
Three years .
Behar :
Oh , three years .
So , you really knew ...
As they say , you knew the grenade you were going to fall on .
[ laughter ]
OK .
Baldwin :
Those are your words , Joy .

( Baldwin appeared on an episode of " Saturday Night Live " that featured a guest appearance by Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , whom Baldwin -- a committed Democrat -- opposed .
In a sketch , Baldwin insulted Palin and then tried to suck up to her . )
Behar :
Did you get to talk to [ Palin ] a little off camera ?
Baldwin : Very briefly .
Behar :
Oh , yes ?
Was it friendly ?
Baldwin : Well , she was entombed in Secret Service agents .
And they had to -- they covered the entire floor and the elevator , and the entire ... and they closed off the street .
There had to be 950 Secret Service agents ...
Behar : Yes .
Baldwin : ... because she 's the vice presidential candidate .
Behar :
Do you think that [ Baldwin 's " 30 Rock " co-star ]
Tina [ Fey ] 's impression of her did anything to the election ?
I mean , do you think it had anything ...
Baldwin : People say it did .
But , I mean , I could n't possibly comment on that .
I would n't know .
But people say that it did .
I want to think that -- I do n't really know .
I have more faith in the American people .
I can't imagine that they would let that sway them .
...
But I think that the correct answer is that what Tina did , and so beautifully , was just underline what was already out there in the journalistic zeitgeist and on the record , which was the woman was not ready to be the vice president of the United States .
Watch more of the discussion with Joy and Alec »
Behar : Yes .
Baldwin :
She just was n't .
Behar :
Do you think she knows that -- or knew that ?
Baldwin : I think it was a win - win for her to be the nominee .
She 's only the second woman to be the nominee in this country .
Behar : Yes , right .
Baldwin : ...
And I think that , you know , for her , it 's just full speed ahead now for her career , or whatever she wants to do .

( Baldwin was n't pleased when the voice mail to his daughter appeared on TMZ.com . )
Baldwin :
When that happened -- because it was at the -- it was at a time when -- actually , when that happened , it was at a time when I believed that the worst was behind me .
I actually had a couple of months of everything being very pleasant , and on so many levels .
The show , we were winning some awards .
I really felt like things -- that life was good .
We live in a culture in which humiliating people and bringing people down for scorn is ...
Behar : I know .
Baldwin : ... is a big part of it .
You know , mocking people .
I mean , your show , they -- you go on YouTube , and the things you say , they sensationalize ... If Elisabeth [ Hasselbeck ] says something ...
Behar : Yes .
Baldwin :
And she kind of gets into it with you or Whoopi [ Goldberg ] , the next thing on the AOL home page -- and what 's dumber than the AOL home page , the AOL home page used to be like the dumbest content you could find -- the AOL home page has ... the clip of you guys , you know , butting heads for the , only the fourth time that week .
Behar : I know .
And I have to constantly tell people that we like each other off the air .
Baldwin : Who cares ?
Behar :
It 's just on the air .
It gets tedious .
Baldwin :
Why does everything have to be about the negative , and people 's problems ?
Behar :
That 's what they like .
Baldwin :
This person 's butt is too big .
Here 's a -- here we snuck some shots of this woman on vacation at the beach .
Behar : I know .
But is n't it a distraction from the real problems of life ?
You 're losing your job .
Your kids are driving ...
Baldwin :
That 's what 's criminal about it .
Behar : Yes .
Baldwin : I think we need to -- we need to focus on what 's wrong .
We need to keep our minds on the things that matter , and not what does n't matter .
And entertainment has become like this opiate that keeps people from focusing on what 's real .
Who cares if some actress ' ass is too big ?
Do you really care ?
Behar :
The actress does .

Power users are controlling digg ...
Many people have great submissions and they never become popular .
Here 's a quote from one of Digg 's very own users " Just as an exemplary anecdote , I 've been a user on here for nearly three years now .
I read digg on a casual basis further back than that prior to signing up .
In the first two years after I joined , I submitted stuff fairly regularly .
Maybe once or twice a week or so .
In those two years , I think maybe three to four submissions made it to the front page .
Back around February or March of this year , I submitted something I thought was pretty cool that had a decent chance of making the front page .
I did it on break at work and checked digg when I got home to see how it did .
The story made it to the front page allright , but it was a submission made after mine from MrBabyMan that used the same exact story with a slightly different URL .
I realized there was no point .
I 'm running across cool and funny stuff on the web all the time , and I 'd love to share it with the community .
But since I 'm not friending people left and right for inane and arbitrary reasons , I know it 'll never become popular .
And if I DO find something that could make it to the front page , one of the power users will swoop in for the kill .
It 's not really a matter of who gets credit for the popular story to me .
( Since we 're so prone to be the poor man 's 4 Chan , we might as well all be anonymous . )
The problem is since I know that if I am discouraged and have given up on submitting stuff , I have to wonder how many other casual users of this site are doing the same because they also realize that its simply pointless .
Surely there are tons of users who have found useful , funny , .. dare I say it ..
NEW stuff that is n't getting to the front page because of this and because of the stranglehold that the power users have on this place .
Digg has n't been a democracy for a long time .
It 's an oligarchy . "

" He does need to address the kinds of things that seem to be with him at various times and one of those that he 's dealt with for a really long time , he needs to address in a way that most of us might understand -- alcohol issues , " Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told ESPN.com 's Pat Yasinskas .
" I am disappointed for him and his opportunity and for the Cowboys and our opportunity and , frankly , for the NFL , " Jones said .
" I would like to have been standing here talking about his success and the curtain coming up for him and addressing his issues .
That certainly would have been more positive . "
In his letter to Jones informing him of his latest suspension , Goodell said Jones ' " disturbing pattern of behavior was clearly inconsistent with the conditions I set for your continued participation in the NFL . "
The disturbance at an upscale Dallas hotel came only six weeks after Goodell reinstated Jones from a 17 - month suspension .
" It 's terribly disappointing to me that we 're dealing with this again and that he 's reflecting so poorly on all of the players in this league , which they do n't deserve , " Goodell said at the NFL meeting in St. Petersburg , Fla .
Goodell said a lifetime ban remained a possibility .
" It 's going to be up to Adam and what he does in the following weeks .
Getting an evaluation and whatever treatment may be prescribed to him at that point of time , " Goodell said .
" Part of it is going to be whether he 's willing to do some of the things that we are asking him to do . "
The player 's agent , Worrick Robinson , did n't return messages left by The Associated Press with his assistant and on his cell phone .
Goodell said the NFL , if asked , would help set up evaluations .
Asked if substance abuse was involved , Goodell responded , " I do n't know .
I 'm not a doctor .
I think that 's one of the reasons we want him to get an evaluation . "
League and law enforcement sources told ESPN senior NFL analyst Chris Mortensen prior to the ruling that Goodell was expected to weigh whether Jones was in potential violation of his probation , in which he was prohibited from alcohol - related incidents .
When Goodell reinstated Jones from suspension before the regular season began , sources said one of the commissioner 's conditions for Jones to remain an active player was that he remain in compliance with all aspects of his three - year probation from his no-contest plea last February to a felony in Fayette County , Ga .
" We respect and support the decision of the commissioner , " Jerry Jones said in a statement earlier Tuesday .
" I regret that this issue has brought negative attention to the Cowboys and the NFL .
We move forward with a very clear knowledge as to what the process will be for a possible reinstatement .
Adam is well aware of where he stands and what he has to do . "
Police reported that Adam Jones might have been drinking when he was involved in the scuffle with a Cowboys - assigned bodyguard last week in Dallas , but Jerry Jones has refuted many of the allegations and speculation , saying the incident was nothing more than back - and - forth banter that got out of hand .
A small glass item on the vanity in the hotel 's restroom was damaged .
The player and his bodyguard , part of a security detail provided by the Cowboys to be with him at all times , said everything was OK .
Police said both were driven from the hotel by an acquaintance , and the bodyguard did not want to press charges .
No arrests were made .
Jones began his time in Dallas under close scrutiny by the league after he was suspended for the entire 2007 season for multiple violations of the conduct policy while he was a member of the Tennessee Titans .
The Cowboys traded for Jones before his suspension was over and he was reinstated by Goodell on Aug. 28 .
Goodell also said his decision on whether Jones can return to play will be based on Jones ' strict compliance with the NFL and the Cowboys in relation to treatment plans and evaluations by clinical experts .
" I 'd like to see him intensify his approach to getting better with his social conduct , " Jerry Jones told ESPN.com .
" I 'd like to see that .
If it were successful , I 'd like to be a part of it .
I 'd like to have influenced it .
I know the commissioner , considering his conduct policies in the NFL , it was a well - considered decision to let Adam back into the NFL . "
The Cowboys ' owner said he does not regret making the trade that brought Adam Jones to Dallas .
" I do n't regret having been a part of helping him do better , " Jones told ESPN.com .
" I am sorry that we 've had the negative publicity and that is the price that we pay for the team as well as the NFL . "
Jones 's friend and mentor , former Cowboys defensive back Deion Sanders , felt the minimum four - game suspension was a little harsh , according to the Dallas Morning News .
" [ Goodell ]
He made a real cautious decision , and we respect it , " Sanders said , according to the report .
" But Adam is certainly not happy .
He 's upset with the severity of it , being the four games .
" But really what he 's upset about is , we 're praying that he does n't lose hope .
Let 's keep in mind he was told that he was going to be suspended for eight games a couple seasons ago , correct ? "
Sanders said , according to the newspaper report .
" And the suspension lasted the entire year .
...
So he 's thinking to himself , ' All right , I was already told this once before .
Hopefully , this is not the same process . '
"
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The recession and economic turmoil is creating a new class of casualties : Married couples who can't afford to get divorced .
In these tough times many people are finding it 's cheaper to stay together , even when they can't stand each other .
" The reason that the economy has such an enormous impact on divorce is that most people in the middle - income brackets are getting by on whatever income they have .
They 're just getting by , " said Bonnie Booden , a family law and divorce attorney in Phoenix .
A major factor in the divorce downturn , Booden said , is divorced couples have to establish two separate households with current funds -- a prohibitive factor when you 're looking at divorce in tough economic times .
Booden said one out of every two clients is seeking consultations because they can't afford to get divorced .
They want to know what other options they might have .
" I tell them about the process , about the cost , and what a reasonable outcome might be .
And once they hear the cost , and especially how you have to duplicate two households on the same money that currently funds one household , they try to think about some other options , " she said .
Some clients have split up bedrooms and continue to live in the same house , she said .
Some split child - care duties so they do n't have to deal with each other and live that way until they can figure out what to do .
" And I 've had people who just throw in the towel and get divorces anyway , creating financial ruin for themselves , " she said .
Circuit courts across the country report downturns in the number of divorce and separation filings .
Cook County 's Circuit Court in Chicago saw a 5 % decrease in filings -- about 600 cases -- in the first three quarters of 2008 compared to the same period last year .
Similar drops were reported in other cities across the country .
This domestic situation is also confirmed in a poll by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers .
The AAML surveyed its members -- all divorce lawyers -- and found that 37 % of them have seen a decrease in the number of couples seeking a divorce , while just 19 % saw an increase in divorce cases .
Gary Nickelson , president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers , said people are just , " toughing it out " and putting off the decision to divorce until the economy gets better .
" We 're in a perfect storm as far as the divorce business is concerned , " Nickelson said .
" It 's not a surprise to me .
That 's been my experience over the last 35 years .
When you have an economic downturn people are not so quick to change their situation . "
Out of options
Some people who come to Booden 's office have come from marriage counselors , she said .
By the time these couples get to her , she said , they 've pretty much run out of options .
Typically , she said she tries to arrange a deal where both parties continue to own their house .
She 'll split up the equity and apply an interest rate to it to make it reasonable to the person not living in the house , and then distribute the cash when the house is sold after the kids go to college .
" People have to realize the financial meltdown changed everything , " she said .
That sentiment is echoed by the AAML's Nickelson .
" As long as stocks and financials and major assets are down , you 're probably going to see a lot of people wait to file for divorce .
There 's a lot of fear in filing for divorce , " he said .
" I think that cuts across all genders , races , and all social economic ranges . "

Introduction
After procrastinating , I finally decided to sit down and learn to program in F# , since functional programming has always intrigued me .
Although I had some experience with Prolog many moons ago , I have done most of my programming using imperative rather than functional or declarative languages , with recent work mostly in C# .
Whenever I 've learned new languages , there is always an effort required to " get up to speed " , but with F# , I found the initial steps were more difficult than I anticipated , due to the lack of a mature IDE , on top of learning a new language and adjusting to a different programming paradigm .
I 'm still no expert in F# , but perhaps , some of my early stumbling might be of use to others , so they do n't have to go through the same pain that I did .
This article describes my steps in getting F# to work for desktop applications .
First , I 'll describe how I got F# installed with VS 2008 , and note some general program and architecture related issues that I ran across .
Next , I 'll present a simple Windows Forms application that can be used as a template for desktop applications written in F# .
Finally , I 'll summarize my perceptions of F# as a language , mention the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation , and explain where I think F# fits in my personal .NET programming toolbox .
As an example application , I put together a simple parser test to be used in an expert system based on fuzzy logic .
The parser simply accepts text input , and defines variables and fuzzy sets .
The application allows text to be saved into and read from a text file , and is used only in my testing , so it is n't much useful in terms of fuzzy logic .
For anyone interested , the actual parser and fuzzy set code is contained in the sample project , but wo n't be discussed here , since it is beyond the scope of this article .
Perhaps , in a future article , I 'll describe the rest of the system and show a real word application .
By way of background , the parser is meant to parse a fuzzy set and variable definitions .
A variable is declared using either of these forms :
Variable Name of Context [ = ]
Value ( i.e. Variable Depth of Water = 250 ) Variable Context Name [ = ]
Value ( i.e. Variable Water Depth 250 )
and a fuzzy set is declared by the form :
FuzzySet Name Context [ = ]
Values ( i.e. FuzzySet Deep Water ( 0,0 ) ( 900,1 )
In both of the definitions , both a Name and a Context are specified so that ideas with similar names can be differentiated , for example , a Hot Day vs. a Hot Volcano .
Both can be measured in temperature units , and have the same name , but the ranges and the meaning of the " Hot " concept is very different .
Getting F# Up and Running
To get started with F# , I downloaded the Microsoft F# CTP ( Version 1.9.6.2 ) from the Microsoft F# website[^ ] , saving the .msi file and then running it to install F#. I accepted all the installation defaults , and it installed without any obvious problems .
Once installed , I opened VS 2008 Professional , and tried to activate the F# add - in according to the Microsoft instructions , but the F# add - in was not on the list under Tools | Add-in Manager .
After uninstalling and reinstalling with the same results , I finally discovered that by simply typing Alt + Ctrl + F , the F# Interactive window opened , and apparently the installation had worked just fine the first time , an hour or so earlier .
The F# add - in still does n't show up in the Add - in Manager , but it seems to work just fine .
Once installed and working , using the VS editor with the F# Interactive tool was easy .
By simply typing code in the editor , highlighting it , and pressing Alt + Enter , the highlighted code is copied into the interactive F# window , compiled , and run .
It 's beautiful for trying , testing , and interactively debugging code snippets .
Also , in the editor , Intellisense seems to work for most , but not all , of the F# code that I needed .
In trying to code anything more than some trivial tests , however , I ran into two problems which I have n't really found mentioned elsewhere online .
First , even though I was able to pop -up a Windows form , I always had the black DOS / Command window show up as well .
Since the F# system does n't allow you to add a Windows Forms project , you have to manually go to the Project | Properties and set the application type to Windows Application .
It appears that the default F# project is always a Console Application .
Second , even though I added references to the standard .NET namespaces ( open System .
Windows .
Forms , etc. ) , the F# compiler always complained about not finding things like System .
Windows .
Forms , System .
Windows .
Drawing , etc .
Apparently , VS does n't automatically add the common references , and those had to be added manually under Solution Explorer | References .
With those two items out of the way , using F# was fairly easy , with the rest of my headaches being due to learning a new language and programming paradigm .
Once my project got to the point where I needed several source code files to keep things organized , I ran into several other problems .
First , there is no obvious entry point , main function , or other obvious starting place in F# programs .
So , how does the compiler know where to start ?
Apparently , the F# system simply runs all of the executable statements in the last file compiled .
This has two immediate implications :
The order of the files in the Solution Explorer makes a difference .
Make sure the starting point for your program is in the last file in the project list .
To work around these issues , I took the approach of placing each type in a separate file , pretty much like in C# , and creating a simple file that always is last in the file list called project_name.fs , where project_name is replaced by the actual name of my project .
This file is very simple , containing only the following lines , where MyNamespace and MyMainForm ( ) are the namespace and main form names used in a particular application .
Note that if you need to do additional things before actually displaying the main form , the code for those can also be inserted before the do Application .
Run statement , and might require additional open statements to reference any needed namespaces or modules .
# light open System open System .
Windows .
Forms open MyNamespace [ < STAThread > ] do Application .
Run ( new MyMainForm ( ) )
Note that the [ < STAThread > ] line is a .NET attribute that defines the application to run in a Single Thread Apartment .
This is required when some of the .NET dialogs are used , such as FileOpenDialog and FileSaveDialog , because they apparently use COM Interop behind the scenes .
If you do n't use any of those , that attribute wo n't be needed .
Building a Windows Forms Application
In working with F# , I truly began to appreciate the designers that are available for C# , VB , and other languages supported by VS 2008 and other IDEs .
Since form designers are not available for F# , I had to code all windows by hand .
To keep things simple ( for me ) , I adopted a coding style illustrated below for part of the MainForm that represents the application .
# light namespace MyNamespace open System open System .
Windows .
Forms open System .
Drawing type MainForm ( ) as form = inherit Form ( ) let mutable fuzzySets = [ ] let mutable fuzzyRules = [ ] let mutable fuzzy Variables = [ ] let mutable fileName = " " let mainMenu = new MainMenu ( ) let mnuFile = new MenuItem ( ) let mnuFileOpen = new MenuItem ( ) let mnuFileSave = new MenuItem ( ) let mnuFileSaveAs = new MenuItem ( ) let mnuFileExit = new MenuItem ( ) let mnuHelp = new MenuItem ( ) let mnuHelpAbout = new MenuItem ( ) let label1 = new Label ( ) let label2 = new Label ( ) let label3 = new Label ( ) let lstFuzzySets = new ListBox ( ) let lstVariables = new ListBox ( ) let txtInput = new RichTextBox ( ) let btnCalculate = new Button ( ) let dlgFileOpen = new OpenFileDialog ( ) let dlgFileSave = new SaveFileDialog ( ) let HomeDir = Application .
ExecutablePath let rec getVariable ( ( lst : ( Variable list ) ) , vName : string , vContext : string ) = match lst with | [ ] -> failwith ( sprintf " Variable %s.%s not found " vName vContext ) | x::_ when ( x. Name = vName ) && ( x.Context = vContext ) -> x | _::t -> get Variable(t , vName , vContext ) let rec getFuzzySet ( ( lst : ( FuzzySet list ) ) , vName : string , vContext : string ) = match lst with | [ ] -> failwith ( sprintf " FuzzySet %s.%s not found " vName vContext ) | x::_ when ( x.

Note that the form is defined by inheriting a standard .
NET Form .
I then defined any private " variables " that will be needed , then all of the controls that are placed on the form .
After the controls , I placed the constructor code that is to be executed ; in this case , it simply calls the form .
InitializeForm function to initialize the form .
Finally come all of the member functions that are needed , including all of the event handlers .
Inside the InitializeForm member , each control is set up as needed , and finally all of the controls are added to the form .
In addition , all events are defined as members so that they may be organized , coded separately , and called from outside the form .
This is similar to how things are automatically organized by the C# and VB designers .
Presumably , when designers for F# become available , they would take care of organizing things in a similar way .
I have to admit that after doing the controls layout manually , I certainly appreciate the ability to use the designers available for other languages !
There are a couple of things to note in the above code .
First , the event handlers are added to the form and each control using the standard .
NET AddHandler , and are defined using anonymous functions in F# .
Most of the event handlers take two parameters corresponding to the sender and the EventArgs , denoted by s and e in the anonymous functions .
Second , all of the event handlers expect a unit ( void in C# ) to be returned .
In cases where the result of an F # function is a value other than unit , it 's necessary to either explicitly return a unit value using the null keyword or throw away a value using |> ignore .
As you can see , there is really no true functional programming contained in the above code ; it 's all pretty much straight imperative code , similar to what would be used in C# , with a different syntax .
That is mainly because of the dependence on the .NET framework that is inherently imperative .
Of course , the ability of F# to handle both imperative and declarative code is one of its strengths , and the ability to program Windows forms shows the imperative side of F# .
For anyone interested , the actual parser and fuzzy set code is contained in the sample project , but wo n't be discussed here , since it is beyond the scope of this article .
Perhaps , in a future article , I 'll describe those parts of the system .
Conclusions
After experimenting with F# for awhile and getting somewhat up - to - speed , I have definitely formed some opinions .
First , I have to say that F# appears to be a very nice , declarative , functional language , and should find wide application in many areas of scientific and mathematical computing .
Since it also allows imperative programming , it is fairly easy to access the objects and features in the underlying .
NET Framework , which is a big plus .
Unfortunately , F# in its current implementation is substantially lacking in what I would call " developer tools " .
Specifically , the lack of form designers and complete Intellisense support in Visual Studio makes it somewhat tedious to use .
In addition , some of the default project settings are not very intuitive , and not extremely well documented .
Hopefully , both of those problems will be addressed in the near future and F# will be able to take its place along with the other .NET languages as a serious development language .
Aside from the lack of developer tools , programming in F# takes some getting used to , especially if you are used to using imperative languages , as I am .
The shift in paradigm from imperative to declarative can be difficult , and F# seems to have so many detailed oddities , that it indeed takes some concerted effort to master .
I certainly have not yet mastered it , but I hope to get a book or two on the language on my next trip home and pursue F# much more in the future , because I do definitely see where it will be a handy tool to have in my programming toolbox .
I would recommend that anyone with even the slightest interest learn about F# .
It never hurts to expand one 's resume , or to stretch the brain into thinking about things from a different perspective .
In addition , I sincerely hope that Microsoft will continue to improve F# , and that additional project templates , form designers , and complete Intellisense support will be provided in the near future .
And for my wish list , I 'd have to add that being able to design and implement forms in C# ( or even VB ? ) , yet call functions written in F# would be wonderful .
So far , the only way I 've been able to do that has been to compile F# code to a library ( *.dll ) and then call it from C#. Being able to easily include both C# and F# files in a project , each compiled with the respective compiler and then linked into one application , would allow one to enjoy the best of both worlds .
History
The Dictator announced his relief - package for the Big Three yesterday :
The media is calling it " a Christmas - gift . "
This is a LOAN - agreement : Gift 's do not come wrapped in razor wire .
This too - little - too - late proposal is meant to bring an end to the problem of having to pay anyone , for whatever they do on - the - job in the United States .
This is the last link in the chain that will complete the Total Redistribution of Wealth in American society .
And too many still , will not connect the dots .
The problem that organized labor created for the corporatocracy has been a thorn in the side of ' business , ' since the days of the New Deal .
Now its payback time and anyone that looks can almost see the saliva dripping from this ' proposal ' that is in reality , an ultimatum .
Some of the details behind the headlines surfaced yesterday in a report from Greg Shotwell , a union activist that spent thirty - years working for GM .
" The danger of this that I see is that , you know , in the '90s , when the auto companies were making billions of dollars , they were taking profits out of North America and investing them overseas in Europe , South America and Asia .
So there 's been a huge transfer of assets overseas .
Now , those assets would remain protected in bankruptcy .
So what , in effect , they 've done is undermined the manufacturing base in the United States so that they could become a major importer to the United States .
You see , they already have fuel - efficient - small fuel - efficient cars that they 're making in Europe and in Asia and in South America .
They 're ready for import .
And they would like to be like Toyota .
Yes , Toyota has plants in the United States , but Toyota imports about 46 percent of all the cars it sells in the United States .
That 's what General Motors is setting itself up to do , and they 're going to use this capitalist disaster to help them wipe out the dealerships and close the plants .
And Congress is just going to help them strong - arm the unions into giving up any job security or gains .
Also , you 're right about the bankruptcy .
And this is one of their goals , is to wipe out the legacy costs .
You know , the people who earned a pension and earned healthcare and retirement in the past , they would take that away .
To me , it 's like a thirty - year mortgage .
I paid my mortgage every week , and I paid it off .
Now that house is mine .
Now they want to say , well , we 're going to take it back .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Now , obviously , there are those who continue to say that the labor costs in the auto industry , especially in the Big Three , are way out of whack .
And could you talk , for those who are not familiar with , how this misrepresentation of what the labor costs really are of today 's workforce among the Big Three has been created ?
GREGG SHOTWELL : Well , there 's a good reason that the plants , the transplants in the South , have not been organized , and that 's mainly because they make as much or more money as organized workers .
And that was a strategy that the Japanese plants did on purpose , because they did n't want the plants organized .
So they pay as much .
The real difference is in what they owe the retirees , what they call the legacy costs .
Now , you 'll hear in the media , they 'll say GM workers get $ 73 an hour , and Toyota workers only get $ 45 an hour .
They arrive at that $ 73 an hour by tacking on the cost of all the retirees onto the active worker .
This is fraudulent bookkeeping .
This is essentially a Ponzi scheme , wherein the old investors are paid off by the new investors .
In other words , the older investors , the retirees , their pay - their pension and healthcare - comes from the new investors , the workers .
I heard Keith Olbermann compare it to saying the average wage in America , and then you would add on everybody who 's collecting Social Security or pensions .
It 's really preposterous .
On top of that , I want to emphasize this .
I earned my pension while I was working , not [ inaudible ] somebody else .
The guy working today is n't earning my pension .
I already earned that .
General Motors should have taken that money , set it aside , put it in a trust .
If they did n't do that , then they 've committed a malfeasance .
That 's their responsibility .
Also , when I was working , they charged the customer more money based on the fact , based on their excuse that " we have to pay more for this worker because of healthcare and pension and his retirement , so we have to charge the customer more . "
Whether that was 1980 or 1990 , they raised those prices .
What did they do with that money ?
They apparently did n't put it in a trust .
But they did - and this is a fact - they 've invested largely overseas .
General Motors and Ford , they have more plants overseas than they have in the United States .
They 're ready to become major importers to the United States and dump all their responsibilities to the people who made those profits . "
( 1 ) In many ways this mirrors what was done by government with Social Security .
The money paid in by the employees was not put into interest bearing trust accounts ­ where it could have grown over time ­ instead it was spent as fast as it came in and the public received only federal drawers filled with IOU 's instead of the money that was supposedly being held in Trust for retiree's .
In the case of the Big Three , they used the money paid ( by their employees ) into their employee - retirement - accounts to open up all those other plants overseas - that are now about to make possible the elimination of the work force whose money actually made this takedown possible .
That is what this takedown is all about ; to open the US market to imported GM , Chrysler and Ford products , and rid themselves of their obligations to deliver on the commitments they made to their employees over many decades .
Their workers played the game by one set of rules , and now after the game has been completed the rules are being changed ( again ) so that those that sacrificed will be left with nothing .
But there 's Congress and there 's much more : " Congress acts like they had no responsibility .
If Congress - you see , we 're the only country in the world that subsidizes outsourcing of our jobs .
Other countries subsidize research and development , and they erect trade barriers to protect their basic industries .
What we did was - we do not subsidize research and development , and we subsidize outsourcing .
Those are other things that need to be changed .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Gregg Shotwell , one of the things that you raise in some of the articles you 've written is that there 's a lot of attention placed on , again , labor costs , but that the actual production workers for the Big Three , their salaries represent about ten percent of the cost of a car , while the money spent for supervisors and management represents 20 percent of the cost of a car .
But we rarely get any attention on that aspect of the compensation .
GREGG SHOTWELL : No .
You know , the media and Congress really look at UAW wages , and this just shows their bias .
But , you know , these facts I got from the book Fat and Mean by [ David ] Gordon .
And he points out that the United States actually has , you know , like three or four times as many supervisors and monitors as Germany or Japan , that we waste a lot more money on management .
But , you know , the actual labor costs - you know , this is another aspect , I think , that people do n't understand .
I understand why , but - our productivity really should justify a raise .
And when I say that , in 1992 - you know , they say that - they justify all this , because we 're losing market share .
Well , the market has gotten bigger .
The pie is bigger .
But General Motors is selling as many cars .
And the notion that they do n't like - people do n't like GM cars belies the fact that they 've sold more cars than Toyota .
In 1992 , GM had 34 percent of the US market .
This is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
And they produced 4.4 million cars .
Now , at that time , GM 's hourly employment was 265,000 .
In 2005 , the market share had fallen about eight percent , but they had produced the same level of cars , 4.5 million , with 111,000 workers .
With 154,000 workers less , they produced the same amount of cars .
They lost market share , but they still produced the same number of cars .
Their productivity has doubled .
So this would - in normal times , when your productivity goes up , that means you deserve an annual improvement factor , a raise .
We 've experienced just the opposite .
The only reason that autoworkers make what seems to be a higher wage than non-union workers is that we have a cost - of - living adjustment .
We won that back in 1970 .
But we often do not get any raise at all .
And in the best years , we only get a three percent raise .
But it 's the cost of living that we have that is the difference between union and non-union . "
( 1 ) In a nutshell : Business and the Big Three seized this opportunity to finally put an end to their " labor - problems " by dissolving their plants in the US , so that they could shirk their legal - obligations to the unions , to their dealerships , and to the communities that depend upon what their employees and their suppliers provided toward the health and welfare of millions of people in the US .
At the same time the Big Three will finally be able to freely use the import markets without having the labor costs to slow them down ~ because to the Corporatopcry nothing else matters !
Had the congress and the government not chosen to go along with this idea , none of this could be happening now .
Just look at the official spin being put on everything from calling this a Christmas Gift , to blaming the workers for the problem , while omitting the real costs of manufacturing that are inflated by the fact that American workers do not have the same health protections that many of our foreign competitors provide for their workers .
The real point at issue here is the continued existence of the entire American manufacturing base , all the way down to light industry - all of which will be directly impacted by the decisions reached over the outcome of the Big Three negotiations .
In reality , this shakedown is little more than a total surrender of the working people to the ownership class in this society .
This " deal " will complete the Redistribution of Wealth in the United States , and the number of people that will suffer from this contrived surrender ­ is almost incalculable .
One more small point to watch for is that forty - three of the fifty States in the US are now in need of some kind of BAILOUT .
The current dollar amount for that is about $ 100 billion , and growing every day .
Please remember that part of every bailout is a " federal - ownership - stake " in whatever is supposedly receiving these monetary " gifts . "
If government continues to wait the amount needed by the States will soon reach unmanageable proportions - but more important if the individual States take this money - they stand to lose their state sovereignty ( their official independence from the federal government ) .
This would mark the end of the United States , because the States themselves would no longer be voluntary members of the so - called Union .
Instead ( in a worst case scenario ) they would become simple serfdoms within a federally - fascist bureaucracy with no rights and no actual part to play in the governance of this nation .
But since the Congress has already given up its duties regarding checks & balances , not - to - mention oversight ­ how much difference could it make that there will be just one - less place to demand answers from ?
Now we 're just an Outlaw - stronghold among the community of nations in the world , because we do not care .

Organising an examination for Britain 's teenagers should not be too tough a job .
For half a century , local government managed it .
Yet from the moment testing was nationalised under the Tories it went berserk .
Ministers floundered , claiming to " need to know " everything about the nation 's young .
In the decade from its introduction by John Patten in 1993 , the cost of testing and league tables rose from £ 10 m to £ 610 m .
Each July saw a flood of " exam fiasco " stories .
Nobody could agree over standards .
A secretary of state - Estelle Morris - resigned , and officials and private companies came , went , resigned or were sacked .
Last summer the testing regime reached its nadir .
Nobody had been found in all Britain up to the task of running an attainment test for 14 - year - olds .
The " market price " for such a paragon was eventually fixed at a salary of £ 328,000 , a flat in west London , membership of a yacht club in Sydney harbour and six club - class tickets round the world .
This obscene reward went to an Australian , Ken Boston , who proved unable to do the job without spending a further £ 156 m on an American company , ETS ( Educational Testing Services ) .
In July hundreds of thousands of exam papers were delayed or improperly marked , and another fiasco was declared as such by Lord Sutherland in his Sats inquiry report last night .
Exams are not alone .
Yesterday 's newspapers contained tales of woe from the following corners of the public sector : a pensions overpayment , a BBC audience voting farce , a transport department efficiency scam and a knife - crime statistics shocker .
Only the ID card and NHS computer shambles disappeared briefly from the spotlight .
Each of these stories demonstrated the inability of large organisations to handle simple bureaucratic tasks .
Yesterday there was no suggestion that blame for the Sats racket should attach to any minister , let alone the schools one , Ed Balls .
The reason why public - service privatisation , once excoriated by Labour , is now so popular is that it privatises blame , in this case to Australia .
In all these cases the one thing never contemplated by politicians or commentators is that the fault might lie in bigness .
The axiom of government by London , from London and for the benefit of London , is that any service must be better if it gets bigger , more centralised , more costly , more computerised and preferably run by our friends in the City .
Schumacher 's small - is - beautiful is for hippies , hobbits and yesterday .
Every survey of social contentment or satisfaction with public services has the same message .
Small states perform better than big ones .
The superiority of New Zealand , Singapore , Norway , Switzerland or the Netherlands might cause some to ask whether Britain 's poor record might be due to diseconomies of scale , but no .
I once asked an NHS manager why the Danish health service scored so much higher on every count than Britain's .
He called the question ridiculous , " because Denmark is a small country " .
To him , big means worse , but nothing can be done about it .
Anyone inquiring after the £ 12bn NHS computer will know that this useless piece of equipment has nothing to do with efficiency or public benefit .
It is merely the ultimate macho investment , a vast contract suitable for real men to play with , bespeaking big jobs for ex-officials and big freebies for ministers .
The computer is to NHS bosses what ID cards are to the Home Office and aircraft carriers are to the MoD .
They confer virility on ministers and managers alike , more so than equipping the poor bloody infantry on their respective frontlines .
Gordon Brown at the weekend lauded the " bravery " of dead marines in Afghanistan , ignoring the added bravery required because he 's blown billions on jets , submarines and aircraft carriers rather than boring field armour .
Yesterday 's revelation of 30 years of overpaid public service pensions arose from the familiar mix of computers , privatisation ( to a firm called Xafinity Paymaster ) and plain carelessness with public money .
When the tax credit fiasco broke three years ago , the fault lay in Brown 's refusal to listen to the warnings of his officials .
To him the risk of disaster was outweighed by the short - term glory of the initiative and , anyway , someone else was paying .
The same hubris caused last week 's fiddling of knife - crime statistics .
There is no way of sensibly collating every " knife - carrying incident " in Britain but who cares , as long as it can be spun into a story ?
The transport department fiasco was occasioned by someone being sold a computer that promised to " save £ 57 m on shared corporate services " .
Who could have believed such snake - oil salesmanship ?
The computer cost £ 121 m and might just save £ 40 m , a loss of £ 81 m .
According to a Commons report , this " stupendous incompetence " has led to not a single official being " dismissed or properly held accountable " .
This casual approach to taxpayers ' money has blossomed since the fad for privatising public administration began in the early 90s .
It is now embedded in Whitehall 's DNA .
Like the salaries paid to " public servants " such as Boston or the heads of the BBC , such expenditure defies reason .
It reflects the transfer of William Whyte 's " organisation man " from private corporate to public sectors , except that the associated perks are underwritten by the taxpayer .
Britain 's audit and regulatory regime , feeble enough in the City , is near non-existent in the public sector , because the National Audit Office and the Commons Public Accounts Committee are overborne by executive arrogance by the fact that ministers are never about long enough to carry the can .
Having interviewed people in power over the years , I am intrigued that those who accept the failings of over - centralisation declare themselves rigid with fear at the prospect of taking corrective action .
David Miliband , when schools minister , issued 3,840 pages of control - freak instructions to head - teachers in a single year .
When chided for this he added another one headed " bureaucracy - cutting tool - kit " .
Those with power never surrender it .
No matter how many Whitehall fiascos hit the headlines , the prime minister and the civil service chief , Sir Gus O'Donnell , will do nothing .
They can not do small .
The challenge is not intellectual , but one of professional aggrandisement .
As they slide into this slime of public waste , the irony of democracy is that the only remedy appears to lie in its antithesis , revolution .

Indiana Town Could Get Plant that Makes Ethanol Out of Garbage
January 26th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
The town of Lowell , Ind. , is examining whether or not to build a $ 200 million plant that would convert garbage into ethanol .
Though such a plant might conjure up visions of the “ Mr. Fusion ” unit in Doc Brown ’s DeLorean , the plants could create 165 permanent jobs and 400 construction jobs in the small town southwest of Gary .
Powers Energy
One , which last fall won a 20 - year garbage disposal contract from Lake County ’s waste management authority , is looking at a variety of sites in the town that have the rail and highway access to bring the waste to a plant .
Garbage - to - gas plants are drawing a lot of interest , including from big names like GM , for gas to power homes or fuel for cars and trucks .
That ’s because such plants may be more efficient at creating fuel than corn- based ethanol production and because they reduce the need for landfill space .
The Lowell plant idea is drawing fire from some local groups because of concerns about pollution from the plants .
There ’s a public hearing on the idea this week , and no certain timetable for any construction .

Cos’è e come si crea una Sitemap in XML
Un semplice tutorial che può sempre servire ai SEO ( Search Engine Optimizer ) che hanno iniziato da poco o a coloro che vogliono capire cos'è e come si crea una sitemap in formato xml necessaria per i motori di ricerca .
Una sitemap è un documento creato in XML e contiene tutti gli url delle pagine del nostro sito .
Possiamo decidere di ometterne alcuni , per esempio gli url delle aree riservate che ci consentono di amministrare il nostro sito .
Possiamo vedere la sitemap XML come un 'altra versione della sitemap che normalmente includiamo tra le pagine del nostro sito che serve per orientare gli utenti all ' interno del sito ; questa versione ( XML ) però non è per gli utenti , ma per i motori di ricerca e pià precisamente per i bot che fanno visita al nostro sito .
Sono bot , non possiamo parlare con parole e foto sottoforma di HTML o PHP ... loro vogliono l'XML .
E allora passiamo alla creazione vera e propria della sitemap , non dimentichiamo però la logica che sta in ogni documento XML , bisogna infatti pensare alle matrioske , ogni elemento sarà contenuto dentro un altro fino ad arrivare al genitore , non dimenticatelo durante l'implementazione della vostra sitemap .
Iniziamo con quello che nelle normali pagine HTML sarebbe l'header , infatti troviamo alcuni dati relativi al formato della sitemap come formato e codifica
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
< urlset
xmlns= " http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9 "
xmlns:xsi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance "
xsi:schemaLocation= " http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9
http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd " >
<url >
in questa prima parte del codice dichiariamo anche a quali standard fa riferimento la sitemap
passiamo alla parte centrale della sitemap :
si comincia sempre con lo specificare l'indirizzo del nostro sito , dopo passeremo alle singole pagine ( index , ecc . .. )
<url >
< loc>http://www.vostrosito.it/</loc>
< priority > 1.00 </ priority >
< lastmod >2008-12-08T03:00:00+00:00</lastmod >
< changefreq > daily </ changefreq >
</url >
spieghiamo quanto appena scritto :
abbiamo racchiuso tutto nell ' elemto URL , aperto all ' inizio del blocco e chiuso alla fine
con l'elemento LOC definiamo l'indirizzo della pagina ( come già detto , inizalmente inseriamo l'indirizzo del nostro sito )
l'elemento LASTMOD contiene la data dell ' ultima modifica dell 'url che abbiamo inserito nella riga precedente
con l'elemento CHANGEFREQ specifichiamo con che frequenza viene modificata ( aggiornata ) la pagina dell 'url dichiarato poco prima .
i valori possibili per questo elemento sono always ( conetnuto diverso ogni volta che vi si accede ) , hourly ( contenuto aggiornato ogni ora ) , daily ( contenuto aggiornato ogni giorno ) , weekly ( contenuto aggiornato ogni settimana ) , monthly ( contenuto aggiornato ogni mese ) , yearly ( contenuto aggiornato ogni anno ) , never ( contenuto mai aggiornato )
ripetete l'ultimo blocco del codice per ogni pagina che desiderate sia indicizzata dal motore di ricerca e alla fine chiudete con
</urlset >
il quale chiude quanto aperto inizialmente nel nostro documento XML .
URLSET rappresenta l'elemento contenitore di tutto , il più esterno , all ' interno del quale troviamo i singoli URL che vogliamo far indicizzare dai motori di ricerca .
Salvate il documento nel formato XML assegnando il nome che preferite ed avrete la vostra sitemap .
Vi ricordo che per uno stesso sito potete avere più sitemap , fate attenzione a non assegnare lo stesso nome altrimenti sul server ne troverete solo una ; ciò accade se si è in più di una persona a gestire il sito e magari involontariamente i colleghi possono inserire sitemap con nomi già esistenti ( ricordate che esiste sempre l'errore umano ! ) .
Per approfondimenti : sitemaps.org
Obama and Bush to meet next week
The president said he wanted Mr Obama to " hit the ground running " US President George W Bush has said he and Barack Obama will discuss issues such as the global financial crisis and the war in Iraq " early next week " .
In a speech at the White House , Mr Bush congratulated the president - elect and said he would make every effort to ensure a smooth handover on 20 January .
The president - elect is due to hold his first news conference on Friday , after a meeting with his economic advisers .
Meanwhile , Rahm Emanuel has accepted the post of Mr Obama 's chief - of - staff .
The Illinois congressman , who was once an adviser to President Bill Clinton , will be responsible for much of the internal management of the new administration .
Mr Emanuel is a tough Washington insider who has been strongly criticised by some Republicans for being too partisan , says the BBC's Jane O'Brien in Washington .
According to ABC
News network , Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod has also accepted the job of senior White House adviser - a post previously held by Karl Rove and Dan Bartlett under Mr Bush .
Mr Obama is next expected to appoint a treasury secretary to tackle the country 's economic crisis .
Illinois Congressman Rahm Emanuel ( L ) was an adviser to President Clinton Likely contenders reportedly include former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Paul Volcker , the former head of the Federal Reserve .
There is also speculation as to whether Mr Obama will reach out beyond the Democratic Party and include Republicans in his administration , such as current Defence Secretary Robert Gates .
The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Chicago says the job of White House spokesman may be reserved for Robert Gibbs , a campaign aide whose combination of a jolly personal style and steely on - message discipline captures something of Mr Obama 's own persona .
' Peaceful transfer ' Earlier , Mr Obama was reported to have won North Carolina - which had not voted for a Democrat in more than a generation .
The state 's 15 electoral votes increase his total to 364 .
Mr McCain has 162 .
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT 9 Dec : Deadline for states to resolve issues such as recounts or challenges 15 Dec : Electoral college electors meet in each state to formally cast their votes 6 Jan : Joint session of Congress to count electoral college votes Before 20 Jan : Barack Obama and Joe Biden must resign from the Senate 20 Jan : Inauguration day
Transition timetable Obama 's top economic contenders Profile : Rahm Emanuel Obama shapes team Missouri is now the only state that remains too close to call .
In a televised address to aides on Thursday , President Bush said he would ask government officials " to brief the Obama team on ongoing policy issues , ranging from the financial markets to the war in Iraq " .
" I look forward to discussing those issues with the president - elect early next week , " he added .
Mr Bush said his administration would do everything it could to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition in advance of Mr Obama 's inauguration in 75 days ' time , so that he and his team " can hit the ground running " .
Mr Bush said the Department of Justice had already arranged security clearance for key members of Mr Obama 's transition team , and that the Illinois senator had begun to be given classified intelligence and security briefings .
The president said the transfer came at a challenging time .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" We 're in a struggle against violent extremists determined to attack us and they would like nothing more than to exploit this period of change to harm the American people , " he said .
Because the US does not have the same culture of a neutral civil service as most democracies , many officials at most levels of government are political appointments , so thousands will leave with the old president and thousands more will arrive with the new one , our correspondent says .
Transition team Mr Obama has begun talks about forming his new administration .
He has until inauguration to select senior officials .
HAVE YOUR SAY Obama 's greatest challenge is to clean the rot created by Bush and Cheney Adeel Agha , Tampa , Florida
The transition team is to be run by John Podesta , a former chief - of - staff to President Bill Clinton , Pete Rouse , who was Mr Obama 's Senate chief - of - staff , and his close friend , Valerie Jarrett .
The entire US House of Representatives and a third of US Senate seats were also contested in Tuesday 's elections .
The Democrats increased their Senate majority by five seats to 56 , including two independents , but fell short of the 60 needed to stop blocking tactics by Republicans .
Four seats are too close to call .
The Democrats also increased their majority in the House of Representatives , gaining 19 seats to give a total of 254 , leaving the Republicans with 173 .

Over here , Adolfo commented :
“ Hi , I tried to do follow the example , but I could n’t even install the packages , hsx and hs - plugins were impossible .
I tried with cabal and manually , and neither of those worked .
any suggestion , known issue with this packages ? ”
I ’ve been busy adding features to Turbinado and have n’t circled back around to making sure that it ’s easy to build , so I can claim a lot of the blame for the build problems .
Turns out to be really important that publicly released packages are easily buildable …
Thinking back , I have really struggled to build Turbinado … and I wrote Turbinado !
Turbinado depends on some particular bugfix - ish library releases ( e.g. GSomething 0.6.1 ) .
With GHC 6.10 , a bunch of libraries have broken or have changed so much that they badly break Turbinado .
( I need to specify better the versions in turbinado. cabal . )
At times , I ’ve considered bundling the dependencies into Turbinado so that building Turbinado would be easy , but that ’s always felt like a cop-out .
So I ’m pleading for “ cabal install ” .
Given Turbinado ’s dependence on particular versions of libraries , I would love to able to do :
cabal install turbinado OR ( from / home / alson / turbinado ) cabal build
Most casual users of Ruby , Python , Perl , Java , etc , know that those languages have automagic build / dependencies system ( respectively , gem , eggs , CPAN , maven ) .
The tools may be of varying quality , but many tutorials include something like “ First , use GEM to install the package : gem install rails ” and demonstrate just how simple it is to get a useful piece of software installed .
This is not the case in Haskell .
I ’d guess that no more than 5 % of Haskellers know about the cabal command line tool and “ cabal install ” .
On the other hand , I ’d guess that 95 % of novice Rubyers know about “ gem install ” .
These automated build / dependency system are now critical to the success of languages .
As a beginner in Ruby , I always knew that I could easily try out various libraries by using GEM to install bits of software .
I ’m now fairly experienced with Haskell and , partly because of that experience , I do n’t believe that I can easily try out various Haskell libraries .
Niklas Broberg ’s HSP is a great example of the challenge of building Haskell programs .
HSP is very nicely separated into modular libraries which : makes it easy to apply pieces of HSP ’s functionality to a program ; makes it hard for a human ( at least for me ) to build any one part of HSP because each part depends on so many other parts .
A build / dependency tool would make HSP much easier to build into existing programs .
The Plea
I love using Haskell and Haskell will only get better if more people are able to use it .
IMO , a pre-condition to the growth of the language is a solid , easy to use build / dependency system .
Cabal is that system for GHC and the cabal command line tool is a key part of that system .
Unfortunately , the cabal command line tool is n’t bundled with GHC , but … Please get it , build it , use it , report any bugs , compliment the Cabal team , etc .
It ’ll be a great help to the Haskell community .
darcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/cabal-install cd cabal - install sh bootstrap.sh
Update : Haskell Platform
Ganesh points out the Haskell Platform Proposal , so it looks as though there is a plan to incorporate the cabal command line tool .
See the following :
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_Platform
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_Platform/FAQ

P.S. Anyone know if the cabal command line tool is going to make it into GHC ?

Plugs are definitely vogue at this week ’s Mondial de l’Automobile in Paris .
So where does the hybrid vehicle fit into the picture ?
It may not , according to Renault .
The French carmaker says that electric vehicles , not hybrids , are needed to deliver the emissions reductions that governments and customers demand .
Renault says that it is engineering a pair of battery - powered electric vehicles ( EVs ) , to be produced starting in 2011 .
As I report for MIT Technology Review today , Renault claims these EVs will be cheaper to build , cost markedly less to power , and produce far less carbon dioxide .
Today they unveiled a partnership with utility géant Electricité de France to “ establish electric cars as a viable and
attractive transport solution for consumers . ”
And Renault is not the only major automaker planning to produce commuter - oriented EVs .
Mitsubishi Motors and Daimler both announced plans in Paris last week to accelerate commercialization of small EVs — Mitsubishi with its i-MiEV minicar and Daimler with a battery version of its popular Smart Fortwo .
Volkswagen ’s promo materials in Paris confirmed it would join the EV club , producing a tiny commuter EV called the Up ! in 2010 with a top speed of 130 kilometers / hour and roughly 100 kms of range .
Ok you say .
EV ’s are à la mode .
But what of the hybrid option ?
The question is partly semantic .
Hybrid technology is everywhere if you count the mild hybrids , which employ a small but potent electric battery to save gas by rebooting the combustion engine on a green light instead of idling through the red ; some can also recuperate energy during breaking by recharging their battery .
This technology is going mainstream : Renault competitor PSA Peugeot Citroën said it alone will install 1 million stop - start systems by 2011 .
VW spokesperson Martin Hube said his company viewed stop - start as just an evolution of internal combustion drive .
“ You can call it a mild hybrid but it ’s just a smart technique , ” says Hube .
“ That ’s nothing new . ”
No automaker questions whether full hybrids like the Prius or GM ’s plug - in Chevy Volt that can drive on either electricity or gasoline are something new .
But while several showed full hybrid concept cars in Paris , fewer talked up plans to build one .
Perhaps they ’ve made the same calculation as Renault : it ’s not worth the trouble to cram high - energy motors , batteries and an engine into a vehicle when one can go straight to the full EV instead .

Hey , I have this hilarious video of you dancing .
Your face is so red .
You should check it out .
If you 've received a message like that through Facebook or MySpace , you may have been exposed to the " Koobface " virus .
" Koobface " comes through an e-mail sent by one of your social networking site friends inviting you to scope out a video .
Once the URL is clicked , " Koobface " prompts you to update your Flash player before the video can be displayed .
Therein lies the virus , cloaked in a " flash_player.exe " file .
According to the Kaspersky Lab , an antivirus organization working closely with Facebook , " the worms transform victim machines into zombie computers to form botnets . "
The McAfee Security Blog explains that when " Koobface " infects your computer , it prompts a downloaded service named Security Accounts Manager ( SamSs ) to load on start - up .
SamSs then proxies all HTTP traffic , stealing results from popular search engines and hijacking them to lesser - known search sites .
A clear eye for fraud will help you avoid this mess .
You can usually spot phony e-mails by their titles .
Kaspersky found the following : Paris Hilton Tosses Dwarf On The Street ; Examiners Caught Downloading Grades From The Internet ;
You must see it !!!
LOL .
My friend catched you on hidden cam ;
Is it really celebrity ?
Funny Moments .
My own " Koobface " attack came in an e-mail entitled , lool , yoour blushingg afce is so funny !
Checkk out .
Obviously , Paris Hilton never threw dwarves , and in all likelihood , my 26 - year - old friend knows how to spell more than two words .
These are clear indicators you 're being attacked .
Facebook has posted instructions about how to remove the " Koobface " virus : give your computer an antivirus scrub - down and change your Facebook password .
This attack on the world 's most popular social networking site and its 120 million users comes just weeks after Facebook won an $ 873 million lawsuit against several people accused of hacking user accounts and spreading spam .
Faith is a very big part of my life .
And putting my life in my creator ’s hands — this is what I always do .
I ’m like , O.K. , God , if there is an open door for me somewhere , this is what I always pray , I ’m like , do n’t let me miss the open door .
Show me where the open door is .
Even if it ’s cracked up a little bit , maybe I ’ll plow right on through that and maybe prematurely plow through it , but do n’t let me miss an open door .
And if there is an open door in ’ 12 or four years later , and if it is something that is going to be good for my family , for my state , for my nation , an opportunity for me , then I ’ll plow through that door .
As I think about our bailing out Detroit , I ca n’t help but reflect on what , in my view , is the most important rule of business in today ’s integrated and digitized global market , where knowledge and innovation tools are so widely distributed .
It ’s this :
Whatever can be done , will be done .
The only question is will it be done by you or to you .
Just do n’t think it wo n’t be done .
If you have an idea in Detroit or Tennessee , promise me that you ’ll pursue it , because someone in Denmark or Tel Aviv will do so a second later .
Why do I bring this up ?
Because someone in the mobility business in Denmark and Tel Aviv is already developing a real - world alternative to Detroit ’s business model .
I do n’t know if this alternative to gasoline - powered cars will work , but I do know that it can be done — and Detroit is n’t doing it .
And therefore it will be done , and eventually , I bet , it will be done profitably .
And when it is , our bailout of Detroit will be remembered as the equivalent of pouring billions of dollars of taxpayer money into the mail - order - catalogue business on the eve of the birth of eBay .
It will be remembered as pouring billions of dollars into the CD music business on the eve of the birth of the iPod and iTunes .
It will be remembered as pouring billions of dollars into a book - store chain on the eve of the birth of Amazon.com and the Kindle .
It will be remembered as pouring billions of dollars into improving typewriters on the eve of the birth of the PC and the Internet .
Warning !
High Dimensions
Ahead
Machine learning is often framed as finding surfaces ( usually planes ) that separate or fit points in some high dimensional space .
Two and three dimensional diagrams are often used as an aid to intuition when thinking about these higher dimensional spaces .
The following result ( related to me by Marcus Hutter ) shows that our low dimensional intuition can easily lead us astray .
Consider the diagram in Figure 1 .
The larger grey spheres have radius 1 and are each touching exactly two other grey spheres .
The blue circle is then placed so that it touches all four grey circles .
Pythagoras tells us that \ ( 1^2 + 1^2 = ( 1+r ) ^2 \ ) and so \(r = \ sqrt {2} - 1 \approx 0.41 \ ) .
Clearly then , the blue circle lies entirely within the square of width 4 containing all the grey spheres .
Figure 1 : The blue circle in the middle touches each of the four identical grey circles .
We can move to three dimensions and set up an analogue of the two dimensional situation by arranging eight spheres of radius 1 so they are touching exactly three other grey spheres .
As in the case with circles , we can place a blue sphere inside the eight grey spheres so that it touches all of them .
In this case , the radius of the blue sphere can be found by solving \ ( 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = ( 1+r ) ^2 \ ) and so \(r = \ sqrt{3} - 1 \approx 0.73\ ) , thus it is still inside the cube of width 4 that holds all eight grey spheres .
Figure 2 : The blue sphere touches each of the eight identical grey spheres .
It ’s not too hard to convince yourself that we can carry on this construction through to higher dimensions .
In four dimensional space we would arrange 16 grey hyperspheres of radius 1 so that each is touching exactly four others .
In this case , \(r = \sqrt{4} - 1 = 1 \ ) and the blue hypersphere is the same size as the grey ones .
Going up again to five dimensional space , we would have 32 hyperspheres , each touching five others .
Following the pattern , in this case \(r = \ sqrt{5} - 1 \approx 1.23 \ ) .
and the blue sphere is larger than the grey spheres in this case but still within the hypercube of width 4 that contains all 32 grey hyperspheres .
The pattern should now be apparent .
In n-dimensional space there will be \ ( 2^n\ ) grey hyperspheres of radius 1 that touch \ ( n\ ) other hyperspheres and the radius of the blue sphere that touches all of them will be \ [ r = \sqrt{n} - 1 . \]
At this point Dorothy turns to her canine companion and says , “ We are not in three dimensional Kansas anymore , Toto . ”
The blue sphere that sits in the centre of all the grey ones will have a radius that increases without bound .
A particularly curious thing happens when we construct the 9 - dimensional case .
The radius of the blue hypersphere is \( \sqrt{9} - 1 = 2 \ ) and so touches the faces of the hypercube that contains all the grey hyperspheres .
Stranger still , once we are in 10 dimensional space or higher , parts of the blue hypersphere will hang outside the box holding all the grey ones .
Thinking about the relative volume of the containing box and the grey spheres gives us some insight into what is happening .
In \( n\ ) dimensions the volume of the containing box is \ ( 4^n\ ) while the volume of a \ ( n\ ) - ball with radius 1 is \ [ \ frac{\pi^{\frac{n} {2}}}{\Gamma( \frac{n} {2}+1 ) } = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \pi^k / k! ,& n=2 k \\ \displaystyle 2^{2k+1}k!\pi^k / ( 2k+1 ) ! ,& n=2k+1 \end {cases} \] where \( \Gamma\ ) is the generalised factorial function .
For simplicity let us only consider the even dimensional cases where \ ( n=2 k\ ) .
Here , the total volume of the \ ( 2^n\ ) grey hyperspheres is \ ( 2^ {2 k} \pi^k / k!\ ) and so the proportion of the box occupied by the grey hyperspheres is \[ \frac{2^ {2k} \pi^k} {4^k k!} = \ left ( \frac{\pi}{4}\right ) ^k / k! \]
Since factorials are faster growing than exponentials the total proportion of volume occupied by the grey sphere in the box goes to zero as the dimension increases .
In effect , the grey hyperspheres are “ disappearing ” relative to the containing box , leaving more room for the blue sphere to fill .
The moral of this story should be familiar to anyone in machine learning : generalising from a handful of examples is a bad idea .
What seems obvious in two and three dimensional space does not hold in 10 dimensions or higher .

DALLAS ( Reuters ) -
The number of executions in the United States fell to a 14 - year low of 37 in 2008 as social concerns about the death penalty and its financial costs rise , the Death Penalty Information Center said on Thursday .
It was the third straight year of declining executions and the trend looked set to continue as the number of death sentences handed down fall , the non-partisan group said .
“ Courts , legislatures and the public are increasingly skeptical about the death penalty , whether those concerns are based on innocence , inadequate legal representation , costs , or a general feeling that the system is n’t fair , ” said Richard Dieter , Executive Director of the Washington - based group .
No further executions are scheduled this year .
The declines in 2007 and 2008 had widely been attributed to a seven - month moratorium on executions imposed by the U.S. Supreme Court as it heard a challenge to the three - drug cocktail used in lethal injections , the most common method of execution .
That challenge was rejected in April .
But Dieter said , “ We were surprised that the surge in executions that we expected after ( the lifting of the moratorium ) did not happen . ”
High legal and security costs are a key factor behind a rethink of the death penalty in many of the 36 U.S. states that still sanction it -- especially with the United States gripped by a deepening recession .
The report said by one estimate each of the five executions in Maryland in the past three decades cost about $ 37 million .
“ Both New York and New Jersey recently abandoned the death penalty after weighing the merits of a system in which tens of millions of dollars were being spent with virtually nothing to show for it , ” the report said .

Condemned prisoners in America spend an average of over 12 years on death row between sentencing and execution , a lengthy period that drives up legal costs amid repeated appeals .
EXPENSIVE “ LUXURY ” IN TOUGH TIMES
The long drawn - out appeals process can also take a toll on the families of victims and there are growing concerns about fairness , the possibility of wrongful convictions , and racial bias in sentencing .
Many studies have shown that a black person convicted of murdering a white person is more likely to be condemned to death than a white person who killed someone who is black .
Four death row inmates were exonerated this year , bringing to 130 the number of people who have been sentenced to death and later cleared .
However , no court has found that an innocent person was wrongfully executed in the past three decades .
Two other trends were noted which are not simply explained by falling rates of violent crime : a sharp drop in the number of death sentences being handed down in favor of life jail terms and capital punishment ’s skewed regional distribution .
Ohio was the only state outside of the South this year to carry out an execution and almost half of all U.S. executions in 2008 were carried out in Texas .
Texas is in a death penalty league of its own with 423 executions since 1976 , when the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a temporary ban on the practice .
Virginia is second at 102 followed by Oklahoma at 88 .
But even in Texas Dieter said only 11 death sentences were handed down in 2008 compared to 37 in 2002 .
“ DPIC estimates that the number of people sentenced to death in 2008 will be 111 , the lowest number since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 , ” the report said .
Most polls consistently show a majority of Americans in favor of capital punishment though the numbers tend to be below the peaks of close to 80 percent reached in the mid-1990s .
The United States is one of only a handful of democracies which still carries out the death penalty .
Amnesty International in April ranked the United States fifth in the world in the number of executions in 2007 , behind China , Iran , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan .
This modded Bergen Gasser EB remote - controlled helicopter has a handgun on its nose .
Yes .
A handgun .
And as you can see in the video , it can also be fired remotely .
On its own , the Gasser EB is a mean , noisy machine .
At 54 inches long , it 's equipped with a 34.5 - inch ( 800 - millimeter ) blade , and a gasoline engine powerful enough to resist the drag of a hefty handgun .
Which is precisely what the owner of this beast , Jim Simmons , added to it : A Springfield 1911 - A .45 caliber weapon .

Simmons also added a remote - controlled firing system .
And if you think that 's pretty stupid because the pilot on the ground wo n't be able to aim , think again :
He also added a gun-sight digital camera .
In other words :
This is a fully - armed mini-UAV , which you can actually use to fly anywhere , aim , and fire at whatever target you want .
Yeah , this is exactly how documentaries about loads of dead people start .
Or maybe not people , but polar bears and elks .
Dear Santa , I did n't get the VP job , but can you please bring me this RC Helicopter with .45 caliber handgun ?
Thank you and merry Xmas , xxxooo

Families ' 9/11 liability suit could go to trial Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday December 15 , 2008
Print This Email
This A federal district court judge in Manhattan said Monday that he will decide whether or not a suit brought against US airlines by families of several victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , may proceed .
 I would like some truth and accountability , and I want the public to hear it ,  said Mike Low , whose daughter Sara was a flight attendant on American Airlines flight 11 .
Low spoke with the Boston Globe for a Monday report .
The families of Barbara Keating , 72 , Mark Bavis , 31 , and Sara Low , 28 , asked Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein to allow their full liability suit against airlines and security companies in Boston to progress to trial .
The suit alleges that security at Dulles International Airport , Newark International Airport and Logan International Airport was negligent in allowing the alleged terrorists to board the flights .
To date , no family members of Sept. 11 victims have had a day in court .
Over 3,000 families have instead accepted lucrative settlements from the federal victims compensation fund , with the average figure hovering in the range of $ 2 million .
For these families , it is n't just about seeing justice .
They seek to tell their fallen relatives ' stories , and establish a public archive to further explore the attacks of Sept. 11 .
In a related post , the Globe said that the families are unshaken by news that the men the Bush administration alleges to be the plotters of the attack plan to plead guilty .
" It s good for the country , " said the families ' attorney , Donald A. Migliori , of the guilty pleas .
" But its irrelevant to our claims . "
The prisoners ' pleas are reportedly a show of contempt for the military tribunal process at Guantanamo Bay , where detainees do not have access to American due process .
In at least one instance , a guilty plea by a Guantanamo detainee was directly influenced by Vice President Dick Cheney .
For the families and their demand for justice , their wait may soon be over .
 We owe them a debt of gratitude , especially for their efforts to create a public archive of information ,  retired FAA agent Brian F. Sullivan told the Globe .

The little scooter is based on an original Vespa which had fallen into complete disrepair , but using long - tested woodcraft techniques a flowing new body was constructed for the runabout .
The main spine of the bike is fashioned from steam bent and laminated veneers upon which very nicely carved body work hangs .
Even the package tray and seat are made from wood .
We would have probably gone with a traditional seat , but that 's just cause we 're a bunch of softies like that .
Realistically though , we 're betting this Vespa is now quite a few pounds heftier than when it started out , and the original was not known for its swiftness so despite it 's beauty it 's probably kind of a pig in the performance department .
Then again , if something looks that good , we 'll give the zero to sixty times a pass .

Summing up what many scientists , environmentalists and politicians now think about the threat of climate change is simple : the world is drinking in the last chance saloon .
Time is still available to tackle the warming of the atmosphere , which every government ( including that of George Bush ) today accepts is real , and being caused by human actions .
But the window of opportunity is rapidly closing , and the last chance for the world to act in concert to bring the process under control is clearly visible : it is the UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen scheduled for December 2009 .
The international community will meet to try to agree a new global deal to cut rising emissions of greenhouse gases – the waste gases from industry and transport , principally carbon dioxide , which are retaining the sun 's heat in the atmosphere and causing temperatures to rise .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But , if such a deal is not achieved in Denmark , many observers feel it will be too late subsequently to stop climate change causing devastating problems for the world in general and human society in particular , from the widespread failure of agriculture to the swamping of low - lying countries by sea - level rise .
This week , in the Polish industrial city of Poznan , a dress rehearsal for Copenhagen is taking place .
Diplomats and officials from every member state of the United Nations have come together to shape the outline of next December 's agreement – or at least , to try .
For it would be difficult enough to get 150 - plus delegations , each with its own domestic pressures and national interests , to agree on the colour of an orange , never mind what , if it is successfully negotiated , will probably be the most complex treaty the world has seen .
Who is to do what ?
That 's the simple , but fantastically difficult question at the heart of everything .
Most of the excess CO2 ( above normal historical levels ) currently in the atmosphere was put there by the rich developed countries such as the US , Britain , Germany and Japan , in the two centuries since industrialisation began , and particularly in the years since the end of the Second World War when economic growth shot forward so dramatically .
But developing countries such as China , India , Indonesia and Brazil are rapidly catching up , and it is probable that China , for example , with its exploding economy growing at 10 per cent a year , has overtaken the US to become the largest CO2 emitter in the world .
So who is more to blame ?
How are we to balance what is known in the jargon as the burden - sharing ?
How are we to divide up the pain ?
( For cutting carbon emissions out of your economy is costly and may restrict your economic growth . )
Can China cut less CO2 than the US , even if it is emitting more ?
Will the US even be willing to make cuts under those circumstances ?
The first world climate treaty , the Kyoto protocol , signed in 1997 , recognised that nations had " common but differentiated " responsibilities and so it committed the industrialised countries , including Britain and the rest of the European Union , the US and Japan , to making fairly modest reductions in their CO2 by 2010 , while the developing countries , led by China , began to monitor their emissions , but were not obliged to cut them .
But Kyoto ran aground .
Never mind that few nations ( Britain being a rare exception ) will meet their modest Kyoto targets .
George Bush withdrew the US in 2001 and robbed it of its significance ; without the world 's biggest polluter involved , Kyoto ceased to mean anything .
What is to be negotiated at Copenhagen is a successor treaty to Kyoto , and it is clear what that must involve , if it is to succeed .
Firstly , all the major industrialised countries , including America , must agree a programme of deep cuts in their emissions .
They have to lead the way .
Secondly , the developing countries , led by China , have to do something in terms of reducing their emissions ; they cannot simply continue with business as usual .
Thirdly , there will have to be new flows of funds from the rich nations to the developing countries , to help them take action , both to cut their emissions , and to protect themselves againstthe effects of climate change which will be unavoidable , such as sea - level rise .
And fourthly , there may have to be a special agreement to protect the world 's forests , which lock up a vast amount of the Earth 's carbon .
If such a deal is eventually done , it will be close to the wire ; it will be behind closed doors in Denmark , brokered at the last minute between pragmatic and powerful people .
The original Kyoto agreement was reached in this way , in the early hours of the morning .
An important player was Al Gore , who was then the US Vice - President ( and who has since gone on to become , with his film An Inconvenient Truth , the world 's single most influential voice on climate change ) .
Another was Britain 's John Prescott , who then combined the jobs of Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Secretary – Kyoto was probably his finest hour .
Perhaps the key player was the Argentine Raul Estrada , chairman of the central negotiating committee , who rescued the talks when they seemed on the brink of collapse .
Such figures will be necessary in Copenhagen .
One of them will almost certainly have to be Chinese .
But , towering above them all is one new figure : Barack Obama .
The President - elect has already made it clear he sees tackling global warming as a priority , and he will reverse George Bush 's obstructionism and fully re-engage with the talks .
The election of Mr Obama was like an electric shock : it changed the dynamic and meant a deal was possible ; if the US were to take a leading role , it would mean it was very possible .
Britain 's new Energy and Climate Change Secretary , Ed Miliband , who is taking part in the Poznan talks this week , wants a leading role for Britain , although the UK position , of course , is part of the position of the EU .
Therein lies a difficulty , as this week the EU is trying to finalise its own energy and climate package – with some difficulty .
This aims ambitiously at member states providing 20 per cent of their energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020 , and cutting 20 per cent of EU carbon emissions by the same date , if no global climate deal is achieved at Copenhagen – and 30 per cent if a global deal is achieved .
Some member countries , principally Poland , Italy and the Czech Republic , are unhappy with this , and it is possible that European heads of government ( including Gordon Brown ) , who will try to complete the deal tomorrow and on Friday , may have to secure their adhesion by watering it down .
This possibility worries environmentalists and other observers in Poznan , who were hoping that if the EU set a forceful example , a very positive statement about the way forward to Copenhagen might be agreed by the end of the week .
Another worry is that the Obama effect is not yet being felt : remember that it remains the Bush administration until the new president is inaugurated on 20 January .
It is possible that the Poznan declaration may not be as positive as many would like .
But what cannot be disregarded is the pressure of the science , which gets more ominous .
" The world desperately needs an effective equitable global deal to be secured in Copenhagen next year , and Poznan fires the starting gun on that process , " said Robin Oakley , head of climate and energy for Greenpeace UK .
" At the moment , we are heading for something like four degrees of temperature rise , which would be catastrophic , " said Ed Matthew , head of climate change for Friends of the Earth .
" We are running out of time . "
( CNN ) -- Asian and Pacific stocks nosedived Tuesday , with the major exchanges posting sharp declines a day after grim U.S. economic news battered Wall Street .
Japan 's Nikkei index dove nearly 6.4 percent .
Japan 's Nikkei index dove nearly 6.4 percent , while Australia 's All Ordinaries ended down 5 percent .
The Australian exchange opened lower and fell further after the country 's central bank announced it would cut its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to 4.25 percent .
" The Australian economy has been more resilient than other advanced economies , but recent data nonetheless indicate that a significant moderation in demand and activity has been occurring , " the bank announcement stated .
" With confidence affected by the financial turbulence and a decline in the terms of trade now under way , more cautious behavior by both households and businesses is likely to see private demand remain subdued in the near term . "
In South Korea , Seoul 's KOSPI was back down 3.5 percent after a midday attempt at rallying , and Hong Kong 's Hang Seng index had dropped slightly over 5 percent by late afternoon .
The Shanghai composite index had bucked the trend with a modest gain earlier , but was down about 0.8 percent by late afternoon .
The skids followed a sharp dip in the U.S. markets Monday , when Wall Street was hammered by investor bailouts and economic analysts concluded the United States is mired in a recession that is likely to continue for some time .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 680 points , its fourth - biggest single - session decline on a point basis ever .
The decline was 7.7 percent in percentage terms -- the 12th worst percentage one - day decline ever .
It ended at 8,149 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index Monday fell 8.9 percent , and the Nasdaq composite gave up 9 percent .
Year - to - date , the Dow is down 38.6 percent and has lost 42.5 percent from its record close of 14,164.53 on October 9 , 2007 .
Stocks slid throughout the morning as investors sorted through early holiday sales reports and weak readings on manufacturing .
But the selling accelerated in the afternoon after the National Bureau of Economic Research confirmed what many have long believed -- that the nation is in a recession .
According to the NBER , the official body that calls economic cycles , the United States has been in a recession since December 2007 .
" The economy stinks , the manufacturing report did n't come out well , and the announcement from the NBER did n't help , " said Ram Kolluri , president at Global Investment Management .
" There 's a real nervousness about the economy , " he added .
Monday afternoon , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that the economic weakness will continue for some time , despite the impact of the government 's efforts to get money flowing again .
And Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the downturn is significant .
Global economic news was pretty grim as well , with manufacturing surveys in Britain and the euro zone showing a steep slowdown .
A reading on China 's manufacturing survey was equally worrisome .

PHILADELPHIA  Senator Barack Obama is days away from breaking the advertising spending record set by President Bush in the general election four years ago , having unleashed an advertising campaign of a scale and complexity unrivaled in the television era .
With advertisements running repeatedly day and night , on local stations and on the major broadcast networks , on niche cable networks and even on video games and his own dedicated satellite channels , Mr. Obama is now outadvertising Senator John McCain nationwide by a ratio of at least four to one , according to CMAG , a service that monitors political advertising .
That difference is even larger in several closely contested states .
The huge gap has been made possible by Mr. Obama ’s decision to opt out of the federal campaign finance system , which gives presidential nominees $ 84 million in public money and prohibits them from spending any amount above that from their party convention to Election Day .
Mr. McCain is participating in the system .
Mr. Obama , who at one point promised to participate in it as well , is expected to announce in the next few days that he raised more than $ 100 million in September , a figure that would shatter fund - raising records .
“ This is uncharted territory , ” said Kenneth M. Goldstein , the director of the Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin .
“ We ’ve certainly seen heavy advertising battles before .
But we ’ve never seen in a presidential race one side having such a lopsided advantage . ”

Bush Aides Rush to Enact a Safety Rule Obama Opposes
By ROBERT PEAR
WASHINGTON — The Labor Department is racing to complete a new rule , strenuously opposed by President - elect Barack Obama , that would make it much harder for the government to regulate toxic substances and hazardous chemicals to which workers are exposed on the job .
The rule , which has strong support from business groups , says that in assessing the risk from a particular substance , federal agencies should gather and analyze “ industry - by - industry evidence ” of employees ’ exposure to it during their working lives .
The proposal would , in many cases , add a step to the lengthy process of developing standards to protect workers ’ health .
Public health officials and labor unions said the rule would delay needed protections for workers , resulting in additional deaths and illnesses .
With the economy tumbling and American troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , President Bush has promised to cooperate with Mr. Obama to make the transition “ as smooth as possible . ” 
But that has not stopped his administration from trying , in its final days , to cement in place a diverse array of new regulations .
The Labor Department proposal is one of about 20 highly contentious rules the Bush administration is planning to issue in its final weeks .
The rules deal with issues as diverse as abortion , auto safety and the environment .
One rule would make it easier to build power plants near national parks and wilderness areas .
Another would reduce the role of federal wildlife scientists in deciding whether dams , highways and other projects pose a threat to endangered species .
Mr. Obama and his advisers have already signaled their wariness of last - minute efforts by the Bush administration to embed its policies into the Code of Federal Regulations , a collection of rules having the force of law .
The advisers have also said that Mr. Obama plans to look at a number of executive orders issued by Mr. Bush .
A new president can unilaterally reverse executive orders issued by his predecessors , as Mr. Bush and President Bill Clinton did in selected cases .
But it is much more difficult for a new president to revoke or alter final regulations put in place by a predecessor .
A new administration must solicit public comment and supply “ a reasoned analysis ”  for such changes , as if it were issuing a new rule , the Supreme Court has said .
As a senator and a presidential candidate , Mr. Obama sharply criticized the regulation of workplace hazards by the Bush administration .
In September , Mr. Obama and four other senators introduced a bill that would prohibit the Labor Department from issuing the rule it is now rushing to complete .
He also signed a letter urging the department to scrap the proposal , saying it would “ create serious obstacles to protecting workers from health hazards on the job . ” 
Administration officials said such concerns were based on a misunderstanding of the proposal .
“ This proposal does not affect the substance or methodology of risk assessments , and it does not weaken any health standard , ”  said Leon R. Sequeira , the assistant secretary of labor for policy .
The proposal , Mr. Sequeira said , would allow the department to “ cast a wide net for the best available data before proposing a health standard . ” 
The Labor Department regulates occupational health hazards posed by a wide variety of substances like asbestos , benzene , cotton dust , formaldehyde , lead , vinyl chloride and blood - borne pathogens , including the virus that causes AIDS .
The department is constantly considering whether to take steps to protect workers against hazardous substances .
Currently , it is assessing substances like silica , beryllium and diacetyl , a chemical that adds the buttery flavor to some types of microwave popcorn .
The proposal applies to two agencies in the Labor Department , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Mine Safety and Health Administration .
Under the proposal , they would have to publish “ advance notice of proposed rule - making , ”  soliciting public comment on studies , scientific information and data to be used in drafting a new rule .
In some cases , OSHA has done that , but it is not required to do so .
The Bush administration and business groups said the rule would codify “ best practices , ”  ensuring that health standards were based on the best available data and scientific information .
Randel K. Johnson , a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce , said his group “ unequivocally supports ”  the proposal because it would give the public a better opportunity to comment on the science and data used by the government .
After a regulation is drafted and formally proposed , Mr. Johnson said , it is “ all but impossible ”  to get OSHA to make significant changes .
“ Risk assessment drives the entire process of regulation , ”  he said , and “ courts almost always defer ”  to the agency ’s assessments .
But critics say the additional step does nothing to protect workers .
“ This rule is being pushed through by an administration that , for the last seven and a half years , has failed to set any new OSHA health rules to protect workers , except for one issued pursuant to a court order , ”  said Margaret M. Seminario , director of occupational safety and health for the A.F.L. - C.I.O .
Now , Ms. Seminario said , “ the administration is rushing to lock in place requirements that would make it more difficult for the next administration to protect workers . ” 
She said the proposal could add two years to a rule - making process that often took eight years or more .
Representative George Miller , a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor , said the proposal would “ weaken future workplace safety regulations and slow their adoption . ” 
The proposal says that risk assessments should include industry - by - industry data on exposure to workplace substances .
Administration officials acknowledged that such data did not always exist .
In their letter , Mr. Obama and other lawmakers said the Labor Department , instead of tinkering with risk - assessment procedures , should issue standards to protect workers against known hazards like silica and beryllium .
The government has been working on a silica standard since 1997 and has listed it as a priority since 2002 .
The timing of the proposal appears to violate a memorandum issued in early May by Joshua B. Bolten , the White House chief of staff .
“ Except in extraordinary circumstances , ”  Mr. Bolten wrote , “ regulations to be finalized in this administration should be proposed no later than June 1 , 2008 , and final regulations should be issued no later than Nov. 1 , 2008 . ” 
The Labor Department has not cited any extraordinary circumstances for its proposal , which was published in the Federal Register on Aug. 29 .
Administration officials confirmed last week that the proposal was still on their regulatory agenda .
The Labor Department said the proposal affected “ only internal agency procedures ”  for developing health standards .
It cited one source of authority for the proposal : a general “ housekeeping statute ”  that allows the head of a department to prescribe rules for the performance of its business .
The statute is derived from a law passed in 1789 to help George Washington get the government up and running .
The Labor Department rule is among many that federal agencies are poised to issue before Mr. Bush turns over the White House to Mr. Obama .
One rule would allow coal companies to dump rock and dirt from mountaintop mining operations into nearby streams and valleys .
Another , issued last week by the Health and Human Services Department , gives states sweeping authority to charge higher co-payments for doctor ’s visits , hospital care and prescription drugs provided to low - income people under Medicaid .
The department is working on another rule to protect health care workers who refuse to perform abortions or other procedures on religious or moral grounds .

bento # 14 Katamari Damacy December 6 , 2008
Posted by AnnaTheRed in bento blog ( all ) Tags : bento
Most my bento have been Studio Ghibli themed since I started making bento , and I wanted to make something different .
My boyfriend and I love video games .
We each own a PS2 , an xbox360 , an wii , and a DS lite .
So I decided to make a video game themed kyaraben for a change .
I looked at his video game collection and found a game we both have and love .
And it was Katamari Damacy !
Bento#14 : Katamari Damacy
Created and eaten on : 10/17/2008
Katamari Damacy is created by Japanese developers .
The game has a very unique concept and style .
You can look at Katamari Damacy in Wikipedia for a full description of the game , but basically you ’re a very tiny “ Prince ” , and his father , the King of All Cosmos , destroyed the stars , constellations and Moon .
Now Prince has a mission to rebuild what his father destroyed by rolling a very tiny katamari ( clump ) onto “ stuff ” and make the katamari bigger .
These “ stuff ” are pretty much anything you can find in Japan .
And in the game , they are scattered all over the house , streets , park , town … everywhere .
I ’m not going to review the game here because this is my bento blog , but the game is just sooooo addicting .
Once I had an idea , it was pretty easy .
I just needed to make a rice ball , and put lots of stuff from the game on the rice ball .
I knew it ’d be a lot of work , so I tried not to worry too much about the details .
First , I made an egg sheet and put it in a bento box for background .
Then I made a bowl out of rice , put left over curry in , and covered it with the lid which was also made out of rice .
And I made tiny sushi , tiny carrots , tiny radishes , rice balls , etc …
Making those little foods may look like a pain in the neck , but it was actually the most fun part of making this bento .
After that , I put the little foods on the rice ball .
I was already giggling looking at the “ katamari ” at this point , because it looked so ridiculously cute !
I wrapped potato salad with microwaved lettuce leaves , and shaped it like Prince .
I snapped off the stem of parsley and put it as Prince ’s arms and legs .
This bento may look crazy & complicated , but I had an awesome time making it .
Everything went pretty much the way I wanted .
Of course , I could n’t close the lid on the bento , but I could care less .
Besides , that was the whole point of the game ! 😛
I ’d usually write what each parts are made of in the end of a post , but for this bento , please visit my flickr for the detail .
There is just so much detail to write in here !
EDIT : Seems like I ’m getting a lot more traffic than usual , ( thanks to reddit , digg , metafilters , kotaku , kottke , etc … ) and I just wanted to make something clear for those who never had Japanese curry .
As you can see in the pictures above , there ’s chicken curry ( with potato and carrot ) inside the rice bowl / ball thing .
And you usually eat curry with rice .
That ’s it .
The little foods are just extras .
And they ’re mainly vegetable and egg .
So please do n’t worry .
My boyfriend is getting enough nutrients just from curry and rice . =D
This is also a good way to pack curry for bento , because this way , the curry does n’t stain your bento box .
You do n’t have to make a bowl out of rice , but just fill a lunch box with rice , scoop some rice with a spoon ( do n’t scoop all the way to the bottom ) and pour curry in .
If the curry is too soupy , it might leak to the bottom , but if it ’s left over curry and was in the fridge overnight , this usually works well .

Security researcher Dino Dai Zovi is making waves this Halloween thanks to recent comments he made at this week 's Hack in the Box conference in Malaysia regarding the security of the x86 architecture .
Zovi , formerly of Matasano Security , is n't a high - profile figure in the industry , but he has worked on several notable projects , including the hardware - based Vitriol rootkit that took advantage of Intel 's VT -x technology to infect a system .
He won the April 2007 MacBook hacking contest , has presented at Black Hat , and maintains a strong interest in how processor architectures affect security .
At the Hack in the Box conference , Zovi warned that a theoretical x86 iPhone would have to deal with security problems that an ARM - based phone would not encounter .
" That [ the use of an x86 processor ] will make the iPhone x86 and that will make a lot of attacks easier , " the researcher told InfoWorld .
" The iPhone uses the ARM processor and most people are not familiar with it ... If you 're doing exploits and vulnerability research , you need to know the specifics of the processor that 's running . "
Zovi did not give specifics on precisely how malware authors and hackers might exploit the x86 architecture to attack a smartphone , but he did note that the version of OS X that runs on the iPhone is " significantly " less secure than its desktop counterpart .
Again , he declined to provide exact information on how the two were different .
x86 = security risk ?
Dino Dai Zovi's comments on the merits of an x86 - based iPhone are highly theoretical , given Apple 's recently - announced plans to build its own iPhone CPU .
Even if Apple had no such intentions , Intel does n't currently have a solution that fits within a smartphone 's power profile ; such a chip wo n't appear until Atom transitions to 32nm , and it is n't a sure bet even then .
Safer than x86 ?
If Intel cares about Zovi 's comments at all , it 's because there 's no reason to assume the iPhone would be the only device effected by hypothetical weaknesses in the x86 architecture .
I 've discussed Intel 's branding and association plans before ; the company is encouraging customers to associate " Intel Inside " with MIDs or smartphones .
The idea that the x86 architecture is some sort of security risk for these devices is not good for that message , especially when the entire conversation involves products that do n't even exist .
It 's worth asking just how much the issues Zovi raises matter in the real world .
I 'm not contesting his claim that security researchers need to be familiar with specific architectural details , but security researchers are not malware authors .
To date , the malware epidemics that have swept the Internet have generally not been complex attacks that required a specific client configuration or a near - genius author .
The best / most virulent malware attacks have historically been quite simple ones that took advantage of broad security flaws that affected multiple operating systems .
As more of these flaws have been patched , we 've seen malware authors switch attack vectors and begin focusing more on social exploits — hence the rise of phishing .
Phishing attacks , however , are often simple themselves , and are far more likely to rely on user gullibility ( i.e , " Click here to reset your Paypal account " ) than on truly sophisticated tomfoolery .
As malware creation and distribution becomes more of a commercial enterprise , the concerns of those involved are beginning to mirror the concerns of legitimate businesses .
The commercial mass - marketing appeal of botnets lies in the fact that they are cheap , easy to create , and easy to maintain .
No one system may remain zombiefied for very long but , as long as the system infection rate exceeds the system turnover rate , that 's not a problem .
The entire structure of the business is geared towards keeping costs low and distribution rates high .
The inherently reactive nature of modern IT security only fosters this approach .
One reason Storm stuck around as long as it did is because its authors / distributors kept spinning new variants that got past AV filters .
The black hats could spin new variants faster than the white hats could patch them .
I have no doubt that Dino Dai Zovi is correct when he says that the degree of general knowledge that 's available regarding the x86 architecture is useful to malware authors , but any consideration of device security has to account for the protective mechanisms built into both a device 's OS and its actual hardware .
Both AMD and Intel have deployed new technology to improve the latter over the past five years ; AMD pioneered the " NX Disable " bit , which prevents certain types of buffer overloads from executing , while Intel has its own Trusted Execution Technology that 's designed to completely sandbox certain programs in order to prevent any sort of tampering .
Since the entire TXT system is hardware - based from start to finish , Intel can effectively isolate the code in question .
I do n't know to what degree the problems AMD and Intel have addressed in hardware are actually inherent faults within the x86 ISA , but it seems premature to assume that any flaws of this sort cannot be addressed through the use of additional hardware .
Finding the light switch
Finally , I 'd like to note that Dai Zovi 's argument in favor of ARM rests on the concept of security through obscurity , an inherently weak argument .
A security system based on obfuscation offers all the protection of a perfectly empty , perfectly dark room , and is promptly broken as soon as someone finds the light switch .
If a lack of familiarity with the ARM architecture is the only thing standing between the malware industry and its profits , you can bet that wall will come down fast .
The cost of retraining one 's employees is infinitesimal compared to the potential benefits of a smartphone botnet , and it does n't take a genius to see the dollar signs .
If Dai Zovi seriously contends that the x86 architecture is a significant , unaddressable security risk to the smartphone industry , he 's needs to release more details to show it .
" I have friends calling me from other countries saying ' Oh well , do n't worry , we 've seen this happen in third world countries before , we 've seen Parliament 's get suspended , and people pull fast tricks in order to not face the will of Parliament , ' but in Canada ? , " Liberal Bob Rae said .
" I frankly do n't regard his government as legitimate any more .
His government is there because he avoided the will of Parliament . "
A British local authority responsible for a toddler who died after a lifetime of abuse has suspended six members of staff , after a damning report into the case that has sparked national outrage .
The 17 - month - old boy , known only as Baby P , died in a blood - spattered cot in August 2007 , despite being on the child protection register and being seen by social workers 60 times .
The boy 's mother pleaded guilty and her boyfriend and a lodger have been convicted of charges relating to the baby 's death .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the British public were left " shocked and saddened but horrified and angered " at how the boy was not given help .
A petition by the mass - market Sun newspaper calling for those responsible to be sacked attracted 1.3 million names , and an inquiry was launched .
Inspectors investigated why the toddler was not taken into care despite numerous injuries including broken ribs and eventually a broken back .
The local authority involved , Haringey Council in north London , is the same one that failed to stop the death of eight - year - old Ivorian Victoria Climbie , a child abuse case that similarly shocked Britain in 2000 .
Children 's minister Ed Balls unveiled the results of the probe on Monday , describing them as " devastating " and saying the report delivered a " damning verdict on the current management of safeguarding " at the council .
Mr Balls said one of the most worrying factors was the " failure to talk directly to children at risk " .
Councillor Lorna Reith , deputy leader of Haringey Council , confirmed a director , a deputy director , a senior team manager and three social workers had been suspended on full pay .
Among them was Sharon Shoesmith , the head of children 's services who had initially defended the actions of her staff following the baby 's death .
Council leader George Meehan and the cabinet member for children and young people , Liz Santry , also resigned .

Given the size of the Democratic majority , an Obama administration is also likely to impose stricter environmental regulations and place higher taxes on oil companies than the Bush administration did .

TRADE : Cooperation Fades , Protectionism Rises
What consensus there was on international trade seemed to evaporate with the failure of world trade talks this summer .
Indeed , with the world on the brink of a global recession , led by the United States and Europe , the fear of a rise in protectionism grows .
The first test of sustaining international cooperation will come on Nov. 14 and 15 , long before Mr. Obama takes office .
Leaders from 20 major countries will gather in Washington with President Bush to embark on an effort to rewrite international financial regulations  an undertaking some liken to a latter - day Bretton Woods conference .
Whether or not he attends , Mr. Obama will cast a long shadow .
In short order , the recession and a likely spike in unemployment are sure to put him under pressure from union supporters , as well as Congressional Democrats , to take a tougher line on trade .
“ China is the issue that should be part of Obama ’s trade policy right away , ” said Thea M. Lee , the chief economist of the A.F.L. - C.I.O . “ Part of it is sending a strong message to the Chinese government that the U.S. is not willing to tolerate currency manipulation and violation of workers ’ rights . ”
But China ’s economy is slowing , making its leaders even less receptive to demands to allow their currency to rise .
The United States will also need the Chinese to buy a good chunk of the debt being run up by the bailout of banks and housing .
It is also unclear whether Mr. Obama will pursue a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement , which he discussed in the hard - fought primaries .
“ He parsed his answers in a way that suggests he understands the importance of global trade , ” said Hank Cox , a spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers .

The nation 's first commercial hydrokinetic turbine , which harnesses the power from moving water without the construction of a dam , has splashed into the waters of the Mississippi River near Hastings , Minnesota .
The 35 - kilowatt turbine is positioned downstream from an existing hydroelectric - plant dam and — together with another turbine to be installed soon — will increase the capacity of the plant by more than 5 percent .
The numbers are n't big , but the rig 's installation could be the start of an important trend in green energy .
And that could mean more of these " wind turbines for the water " will be generating clean energy soon .
" We do n't require that massive dam construction , we 're just using the natural flow of the stream , " said Mark Stover , a vice president at Hydro Green Energy , the Houston - based company leading the project .
" It 's underwater windpower if you will , but we have 840 or 850 times the energy density of wind . "
Hydrokinetic turbines like those produced by Hydro Green and Verdant capture the mechanical energy of the water 's flow and turn it into energy , without need for a dam .
The problem for companies like Hydro Green is that their relatively low - impact turbines are forced into the same regulatory bucket as huge hydroelectric dams .
The regulatory hurdles have made it difficult to actually get water flowing through projects .
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has oversight of all projects that involve making power from water , and the agency has recently shown
signs of easing up on this new industry .
In the meantime , the first places where hydrokinetic power makes in impact could be at existing dam sites where the regulatory red tape has already been cut .
“ I am thrilled to support today 's historic order that allows for harnessing more power from the Mississippi River , ” FERC Commissioner
Philip Moeller said in a release .
“ I hope this is the first of thousands of similar projects that produce clean and renewable power from in - stream flows at existing dams . ”
Moeller 's enthusiasm could encourage other companies that are trying similar strategies to tap tidal or current power .
Verdant has been testing its own turbine design to capture tidal flow in New York 's East River , but it has n't been easy .
" Verdant has spent more money on permitting their East River project that than they did on hardware , " said Roger Bedard , a researcher at the
Electric Power Research Institute , who has studied water - current–based energy generation .
Hydro Green 's
Stover hopes that his company 's new unit will help shorten that regulatory process by generating environmental impact data that could ease concerns the turbines will disrupt river ecosystems and habitats .
And in the meantime , investors will continue to scour the planet for companies and technologies that could benefit from Barack Obama 's plans to create green jobs .
Congress already passed a bill this year to extend tax incentives for hydrokinetic projects through 2016 .
" After the wind and solar craze , people said , ' What else is out there ? ' "
Stover said .
" The investment community is quite interested . "

MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) -- Former FBI agent John Connolly , whose fall from celebrated mob-buster to paid gangland flunky captivated a South Florida courtroom for weeks , broke his long silence Thursday at his sentencing hearing .
Retired FBI agent John Connolly was convicted last month of second degree murder for his role in a mob hit .
Connolly , 68 , denied having any role in a 1982 mob hit , telling the family of slain businessman John Callahan : " It 's heart breaking to hear what happened to your father , and to your husband ...
My heart is broken when I hear what you say . "
Later , under a spirited cross-examination , Connolly explained that rubbing elbows with killers and gangsters and winning their confidence was part of the job .
His attorney argued , " He did what the FBI wanted him to do and now all of a sudden , he 's responsible for all these heinous acts . "
Connolly did not testify at his trial .
The prosecutor , Michael Van Zamft , asked for a life sentence , saying the 30 - year minimum sentence is too little because " Mr. Connolly abused his badge . "
Judge Stanford Blake postponed the sentencing until January 15 .
He said he needed time to consider a defense motion challenging the second - degree murder conviction .
Connolly was convicted last month in the 1982 slaying of Callahan , an executive with World Jai-Alai .
Callahan 's bullet - pocked body was found in the trunk of a Cadillac parked at Miami International Airport .
Connolly 's testimony followed that of several other witnesses , including Callahan 's son and a former FBI agent .
Callahan 's son , Patrick , read letters that he , his sister , and his mother wrote .
He said that his mother considered his father " the love of my life " for 23 years .
Former FBI agent Billy Reagan told the judge : " John had nothing to do with these murders , your honor . "
During the two - month trial , jurors heard that Connolly had told his mob connections that Callahan , 45 , was a potential witness against them , setting him up for the gangland - style execution .
Connolly previewed his denials in a jailhouse interview published Thursday in The Boston Globe .
He faces 30 years to life at his sentencing .
" I did not commit these crimes I was charged with , " Connolly told the newspaper .
" I never sold my badge .
I never took anybody 's money .
I never caused anybody to be hurt , at least not knowingly , and I never would . "
According to testimony at his trial , Connolly was co-opted by the very gangsters he was supposed to be pursuing -- members of South Boston 's notorious Winter Hill gang .
His story is said to be the inspiration for the character played by Matt Damon in the 2006 Martin Scorsese movie , " The Departed . "
Connolly 's sordid tale has been closely followed in New England , where he grew up in Boston 's " Southie " neighborhood , the same area long dominated by the Winter Hill gang and its notorious leader , James " Whitey " Bulger .
Sought in 19 slayings , Bulger is the FBI 's second most - wanted fugitive .
During the first two decades of his FBI career , Connolly won kudos in the bureau 's Boston office , cultivating informants against New England mobsters .
Prosecutors said Connolly was corrupted by his two highest - ranking snitches : Bulger and Stephen '' The Rifleman ' ' Flemmi .
Connolly retired from the FBI in 1990 and later was indicted on federal racketeering and other charges stemming from his long relationship with Bulger and Flemmi .
He was convicted of racketeering in 2002 and was serving a 10 - year federal prison sentence when he was indicted in 2005 in the Callahan slaying .
During testimony , jurors heard that Connolly was on the mob payroll , collecting $ 235,000 from Bulger and Flemmi while shielding his mob pals from prosecution and leaking the identities of informants .
The prosecution 's star witnesses at the Miami trial were Flemmi , who is now in prison , and mob hit man John Martorano , who has admitted to 20 murders , served 12 years in prison and is now free .
Callahan , who often socialized with gangsters , had asked the gang to execute Oklahoma businessman Roger Wheeler over a business dispute , according to testimony .
Martorano killed Wheeler in 1981 on a golf course , shooting him once between the eyes , prosecutors said .
After Connolly told Bulger and Flemmi that Callahan was going to implicate them in the slaying , Martorano was sent to do away with Callahan , prosecutors said .
But one star witness did not testify -- the former FBI agent who inspired the 1997 film " Donnie Brasco . "
He refused to take the stand after the judge denied his request to testify anonymously .

GOP advantage in Senate run-off dims Dems chances for 60 - seat Senate Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday December 2 , 2008
Print This Email This Georgia voters return to the polls Tuesday for a run-off Senate election that could put Democrats a step closer to a filibuster - proof majority in the chamber , although the chances of an upset seem slim .
While such do - overs are difficult to predict , Republican incumbent Sen.
Saxby Chambliss seems well positioned to hold onto his seat .
The race against Democratic challenger Jim Martin grew unexpectedly close this fall , preventing Chambliss from earning a majority of votes on Election Day .
( Georgia law requires run -off elections if one candidate does not crack the 50 percent mark . )
Chambliss holds a seven - point lead over Martin , according to a Pollster.com average of run-off polls .
The extra month of campaigning in Georgia led both campaigns to import volunteers , surrogates and campaign workers from the presidential operations as well as from completed races in other states .
Chambliss appeared alongside failed vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin on Monday , and Martin relied on former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore to bolster his support in the state .
A victory by Martin , who finished 100,000 votes behind Chambliss in November , would be " the biggest upset of the Senate cycle , " notes Roll Call 's John McArdle ( subscription only ) .
When Martin emerged from a runoff to win the Democratic nomination in Georgia , he was viewed as little more than a sacrificial lamb in what had been considered a safely GOP seat .
But that was before Chambliss  campaign was hit hard by the countrys economic downturn and before national Democrats made the race a priority in their late election spending .
Booting Chambliss from the Senate would prove particularly satisfying to Democrats still enraged over the smear tactics the Republican employed in his 2002 race against Democratic candidate Max Cleland , a triple - amputee Vietnam veteran .
Chambliss accused Cleland of lacking national security experience and ran TV ads juxtaposing Cleland 's face with Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein .
President - elect Barack Obama sought on Thursday to separate himself from the political scandal swirling around Governor Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois , saying he never talked to the governor about who would replace Mr. Obama in the United States Senate .
Mr. Obama added that he was “ absolutely certain ” his staff was not involved in any deal - making regarding his successor .
“ That would be a violation of everything that this campaign has been about , ” he said at a news conference in Chicago .
Nonetheless , Mr. Obama said he was gathering an account of any contacts between his staff and the Blagojevich administration , and promised to release those details in the next few days .
But he said his staff had acted appropriately .
Inspired by a commenter , I have come up with an auto industry bailout plan .
For years , we have been treated to the following comments :
A Republican congressman who said parts of Iraq are no more dangerous than Detroit is drawing criticism from the mayor ’s office and the Michigan Democratic party .
During an interview Monday with WILS - AM in Lansing , Rep. Tim Walberg , R - Tipton , said the returning troops he has talked with “ indicate to me that 80 to 85 percent , in a conservative fashion , of ( Iraq ) is reasonably under control , at least as well as Detroit or Chicago or any of our other big cities .
That ’s an encouraging sign . ”
And this :
Former state Assemblyman Howard Kaloogian is leading a group of about 20 people on a visit to Iraq next month in what he and his organization , Move America Forward , call a “ Truth Tour . ”
“ We want to get a firsthand account and look at the progress being made over there , ” the 45 - year - old conservative Republican said in a telephone interview from Michigan where he was on business .
“ You never hear about the good news from Iraq . ” ***
“ The impression most people have on the streets of San Diego is that car bombs are the norm when in fact they are n’t , ” Kaloogian said .
“ Detroit is arguably a more dangerous place than Iraq . ”
Rep. Steve King ( R - IA ) was even dedicated enough to run the numbers :
Using Pentagon statistics cross-checked with independent research , King said he came up with an annualized Iraqi civilian death rate of 27.51 per 100,000 .
While that number sounds high – astonishingly , the Iowa Republican discovered that it ’s significantly lower than a number of major American cities , including the nation ’s capital .
“ It ’s 45 violent deaths per 100,000 in Washington , D.C. , ” King told Crowley .
Other American cities with higher violent civilian death rates than Iraq include : Detroit – 41.8 per 100,000 Baltimore – 37.7 per 100,000 Atlanta – 34.9 per 100,000 St. Louis – 31.4 per 100,000
Additionally , I am aware that Michigan has a ginormous Muslim population and has almost instituted Sharia Law .
I think you can understand what needs to be done .
We need to invade Michigan and rebuild the state from the ground up .
We will be greeted as liberators , we have clear supply lines , and we can easily rebuild the auto industry with the kind of money we spend on other countries we invade .
Hell , our new Secretary of State , Hillary of Clinton , spent the better part of the past year fighting for the rights of average folks from Michigan , so think of the good will we have with the public .
This is very doable .
Just tell Congress we will give KBR no -bid contracts to fix Detroit .
And citizens of Baltimore , Altanta , St. Louis , and DC - you better get your shit together or you are next .
*** Update ***
This plan is picking up support rapidly , and we have unearthed another bonus to earn GOP support :
The New York Times has an article on the simple but effective idea that a statistical analysis of word frequency in written text can be a guide to the psychological state of the author .
It ’s a technique that ’s been pioneered by psychologist James Pennebaker who has conducted a considerable amount of intriguing research to back up his technique .
In fact , he ’s completed a huge number of studies looking at word frequency in everything from bereavement to suicidal and non-suicidal poets .
However , some of his most impressive work has focused on the benefits of getting distressed or ill people to write , finding that it benefits recovery from trauma , but perhaps more surprisingly seems also to boost immune system function in HIV patients .
The evidence and theory behind the work was described in a great 2003 review article which notes that the importance lies not so much in the subject or action words , but in the ‘ bitty ’ parts of speech , such as the use of pronouns ( I , you , we and so on ) .
These seem to relate to the focus of the thoughts and Pennebaker was asked by the FBI to apply the technique to the communications of Al Queda :
Take Dr. Pennebaker ‚Äôs recent study of Al Qaeda communications
‚ Äî videotapes , interviews , letters .
At the request of the F.B.I. , he tallied the number of words in various categories ‚ Äî pronouns , articles and adjectives , among others .
He found , for example , that Osama bin Laden ‚Äôs use of first - person pronouns ( I , me , my , mine ) remained fairly constant over several years .
By contrast , his second - in - command , Ayman al - Zawahri , used such words more and more often .
‚ Äú This dramatic increase suggests greater insecurity , feelings of threat , and perhaps a shift in his relationship with bin Laden , ‚Äù Dr. Pennebaker wrote in his report [ pdf ] , which was published in The Content Analysis Reader ( Sage Publications , July 2008 ) .
Interestingly , the FBI have their own in - house text analysis technique but I ’m damned if I can remember the name or find it on the net .

( CNN ) --
Years before the first Gulf War , Saddam Hussein was slaughtering Iraq 's Kurds with bombs , bullets and gas .
Kurdish refugees fleeing Saddam Hussein 's chemical weapons attacks in 1988 .
The Reagan White House saw it as a ruthless attempt to put down a rebellion by a minority ethnic group fighting for independence and allied with Iraq 's enemy , Iran .
But Peter Galbraith thought it was something worse .
" A light went off in my head , and I said , ' Saddam Hussein is committing genocide , ' " said Galbraith , who was on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time .
An unabashed idealist , Galbraith was known for tackling unconventional issues .
" If you 're going to be idealistic in life , you 're going to be disappointed , " he said .
" But that 's not a reason to abandon idealism . "
Galbraith was one of the first Westerners to witness the effects of the slaughter .
During a fact - finding trip for the Senate in 1987 , he saw something troubling .
Scream Bloody Murder Christiane Amanpour introduces you to the courageous few who saw evil and tried to stop the killing .
December 4 , 9 p.m. ET see full schedule »
" When we crossed from the Arab part of Iraq into the Kurdish part of Iraq , the villages and towns that showed on our maps just were n't there , " he said .
Bulldozing Kurdish villages was just the first phase of Hussein's war against the Kurds .
In 1988 , it escalated with chemical weapons .
" Thousands , maybe tens of thousands of people were killed in those attacks , and then Iraqi troops moved into those villages and gunned down the survivors . "
Galbraith wanted to invoke the U.N. 's Genocide Convention , which requires countries to prevent and punish such crimes .
" We could not stand aside and allow Saddam Hussein to commit genocide against the Kurds of Iraq . "
With the support of his boss , Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island , Galbraith drafted a bill -- the Prevention of Genocide Act -- that would cut off U.S. foreign aid to Iraq and impose a trade embargo .
" That would have been an appropriate response to a dictator who is gassing his own people , " Galbraith said .
" I thought with a name like that it would garner a lot of support . "
But the compelling name was not enough .
So Galbraith went back to the region to gather more evidence .
Watch as Galbraith describes his fight to end the slaughter »
Tens of thousands of Kurds had fled to Turkey .
Survivors described blinding , burning clouds of poison gas that dropped people in their tracks .
" These people do n't make up these stories .
These are real stories .
And if you talk to them , if you simply talk to them ... you know that they 're telling the truth , " Galbraith said .
His report was still not enough to persuade the White House to punish Saddam .
Watch as Galbraith discusses genocide »
The Reagan administration had invested several years cultivating Iraq as an ally against Iran , their mutual enemy , and as a market for U.S. products , including more than $ 1 billion a year in farm exports .
The Prevention of Genocide Act would end the diplomatic courtship and hurt U.S businesses .
Read once - secret documents from the Reagan administration
" I had a fellow who worked for one of the Louisiana senators call me up really in tears , " Galbraith said .
" And when I talked about genocide against the Kurds , he talked about the genocide that I was committing against the rice farmers of Louisiana . "
Although then - Secretary of State George Schultz warned Iraq that use of outlawed chemical weapons jeopardized the two countries ' budding relationship , Schultz 's spokesman said imposing economic sanctions would be premature .
Watch as George Schultz explains the administration 's position »
To Galbraith , " that was a morally repugnant statement . "
The Reagan administration also claimed Galbraith 's bill used " inaccurate terms like genocide . "
But for Galbraith , this was no time for semantics .
" Should we have waited until he used chemical weapons again ?
Should we have waited until instead of 5 percent of the Kurdish population was murdered -- 10 ? 15 ? "
In the end , the House of Representatives killed Galbraith 's sanctions bill with backing from the Reagan administration .
Politics had trumped principle .
Galbraith calls the U.S. policy " appeasement . "
" We were not able to modify Iraq 's behavior , " Galbraith said .
" And guess what ? "
Two years later , in August 1990 , Iraq invaded Kuwait , its oil - rich neighbor to the south .
This time , the U.S. compared Saddam to Hitler .
And with Kuwait 's oil at stake , the U.S finally screamed bloody murder .

Why the exodus to South - East Asia ?
In my view , it is simply a matter of taste .
Some men - a lot of men - prefer Asians .
What lies at the heart of Thailand 's sex tourism industry is the way we sexually stereotype Asians ; about the way Asian women perform in the bedroom and act in a relationship .
When I told my squash partner I was going to Thailand , he said : " You lucky bugger .
Sure you do n't want company ? "
He then told me about the good times he 'd spent with " tight - bodied Asians " .
Maybe I 'm just ridiculously naive - I have yet to set foot in a strip joint - but I was shocked to learn three people I knew had been to Thailand , paid for sex , and thought their actions were sufficiently ordinary to talk openly about it without fear of recrimination .
I asked my ex-girlfriend , Viv - brought up in England by parents from Hong Kong - about it .
Her words detonated off the screen : " Oh my God , I have so much to say about this . "
In her opinion , there is " a hell of a lot " of sexual stereotyping .
She told me : " We call it ' yellow fever ' , which I find hilarious , or ' Asian fetish ' , which is more common .
I get it all the time at certain clubs , and you know that guys are only talking to you because you look Asian .
Viv had a number of theories about why Caucasian men are attracted to Asian females .
First , there is the physical difference .
" Perhaps it 's the hairlessness of our bodies and the different feel of our skin due to the extremely healthy diet and the blackness and straightness of the hair , " she said .
" Everything is completely different . "
Cultural differences serve to heighten the attraction .
" Girls are taught to bring up a family and to know their place ; to take all sorts of shit and still be courteous and long - suffering without a word of complaint .
" Western guys who look ugly as hell and do n't stand a chance with strong - minded , selfish , feminist , materialistic , status - driven Western girls can have beautiful Asian girls falling over themselves to be with them . "
The trouble is , the No. 1 dish served up by the sex industry is young girls .
The 2001 World Health Organisation report Sex Work In Asia revealed the premium age for sex workers in the region to be 12 to 16 .
According to the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women , the average age of girls entering the sex industry is 14 .
The poorest villages in Vietnam , Burma , Laos and Thailand are ideal recruiting stations for traffickers supplying children for sex .
This practice results in children being either kidnapped or sold into the trade , either knowingly or unwittingly , by their families .
It happens because their poverty is extreme and the economic incentives are too good to ignore .
The high sums paid by foreigners have made the industry lucrative .
A bar girl servicing foreigners can expect to charge anywhere between 500 baht ( $ 22 ) and 2000 baht for either a short time ( one to two hours ) or a long time ( all night ) .
Hence the phrase , " Love you long time . "
On top of this , the punter usually has to buy the girl , or girls , a designated number of drinks - usually two - and pay her " bar fine " for taking her out of the establishment .
When I asked my squash buddy whether he slept with prostitutes in Australia , he laughed and said of course he did n't .
So why did he do it in Thailand ?
" Because that 's just the way it is over there . "
As he said this , I felt something in me starting to burn .
I wanted to tell him what a lame excuse that was for behaviour he would n't accept on his own turf .
I wanted to know if it mattered to him what circumstances had delivered these women to his bedside , made them strip off seductively and lick him all over .
But my fire went out in silence and I ordered us another beer .
He 's my mate .
Who am I to tell him what to do ?
He is n't the first Australian to go to Asia for sex , and he definitely wo n't be the last .
He 's merely part of a groundswell of men , and now women , who believe they have the right to exploit the sons and daughters of neighbouring nations .
Craig Scutt is an author and freelance journalist .
This is an edited extract from his essay in Griffith Review 22 : MoneySexPower .
A technology that uses special mirrors and lenses to help generate electricity from sunlight may be a new bright spot for the solar industry .
Often called " concentrated photovoltaics , " the technology was the focus of a $ 103 million deal in November to install 10 megawatts of generating capacity in southern Spain , enough to power a city of 40,000 .
SolFocus Inc. , the Silicon Valley company that supplied technology in that transaction , on Monday is also announcing a deal to help build a 1.6 - megawatt power plant in Greece that is based on the same approach .
Concentrated photovoltaics use mirrors and lenses to direct an increased amount of energy on smaller solar panels , which can be made from low - cost materials such as glass and aluminum , thus avoiding the use of silicon , a commodity that can be subject to shortages that keep panel prices high .
The technology is on a trajectory to grow from less than 10 megawatts of generating capacity world - wide this year to as many as six gigawatts by 2020 , according to a report issued earlier this year by Greentech Media and the Prometheus Institute for Sustainable Development , research groups both in the Boston area .
That would pale in comparison to the projected 300 gigawatts in overall solar production by then , but would still double the current overall capacity of nearly three gigawatts -- most of which is supplied by silicon - based solar panels .
SolFocus is expected to announce a transaction Monday with Samaras Group , a renewable - energy developer in Greece .
Including the latest deal , SolFocus officials say they will have contracts to install up to 20 megawatts of capacity .
Last week Mr Falk described Israel 's blockade of Gaza as a war crime
The Israeli authorities have prevented a senior UN human rights official from entering the country , accusing him of being seriously biased against it .
Israel has been angered by a series of comments by Richard Falk accusing it of war crimes and comparing its actions in Gaza to Nazi Germany in WWII .
Mr Falk was stopped at Tel Aviv airport on Sunday and sent back to the United States on Monday morning .
An official accused him of following a distorted , anti-Israeli mandate .
" [ He ] does not try to advance human rights , but instead comes with his conclusions ready and those conclusions are of course extreme , methodic criticism of Israel and only of Israel , " said foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor .
A spokeswoman for the interior ministry spokeswoman said the former Princeton University international law professor had been told he would be turned back if he flew to Israel .
Local human rights group Adalah criticised Israel 's decision to deport Mr Falk , calling it a " severe blow to the rights of the Palestinian civilian population living under Israeli occupation " .
Last week Mr Falk , the special human rights rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories , described the Israeli blockade of Gaza as a massive violation of international humanitarian law .
" Israel maintains its Gaza siege in its full fury , allowing only barely enough food and fuel to enter to stave off mass famine and disease , " he said in a statement to the UN Human Rights Council .
Israel says its blockade is a necessary security measure to stem rocket attacks from the territory , whose borders are controlled by Israel but which is controlled internally by the Hamas militant group .
EUROPE
By John Lichfield
After eight years of a Bush administration which divided , ignored or patronised Europe , EU leaders are bubbling with excitement at the prospect of a more creative , transatlantic partnership with President - elect Barack Obama .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The European Commission president , Jose - Manuel Barroso spoke of a " new deal " between the US and the EU , to shape the global agenda from trade to human rights to climate change .
The French President , Nicolas Sarkozy , said : " At a time when we all face immense challenges , your election will inspire immense new hope in France , in Europe and in the entire world . "
The German Chancellor , Angela Merkel , said , pointedly , that she that she looked forward to a " closer and more trusting cooperation between the United States and Europe . "
Others warned , however , that , once the gloss wore off , an Obama presidency was likely to bump against fundamental differences of interest between Europe and the US on issues ranging from trade , to climate change and how to handle a more assertive or belligerent Russia .
There was also a notable difference of tone yesterday in the reactions of those countries dismissed by the Bush administration as " Old Europe " and the reactions of some of the former Soviet bloc countries , which had aligned themselves with the Bush - Cheney - Rumsfeld worldview .
Obama 's triumph was received ecstatically in Germany and above all in France , where over 90 per cent of people had told pollsters that they wanted a Democratic victory .
John McCain 's defeat was seen as a crushing disavowal of the conservative and neo-conservative forces which orchestrated a bullying campaign of denigration of all things French after Paris had actively opposed the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
In Poland and the Czech Republic , the reaction was more muted .
The Polish foreign minister , Radek Sikorski , said that he hoped the future President Obama would ignore Democratic Party misgivings and push ahead with the Bush administration 's plans for an anti-missile defence and radar shield based in Poland and the Czech Republic .
The shield – angrily opposed by Moscow - is likely to become a key litmus test of future US and European dealings with Russia .
FRANCE
by John Lichfield in Paris
In no other western country was a Barack Obama victory more anxiously awaited than in France .
More than 90 per cent of French people – more than 90 per cent of the parliamentary deputies in President Nicolas Sarkozy 's centre - right party – had told pollsters that they preferred Obama to John McCain .
The Democrat 's sweeping victory was seen in France as an opportunity to create a more cooperative – and more equal – relationship between Europe and the United States , on issues ranging from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , to the global financial crisis and climate change .
More than that , Obama 's triumph was seen as a crushing disavowal of the conservative and neo-conservative forces which orchestrated a bullying campaign of denigration of all things French after Paris had actively opposed the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .

" Where George W. Bush pronounced , bulldozed and failed , Barack Obama will listen , cooperate and then decide , " said Alain Duhamel , one of France 's wisest political commentators .
President Nicolas Sarkozy has annoyed many French people – including some in his own camp – by ingratiating himself with the formerly frog - bashing Bush administration since his election 17 months ago .
Even he , however , has scarcely hidden his preference for Obama in recent weeks .
In a glowing congratulatory letter yesterday , M. Sarkozy addressed to " Dear Barak ( sic ) " , the president said that Mr Obama 's " brilliant victory " and " exceptional campaign " had demonstrated to the world the continuing strength of American democracy .
" At a time when we all face immense challenges , your election will inspire immense new hope in France , in Europe and in the entire world , " President Sarkozy said .
Francçis Hollande , the leader of the main opposition party , the Parti Socialiste , paid tribute to the " audacity and courage " of the American people for electing a " man of progress " despite the " colour of his skin " .
He warned , however , that President Obama would govern in what he saw to be America 's best interest .
Despite the global excitement , Obama could not , and would not , be a " president of the world " .
French diplomats issued similar words of caution in private .
An Obama presidency , they said , should create a more equal and more cooperative transatlantic relationship .
Once the gloss wore off , they warned , American interests would reassert themselves on such potential transatlantic flash - points as trade , global warming and relations with Russia .
IRAQ
By Patrick Cockburn
It became clear during the presidential election that neither Barack Obama nor John McCain had much idea of what was happening in Iraq .
During the early stages of the campaign the two men were divided over the question of an American military withdrawal .
Mr Obama was only in the race because he had opposed the invasion in 2003 .
Mr McCain claimed the war could still be won .
This debate is now out of date , though nobody in the US has paid much attention to this in recent months because of the economic crisis .
The Iraqi government is confidently demanding that the US withdraw its combat troops from the cities at the end of June 2009 and from Iraq entirely at the end of 2011 .
The timing of the pullout is not very different from Mr Obama 's plan to withdraw over sixteen months .
The danger is that the new Democratic administration will be paralysed by fear that it will be accused of selling out Iraq just when victory was in sight .
Mr Obama may also be tempted to appoint tired old foreign policy veterans of the Clinton administration , regardless of their previous lack of achievement in the Middle East , in a bid to reassure the powers that be in Washington that he plans no radical changes .
Iraqis , with the exception of the Kurds , will in general be overjoyed to see the back of President Bush .
There is nothing new in this .
Polls in Iraq have always shown that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was popular outside the Sunni community but the US military occupation was never accepted .
The Iraqi prime minister Nouri al - Maliki is now portraying the stalled Status
of Forces Agreement with the US as a way of ending the occupation .
It will be easier for Mr Obama than Mr Bush to make the necessary concessions , many of them cosmetic , to get the measure past the Iraqi parliament .
There is another area in which an Obama administration could make vital changes in policy .
The two main allies of the present Iraqi government are Washington and Tehran , yet Mr Bush deluded himself that Iranian influence in Baghdad could be minimized .
From the beginning his occupation of Iraq was undermined by his foolish portrayal of the invasion of Iraq as a staging post on the way to overthrowing the Iranian and Syrian governments .
Not surprisingly they made sure the occupation never stabilized .
Once this self - destructive policy of confrontation is reversed and the US talks seriously to them then one of the main sources of instability in Iraq will disappear .
MIDDLE EAST
By Donald Macintyre
Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert yesterday warmly congratulated Barack Obama for his " historic and impressive " victory .
And certainly strenuous efforts have been made by Obama allies to reassure Israelis that they will in the words this week of Martin Indyk , Bill Clinton 's one time ambassador to Tel Aviv , have a " true friend " in the new White House .
Much will depend on what you mean by friend .
Given that Israel is facing an election of its own which could return the right under Benjamin Netanyahu to power , it is hard to forget Mr Obama 's own remark , during the Ohio primary , that you did n't have to sign up to every policy of Likud — Mr Netanyahu 's party — to be a friend of Israel .
The Israeli right has –surely correctly -- feared that the new President , will not be the kind of friend who can make a Knesset speech , as his predecessor did earlier this year , which utterly fails even to exhort Israel to make concessions for peace .
The left has hoped that he will be the kind of candid friend who pushes Israel towards the agreed end to the occupation which they hope he believes is in its own –and America 's -- interests .
Some in the middle — and in the Israeli establishment — actually see the Obama victory as a positive on Iran despite worries about his willingness to engage with Tehran , on the grounds that he has a much better chance of building an international coalition to stop it building nuclear weapons .
Their fear is rather that domestic preoccupations — notably economic — will stop him prioritising the Middle East , including a deal with Syria , which would require the US at the table .
Bush has left more of an Israeli - Palestinian process , however flawed , than Clinton did after the collapse of Camp David .
It is beset with problems including the control of Gaza by Hamas , whom Obama has said he wo n't talk to unless they transform their stance .
And many Palestinians , their hopes raised and dashed so often before , are anyway sceptical if an Obama presidency will make much difference .
But Ghassan Khatib , the moderate Palestinian intellectual and former minister said yesterday by defusing the Iran crisis Mr Obama could create a markedly better atmosphere in the region , including for progress in the Israel - Palestinian conflict .
Their hope will be that he will at least fulfil his promise this year to make — in stark contrast to Bush and several other presidents — to make the Middle East a first term priority .
PAKISTAN
By Andrew Buncombe
Pakistan is the crucible of south Asia whose stability is key to containing the spread of Islamic militancy .
More than a year ago , Obama angered Pakistan by voicing his support for airstrikes against al - Qa'ida militants inside the country on the border with Afghanistan and even the deployment of troops if Islamabad " cannot or will not act " against them .
His promise to " take out " militants in the tribal areas was not well received .
In reality , the Pakistan government would have worked with the administration of whichever candidate had won .
The policies of Mr Obama and Mr McCain were little different in regard to targeting militants in the tribal areas .
Both men have also stressed the importance of the military operation in Afghanistan .
Mr Obama said he will send an additional 7,000 US troops .
Pakistan 's prime minister congratulated Mr Obama , saying he hoped he would promote peace and stability .
" I hope that under your dynamic leadership , the United States will continue to be a source of global peace and new ideas for humanity , " said Yousuf Gilani .
While some commentators in Pakistan have pointed out that " Democrats traditionally support India while Republicans favour Pakistan " , few are expecting a radical shift in US policy .
" It 's not going to make much difference , " said Dr Rasul Baksh Rais , of the Lahore University of Management Sciences .
" The US will continue its policy in Afghanistan .
As far as this is concerned there seems to be consensus . "
More recently the now president - elect had talked of India and Pakistan finding a solution to the Kashmir problem .
He said Pakistan needed to concentrate on dealing with militants , rather than the perceived threat from India .
Many thought it was commonsense , but some in India believed he was proposing a US involvement in the issue , even raising the prospect of former president Bill Clinton being dispatched as a special envoy .
Unsurprisingly , in both India and Pakistan Obama has captured the imagination of younger people .
While Indian culture traditionally respects its elders - and elects leaders who might look decidedly antique almost anywhere else - in India his campaign has received celebrity - style coverage in the run-up to the election .
For a part of the world that for some long lived under foreign , white , ruled , the election of a non-White president by the world 's most powerful democracy clearly has resonance .
In a message to Mr Obama , India 's prime minister , Manmohan Singh , said : " Your extraordinary journey to the White House will inspire people not only in your country but also around the world . "
AFRICA
By Daniel Howden in Nairobi
Barack Obama 's victory was greeted with such enthusiasm across the largest and poorest continent on earth that it seemed at times to be an African , not an American election .
It is here that the people he invoked " huddled around radios in forgotten corners of the world , " are to be found .
However , Africa was almost invisible in the candidate 's position papers , with references to Sudan , Aids and aid all largely indistinguishable from those of John McCain .
He is feted as a symbol , as a communicator and as an agent of change , and many suspect his greatest impact is likely to be limited to the first of those three .
In Kenya , the land of his father 's birth , expectations and reality clash most obviously .
The country already enjoys a serious aid budget and the continent 's largest US diplomatic presence , change is unlikely .
Liberia 's president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , a close ally of Washington , welcomed his election but said that Africans should not expect anything dramatic , especially while the US has its own economic crisis .
Not everyone moved to dampen expectations though .
South Africa 's president Kgalema Motlanthe said : " We express the hope that poverty and under - development in Africa , which remains a challenge for humanity , will indeed continue to receive a greater attention of the focus of the new administration . "
The one area likely to be addressed in some form is Sudan .
Darfur , and before it the plight of Christians in South Sudan , has captured the attention of the American public and by extension its politicians .
There is a perception that Democrats have taken a softer approach to the Arab - dominated government in Khartoum .
LATIN AMERICA
By Paul Scheltus in Buenos Aires
Latin Americans are hoping for more carrot and less stick from President Obama than under his predecessor , President Bush .
Immigration will be top of the agenda for most governments .
Legalising the estimated 15 million illegal workers in the US and introducing a temporary worker programme , as well as secure borders are a priority for all Latin American nations , according to former Mexican foreign minister Jorge Castañeda .
In Buenos Aires yesterday morning young people from several Latin American nations echoed that theme .
" It was time for a change , " said 24 - year old Nacho Giretti .
" I hope that from now on the treatment of immigrants in the United States will be more humane . "
Under President Obama , relations with Cuba are expected to change .
Obama has said he will ease travel restriction and allow unlimited remittances to be sent .
Those signs were welcomed by dissidents and party officials in Cuba alike .
Pending free trade agreements , drug trafficking and energy policy are just some of many regional issues that need urgent attention .
All require that President Obama " extend a hand " to Latin America , as he has promised he will .
CHINA
By Clifford Coonan
Although China is not a democracy and is run as a single - party state by the Communist Party , there has been keen interest in the election among the Chinese .
Beijingers enthusiastically welcomed the election of Barack Obama as a victory for an attractive young candidate who would boost US - Chinese relations and resolve the global financial crisis .
" Obama is great .
This election has really changed the history of America and racism in America .
Obama can handle the economy better than Bush , he is more open to new things and also he wo n't start a war somewhere , " said Hu Feimin , 26 , a secretary from Anhui province .
The Beijing leadership is anxious to ensure change in the world 's most powerful country does not harm the interests of China , an emerging superpower .
" America has changed colour , it 's good .
Now I hope to see practical progress in future relations between China and America , " said Liu Chenbing , 32 , an engineer from Shanxi province .
" What I hope for most is that America can do something good for unification with Taiwan and that the American financial crisis can be dealt with quickly and effectively , " he said .
President George Bush is popular here , but state media ran resoundingly positive coverage of Obama 's win , suggesting the official view on Obama is this is a president the Chinese leadership can do business with .
State broadcaster CCTV hailed his Confucian qualities of filial piety and his strong family values .
Pundits hailed the incoming president as a positive symbol of change of the US .
" In the last 30 years , the relationship between China and the USA has come a long way .
I believe the new government will continue to strengthen the cooperation between China and the U.S.A. , " said Tao Wenzhao , an American Studies researcher at the influential Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .
Shen Tianhong , 25 , who works at a property management company , was surprised by the result .
" I thought white people dominated America and the presidency .
But it 's a good decision , " she said .
" This is better for the world .
And Obama can handle the American financial crisis more quickly , so that is good for China , " said Ms Shen .
Zou Qinyue , manager of a Sichuan restaurant , was focused on the economic aspect .
" Black or white , he must have something special to become president .
I hope the economy stabilises , because then the global economy will stablise . "
Some young people learned what they know about US politics from watching US TV shows .
" The funny thing is that in " 24 " , there is a black president also .
A black president can do good in his presidency , just like David Palmer , " said university student Zhu Ming .
Diamonds have been traded and sold for thousands of years but not too many people know how and where they got their start in the jewelry trade .
Diamonds are not only found in wedding rings , necklaces and earrings , but now they 're placed on cellphones , cars and even clothing !
It did n't take long before this gem from the east spread around the world and then became discovered in all parts of the world .
Some of the earliest references to diamonds came from India from their Sanskrit texts which mentioned the budgeoning diamond trade .
Buddhist works dating from the late 3rd century , but mostly the 4th , mentioned the use of diamonds as precious stones .
They also recognized not only their beauty , but the strength in which they had to mark tough metals of all kinds .
India remained the primary source for diamonds for quite some time which led to a very prosperous trade economy throughout the east .
Diamonds eventually spread all over the world , especially in gifts for royalty and very wealthy people .
It took many centuries before India dried up its main resources for diamonds which led to exploration around the world for more mines .
This exploration brought on major diamond mine discoveries in both Brazil and South Africa .
Since then South Africa has become the largest producer of diamonds in the world .
Unfortunately we all have heard about the troubles this trade has brought to the people of Africa , but no matter what it continues onward .
Sometime in the later years of the 15th century , Belgium jewelers , specifically Antwerp , made a name for themselves for developing a new technique to polish and shape the gems was created .
Since then Belgium has become the diamond center of the world with more than 12,000 expert cutters and polishers at work .
You 'll find today that 85 % of the worlds rough diamonds , 50 % of cut diamonds , and 40 % of industrial diamonds are traded in Antwerp year round .
There have been a steady stream of worries about the dangers that Internet use could pose to children , and many have dismissed these worries as overblown parental concern .
The latest group to weigh in is the MacArthur Foundation , best known for handing out the so - called " genius " awards .
The Foundation has funded a sprawling set of studies that looked into how the US youth population is using the Internet , and has just released a document that ties them all together .
Overall , the conclusion is that , at worst , the Internet generally enables the same old social interactions in a new medium ; at its best , however , it enables them to participate in something close to a meritocracy , where their age is n't a concern .
The new report is based on studies that have been performed over the last several years ; the entire list of data sources takes up a large paragraph , but includes over 5,000 observation hours , nearly 700 interviews ( both individual and focus groups ) , diary studies , 10,000 social networking profiles , and more .
The authors take what 's termed an ethnographic approach , eschewing a controlled look at a single facet of behavior in favor of a global picture of how kids are using the Internet .
What they found is that behavior broke down into two general categories : normal social interactions , primarily pursued with other people in the same location , and interest - focused socializing , which tended to occur across wide geographical areas .
In the first case , the social interactions primarily occur with people the kids are already familiar with .
" With these friendship - driven practices , youth are almost always associating with people they already know in their offline lives , " the authors wrote .
" The majority of youth use new media to hang out and extend existing friendships . "
Texting , e-mail , chat , and even online gaming have simply been integrated into the normal social routine .
In fact , the report cites a number of cases where friends in the same room would use some sort of online service to extend the circle of people they could interact with .
For the most part , children are just as protective of this sort of communication as they are with more traditional forms .
Just as they would with a phone call , kids want the parents to stay off the line when they 're socializing .
Although many seem to view the emoticons and radical abbreviations used in online chat as a sign that these venues do n't fully develop social skills , the report says that most online communities have clear social boundaries that kids learn by exploring : " Youth online communication is conducted in a context of public scrutiny and structured by shared norms and a sense of reciprocity . "
In fact , online media seem to provide youth the chance to hone their communications skills ; many kids described how they were able to take as much time as they needed to craft carefully ambiguous messages ( often flirtatious ) for posting at places like Facebook .
But parents are n't being completely frozen out .
Many kids reported using computers ( though not necessarily social tools ) for interactions with their parents .
A number mentioned having set " family gaming " hours each week , and the more artistically inclined worked on family projects , such as editing videos of major events .
This sort of activity blurred into the second major social aspect , which is involvement in interest groups .
" Online groups enable youth to connect to peers who share specialized and niche interests of various kinds , whether that is online gaming , creative writing , video editing , or other artistic endeavors , " the report notes .
Since this social circle is defined by interest , membership tends to be geographically diffuse .
In this environment , adults appear to have a key role , in part because participation is often based on expertise .
" On the interest - driven side , " the authors write , " we saw adult leadership in these groups as central to how standards for expertise and literacy are being defined . "
But , once those standards are set , these communities tend to judge members by them , rather than age .
As such , youth are able to obtain social currency within these groups in a way they were unlikely to manage in the offline realm .
As such , these groups have the potential to significantly enhance the maturation process .
If the report sees significant risks in the explosion of online communications , it 's that the technology gap may enhance all the other gaps that tend to pop up during the teen years .
" A kid who is highly active online , coupled with a parent who is disengaged from these new media , presents the risk of creating an intergenerational wedge , " warn the authors .
Which , of course , is just an extension of a more general warning : you should not only pay attention to what your kids are doing , you should make sure you know how they 're doing it .

Huffington Post :
In his efforts to attack Barack Obama , John McCain appears to have turned to the same political consulting firm that was responsible for spreading vicious smears about the Senator during the 2000 South Carolina GOP primary .
In recent days , the Huffington Post and other outlets have reported on the McCain - funded nationwide robocall campaign charging that Barack Obama " worked closely with " former 60s radical William Ayers .
Another RNC / McCain campaign call states that Obama is a " celebrity " politician who was fundraising in Hollywood during the financial crisis .
BRILLIANT tactics .
Polls show your campaign losing traction as your " pitbull with lipstick " running mate goes negative out on the campaign trail , so what do you do ?
Stay negative , and use the company that perpetuated the " John McCain fathered an illegitimate black baby " story that sank your campaign .
That 's putting country first , Johnny .
But wait , there 's more :
From Conservapedia
The flag of the United States , a nation founded upon principles of personal freedom , has become a symbol of freedom and liberty in a wider sense , despite efforts with mixed results from both conservatives and liberals to hinder the freedom of American citizens
Freedom is the state of being free or at liberty rather than in confinement or slavery or under physical , mental or spiritual restraint .
More specifically , it can mean :
Ability to act freely : a state in which somebody is able to act and live as he or she chooses , without being subject to any undue restraints or restrictions .
The right to practice self - governance and to live under a limited government , rather than being bound by unaccountable bureaucracies , Progressivism , the nanny state , and ultimately despotism .
Release from captivity or slavery : release or rescue from being physically bound , or from being confined , enslaved , captured , or imprisoned .
The condition of being free ; the power to act or speak or think without externally imposed restraints .
Exemption : immunity from an obligation or duty .
Civil liberty , as opposed to subjection to an arbitrary or despotic government .
The right to enjoy all the privileges or special rights of citizenship , membership , etc. , in a community or the like .
The desire for freedom was one of the founding principles of the United States of America thanks to the values of the Founding Fathers .
Today , freedom still stands proudly at the top of a list of aspirations for Americans .
All Americans , no matter their creed or the color of their skin agrees that : " we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all " .
“ Freedom incurs responsibility .
That is why many men fear it .
-- George Bernard Shaw ”
“ Freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit .
-- Ronald Reagan ”
Freedom and equality
Milton Friedman said , " The society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither ; the society that puts freedom before equality will end up with a great measure of both . " [ 1 ]
Freedom & St Paul 's Letter to the Galatians
John Hanneman wrote , " Inner freedom has to do with the very essence of our being . "
This " inner freedom " is the theme of St Paul 's letter to the Galatians .
The Greek words for freedom appear 36 times in the New Testament .
Paul uses them 28 times in his letters , and 10 times in Galatians alone .
The purpose of this letter is clear : to explain how Christians have been released from the law and been given freedom in Christ , how the Spirit has replaced the Torah in our lives .
It is for freedom that Christ has set us free .
Galatians 5:1 ( NIV )
Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ , who gave Himself for our sins , that He might deliver us out of this present evil age , according to the will of God the Father .
Galatians 1:3-4 ( NASB )
Galatians reveals why people struggle so much with law .
It identifies the key ingredient to becoming free , and how people can enjoy freedom in Christ .
Paul writes :
In his word of greeting in the introduction , he says :
Here the apostle defines what he means by freedom .
Following his wish for " grace and peace , " he uses two phrases that capture for Christians the two ways they are free as a result of their relationship with God .
The first phrase is that the Lord Jesus Christ " gave Himself for our sins . "
Here the Apostle is describing our freedom from slavery to the power of sin .
This is the great doctrine of Justification .
We are born into sin , separated from God , but this separation can be overcome because God sent His Son Jesus to die on the cross for our sins .
Through this atonement , all of our sins , past , present , and future , have been paid for - all we need do is put our faith in Christ .
John Stott comments : " The death of Jesus Christ was primarily neither a display of love , nor an example of heroism , but a sacrifice for sin . " [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Misdefinitions of Freedom
In several cases , the left has often co-opted the term " freedom " when in reality they mean socialism , communism , and anarchism .
This sort of misdefining of freedom has its roots with the French Revolution with its slogan of " Liberte , Egalite , Fraternite " as well as their concept of " total liberty " being closer in definition to " total anarchy " .
[ 3 ]
Likewise , because they falsely conflate conservativism and the right as being " fascist " despite fascism being closer to the far left , they create a false dichotomy regarding what they defined as freedom and fascism , and often imply that freedom is often " given up " for what they defined as fascism .
A notable example of this is George Lucas with the Star Wars saga , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] who among other things falsely claimed , owing to his anti-war politics , that going to war at all results in a loss of freedom ( despite America literally being founded in the American War for Independence among others ) . [ 6 ]

TORONTO , Nov 5 ( Reuters ) -
The body of a Canadian teenager who ran away from home after his parents took away his Xbox 360 video game console has been found , the Toronto Star reported on Wednesday .
Police said hunters found the body of Brandon Crisp in a wooded area northeast of Barrie , Ontario , where the 15 - year - old lived with his parents , the Star reported on its Web site .
Details on the cause of death or on whether foul play was suspected were not immediately available .
The boy had been missing since Oct. 13 .
He left home after his parents took away his gaming privileges because of his excessive playing of “ Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , ” a wartime shooting simulator .
The game also lets players compete against each other online and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O , the maker of the Xbox 360 console , had been co-operating with police as they reviewed the list of players with whom Brandon Crisp may have played shortly before he disappeared .
Microsoft also matched an existing C$ 25,000 ( $ 21,500 ) reward for information that would lead to the teenager ’s return .
Yesterday , Slashdot linked to my Age of Conan : How a MMORPG
Dies article as part of a roundup news clip on the state of the Age of Conan union .
Six - thousand hits later , it ’s come to my attention that not everyone agrees with that post - mortem of the game .
In fact , some of you think the game has alot to offer , even if it came running off the starting line like a special olympics hopeful dressed up in Jesse Owens ’s track suit .
I ’m told that quite a bit of progress has been made in patching the bugs that plague the game and with the server merges , players will one again be able to work together in ways that do n’t involve a slow , wary dance with knives out .
I must admit , my discussion of Age of Conan was based on the game that shipped at release , not the one that exists now , since I was concerned mostly with how Funcom managed to shed half their subscriber base once the first billing month ran out .
And you ’re right , there are some good things that are unique to the game , and I would be remiss in my duties as a blood - sucking leech on the game industry ’s jugular if I did n’t share the details of a particularly savory vein .
So in that spirit , I would like to show you the best features in Age of Conan , starting with —

I get a lot of random emails , especially on one AOL account as it is a fairly common word and lots of people tend to mistake me for someone else .
Today I got a special treat in the form of some sort of conservative Christian group that has me confused with one of their own .
And lo and behold , they are warning everyone about Barack Obama , who is both the Anti-Christ and the Second Coming of Hitler .
Seriously :
Hi ,
I received this forward today and it shows me that God is definitely concerned with our country and its elections .
The Obama path seems to follow the Hitler path .
The German children sang songs about Hitler and change .
Today , American children are singing songs about Obama and change .
Also , I believe the verse that is listed , Jer. 1:5 , is a confirmation that God is in this because this is the same Scripture that Apostle Bill spoke of on Saturday , at the kid ’s ministry training , and on Sunday during his teaching .
All we can do is — PRAY , PRAY , PRAY
Pastor Sue Hampton
A Warning from Germany – PLEASE READ .
Is History repeating itself ?
Dear Christian Friend
Please read this .
My mother , a Holocaust Survivor as some of you know , has been saying this all along .
She keeps saying to me “ How can people be so stupid ? ” and as I have watched the world go after Senator Obama , comparing the situation to that time prior to Nazi Germany - I quiver inside .
The woman who wrote this is old but she , like my mother is trying to warn us .
I submit this to you for your discernment .
Take it to the Lord .
In His Love

HYMN TO HITLER
Posted by : Lori Kalner on Wednesday , October 01 , 2008
In Germany , when Hitler came to power , it was a time of terrible financial depression .
Money was worth nothing .
In Germany people lost homes and jobs , just like in the American Depression in the 1930s , which we have read about in Thoene ’s Shiloh books .
In those days , in my homeland , Adolph Hitler was elected to power by promising ‘ Change . ’
He blamed the ‘ Zionists ’ around the world for all our problems .
He told everyone it was greedy Zionist Bankers who had caused every problem we had .
He promised when he was leader , the greedy Zionist bankers would be punished .
The Zionists , he promised , would be wiped off the face of the earth .
So Hitler was elected to power by only 1/3 the popular vote .
A
coalition of other political parties in parliament made him supreme leader .
Then , when he was leader , he disgraced and expelled everyone in parliament who did not go along with him .
Yes .
Change came to my homeland as the new leader promised it would .
The teachers in German schools began to teach the children to sing songs in praise of Hitler .
This was the beginning of the Hitler Youth movement .
It began with praise of the Fuhrer ’s programs on the lips of innocent children .
Hymns in praise of Hitler and his programs were being sung in the schoolrooms and in the playyard .
Little girls and boys joined hands and sang these songs as they walked home from school .
My brother came home and told Papa what was happening at school .
The political hymns of children proclaimed Change was coming to our homeland and the Fuhrer was a leader we could trust .
I will never forget my father ’s face .
Grief and fear .
He knew that the best propaganda of the Nazis was song on the lips of little children .
That evening before he said grace at the dinner table , he placed his hands upon the heads of my brothers and me and prayed the Living Word upon us from Jeremiah 1:4-5 .
‘ Now the Word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
‘ Before I formed you
in the womb I knew you , and before you were born I
consecrated you ; I
appointed you a prophet to The nations . ’
Soon the children ’s songs praising the Fuhrer were heard everywhere on the streets and over the radio .
‘ With our Fuhrer to lead us , we can do it !
We can change the world !’
Soon after that Papa , a pastor , was turned away from visiting elderly parishioners in hospitals .
The people he had come to bring comfort of God ’s Word , were ‘ no longer there . ’
Where had they vanished to while under nationalized health care ?
It became an open secret .
The elderly and sick began to disappear from hospitals feet first as ‘ mercy killing ’ became the policy .
Children with disabilities and those who had Down syndrome were euthanized .
People whispered , ‘ Maybe it is better for them now .
Put them out of misery .
They are no longer suffering .
And , of course , their death is better for the treasury of our nation .
Our taxes no longer must be spent to care for such a burden . ’
And so murder was called mercy .
The government took over private business .
Industry and health care were ‘ nationalized . ’
( NA - ZI means National Socialist Party )
The businesses of all Jews were seized .
( Perhaps you remember our story in Berlin on Krystalnacht in the book Munich Signature )
The world and God ’s word were turned upside down .
Hitler promised the people economic Change ?
Not change .
It was , rather , Lucifer ’s very ancient Delusion leading to Destruction .
What began with the propaganda of children singing a catchy tune ended in the deaths of millions of children .
The reality of what came upon us is so horrible that you in this present generation cannot imagine it .
Our suffering is too great to ever tell in a book or show in a black and white newsreel .
When I spoke to Bodie about some of these things , she wept and said she could not bear to write them .
Perhaps one day she will , but I asked her , ‘ who could bear to read our suffering ? ’
Yet with my last breaths I warn every Christian and Jew now in the name of the Lord ,
Unless your course of the church in America is spiritually changed now , returning to the Lord , there are new horrors yet to come .
I trembled last night when I heard the voices of American children raised in song , praising the name of Obama , the charismatic fellow who claims he is the American Messiah .
Yet I have heard what this man Obama says about abortion and the ‘ mercy killing ’ of tiny babies who are not wanted .
There are so few of us left to warn you .
I have heard that there are 69 million Catholics in America and 70 million Evangelical Christians .
Where are your voices ?
Where is your outrage ?
Where is passion and your vote ?
Do you vote based on an abortionist ’s empty promises and economics ?
Or do you vote according to the Bible ?
Thus says the Lord about every living child still in the womb .
‘ Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , and
before you were born I consecrated you . ’
I have experienced the signs of the politics of Death in my youth .
I see them again now .
Christians !
Unless you stand up now , you will lose your freedom of religion .
In America priests and preachers have already lost their freedom to speak openly from their pulpits of moral danger in political candidates .
They cannot legally instruct you of which candidate holds fast to the precepts of scripture !
American law forbids this freedom of speech to conservative pastors or they will lose their ‘ tax exempt ’ status .
And yet I have heard the words of Obama ’s pastor Damning America !
I have heard the words of Obama damning and mocking all of you in small towns because you ‘ Cling to your religion . ’
But I am a woman whose name is unknown .
My life is recorded as a work of fiction .
I have no fear of reprisal when I speak truth to you from the pages of a book .
( Though the Zion Covenant books are mocked and condemned by the Left in America . )
I am an old woman and will soon go to be with my Lord .
I have no fear for myself , but for all of you and for your children , I tremble .
I tremble at the hymns to a political leaders which your children will sing at school .
( Though even now a hymn or a prayer to God and our Lord Jesus is against the law in public school ! )
Your vote must put a stop to what will come upon America if Barrack Obama is elected .
I pray you will personally heed this warning for the sake of your children and your grandchildren .
Do not be deceived .
The Lord in Jeremiah 1:7 - 8 commands every believer to speak up !
‘ Do not say , ‘ I am only a youth , ’ for to all whom I send you , you shall go , and whatever I command you , you shall speak .
Do not be afraid of them for I am with you , declares the Lord ! ’
I am in Prayer for you , and for the Church !
Spoken to you in the authority of Jesus the Christ , the Name Above All Names ,

As part of the continuing protests in Australia opposing their government ’s weak climate change policies , activists in the Adelaide , the South Australia capital , tossed shoes at a protester dressed as Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd .
[ social_buttons ]
This comes two days after an Iraqi journalist threw both his shoes at President Bush during a press conference in Baghdad .
The waving of dirty soles or tossing of shoes is considered a strong insult in many cultures but up until now it had not been seen in Australia .
While Australia plans a decrease in carbon emissions by only 5 percent by 2020 , the European Union plans a 20 percent decrease and Barack Obama has promised a 17 percent decrease in the United States .
Activists protested all weekend in Australia , including one action where protesters surrounded government buildings with sandbags , to represent the risk of rising sea levels from global warming .

Gender Psychosis
$ 17 , 6x9 , 365 pages
“ GENDER PSYCHOSIS ” is a term used to describe a formally recognized mental illness involving a society - wide break from reality where people get so demented trying to figure out what their genitals mean , NOTHING makes sense anymore .
It ’s a strange new world where men need tampons , get their balls waxed , and breastfeed their kids .
Where “ homophobia ” is a more heinous crime than knowingly infecting someone with HIV .
Where fear of being called “ homophobic ” leads people to pretend that Ellen Degeneres is funny .
Where women falsely accuse men of rape and justify it because of , you know , history and stuff .
Where women bark so loudly from their vaginas that everyone needs earplugs .
Where ugly men blame beautiful women for the fact that ugly men ca n’t get laid .
Where it is established as a scientific fact .
beyond a whisper of doubt , from here to eternity , that being weird does n’t necessarily make you sexy .
Throughout five sections spanning 80 chapters , Jim Goad mocks the reigning sexual pieties simply because they do n't make a lick of sense .
God knows , I have said this so often on these pages that I am getting sick of hearing it myself but , clearly , the message cannot be repeated too many times : why should we go to extreme and terrifying lengths – including debauching the currency – in order to give people money that they might more fairly and cheaply have been allowed to keep in the first place ?
I had a bad day last Friday , but it was an all - too - typical day for America .
It actually started well , on Kau Sai Chau , an island off Hong Kong , where I stood on a rocky hilltop overlooking the South China Sea and talked to my wife back in Maryland , static - free , using a friend ’s Chinese cellphone .
A few hours later , I took off from Hong Kong ’s ultramodern airport after riding out there from downtown on a sleek high - speed train  with wireless connectivity that was so good I was able to surf the Web the whole way on my laptop .
Landing at Kennedy Airport from Hong Kong was , as I ’ve argued before , like going from the Jetsons to the Flintstones .
The ugly , low - ceilinged arrival hall was cramped , and using a luggage cart cost $ 3 .
( Could n’t we at least supply foreign visitors with a free luggage cart , like other major airports in the world ? )
As I looked around at this dingy room , it reminded of somewhere I had been before .
Then I remembered :
It was the luggage hall in the old Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport .
It closed in 1998 .
The next day I went to Penn Station , where the escalators down to the tracks are so narrow that they seem to have been designed before suitcases were invented .
The disgusting track - side platforms apparently have not been cleaned since World War II .
I took the Acela , America ’s sorry excuse for a bullet train , from New York to Washington .
Along the way , I tried to use my cellphone to conduct an interview and my conversation was interrupted by three dropped calls within one 15 - minute span .
All I could think to myself was :
If we ’re so smart , why are other people living so much better than us ?
What has become of our infrastructure , which is so crucial to productivity ?
Back home , I was greeted by the news that General Motors was being bailed out  that ’s the G.M. that Fortune magazine just noted “ lost more than $ 72 billion in the past four years , and yet you can count on one hand the number of executives who have been reassigned or lost their job . ”

More than a century ago , Christian fundamentalists invented cereal to promote a healthy lifestyle free of sin .
Little did they know , their creation would eventually be used to promote everything from radio and cartoons to Mr. T and tooth decay .
Meat Is Murder ( on the Colon )
During the early 19th century , most Americans subsisted on a diet of pork , whiskey , and coffee .
It was hell on the bowels , and to many Christian fundamentalists , hell on the soul , too .
They believed that constipation was God 's punishment for eating meat .
The diet was also blamed for fueling lust and laziness .
To rid America of these vices , religious zealots spearheaded the country 's first vegetarian movement .
In 1863 , one member of this group , Dr. James Jackson , invented Granula , America 's first ready - to - eat , grain - based breakfast product .
Better known as cereal , Jackson 's rock - hard breakfast bricks offered consumers a sin-free meat alternative that aimed to clear both conscience and bowels .
While Jackson 's innovation did n't appeal to the masses , it did catch the attention of Dr. John Kellogg .
A renowned surgeon and health guru , Kellogg had famously transformed the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan into one of America 's hottest retreats .
Socialites from the Rockefellers to the Roosevelts flocked to " The San "  to receive Kellogg 's unorthodox treatments .
But shock - therapy sessions and machine - powered enemas were n't the only items on the agenda .
Kellogg also stressed such newfangled ideas as exercise and proper nutrition .
It was n't long before he started serving bran biscuits similar to those of Dr. Jackson — only now with the Kellogg name on them .
To avoid a lawsuit , he changed the name of the cereal by one letter , dubbing it " Granola . " 
By 1889 , The San was selling 2 tons of granola a week , despite the fact that it was barely edible .
The success inspired Dr. Kellogg and his brother , W.K. , to produce more - palatable fare .
After six years of experimentation , a kitchen mishap by W.K. yielded the breakfast staple known as cereal flakes .
Making Red Blood Redder
In many ways , the cereal flake is the perfect consumer product .
It 's easy to produce , easy to sell , and surprisingly lucrative .
To this day , cereal comes with an eye - popping profit margin of 50 percent .
These merits became clear to Charles Post , a failed suspender salesman who moved to Battle Creek in 1895 .
Post began selling knock - off versions of Kellogg 's products with a twist of his own — advertising .
At the time , advertising was associated with snake - oil salesmen and con artists .
But Post , who had a background in sales , did n't mind drizzling a little snake oil on his product .
He published pamphlets with titles such as " The Road To Wellville "  and claimed his cereal , Grape - Nuts , could cure appendicitis , improve one 's IQ , and even " make red blood redder . " 
By 1903 , he was clearing $ 1 million a year .
Across town , Dr. Kellogg refused to sully The San 's reputation with heathen advertising , and his profits suffered as a result .
W.K. , however , had no such qualms and set out to emulate Post .
In his first national campaign , he told women to " Wink at your grocer , and see what you get . " 
( Answer : a free box of Kellogg 's Corn Flakes . )
Within a year , he 'd sold 1 million cases of cereal .
With the leading cereal makers embracing such unabashed hucksterism , it was clear that cereal 's connection to its fundamentalist roots had come to an end .
Thinking Outside the Box
All across America , the eyes of investors lit up with dollar signs , and would - be cereal barons descended on Battle Creek like locusts .
By 1911 , 107 brands of corn flakes were being made in Battle Creek alone .
But the cereal business had one major drawback — there was little substantive difference between brands .
To stand out from the crowd , manufacturers realized that they had to focus more on the outside of the box than on what was inside .
Some tried decorating their products with adjectives , creating names like University Brand Daintily Crisped Flaked Corn .
Others competed to appear the healthiest .
Tryabita , for example , was infused with celery flavor because , well , it sounded healthy .
But the real winner was a cereal called Force .
Its mascot , Sunny Jim , was a strutting , top - hatted gentleman who became so popular in newspapers and magazines that other cereal makers rushed to create their own mascots .
For a cereal called Elijah 's Manna , Charles Post even tried putting a picture of the prophet on the label .
Although the product was eventually pulled , one industry ground rule had been established : Every box needs a character .
Before long , cereal makers had an insatiable appetite for finding the right mascot , regardless of the cost .
During the Depression , Post Toasties decided to use cartoon animals on its boxes and paid its cartoonist $ 1.5 million in the first year .
That artist was Walt Disney , and he used the earnings to build the Disney empire .
The Children Are the Future
Cereal 's total reliance on advertising meant that it was essential for companies to keep up with new forms of media .
Quaker Oats , for example , hitched its sales to the rise of radio in the 1920s by giving away more than 1 million radios as part of a promotion .
Cereal companies were also quick to buy up radio stations and produce radio shows .
For the most part , they churned out dramas and gossip shows aimed at housewives .
But a radical shift in demographics came in 1936 , thanks to a boy named Skippy .
A Dennis the Menace type who frequently interrupted his adventures to extol the virtues of Wheaties , Skippy was the first cereal character directly marketed to children .
As it turned out , kids ate him up , and cereal producers learned an important lesson : Children are suckers .
The flood of kid-friendly , cereal - shilling characters that followed reads like a Who 's Who of American iconography , including the Lone Ranger , Dick Tracy , and Buck Rogers .
By the 1960s , cereal advertisers were devoting 90 percent of their budgets to reaching children .
In the process of targeting the young , cereal companies also realized that kids do n't care about their colons .
They want sugar .
Lots of sugar .
In 1939 , a Philadelphia heater salesman named Jim Rex created the first sugared cereal , called Ranger Joe Popped Wheat Honnies .
Ironically , he designed the cereal to minimize the amount of sugar children consumed .
He reasoned that if he lightly presweetened his product , kids would n't add more sugar on top .
He was wrong , and his good intentions were lost on bigger companies .
After Ranger Joe sales skyrocketed , manufacturers started producing cereals such as Sugar Smacks , which contained a shocking 56 percent sugar .
How did cereal companies reconcile this with their original commitment to the health movement ?
Taking a page out of Post 's playbook , they declared that sugar was n't bad for you because it gave you the fuel you needed to start your day .
With trusted radio personalities extolling the " energy - giving "  virtues of cereal , impressionable kids and their frazzled parents rushed to stores .
TV Nation
Television took advertising for sugar cereals to a new level , and the master of the new medium was an ad man named Leo Burnett .
He invented TV programs specifically designed to entertain children and sell Kellogg 's products .
Much like Skippy a decade before , Burnett 's characters would turn to the screen in the middle of a show and pitch the merits of a particular brand .
There was nothing subtle about it .
Howdy Doody , Roy Rogers , Andy Griffith , Rin Tin Tin , the Beverly Hillbillies , Yogi Bear , and Fred Flintstone all became television icons because they were good at selling cereal .
Also at Burnett 's urging , cereal companies invested heavily in early television technology .
( They still do ; cereal is the second - largest advertiser on television today , behind automobiles . )
The financial backing let them shape the medium to suit their needs — namely , adding color .
Burnett was one of the earliest believers in motivational psychology and understood that colors appealed to kids and moms subliminally .
When color TV became a reality , he persuaded Kellogg to use anthropomorphized cartoon animals as mascots .
He thought animation would make for better , more colorful commercials .
The first mascot they produced was Tony the Tiger , whose meteoric success was followed by hundreds of other cartoon icons .
Burnett 's advertising style was so effective that cereal sales continued to rise every year , unlike most products at the grocery store .
After a while , parents and child psychologists became concerned that the ads were a little too effective .
In the late 1960s , consumer advocates claimed that using cartoon characters to target children was overly manipulative , if not unethical .
Eventually , in 1990 , they forced Congress to pass a law banning TV characters from pitching directly to children in the middle of a show .
Protective measures aside , cereal had strayed far from its wholesome origins .
While Dr. Jackson 's dream of displacing pork chops from the breakfast table had become a reality , his cereal was n't what it used to be .
Bitten by the fangs of consumerism , Granula had transformed into Count Chocula in the course of a century .

BAGHDAD 
The Iraqi television reporter who flung his shoes at President Bush during a news conference is scheduled to appear before a judge Wednesday , the first step in a potential criminal prosecution against him , members of the reporter ’s family said .
At the appearance , a criminal court judge will decide whether there is sufficient cause to try the reporter , Muntader al - Zaidi , 29 , who has become a folk hero in much of the Arab world for his actions against the president in Baghdad on Sunday evening .
Throwing a shoe at a person is considered a particularly severe insult and a sign of disrespect in the Arab world .
Mr. Zaidi , who has been held by the authorities since Sunday , has not yet been charged .
But Iraqi criminal lawyers not involved in the case say there are several possible charges he could face , including initiating an aggressive act against the head of a foreign state on an official visit , with a potential punishment of seven years in prison .

The environmental disaster first disclosed a few days ago is growing much bigger than authorities described :
A coal ash spill in eastern Tennessee that experts were already calling the largest environmental disaster of its kind in the United States is more than three times larger than initially estimated , according to an updated survey by the Tennessee Valley Authority .
Officials at the authority initially said that about 1.7 million cubic yards of wet coal ash had spilled when the earthen retaining wall of an ash pond at the Kingston Fossil Plant , about 40 miles west of Knoxville , gave way on Monday .
But on Thursday they released the results of an aerial survey that showed the actual amount was 5.4 million cubic yards , or enough to flood more than 3,000 acres one foot deep .
The amount now said to have been spilled is larger than the amount the authority initially said was in the pond , 2.6 million cubic yards .
But do n't worry , we do n't know for sure that it will kill the victims :
Mr. Moulton said on Friday that the levels exceeded safety limits for drinking water , but that both metals were filtered out by water treatment processes .
Mercury and arsenic , he said , were “ barely detectable ” in the samples .
The ash pond was adjacent to the Emory River and near a residential area , where three houses were destroyed by the tide of muddy ash .
Water sampled several miles downstream from the spill was safe to drink , but its iron and manganese content exceeded the secondary drinking water standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency , which govern taste and odor but not potential health effects , Mr. Moulton said .
Neither the authority nor the E.P.A. has released the results of tests of soil or the ash itself .
Authority officials have said that the ash is not harmful , and the authority has not warned residents of potential dangers , though federal studies show that coal ash can contain dangerous levels of heavy metals and carcinogens .
“ You ’re not going to be endangered by touching the ash material , ” said Barbara Martocci , a spokeswoman for the T.V.A .
“ You ’d have to eat it .
You have to get it in your body . ”
The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation also released a statement saying there was no indication of risk unless the ash was ingested .
" Ingested . "
You mean , as in " inhaled " ?
Because it seems to me it will be almost impossible for residents to avoid breathing it in .
Oh well .
Thanks , BushCo !
I hope the new Democratic Congress and the corporate media continue to do their bit for more " clean coal " !
( CNN ) -- Former presidential candidate Ron Paul was interviewed Friday morning by CNN anchor John Roberts on " American Morning . "
Rep. Ron Paul says that what really needs regulating is the Federal Reserve .
Paul , a Republican from Texas , spoke from his home in Clute , Texas .
The topic of the discussion was the current economic crisis and the Capitol Hill testimony Thursday of former Fed chief Alan Greenspan .
John Roberts , CNN anchor :
Up there on the Hill , Alan Greenspan was basically saying , " Oops , I missed this one , sorry about it , " but he was optimistic for the future .
Congressman Paul , do you even listen to him anymore ?
Rep. Ron Paul : I have to because somebody like you might ask me a question about him .
No , I do n't really listen in the sense that I 'm going to get a lot of new information .
I used to listen to him when he was writing back in the '60s because he agreed with free market economics and no respect for the Federal Reserve .
Lately , though , I mean , he 's been part of -- and right now he 's really gotten bad because what he was saying yesterday was that the only place where he might have made a mistake is he did n't advocate more regulations .
Well , if you 're a true free market person it is n't the lack of regulations .
Trying to regulate and improve on the conditions that the government creates .
I mean we created this problem .
The Federal Reserve created this .
The Community Reinvestment
Act created it .
The FDIC created it .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created it .
It was all seen there but now he says if we could have only had more regulations ...
Roberts : Right .
Paul : ... we could have salvaged this clogged system .
Roberts :
Well , you believe that markets can be or should be self - regulating ?
Paul :
Well , to a degree , but the government does have a responsibility to deal with fraud , but the monetary system is fraudulent .
Instead of perpetuating fraud in the monetary system they should be dealing with real fraud .
But just regulating prices -- that 's what they 're doing now , they 're trying to regulate prices and set prices for these assets that has n't -- have no value .
So , no , that 's not the kind of regulation we want , but there is certainly a role for regulations .
We should be regulating the Federal Reserve system is what we really ought to be regulating .
Roberts :
Well , regardless of what we talk about this morning , the Dow is going to go off a cliff again today so let me turn to politics if I could .
A lot of people have said , particularly because of the economy , this is a bad year to be a Republican .
John McCain behind in the national polls , seems to be behind in the battleground states as well .
He 's got a long and difficult road if he hopes to win the Oval Office .
If Republicans really take a beating , Congressman Paul , on November the 4th , where does that leave the Republican brand ?
Paul :
Well , I think they 're in big trouble , but I think I mentioned that a year or so ago , that they 've sort of lost their way .
No , it 's going to be a lot worse , but you have to say that the markets are n't being reassured about the obvious victory that 's going to occur .
Then they said , " Oh , my , you know , we 're going to have Obama and a Democratic Congress stronger than ever so things are going to get a lot better . "
They have n't discounted that yet .
The country is in a mess regardless , but I think the Republican Party really in a mess because ...
Roberts : I mean , I mean how ...
Paul : ... they 'll probably lose a fair amount of seats again .
Roberts :
How bad a blow could it be and how long might it take the party to rebuild ?
Paul :
You know , I was first elected -- I first ran in 1974 , and I think there were about 145 members of Congress , Republicans , then .
It took 20 years .
So that is the case .
But , you know , I think it 's secondary to what the Congress is doing .
If both parties have bad ideas , it does n't matter a whole lot .
Right now ...
Roberts :
And I wanted to ask you about ...
Paul : ... I think both parties follow those ideas .
Roberts :
You 're on the ballot in a couple of states .
You 're on the ballot in Louisiana .
You 're also on the ballot in Montana , and in Montana you were polling 4 percent there .
That 's exactly the difference between Senator McCain and Barack Obama with Barack Obama on top .
I mean you could be the spoiler here and take Montana away from Senator McCain , and I know that some Republicans , friendly to you , say hey , get off the ballot in Montana .
You tried , you could n't .
How are you going to feel if because of you McCain loses Montana ?
Paul :
Well , I think it will be a pretty far stretch if McCain loses the election that they 're going to blame me .
I have n't been campaigning in Montana .
People who are supporting out there are spontaneous .
They 're enthusiastic .
They do n't like either candidate .
So I do n't think the person whose name they picked is the one that does the spoiling .
I think there 's something else that is wrong .
Maybe it's the flawed policies of both candidates .
Roberts : Congressman Paul , it 's always good to see you .
Thanks for joining us this morning .
We 'll check back with you again soon .
Paul :
Thank you .
Good to be with you .
KINGSTON , Jamaica ( AP ) 
Heavily armed gangs wrestling for control of two communities near Jamaica 's capital have forced more than 200 people from their homes , police said Wednesday .
Families packed mattresses , refrigerators and other belongings into trucks and cars as they fled this week , forming a funeral - like procession out of their neighborhoods .
Local school attendance has plummeted from about 600 to 200 students , said Natalie Neita - Headley , a parliament member who represents the area .
Gang takeovers are fairly common in impoverished communities across Jamaica .
In recent years , the groups have ousted residents from east Kingston as well as from rural parishes .
Police said they are looking for the leaders of the One Order and Clansman gangs , known mostly for extortion .
The gangs have threatened residents and accused them of being police informers , police Supt .
Assan Thompson said .
But Monsignor Richard Albert , chairman of a local crime - prevention committee , said the gang leaders have denied threatening anyone .
Albert instead blamed the takeovers on " rogue elements who want to throw people out of their homes so they can put in their own and collect rent . "
The most recently targeted communities are located near Spanish Town — about 14 miles ( 23 kilometers ) west of Kingston — where gangs have been fighting for control for nearly 10 years .
Several days ago , a separate gang burned down a tenement in Kingston and left more than 40 people homeless .
Most of the victims had lived there for almost 60 years .

Darcs and the HTTP library
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE -----
Hash : SHA512
So , a while ago I mentioned that it'd be nice to scrap the libwww / curl / other - web - binding bindings since they made the configuration and building and documentation more complex , and led to not a few end - user problems , and we had no control or influence with them .
The obvious alternative was Haskell 's HTTP library , but aside from issues with proxies and SSH , one major objection was performance .
As everyone knows , HTTP was [ Char ] - based and consequently horribly slow and and memory - inefficient , and it would 've hurt badly Darcs 's performance .
Which really does n't need any hurting .
So I 'm happy to announce that raw performance , at least , no longer seems to be a problem !
Just a few days ago HTTP - 4000.0.0 was released to Hackage http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HTTP
and its summary reads : " A library for client - side HTTP , version 2 .
Rewrite of existing HTTP package to allow overloaded representation of HTTP request bodies and responses .
Provides three such instances : lazy and strict ByteString , along with the good old String .
Inspired in part by Jonas Aadahl et al's work on ByteString 'ifying HTTP a couple of years ago .
Git repository available at http://code.galois.com/HTTPbis.git "
( It does n't seem to 've been announced , but dons mentioned it to me on Reddit . )
Naturally , one wonders how fast this rewrite is .
Fortunately , the homepage http://www.haskell.org/http/
provides an example ' get.hs ' .
I installed the new HTTP , compiled get.hs with it , and ran a bulk download with it : gwern at craft :33333 ~ > time wget -q
http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/current/dist/ghc-6.7.20070401-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2 && time ./ get http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/current/dist/ghc-6.7.20070401-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2 > ghc.bz2 && diff ghc - 6.7.20070401-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2 ghc.bz2 && du -h ghc - 6.7.20070401-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2 ghc.bz2 && rm ghc - 6.7.20070401-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2 ghc.bz2 =wget -q 0.06s user 0.43s system 2 % cpu 23.032 total ./ get > ghc.bz2 3.10s user 0.67s system 15 % cpu 24.518 total 22 M ghc-6.7.20070401-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2 22 M ghc.bz2
Note that in this iteration ' get ' is only 1 second slower .
The files are identical , as diff reports , and they are n't empty files either , they are the right size , as du reports .
On some runs , get is faster and on other runs , wget is faster .
There seems to be a weak trend of get being a few seconds slower .
I will note in its defense that it's not writing to a file like wget , but printing to stdout ; this could be slowing it down .
I do n't recommend trying to switch to HTTP right now , because as I said , I have no idea whether HTTP can handle Darcs 's SSH and proxy needs .
But this is worth noting for the future .

When I told my grandmother a few years ago about my fascination with this newfangled computer network called the Internet , she had a discouraging question : " Is n't that just for watching pornography ? "
Now I can safely answer her : " Only sometimes . "
That 's because a study by Internet research firm Hitwise found that Web traffic in the U.K. to social networks has overtaken adult websites .
The same phenomenon occurred in the U.S. in the middle of 2007 , but social and sexual sites continue to battle it out , frequently overtaking one another on a monthly basis .
Will the same be true of the Brits , whose porn use took a back seat to social media last October and continued that trend for the rest of the year ?
The study comes after an array of news reports about the porn industry 's vulnerability to the slumping economy .
This seems to be another fork in its side .
But then again , social media are n't immune either -- just look at the various Web start - ups , including Digg and Flickr , that recently announced job cuts .
The Hitwise report gives some interesting statistics on website demographics .
For example , the majority of adult website frequenters are male .
Wait , that 's nothing new .
But on the flip side , almost 55 % of social - media and forum users are female .
Could the trend stem from more women taking to the Net and gravitating to the social networks rather than the male - dominated , seedy underbelly ?
Just something to Twitter about .

Get that philosopher look
It 's World Philosophy Day - an opportunity to contemplate one 's very existence and whether computer monitors really exist , says David Bain .
People expect different things of philosophers .
Some expect us to be sages .
When these people meet me , my heart sinks , since I know theirs is about to .
Others expect us to have a steady supply of aphorisms up our sleeves , such as that love is never having to say you 're sorry ( something no partner of mine has ever been persuaded of ) .
They too are disappointed when they meet me , especially when I say that the glass so beloved by optimists and pessimists is both half full and half empty .
Others expect of us not sagacity , but madness , or at least outlandish beliefs .
And here , it must be said , some philosophers really have delivered .
Thales believed that everything is made of water , for example , while Pythagoras avoided eating beans because he believed they have souls .
Eccentric hair :
The mark of a modern - day French philosopher As Princeton philosopher David Lewis once said : " When philosophers follow where argument leads , too often they are led to doctrines indistinguishable from sheer lunacy . "
But beware .
this is the same David Lewis who believed that , for each of the ways things might have been but are not , there is a world at which they are that way , eg a world at which your counterpart is spending today with the world 's greatest sex god or goddess .
And , reassuring though it can be to think that at least that counterpart is having fun , even those impressed with Lewis 's towering intellect have often found these other worlds of his hard to swallow .
Not all philosophers pin such striking colours to the mast , but there is a good reason why people associate the subject with surprising views .
Philosophy involves standing back and thinking - intensely and rigorously - about aspects of our lives that are at once ordinary and fundamental .
And when the surface is scratched , what you find below is extraordinary - or , rather , extraordinarily difficult to make good , clear sense of .
Lying in wait are arguments that lead to , if not sheer lunacy , then bullets we 're loathe to bite .
So , with World Philosophy Day upon us , here are some pesky arguments to apply your minds to : 1 . SHOULD WE KILL HEALTHY PEOPLE FOR THEIR ORGANS ?
Suppose Bill is a healthy man without family or loved ones .
Would it be ok painlessly to kill him if his organs would save five people , one of whom needs a heart , another a kidney , and so on ?
If not , why not ?
Consider another case : you and six others are kidnapped , and the kidnapper somehow persuades you that if you shoot dead one of the other hostages , he will set the remaining five free , whereas if you do not , he will shoot all six .
( Either way , he 'll release you . )
If in this case you should kill one to save five , why not in the previous , organs case ?
If in this case too you have qualms , consider yet another : you 're in the cab of a runaway tram and see five people tied to the track ahead .
You have the option of sending the tram on to the track forking off to the left , on which only one person is tied .
Surely you should send the tram left , killing one to save five .
But then why not kill Bill ?
2 . ARE YOU THE SAME PERSON WHO STARTED READING THIS ARTICLE ?
Consider a photo of someone you think is you eight years ago .
What makes that person you ?
You might say he she was composed of the same cells as you now .
But most of your cells are replaced every seven years .
You might instead say you 're an organism , a particular human being , and that organisms can survive cell replacement - this oak being the same tree as the sapling I planted last year .
But are you really an entire human being ?
If surgeons swapped George Bush 's brain for yours , surely the Bush look - alike , recovering from the operation in the White House , would be you .
Hence it is tempting to say that you are a human brain , not a human being .
But why the brain and not the spleen ?
Presumably because the brain supports your mental states , eg your hopes , fears , beliefs , values , and memories .
But then it looks like it 's actually those mental states that count , not the brain supporting them .
So the view is that even if the surgeons did n't implant your brain in Bush 's skull , but merely scanned it , wiped it , and then imprinted its states on to Bush 's pre-wiped brain , the Bush look - alike recovering in the White House would again be you .
But the view faces a problem : what if surgeons imprinted your mental states on two pre-wiped brains : George Bush 's and Gordon Brown's ?
Would you be in the White House or in Downing Street ?
There 's nothing on which to base a sensible choice .
Yet one person cannot be in two places at once .
In the end , then , no attempt to make sense of your continued existence over time works .
You are not the person who started reading this article .
3 . IS THAT REALLY A COMPUTER SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU ?
What reason do you have to believe there 's a computer screen in front of you ?
Presumably that you see it , or seem to .
But our senses occasionally mislead us .
A straight stick half - submerged in water sometimes look bent ; two equally long lines sometimes look different lengths .
Are things always as they seem ?
The Muller - Lyer illusion indicates not But this , you might reply , does n't show that the senses cannot provide good reasons for beliefs about the world .
By analogy , even an imperfect barometer can give you good reason to believe it 's about to rain .
Before relying on the barometer , after all , you might independently check it by going outside to see whether it tends to rain when the barometer indicates that it will .
You establish that the barometer is right 99 % of the time .
After that , surely , its readings can be good reasons to believe it will rain .
Perhaps so , but the analogy fails .
For you cannot independently check your senses .
You cannot jump outside of the experiences they provide to check they 're generally reliable .
So your senses give you no reason at all to believe that there is a computer screen in front of you . "
4 . DID YOU REALLY CHOOSE TO READ THIS ARTICLE ?
Suppose that Fred existed shortly after the Big Bang .
He had unlimited intelligence and memory , and knew all the scientific laws governing the universe and all the properties of every particle that then existed .
Thus equipped , billions of years ago , he could have worked out that , eventually , planet Earth would come to exist , that you would too , and that right now you would be reading this article .
After all , even back then he could have worked out all the facts about the location and state of every particle that now exists .
And once those facts are fixed , so is the fact that you are now reading this article .
No one 's denying you chose to read this .
But your choice had causes ( certain events in your brain , for example ) , which in turn had causes , and so on right back to the Big Bang .
So your reading this was predictable by Fred long before you existed .
Once you came along , it was already far too late for you to do anything about it .
Now , of course , Fred did n't really exist , so he did n't really predict your every move .
But the point is : he could have .
You might object that modern physics tells us that there is a certain amount of fundamental randomness in the universe , and that this would have upset Fred 's predictions .
But is this reassuring ?
Notice that , in ordinary life , it is precisely when people act unpredictably that we sometimes question whether they have acted freely and responsibly .
So freewill begins to look incompatible both with causal determination and with randomness .
None of us , then , ever do anything freely and responsibly . "
IN CONCLUSION
Let me be clear : the point is absolutely not that you or I must bite these bullets .
Some philosophers have a taste for bullets ; but few would accept all the conclusions above and many would accept none .
But the point , when you reject a conclusion , is to diagnose where the argument for it goes wrong .
Doing this in philosophy goes hand - in - hand with the constructive side of our subject , with providing sane , rigorous , and illuminating accounts of central aspects of our existence : freewill , morality , justice , beauty , consciousness , knowledge , truth , meaning , and so on .
Rarely does this allow us to put everything back where we found it .
There are some surprises , some bullets that have to be bitten ; sometimes it 's a matter simply of deciding which .
But even when our commonsense conceptions survive more or less intact , understanding is deepened .
As TS Eliot once wrote : " the end of our exploring , Will be to arrive where we started , And know the place for the first time . "

It is just that fucked up .
All I know is he loves a fat girl .
Every job has its quirks .
That ’s what Kirk reassuringly told himself on his first day of work after meeting the company ’s most egregious quirk , The Colonel .
Kirk was n’t quite sure if the impeccably - dressed man ’s gruff introduction – which solely consisted of looking Kirk up , then down , then up again , and scoffing “ that ’s a pretty sad excuse for a Double Windsor ” – was in jest or contempt , so he stuck with a the more palatable label of quirky .
Fortunately , by the time Kirk realized that deranged was much more appropriate than quirky , he knew that he ’d never have to personally work with The Colonel : the chain - of - command simply would n’t allow for it .
Having spent the larger part of his life in the military , The Colonel faithfully chose the same rigid structure for his civilian venture , a technology start - up that developed real - time logistics tracking systems .
The “ high - discipline ” company worked well for the first year or so , as The Colonel had only hired ex-military employees and had only solicited to the military .
However , when it came time to expand into the private industry , a few concessions were needed to attract the less - disciplined civilian talent : health benefits , sixty - minute lunch breaks , casual Fridays , etc .
Of course , the company ’s core values – chain - of - command , strict rules , top - of - the - line accommodations for executives , and so on – would never change .
A Good Problem to Have
When Kirk joined , the company was in the middle of “ a good problem to have . ”
Months earlier , the development team had created a prototype to demonstrate the company ’s capabilities to prospective clients .
Their prototype was pretty impressive for the time : using inexpensive GPS units , standard cell phones , and off - the - shelf server hardware , their system would track “ field assets ” such as delivery trucks in real - time and display the asset on an interactive map .
As for their problem :
The Colonel and his sales team told prospects that the prototype was their core product , and managed to sell a handful of licenses for it .
Since putting more soldiers on the ground apparently solves all military problems , The Colonel employed the same tactic and nearly doubled the staff .
With a company of fifty ( half of which were developers ) , they were bound to successfully deliver the product they had sold .
But Still a Problem
As it turns out , developing a complex , customizable geographic information system that interfaces with an amalgam of less - than - ideal equipment is kinda hard .
There are things like specs to consider , user interfaces to develop , equipment drivers to create , and so on .
Add in to the mix aggressive deadlines , angry customers , and large refund checks to cut , and it creates something far worse than a “ good ” problem .
The immediate result of all this is one seriously angry colonel .
The Colonel knew very little about software development , software , and computers in general .
In fact , he did n’t even have a computer in his office ; his secretary was responsible for printing out his email and typing up his dictated replies .
What he did know , however , was that computer programs are made up of computer code , computer code is typed up by programmers , and when programmers are n’t typing code , they ’re not making computer programs .
To ensure that programmers were focused on programming , The Colonel cut out a lot of the unnecessary parts of the software development process like system design and testing .
While the quit - wasting - time - and - type - in - your - computer - code approach certainly helped get more code written , there were a few side effects .
Namely , their software did n’t quite meet the requirements and it was pretty buggy .
The Colonels ’ new stop - writing - all - this - buggy - computer - code approach did n’t seem to help , either .
A Bad Problem To Have
After six long months of non -stop coding , development finally hacked together a system that could pass as the product sold to their clients .
It kinda , sorta , somewhat tracked a variety of asset classes across a map , and usually displayed the results correctly .
That is , assuming one was using the exact configuration of cell phones and GPS units that the development team had .
Unfortunately , the first client took the “ compatible with any receiver ” feature literally , and bought completely different GPS units .
While their system read the GPS data in , the coordinate system used was completely different , which meant that incoming GPS data piled up in the system ’s processing queue .
Changing the input filter on the cell phone fixed the incoming data , but there was still a mountain of bad data to deal with ; and the customer really wanted the data fixed .
The Colonel was furious when he learned about this major glitch , and insisted that the problem be addressed immediately .
There was just one caveat : since computer code caused the problem in the first place , adding more computer code would likely exacerbate the problem .
They needed a solution that did n’t call for any programming to deal with the bad data .
Since the developers had absolutely no idea how to solve the problem without coding , The Colonel offered his solution : covert the data by hand , row by row .
And he was n’t joking ; in fact , The Colonel never joked .
The two developers assigned to documentation duty were relieved of that job and given an Excel spreadsheet and a desk calculator .
For nearly a week , the pair worked sixteen hours a piece , each day , typing in data from a print - off and calculating the results by hand .
This effort did result in a fixed data file for the client , but also left two casualties : one of the developers quit , the other had simply lost all will to live .
Things went a bit downhill from there .
Despite having two somewhat successful field installs , the company was not having any luck selling to other prospects .
As the weeks passed , The Colonel was becoming more and more agitated that business was not picking up .
So , he did the only logical thing and clamped down on all the slacking employees .
Cracking Down
The harbinger of many further disciplinary emails came after three employees had an impromptu meeting for a few minutes in an unoccupied conference room .
ATTN EMPLOYEES : Effective immediately , no conference room may be used without first reserving the room on - line .
We have a system for a reason and want to make sure the rooms are utilized appropriately .
There are no exceptions to this policy .
DICTATED BUT NOT READ , The Colonel
The next reminder came a day later after The Colonel spotted someone walking around with a cup of coffee and having a few words with someone past the time where everyone should be dutifully at their desks , slaving away :
ATTN EMPLOYEES : Effective immediately , we will now be enforcing tardiness and desk policies .
In addition , we will also be tightening up some of the attendance rules at the office : 1 . WORKING HOURS .
There shall be no more " thirty minute flex time " .
You are expected to be at your desk no later than at 8:00 AM and leave no earlier than 5:00 PM .
2 . BREAKS .
You have two fifteen - minute breaks and a half - hour lunch break .
While you can combine your breaks , you may no longer " split " them and take five minutes , five minutes , etc. 3 . DESK -
When you are at your desk , you are expected to be working .
DICTATED BUT NOT READ , The Colonel
The Colonel clarified these rules the next day .
ATTN EMPLOYEES :
There appears to be a misunderstanding of the attendance rules .
You are to be at your desk , working , by 8:00 AM and are expected to work up at least 5:00 PM .
This means your computer must be turned on before 8:00 AM , and you need to pack your items up after 5:00 PM .
DICTATED BUT NOT READ , The Colonel
To no one ’s surprise , the crackdown did n’t quite help morale or increase business in the least .
It did lower expenses quite a bit ; by the time this next email was sent out , twelve of the staff had resigned :
ATTN EMPLOYEES : Effective immediately , we will no longer have " casual Friday . "
We do n't stop working on Friday and should therefore dress for work .
DICTATED BUT NOT READ , The Colonel
Over the next two weeks , another eight employees quit .
By this point , The Colonel implemented some brilliant countermeasures .
ATTN EMPLOYEES : Effective immediately , breaks may no longer be " combined " .
There have been far too many employees abusing the break / lunch policy and taking a full hour for lunch , each and every day .
Morning Break may be taken between 9:00 AM and 10:30 AM .
Lunch Break may be taken between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM .
Afternoon Break may be taken between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM .
DICTATED BUT NOT READ , The Colonel
Obviously , through all these crackdowns , Kirk had turned looking for a new job into a full - time endeavor .
Unlike so many other employees , he was n’t quite comfortable just up and quitting without another job in the bag .
Of course , everyone has their limits .
As it turned out , Kirk ’s limit was this personalized email from The Colonel himself .
ATTN KIRK : Earlier this week , you had brought in several large personal items and placed them in your workspace .
You told your manager that the purpose of this was so that your items " did not get too hot during the day " in your car .
Please note that we are not a storage facility .
Your workspace needs to be clean and orderly ; large personal items are not acceptable .
There are no exceptions , even if you need to store items just for just one day .
DICTATED BUT NOT READ , The Colonel
Kirk resigned shortly after that .
While he tried his best to forget about The Colonel and the GIS system he had worked on , he verified that , four years later , they have yet to release their product .
