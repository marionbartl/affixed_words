No , really .
He totally did ( via Feministing ) .
In an interview with…idk , some dude , he said , and I quote , “ she is a direct counterpoint to the liberal feminist agenda for America ” to justify picking her to be his running mate .
Watch it .
Which is rather rich , of course , as one of Palin ’s major selling points ( at least nominally ) has been how she gives hope to women that we can be powerful too , and she is n’t afraid to stand up for what she believes in , and oh yeah – she explicitly calls herself a feminist ( about 0:20 in the video below ) .
Now , I and most other feminists would strongly disagree with her on that conclusion , but really .
A pseudo - feminist who at least pretends to care about women ’s equality and rights has got to be better for McCain and Palin ’s image than admitting she is a pawn to alienate free - thinking women , right ?
Oy .
The best part is , of course , McCain ’s use of the term “ liberal feminist ” .
I do not think he knows what that term means ; it ’s not one I ’ve ever heard used in a derogatory sense before .
I ’ve heard feminazi , and radical feminist , and fat hairy - legged atheist lesbian castrating cunt feminist , but never liberal feminist by anyone except people who actually knew something about the feminist movement .
Since we know that , for McCain , the mere mention of the word “ liberal ” is enough to make him froth at the mouth , I ’m sure he only meant it in a pejorative sense ; i.e. in his book , the term “ liberal feminist ” is greater than or equal to all of the former ones in terms of sheer insult power .
But , oh John .
You are such an idiot .
I was trying to think of the best way to tell you this , when I thought of a scene from one of my favorite movies , A Fish Called Wanda .
Luckily , YouTube came to the rescue , and I was able to find a clip of that precise moment .
No , John .
The London Underground is not a political movement , Aristotle was not Belgian , and liberal feminism is n’t actually a cabal of women just dying to cut off your penis .
Those are all mistakes .
I looked them up .
Courtesy of ( and according to ) Wikipedia , here is a brief summary of the basic tenets of liberal feminism :
Liberal feminism , also known as “ mainstream feminism , ” asserts the equality of men and women through political and legal reform .
It is an individualistic form of feminism and theory , which focuses on women ’s ability to show and maintain their equality through their own actions and choices .
Liberal feminism looks at the personal interactions of men and women as the starting ground from which to transform society into a more gender - equitable place .
According to liberal feminists , all women are capable of asserting their ability to achieve equality , therefore it is possible for change to happen without altering the structure of society .
These are mostly things that you kinda , sorta , claim to stand for .
I mean , individualistic ?
Conservative ideal .
Show and maintain equality through their own actions and choices ?
Conservative - tacular !
Just looking at this paragraph , this is something you should wholeheartedly agree with , being a not - sexist but still conservative person .
Well ! , you say .
Perhaps this is just a very clever way of hiding the fact that liberal feminists eat babies for Sunday brunch !
So , let ’s look at that gosh - darn liberal feminist agenda ( again copying and pasting from Wikipedia , because they do an okay job and I do n’t feel like culling through 50 websites to find the same information ) :
Priority Constitutional Equality through the Constitutional Equality Amendment
Reproductive Freedom Issues / Abortion rights
Ending Violence Against Women
Promoting Diversity / Ending Racism
Lesbian Rights
Economic Justice Also important Affirmative Action
Disability Rights
Ecofeminism
Family
Fighting the Right
Global Feminism
Health Immigration
Judicial Nominations
Legislation
Marriage Equality
Media Activism
Mothers ’ Economic Rights
Working for Peace Social Security
Supreme Court
Title IX / Education
Welfare
Women - Friendly Workplace
Women in the Military
Young Feminist Programs
Hmm – let ’s focus on “ priority ” .
Constitutional equality – you might not be in favor of another Constitutional amendment , period , particularly one guaranteeing rights , so I could see you not digging that .
Reproductive freedom – well , we know how you feel on abortion ( at least since having been anointed the GOP ’s Last Hope and thus renouncing any moderate views you may have had on the subject ) , and also know that you are completely unfamiliar with other reproductive rights issues such as contraception ( several times in the past year , reporters have asked him about abstinence - only sex-ed , contraceptive use preventing the spread of HIV , and birth - control access , and each time he admitted he was clueless ) .
Ending violence against women ?
Idk , did you vote for the VAWA ?
Your running mate does n’t care about it , that ’s for damn sure .
Promoting diversity / ending racism – well , nominally yes , but you ’re not a fan of the whole affirmative action thing , and love that racism is getting you votes , so I can see that point .
Lesbian rights – ha !
I ’m sure every time you think of “ gay marriage ” that you think of two dudes , and we know how much that squicks you out .
Two actual , full - blooded , hardcore lesbians that want to get married ?
Keep this in mind :
Yeah , that ’s what I thought .
What ’s that last priority ?
Economic justice ?
I ’m just gonna let that slide , because … come on , people .
So , upon closer inspection , I can see why the “ liberal feminist agenda ” is something you oppose .
But here ’s the thing .
All of those things , on that list , that you have spoken against ?
Those are good things .
And I ’m not saying that to try to convert you , because quite honestly , I think there ’s no hope .
But what are you going to do when people look up the “ liberal feminist agenda ” and see that it all sounds , well , rather reasonable ?
How can you speak out of both sides of your mouth at once : say that Palin ’s nomination is “ empowering women ” or some other drivel like that , and then at the same time admit that you do n’t care about even basic human rights ?
Because the thing is , as I mentioned , liberal feminism is kind of like Feminism Lite .
It ’s Feminism 101 .
It ’s feminism with training wheels .
It ’s the kind of feminism that most compassionate , moderately - educated , common - sense people should be able to agree with , were the mere word “ feminist ” not a smear .
It is probably the most common brand of feminism embraced by people in this country .
It is ( largely ) sex-positive : not condemnatory of pornography , prostitution , or BDSM .
It has its flaws and shortcomings , but not in a way that would irk a true social conservative ( of course , a true social conservative would be irked by other parts of it ) .
It is the kind of feminist your next - door neighbor probably is ( unless you live in San Francisco ) , or that nice guy down the road with three kids and a “ Kerry / Edwards ” sticker on his car .
If you really wanted something that a lot of people could disagree with , why not anarcha - feminism ?
Why not separatist feminism ?
Why not use the quintessential rallying cry of the wounded right : radical feminism ?
Yes , it is an actual thing , not just a phrase to trigger Rush Limbaugh ’s cremaster reflex .
Radical feminists want to disrupt society and overthrow the patriarchy .
Separatist feminists do n’t even support heterosexual relationships , for Pete ’s sake !
They would be so easy to malign and use to scare people !
But you did n’t use them .
You used liberal feminists .
That ideology alone was enough to make you squirm .
No , I have n’t gone off the deep end .
I do n’t actually think that John McCain is intimately familiar with the subtypes and nuances of the different “ feminisms ” , even insofar as anybody can be an expert on the subject .
But the fact remains that he is diametrically opposed to even the basic , bread - and - butter , tenets of feminism .
Things like “ men and women have an equal right to determine their own lives ” .
And while by “ liberal feminist ” he may have meant something other than “ mainstream , fairly non-controversial feminist ” , the fact remains that he IS opposed to the latter , as well as the former .
Vociferously .
It ’s just amazing that he had the wherewithal to publicly state it , and furthermore cite it as a major factor .
The dude JUST SAID that he picked Palin as a VP candidate to piss off people who care about equal rights .
I mean , the fact that he has no shame or hesitation in stating that , shows how he thinks most of the country feels .
He may be right , at least in terms of how the word “ feminism ” is portrayed in the media .
But I do n’t think he ’s right about the ideas .
We do actually have a progressive majority in this country , largely aligned with liberal feminist views ( via Tom Paine ) .
Only 29 % of the country , at the time of the linked poll , supported overturning Roe v. Wade ( a cornerstone of social conservatism ) .
The linked report also shows a steady increase in people ’s belief in women ’s equality and that of homosexuals , and a decrease in opposition to the latter .
Republicans still manage to win votes because people are not evenly distributed , geographically ; there are , of course , lots of areas where 90 % of the people believe in overturning Roe v. Wade and 20 % believe in women ’s equality .
Republicans are also no stranger to negative campaigning and using wedge issues to gain votes .
But that does n’t seem to be working as well this year , and the Democrats have a large majority in electoral votes .
Many former red states are looking distinctly blue .
The death knell of the Republican party is already tolling .
Now McCain has alienated at least a chunk of the conservative women , the pseudo - feminist ones who were maligning most other feminists for not being gaga over Palin .
He just spanked her whole shtick about “ female power ” and “ equality ” and , yes , “ feminism ” .
Now that he ’s publicly stated his own sexist agenda – could his anti-feminism be the final nail in his coffin ?
Let ’s hope so .
Note :
In this post , I was not trying to cast aspersions on any particular “ brand ” of feminism ; I know that , despite certain differences , what all feminisms have in common is a desire to right the wrongs towards women of the past , present , and future .
We just differ in the methodology .

Pelosi hopes lame duck Republicans back new stimulus package David Edwards and Muriel Kane

In a statement lauding Barack Obama 's victory in Tuesday 's election , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also praised the " unifying " tone in speeches by Senator John McCain and outgoing President George W. Bush .
Pelosi promised that Democrats in the House will " work closely with our new president for a vision for America ... and ... that we will do so in a strong bipartisan way , with civility in our debate and fiscal responsibility in our budgeting . "
Pelosi also announced that because the economy cannot wait for January , " we have a stimulus package on the table that I hope the Republicans in the Senate will allow to be taken up in a lame duck session . "
The package would seek to create jobs " in a newer , greener way , " extend unemployment benefits , provide emergency food assistance , and assist the states in meeting their own responsibilities .
According to Democratic aides who spoke to CNN , the proposed package will cost " somewhat north of $ 100 billion " and perhaps as much as $ 150 billion .
However , Palosi has said she would be willing to accept passage of the $ 61 billion package that Senate Republicans blocked in September .

Try : this
Well , let me begin by saying this has nothing to do with motorcycles .
So , I had a vision a couple of months ago .
It took my by surprise , and many of my family and friends told me it could n't be done .
But I do n't believe in impossibility .
" What was my vision ? " you ask .
A pizza with the depth and character of a lasagna .
A lasagna that you could pick up with your hand and eat like a pizza .
A match made in heaven ?
Perhaps .
After letting the idea percolate for a couple of months I finally hashed out a solid design .
Summary
8 >9 " lasagna noodles ( 2.5 - 3 " width )
Pizza dough ( made with flour yeast and salt )
Sausages ( Chicken herb )
Meat tomato sauce
Low fat ricotta
Skim Mozzerella
Spinach
Mushrooms
Garlic
Toppings to taste
Put it all together in a kind of deep dish pizza + lasagna arrangement ( being careful to lay noodles orthogonal to one another , cook at 375 F for 40 minute let sit for 10 minutes and enjoy .
So , last night I decided to dig into the implementation of the beast .
I did n't get everything right ; I forgot to let it sit before enjoying , I did n't use nearly enough tomato sauce , and I probably used too much garlic .
But obviously someone familiar with both pizza and lasagna can tweak to their tastes .
Detailed instructions ( a short tale of kitchen misadventures ) :
So , to begin , you need to make your pizza dough .
I followed a generic pizza dough recipe for a pair of thick crusted 14 inch pizzas and cut it in half .
You 'll note that minus the crust you need a 3/8 " thickness circle of dough approximately 15.5 " in diameter .
Beyond that you 're making crust .
After making the dough ( seriously grab a cookbook if you want details , I used whole wheat flower ) , you have to get the crust prebaked .
Massively lubricate your pan .
Set rolled dough in the pie tin in the appropriate shape , put some ( also lubricated ) aluminum foil over it .
I used spray olive oil for my lubrication .
I 'd imagine butter or something like that could be substituted .
Then , to hold the corners of the pie down my wife recommended adding red beans on top of the foil which I did .
Oven at 350F .
Get your water boiling in appropriate noodle fashion .
When it 's boiling and your oven is preheated , set the timer to 13 - 15 minutes and put your noodles in the water .
And put your pizza crust in the oven to prebake .
Now , make your lasagna mix .
I just used a food processor and tossed in appropriate ricotta / garlic / sausage / spinach .
I 'm sure any other lasagna recipe would work here .
When your noodles are ready , drain them and pull the crust from the oven as close to simultaneously as you can .
Now you need to stamp your noodles .
Stamping is a relatively simple process .
You get an identical pan to the one you 're using .
Put it on top of your noodles and use it as a cookie cutter .
You 'll note that after this process is completed your noodles will fit into your pan ( without crust ) .
When your stamping is complete you just need to get on with the making lasagna portion of the project .
Lay your layers following a standard recipe .
Limit yourself to two layers of noodles though to prevent carbs from overwhelming your dish .
Remember to lay them in opposite directions .
When you complete your layering your final goal is to make the top as pizza - like as possible .
Put down a final layer of tomato sauce , then a layer of mozzerella thick enough to completely hide the noodleyness of the dish .
Pop it in the oven ( now at 375 F ) , wait 40 minutes .
Take it out .
Wait 10 minutes , and enjoy .
Note , consistency at 10 minutes will be borderline hand hold - able , and at 20 it should be more solid .
Of course leftovers are truly something spectacular and provide a remarkable view of the composition of the creation .
Conclusion
I feel like a broke the sound barrier .
Rachael Ray apparently has something she calls a Pizzagna .
It has neither the shape or structure of a pizza nor the noodles or layers of lasagna .
It is simply a scrambled mash of noodles with some lasagna ingredients and some pizza ingredients .
This should not be confused with that .
Mark Papermaster , a former IBM executive who 's replacing retiring iPod chief Tony Fadell , came to Apple with some heavy baggage — namely a one - year no -compete clause that IBM said he was violating by working at Apple .
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karashas sided with IBM for the time being in their lawsuit , ordering Papermaster to " immediately cease his employment with Apple Inc. until further order of this court . "
Papermaster 's argument is that Apple actually does n't compete with IBM , since " IBM focuses on high - performance business systems such as information technology infrastructure , servers and information storage products , and operating systems software , " while " Apple , on the other hand , is in the business of designing , manufacturing and marketing consumer - oriented hardware and related products . "
More to the point , he says that " I do not recall a single instance of Apple being described as a competitor of IBM during my entire tenure at IBM . "
Interestingly , he says he wo n't be directly involved with Apple 's recently acquired chipmaker PA Semi ( since running them would be a clear violation of the IBM agreement ) , though that seems like a bit of stretch , since they 're supposedly making chips for the iPod and iPhone .
Apple is complying with the court order , but says they " are confident that Mark Papermaster will be able to ultimately join Apple when this dust settles . "

The navy says it is determined to protect ships in a key trade route Commandos operating from a warship of the Indian navy have prevented an attempt by pirates to hijack a ship in the Gulf of Aden , the navy says .
It said that an armed helicopter with marine commandos stopped " pirates from boarding and hijacking an Indian merchant vessel " on Monday .
The vessel was heading eastwards after going through the Suez Canal .
The Indian navy last month sent its warships to the Gulf of Aden on an anti-piracy patrol .
The BBC's Alan Johnston in Delhi says it is the first time that it has taken action of this kind since it joined several foreign navies to patrol the often lawless waters off the coast of Somalia .
The navy was ordered to protect Indian flagships travelling between Oman and Yemen .
In Monday 's incident they were responding to an emergency call made by a cargo vessel .
" This timely and successful intervention led to the pirates aborting their attempt , " the navy said in a statement .
The navy has been conducting " anti-piracy patrols " in the Gulf of Aden since 23 October , because a " sizeable portion of our country 's trade " flows through it , the navy statement said .
" There has been a quantum increase in the number of piracy attacks in this region over the last few months .
" These patrols are carried out in co-ordination with the Ministry of Shipping and are intended to protect Indian merchant vessels from being attacked by pirates and also to instil confidence in our large seafaring community . "
Our correspondent says that the threat posed by pirates off the Somali coast has been the subject of increasing concern in India and the rest of the world .
More than 80 ships have been hijacked off Somalia this year .
The issue was highlighted by the capture of a ship crewed mainly by Indians two months ago .
The wife of the captain - who is still being held - has waged a high - profile media campaign to press for his release .

NEW YORK - Merrill Lynch & Co. chief executive John Thain and two former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. colleagues he recruited may reap almost $ 200 million for their year running Merrill if they leave or are given lesser roles after Bank of America Corp. buys the brokerage .
Thain , who got a $ 15 million bonus when hired in December , stands to get an additional $ 11 million in accelerated stock payouts if he does n't stay after the deal , compensation consultant Graef Crystal said .
Trading chief Thomas Montag , 51 , who joined in August , may get $ 76 million , including bonus and accelerated awards .
Strategy head Peter Kraus , 56 , was given $ 95 million , including bonus and stock awards , to replace a Goldman package he had to forfeit , people familiar with the matter said .
While Thain managed to negotiate a merger even as rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sank into bankruptcy , shareholders may resent the executive payouts .
Merrill 's stock returned more than 13 percent a year from 2000 through 2006 .
Since Dec. 1 of last year ,
Thain 's first day , the shares have fallen more than 60 percent , as write - downs on devalued mortgage holdings eroded the company 's financial results .
" Investors will definitely be disappointed , " said Richard Bove , of Ladenburg Thalmann & Co . " Thain 's claim to fame here is that he kept them from going bankrupt . "
Merrill spokesman William Halldin declined to comment .
Merrill shares plunged 36 percent last week as investors speculated the New York - based firm might suffer the fate of Lehman .
Since the deal was disclosed early Monday , they have climbed 17 percent .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Like many other elderly Americans , Edie Stark has been hard hit by the meltdown in U.S. financial markets .
She is 84 and has been worried a lot lately about outliving her savings .
Edie Stark , 84 , a retiree who lives in an upscale retirement complex , said she has been hard hit by the meltdown in U.S. financial markets during an interview in Miami November 6 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Joe Skipper
A retired nurse , Stark is a prime example of what financial planners coldly call “ longevity risk , ” a reference to the need for a secure income and lasting savings at a time when growing numbers of Americans can live for 30 years in retirement .
Life expectancy in the United States has already reached a record high of 77.8 years , up from 70.8 in 1970 , according to the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics .
Fueled by continuing health gains , the U.S. Census Bureau projects life expectancy in the world ’s wealthiest country will reach 79.2 years by 2015 .
Stark said she and her husband had seen more than 50 percent of their retirement assets wiped out since the stock market started tanking several months ago .
She still plans to see out the end of her days with her 88 - year - old husband at the Palace , an upscale retirement complex where they live on the palm - fringed southern outskirts of Miami .
She acknowledges that may not be possible , however , as her life savings vanish .
“ I have fixed expenses so I can add it up and tell you how many years we can live unless the market comes up , ” said Stark .
“ We wanted to have money to leave our children .
That ’s not possible anymore , ” said Stark , whose husband suffers from dementia and is cared for in an assisted living facility at the Palace .
Dorie Ryder , 89 , a retired school teacher and neighbor of Stark ’s at the Palace , said she had lost about 25 percent of her assets to the recent stock market downturn .
She has fond memories of better times when she and her husband lived just a block away from the home of former President Richard Nixon on nearby Key Biscayne .
But Ryder said she is now contemplating a move into a Miami - area apartment , where she ’d live alone but pay less rent than the $ 3,500 she forks out monthly at the Palace .
“ I just do the best I can and I ’m worried , ” said Ryder , who has a small pension .
“ I do n’t know how long I ’ll be able to stay here . ”
Coping with financial fears is not unique to the elderly , especially at a time of record home foreclosure filings , crumbling real estate values and rising unemployment .
It can be especially painful for the elderly , however , even for those who are still a long way from being destitute .
“ Money anxiety when you ’re older is just different than when you are young .
You do n’t have a chance to recover , ” said Teresa Ghilarducci , a retirement expert and professor of economic policy analysis at New York ’s New School for Social Research .
DYING OF WORRY
“ I predict that this spike in anxiety around the security of money is actually going to lead to more sickness , ” she added .
“ People are going to die of worry . ”
Experts say millions of middle - and upper - class retirees across the country face mounting insecurity due to exposure to stocks instead of “ safe money ” investments like short - term bonds and fixed annuities .
Many were lured into the equities because they offered a chance to double their money from 2003 to 2008 .
Others face foreclosures because they over - borrowed against their homes before the U.S. housing meltdown .
“ Probably half our clients are retired and yes , we have a lot of very worried , concerned clients , ” said Peggy Cabaniss , president of HC Financial Advisors in Lafayette , California .
“ Their leading concerns are , No. 1 , that they ’re going to run out of money , ” she said .
Like the American Psychological Association , Cabaniss said she tells her clients not to get caught up in blow - by - blow media reports about swooning markets and dour economic news .
“ The way things are presented it sort of sounds like and feels like the end of the world , ” she said .
But avoiding bad news is tough when it affects life savings and people ’s retirement security hangs in the balance .
Ghilarducci and Alicia Munnell , director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College , say the erosion of retirement savings due to stock declines is something that should be triggering alarm bells .
The United States is the only developed , industrialized and democratic country in the world where traditional pension plans with a nearly guaranteed stream of income are being replaced by 401k plans , in which retirees bear many risks from volatile market investments , Ghilarducci said .
“ It ’s disastrous , ” she said , referring to the outlook for retiring or soon - to - be retired “ baby boomers . ”
“ Late boomers will fare far worse than their parents and grandparents in terms of replacing their income in retirement , mainly because of the erosion in the employer pension system , ” Ghilarducci said .
“ It highlights the flaws in our retirement income system , ” said Munnell .
“ The idea that we have people increasingly and solely dependent on accounts which vary with the ups and downs of the stock market just does n’t make for a very sensible retirement arrangement , ” she added .
“ My view is that it was always going to take the real suffering of a whole cohort before anybody was going to be willing to do anything to improve the retirement system .
And I think the financial crisis may have accelerated that process . ”
Driving yesterday past the gasoline station where I usually buy fuel , I noticed that the price of the lowest grade of unleaded — the one I buy — was down to $ 2.09 per gallon .
Registering this perception as a little piece of good news in an unhappy world , I drove on .
Later , however , I began to mull over the altogether unsurprising fact that , to my knowledge , Congress has held no televised hearings to look into the tremendous fall in fuel prices since last summer , when I paid more than $ 4.00 per gallon for a while .
Oil company executives have not been summoned to Washington so that they can be applauded for sloughing off the greed that ( allegedly ) impelled them to charge so much for their products in June and July .
No member of Congress has apologized for calling the businessmen there last spring to berate and threaten them while angrily mouthing sentiments that can only be described as idiotic .
These congressional show trials , which are held whenever gasoline prices rise substantially , always adhere to a tight protocol and a traditional script for each of the actors .
Members of Congress huff and puff , demand to know how much the executives are earning , threaten new taxes and controls , and suggest ominously that the government may have to take over the companies unless something gives .
Company executives do not laugh at these antics or dismiss them as the foolishness they are , but rather respond in solemn seriousness , explaining how changes in supply and demand have brought about the price increases .
Yeah , yeah , supply and demand .
Is n’t that just the sort of excuse you ’d expect a robber baron , caught red - handed , to invoke ?
It ’s no wonder the public always believes that conspiracies among the companies explain the high prices , and hence that the public supports government action to whip the conspirators into line or to impose price controls .
It ’s a perfect match : ignorant ( and immoral ) members of the public and ignorant ( and immoral ) members of Congress to represent them in Washington .
We are witnessing democracy in action .
As H. L. Mencken said , “ votes are collared under democracy , not by talking sense but by talking nonsense . ”
I first became aware of this moronic charade back in the 1970s , during the first “ energy crisis . ”
William E. Simon , whom Nixon appointed to be the “ energy czar ” at that time , later gave a hilarious account of it in his book A Time for Truth ( 1978 ) .
Simon described “ the demogoguery that is often unleashed at these hearings and is a gross caricature of the process of seeking information . ”
He illustrated his claim by reproducing the transcript of an exchange he had at one of the hearings with Congressman Joe McDade , who was certainly among the most corrupt members in the history of the corrupt House of Representatives .
Read it ( on pp. 62 - 64 ) and weep .
“ I knew , ” wrote Simon , “ I was faced with an economic illiterate or with a political hypocrisy so great that it stunned me . ”
I challenge you , however , to read the transcript of the hearings the House conducted to bully the oil company executives as recently as last spring and reach a conclusion any different from Simon’s .
In his book , Simon noted “ the compulsion in a dominantly liberal Congress to believe any rumor , however baseless , from any source , however absurd , which suggested that the shortage was ‘ unreal , ’ a product of a vicious oil company plot , and the compulsion to ‘ demagogue ’ whenever the red light of the television camera lit up . ”
The more things change . . . .
In 2000 , McCain touted a Social Security privatization scheme , not unlike the proposal Bush made in 2005 .
Eight years later , his campaign decided to go in a different direction .
At least , that was the idea .
Sen. McCain ’s 2008 presidential campaign
Web site takes a different view , proposing “ supplementing ” the existing full Social Security system with personally managed accounts .
Such accounts would n’t substitute for guaranteed payments , and they would n’t be financed by diverting a portion of Social Security payroll taxes .
Asked about the apparent change in position in the interview , Sen. McCain said he had n’t made one .
“ I ’m totally in favor of personal savings accounts , ” he says .
When reminded that his Web site says something different , he says he will change the Web site .
( As of Sunday night , he had n’t . )
“ As part of Social Security reform , I believe that private savings accounts are a part of it — along the lines that President Bush proposed . ”
Oh my .
It ’s one thing for McCain to flip - flop from his position from 2000 ; that was eight years ago .
But for the candidate to reject his own campaign ’s policy position — after a year of campaigning — is just remarkable .
And for McCain to embrace Bush ’s biggest domestic policy debacle is even harder to understand .
Does the senator not remember the public 's reaction in 2005 ?
Hintergrund der Ausschreibung
Im Frühjahr diesen Jahres hat der Deutsche Bundestag die Erstellung einer neuen Online - Petitions - Website ausgeschrieben ( „ Softwareprojekt Öffentliche Petition “ ) .
Den Bürgern soll damit die Möglichkeit gegeben werden , online Eingaben an das Parlament bzw .
den Petitionsausschuss zu richten .
Zuvor gab es einen Pilotversuch in Zusammenarbeit mit dem schottischen Parlament und der Napier Universität Edinburgh , der in diesem Jahr auslief .
Die Ausschreibung legte
Wert auf gute Bedienbarkeit der Endanwendung , Qualitätssicherung , saubere Dokumentation , Performance , Sicherheit , flexibles Design mit Trennung von Code und Repräsentation , Barrierefreiheit sowie die Verwendung von Komponenten , für die keine zusätzlichen Lizenzkosten nötig sind ( richtig : es geht hier nicht um den Gedanken Freier Software , sondern nur um die Kosten ) .
Das Ergebnis sollte ursprünglich zum 1 .
Oktober vorliegen und wurde am 13 .
und 14 .
Oktober in Betrieb genommen .
Vor der Umsetzung musste der Auftragnehmer ( also der Bieter , der den Zuschlag erhalten hat ) ein „ abnahmefähiges Pflichtenheft auf Basis des [ vorgegebenen ] Lastenheftes “ erstellen .
Vor der endgültigen Beauftragung war die Abnahme des Pflichtenheftes vorgesehen .
Ein Angebot musste aus drei Teilen bestehen : Festpreis für das Pflichtenheft , Festpreis für die Umsetzung und ein fester Stundensatz für die Pflege über die nächsten 48 Monate , begrenzt auf insgesamt 66 Tage .
Zusätzlich musste ein Fragebogen ausgefüllt und die Grundzüge der vorgeschlagenen Implementation beschrieben werden .
Die Umsetzung kommt von der araneaNET GmbH aus Potsdam .
Diese hat das System auf Basis des Simple Machines Forum ( SMF ) 1.1.x aufgesetzt , einer typischen Bulletin - Board - Software , die PHP 4.1 und MySQL 3.23 ( oder neuer ) verwendet : also im Kern veraltete und problematische Technik .
Technische Details dazu folgen weiter unten .
Umsetzung und Anforderungen
Die Umsetzung erfüllt in einigen Punkten nicht die Anforderungen der Ausscheibung bzw .
des Lastenheftes oder gesetzliche Vorgaben :
Die Bedienung bzw .
Usability ist nicht auf die Herausforderungen von Online - Petitionen abgestimmt , ein schlüssiges Bedienkonzept ist nicht zu erkennen .
Design - Anpassungen sind aufgrund der verwendeten Foren - Software kompliziert , die Gestaltung wird vernachlässigt .
Daraus ergeben sich hohe mögliche Folgekosten .
Die Anforderungen an die Barrierefreiheit werden nicht erfüllt , für Sehbehinderte ist die Webseite nahezu unbedienbar .
Forums - Diskussionen werden nicht optimal strukturiert angezeigt .
Forums - Beiträge können nicht bewertet werden .
Die Datenschutz - Bestimmungen des Telemediengesetzes werden nicht eingehalten .
Die Software , auf der die Petitions - Webseite basiert , ist für den privaten Hobbynutzer ausgelegt .
Sie hat daher möglichst niedrige Systemanforderungen , damit sie auch auf günstigem Webspace lauffähig ist .
Dabei bleiben professionelle Anforderungen oft auf der Strecke , zum Beispiel Datenbank - Transaktionen zur Datensicherheit .
Es sind ( teilweise schwerwiegende ) Sicherheitslücken aufgetreten .
Beim verwendeten Simple Machines Forum wurde am 4 .
November eine kritische Sicherheitslücke bekannt , was die Entwickler der Petitionswebseite aber nicht zum notwendigen schnellen Update der Software veranlasste : erst am 12 .
November fand die Aktualisierung statt !
Es werden nicht alle Anforderungen des BSI - Grundschutz - Kataloges eingehalten .
Die Mehrzahl der Probleme tritt aufgrund des verwendeten Simple Machines Forum auf .
Für den normalen Nutzer am auffälligsten ist dabei die suboptimale Usability ( Benutzungsfreundlichkeit , Gebrauchstauglichkeit ) .
Usability
Die Online - Petitions - Website des Deutschen Bundestages basiert auf einer Board - Software , wie sie häufig bei privat betriebenen Foren benutzt wird .
Und so sieht sie auch aus .
Abgesehen vom ersten optischen Eindruck bringen die Vorgaben und Einschränkungen der Software eine Reihe von Problemen bei der Usability mit .
Die spezifischen Erfordernisse einer Online - Petitions - Website und eines dazugehörigen politischen Diskussionsforums werden kaum beachtet , Sonderfunktionen irgendwie hineingebastelt .
Man kann sich das in etwa so vorstellen : Angenommen der Bundestag bräuchte ein neues Parlamentsgebäude und schreibt die Erstellung eines Gebäudes mit Plenarsaal und Zuschauertribüne aus .
Eine Baufirma hat zufälligerweise noch ein altes und schon lange leerstehendes Opernhaus herumstehen und bietet dieses besonders günstig an : die Zuschauertribüne bräuchte nur etwas Kosmetik und die Bühne könnte zusammen mit dem Orchestergraben zum Plenarsaal umgebaut werden .
Dass die vorhandene und nicht ohne großen Aufwand änderbare Audio - Verkabelung dafür sorgt , dass ohne Tricks nur ein einziges Mikrofon angeschlossen werden kann , das sagt die Baufirma nicht dazu , sondern engagiert lieber einen Zauberer , der eine Illusion von mehreren Mikrofonen schafft .
Es ist offensichtlich , dass ein solches Gebäude im Vergleich zum Reichstag ein vollkommen ungeeignetes Parlamentsgebäude wäre .
Aber im Internet werden solche Notlösungen nicht nur akzeptiert , sondern auch noch gefeiert .
Dabei verlangt die Ausschreibung explizit eine vorbildliche Usability :
Der Hauptfokus des neuen Systems soll auf einem schlüssigen , logischen und durchgängigen Bedienkonzept und damit auf einer niedrigen Partizipationsschwelle des Nutzers liegen .
Aus den Zielbestimmungen vom Lastenheft Softwareprojekt „ Öffentliche Petition “ , Seite 7
Es gäbe einige Möglichkeiten , eine solche Anforderung umzusetzen .
Stattdessen wird der Nutzer an vielen Stellen mit einer Wüste aus Texten und Tabellen konfrontiert , moderne Gestaltungselemente und eine niederschwellige Benutzerregistrierung fehlen .
Man sieht , dass es sich um ein mit der Zeit gewachsenes System handelt , dass für einen ganz anderen Zweck erstellt wurde .
Einige der auffälligsten Usability - Probleme sind :
Startseite erklärt nichts , dem Nutzer wird ein „ Willkommen Gast .
Bitte einloggen oder registrieren .
Haben Sie Ihre Aktivierungs E- Mail übersehen ? “ entgegen geschleudert .
Bei niedrigen Auflösungen wird die Hälfte des Bildschirmes mit Kopfzeile , Login - Formular und einer Mini-Navigation verbraucht .
Der Rest mit der Überschrift der folgenden Tabelle .
Hat das überhaupt mal jemand in 800x600 ausprobiert ?
Startseite erklärt nichts , dem Nutzer wird ein „ Willkommen Gast .
Bitte einloggen oder registrieren .
Haben Sie Ihre Aktivierungs E- Mail übersehen ? “ entgegen geschleudert .
Bei niedrigen Auflösungen wird die Hälfte des Bildschirmes mit Kopfzeile , Login - Formular und einer Mini-Navigation verbraucht .
Der Rest mit der Überschrift der folgenden Tabelle .
Hat das überhaupt mal jemand in 800x600 ausprobiert ?
Der Link zum Einreichen einer neuen Petition sieht wie eine der Navigation übergeordnete Überschrift aus .
Link - Farben sind nicht konsistent .
Die Website bietet eine Brotkrumennavigation , die aber aufgrund ihrer Gestaltung sehr verwirrend ist .
Wie die meisten Boards bietet auch das Simple Machines Forum ( SMF ) nur eine flache Ansicht der Kommentare , ohne Anzeige von Diskussionssträngen ( Threads ) .
Für eine sinnvolle politische Diskussion ist aber die Verschachtelung der Forums - Beiträge und Darstellung der Diskussionsstränge wünschenswert .
Dabei werden Antworten zu einem Beitrag diesem zugehörig dargestellt , wodurch die Diskussion inhaltlich geordnet wird .
Dies wird so auch bei vielen stark frequentierten Diskussionsplattformen gemacht und ist keine exotische sondern eine übliche ( wenn auch technisch schwieriger zu realisierende ) Darstellungsweise .
Bei der verwendeten linearen Darstellung werden die Beiträge ausschließlich nach der Zeit des Eingangs eines Beitrages sortiert .
Dadurch wird die Diskussionsführung umständlich , jeder Teilnehmer ist gezwungen , darzustellen und ggf .
zu zitieren , auf welchen Beitrag er sich bezieht .
Das erschwert zwangsläuﬁg nicht nur die Benutzung des Forums sondern hat auch negativen Einfluss auf die Qualität der Diskussionen .
Dabei steht im Lastenheft unter Punkt 3.1.8 die Anforderung L-ÖP - F - B -250 , die durchaus so zu interpretieren ist , dass eine verschachtelte Darstellung der Diskussionsstränge zu erfolgen hat : Der Benutzer kann die Darstellung des Diskussionsstrangs in folgender Weise beeinflussen : Alle Beiträge und ihre Antworten ausklappen .
Alle Beiträge und ihre Antworten einklappen .
Einzelne Beiträge ausklappen .
Einzelne Beiträge einklappen .
Vorgeben , wie viele Beiträge pro Bildschirmseite angezeigt werden sollen .
Aus Punkt 3 Forum , Anforderung L-ÖP - F - B-250 vom Lastenheft Softwareprojekt „ Öffentliche Petition “ , Seite 11 Diese Vorgaben werden nicht erfüllt , da das Simple Machines Forum keine Thread - Darstellung unterstützt und auch keine entsprechende Funktionalität nachgereicht wurde .
Ein Board mit linearer Kommentarauflistung ist dann einigermaßen gut nutzbar , wenn eine kleine Gruppe von Leuten regelmäßig mitliest .
Es ist aber nicht gut zur politischen Diskussion unter vielen und immer wieder neuen Teilnehmern geeignet .
Fehlermeldungen sind inkonsistent in Bezug auf Position , Gestaltung und Text .
Die zum Anmelden nötigen Nutzernamen werden automatisch generiert und sind nicht änderbar .
Die Nutzer müssen sich mit Namen wie „ Nutzer123 “ , „ Nutzer 124 “ und so weiter einloggen .
Es sind zwar frei wählbare Pseudonyme vorgesehen .
Diese kann der Benutzer bei der Registrierung aber nicht angeben :
Es wird einfach der automatisch generierte Nutzername gewählt .
Änderungen sind nur manuell in den Profileinstellungen möglich .
An manchen Stellen wird anstatt des Pseudonyms immer der Nutzername angezeigt .
Die Navigation ist nicht konsistent , nicht eingängig und nicht immer klar verständlich .
Der Seitentitel ist nicht aussagekräftig und es gibt keine Haupt - Überschriften .
Die altbackene Optik und die Bedienung machen keinen Spaß , motivieren die Nutzer nicht zur Partizipation und stärken die Akzeptanz des Online - Petitionsverfahrens nicht .
Dafür bietet die ePetitions - Webseite eine andere bemerkenswerte Funktion : Die Benutzer können ein Bild auswählen , das neben ihren Forenbeiträgen angezeigt wird .
Neben eigenen Bildern können Bilder von Stars und Sternchen aus den Bereichen „ Actors “ und „ Musicians “ ausgewählt werden .
Damit kann dann Britney Spears mit Bob Marley , Bruce Willis und Eminem diskutieren .
Hoffen wir , dass sie sich an die Regeln halten und eine Sprache wählen , die „ der Würde des Parlaments “ entspricht ...
Datenschutz
Petitionen und Forumsbeiträge kann jeder Nutzer ohne Registrierung lesen ; Petitionen einreichen kann , wer Name und Anschrift angibt .
Aber auch , wer nur an den Diskussionen im Forum teilnehmen möchte , muss sich mit vollem Namen und Anschrift registrieren .
Die entsprechenden Eingabefelder sind Pflichtfelder .
Dies ist nicht nur ungewöhnlich , sondern verstößt auch gegen die Datenschutzbestimmungen des Telemediengesetzes ( TMG ) , denn es muss dem Nutzer die Möglichkeit gegeben werden , nur unter Pseudonym aufzutreten :
§ 13 , Abs. ( 6 ) Telemediengesetz
Der Diensteanbieter hat die Nutzung von Telemedien und ihre Bezahlung anonym oder unter Pseudonym zu ermöglichen , soweit dies technisch möglich und zumutbar ist .
Der Nutzer ist über diese Möglichkeit zu informieren .
Im Forum ist es sowohl technisch möglich als auch zumutbar , eine Anmeldung unter Pseudonym zu erlauben .
Für die Einreichung einer Petition ist es selbstverständlich richtig , Name und Anschrift zu verlangen , für das Forum ist dies in meinen Augen aber ganz klar rechtswidrig .
Und besonders peinlich für den Bundestag .
Aber auch der das Projekt betreuende Dienstleister sollte den Auftraggeber entsprechend beraten .
Dass der Präsident des Bundestages kein ordentliches Impressum hat , darüber kann man ja noch schmunzeln .
Die unnötige Abfrage personenbezogener Daten ist aber nicht mehr zum Lachen .
Zudem wird der Nutzer nicht , wie ebenfalls vom TMG verlangt , über die Nutzung der Daten informiert :
§ 13 , Abs. ( 1 )
Der Diensteanbieter hat den Nutzer zu Beginn des Nutzungsvorgangs über Art , Umfang und Zwecke der Erhebung und Verwendung personenbezogener Daten [...] in allgemein verständlicher Form zu unterrichten , sofern eine solche Unterrichtung nicht bereits erfolgt ist. [...]
Der Inhalt der Unterrichtung muss für den Nutzer jederzeit abrufbar sein .
All dies ist bei der Online - Petitions - Website des Bundestages nicht der Fall .
Es werden also nicht nur unrechtmäßig personenbezogene Daten wie Name und Anschrift der Forums - Teilnehmer erhohen .
Die Nutzer werden auch nicht über die Verwendung der Daten informiert geschweige denn um eine Einwilligung gebeten .
Verlinken verboten
An den Datenschutz wurde also nicht gedacht .
Dafür aber an die Richtlinien , nachzulesen in rili.pdf .
Die dortigen Regeln betreffen auch Foren - Beiträge , und da sind zum Beispiel Links verboten .
Nun , streng genommen gibt es sowieso keine Links , da in Foren - Beiträgen keine Links aus URLs erzeugt werden .
Die Moderatoren beziehen diese Richtlinie aber auch auf die Nennung von URLs : es ist also zum Beispiel verboten , Quellen für Gesetzestexte anzugeben .
Entsprechende Texte bzw .
Text - Teile werden gelöscht .
Ein sehr skurriles Verhalten , das sinnvolle Diskussionen in vielen Fällen erschwert .
Zurück in die Zeit vor dem Web 1.0 mit dem Deutschen Bundestag ...
Aber auch andere Forums - Beiträge werden gelöscht .
Wie immer in solchen Fällen fragt sich der Leser nachher : was war da los ?
Zumal wenn es allem Anschein nach harmlose Texte trifft .
Natürlich sollte ein Foren - Betreiber darauf achten , dass sich die Teilnehmer nicht gegenseitig quasi die Köpfe einschlagen .
Um den Nutzern einen Anreiz für qualitativ hochwertige Beiträge zu geben , war im Lastenheft ein Bewertungssystem vorgesehen , bei dem die Nutzer Beiträge bewerten können .
Vorgeschlagen werden Schulnoten ( Punkt 3.1.8 Lastenheft , Anforderung L-ÖP - F - B-290 ) .
Das wurde nicht umgesetzt .
Es gibt keine Möglichkeit , Beiträge zu bewerten .
Dabei könnte ein gut gemachtes Bewertungssystem durchaus die Moderatoren stark entlasten .
Dabei muss aber mehr möglich sein , als Beiträge mit Schulnoten zu bewerten .
Denn erfahrungsgemäß bewerten Forennutzer Beiträge , denen sie inhaltlich nicht zustimmen , als „ schlecht “ und solche , denen sie zustimmen , als „ gut “ .
Daraus können regelrechte Bewertungs - Kleinkriege inklusive Rachebewertungen entstehen , was die Administration der Seite erschwert - denn es lässt sich nicht nachvollziehen , ob ein an sich legitimer Beitrag nur deshalb schlecht bewertet wurde , weil Nutzer eine Meinungsverschiedenheit haben .
Sinnvoller - aber auch aufwendiger zu implementieren - wäre ein Bewertungssystem , das den Nutzern inhaltliche , der Diskussionskultur förderliche Bewertungen erlaubt .
Beispielsweise könnten die Benutzer den Beiträgen folgende Label zuweisen : Zustimmung , Ablehnung , In- formativ , Falsch und Störenfried ( Troll ) .
Über die Aufzeichnung dieser Bewertungen lässt sich eine kontrovers geführte Diskussion aufspüren , ohne dass Benutzer gezwungen werden aufgrund mangelnder Optionen ein Gegenüber mit „ schlecht “ zu bewerten .
Dies senkt natürlich auch den Moderationsaufwand und damit die Betriebskosten .
Diese Methode hat sich zum Beispiel bei Slashdot oder Kuro5hin bewährt .
Barrierefreiheit
Laut Punkt 6.5 des Lastenheftes bzw .
Punkt 12 des Fragebogens der Ausschreibung muss die Anwendung barrierefrei nach BITV , Priorität I , sein .
Der Anbieter musste erklären , damit einverstanden zu sein .
Laut dem „ Internet Style Guide “ des Bundestages muss auch Priorität II mit wenigen Ausnahmen erfüllt sein .
Dies soll garantieren , dass behinderte Menschen möglichst ungehinderten Zugang haben .
Diese Anforderung wird nicht erfüllt .
Update : ich habe einihe Screenreader - Audio - Aufzeichnungen gemacht .
Die zeigen , wie Blinde die Webseite „ sehen “ .
So gibt es beispielsweise die folgenden formalen Fehler :
Es gibt keine textuelle Beschreibung aller verwendeter Bilder , es fehlen bei vielen Bildern die alt - Attribute ( BITV - Bedingung 1.1 ) .
- Attribute ( BITV - Bedingung 1.1 ) .
Es handelt sich nicht um valides HTML ( Bedingung 3.2 ) .
Update , 17 .
November : Die meisten XHTML - Fehler ( fehlende Attribite , nicht geschlossene Tags usw . ) wurden in der Zwischenzeit behoben .
Die Struktur ist nicht sauber mit Überschriftenelementen geordnet , in der Regel beginnt die Darstellung mit einer Überschrift dritten oder vierten Grades ( H3 und H4 ) anstatt sauber mit H1 zu beginnen ( Bedingung 3.5 )
und ) anstatt sauber mit zu beginnen ( Bedingung 3.5 ) HTML - Tabellen werden auch zur Darstellung von nicht - tabellarischen Elementen verwendet ( Anforderung 5 ; Bedingung 5.3 ) .
Spaltenüberschriften in Tabellen sind nicht mit dem dafür vorgesehenen HTML - Tag TH gekennzeichnet ( Bedingung 5.1 ) .
gekennzeichnet ( Bedingung 5.1 ) .
Bei abgeschaltetem JavaScript kommt eine deutliche Meldung , man möge zur korrekten Darstellung JavaScript aktivieren .
Ob tatsächlich nicht alles funktioniert habe ich nicht getestet , aber alleine schon die Meldung widerspricht meines Erachtens Bedingung 6.3 bzw.
6.4 , zumal es den Anwender nötigt JavaScript einzuschalten .
Es gibt keine Tastaturkurzbefehle für wichtige Links und Navigationselemente ( Bedingung 9.5 ) .
Die Navigationsmechanismen sind nicht übersichtlich und schlüssig ( Anforderung 13 ) .
So sind beispielsweise nicht alle Link - Ziele eindeutig identifizierbar ( Bedingung 13.1 ) .
Man kommt durch Anklicken einer Zahl zum Beispiel entweder zur Liste der Unterzeichner einer Petition oder der Übersicht der Kommentar - Überschriften , ohne dass dies bei dem Link gesondert gekennzeichnet wäre .
Ob 23 nun über einen Zwischenschritt zu den Kommentaren oder ob 42 zu den Unterzeichnern führt ist nicht deutlich .
Übersichtsseite der Diskussionen vollkommen unter .
Die Links zu den eigentlichen Inhalten sind unter all dem Rauschen mit einem Textbrowser oft kaum zu finden .
Update : Wer sich in einen Blinden Internet - Nutzer hineinversetzen möchte , kann sich entsprechende Audio - Dateien von Bildschirmlese - Programmen anhören .
Der Bundestag als Auftraggeber muss bei der Abnahme diese formalen Kriterien überprüfen bzw .
überprüfen lassen .
Anscheinend ist dies nicht oder nicht durch kompetente Personen geschehen .
Anders ist nicht zu erklären , warum selbst einfach zu prüfende formale Kriterien nicht erfüllt sind .
Das Projekt hätte so nie abgenommen werden dürfen .
Trennung von Funktion , Layout und Inhalt
Das Lastenheft verlangt in Punkt 6.7 die strikte Verwendung von Templates :
Um eine mögliche Erweiterung des Systems einfach und kostengünstig zu gestalten , ist bei der Entwicklung der Grundsatz der strikten Trennung von Funktion , Layout und I nhalt zu berücksichtigen .
Punkt 6.7 Erweiterbarkeit vom Lastenheft Softwareprojekt „ Öffentliche Petition “ , Seite 28
Dieser Grundsatz wird von dem verwendeten Simple Machines Forum ( SMF ) nicht beachtet .
Zwar gibt es beim SMF auch Vorlagen , dieses sind aber auch nur PHP - Dateien , die einen Teil der Logik implementieren .
Aber auch im Haupt - Code befindet sich viel HTML .
Dabei handelt es sich nicht nur um hart codierte Tabellen - Elemente , sondern auch um fest codierte Stylesheets mit Farbangaben , Hintergrundfarben , Texte und so weiter .
Dies ist ein klarer Verstoß gegen Punkt 6.7 des Lastenheftes .
Dass keine strikte Trennung von Code und Repräsentation vorliegt , macht nicht nur die Gestaltung schwieriger bzw .
bei Erweiterungen unnötig kompliziert und auf Dauer teurer .
Es verstärkt auch die oben genannten Probleme mit der Barrierefreiheit und Usability .
Zwischenfazit zur Umsetzung
Mehrfach ist zu beobachten , dass wichtige Anforderungen der Ausschreibung bzw .
des Lastenheftes nicht umgesetzt wurden und mit der verwendeten Foren - Software gar nicht bzw .
nur mit exorbitantem Aufwand umgesetzt werden können .
Das Grundproblem ist also die verwendete Foren - Software .
Nach meinem Verständnis hätte daher schon das Angebot von der Ausschreibung ausgeschlossen werden müssen , denn wenn Anforderungen nicht umgesetzt werden können , dann ist ein Angebot eben auch hinfällig .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass die araneaNET GmbH das Board in ihrem Angebot erwähnt hat , denn es wurden konkrete Angaben zu den zu verwendenden Techniken verlangt .
Aber spätestens bei der Begutachtung des Pflichtenheftes wäre die Notbremse zu ziehen gewesen .
So aber steigen die Folgekosten bei Änderungen und Erweiterungen und so manche Erweiterung ist in einem sinnvollem Rahmen kaum möglich .
Insgesamt macht die Umsetzung einen amateurhaften und schludrigen Eindruck .
Die Online - Petitions - Website des Bundestages ist keineswegs innovativ oder modern , sondern so zusammengestückelt , dass sie gerade mal irgendwie die wichtigsten Anforderungen erfüllt : es können Petitionen eingereicht und unterzeichnet werden und man kann im Forum Kommentare hinterlassen .
Man merkt aber , dass da niemand am Werk war , der sich mit Benutzerführung und Gestaltung von modernen Webseiten auskennt .
Dies wäre aber zwar änder - und erweiterbar , wenn da nicht die Foren - Software wäre ...
So aber kann man dem Bundestag nur einen Rat geben , den ich verschiedenen Kunden leider auch gelegentlich geben muss : wegwerfen und neu schreiben ( lassen ) .
Das ist zwar bitter , aber dennoch die mittelfristig beste Lösung .
Das Simple Machines Forum
Die Software , auf der die Petitions - Site beruht , wurde im Wesentlichen entwickelt , um in wenigen Minuten auf einem beliebigen Webserver ein einfaches Diskussionsforum aufzusetzen .
Sie kommt aus der Kultur der Bulletin - Board - Foren , die vor allem bei privaten Betreibern beliebt sind .
Und es gehört zu den üblichen PHP / MySQL - Frickeleien : kaum Trennung zwischen Code und Design ( einige Design - Elemente werden sogar im Haupt - Code definiert ) , seltsame Lizenzbedingungen ( die vermutlich noch nicht mal eingehalten werden ) , keine Gewährleistung von Datenintegrität da MyISAM - Tabellen und keine Transaktionen genutzt werden , wenig Dokumentation , schwer durchschaubarer Spaghetti-Code , haufenweise globale Variablen , keine automatisierten Test und so weiter .
Da wundert es wenig , dass das System nur wenig Flexibilität mitbringt und sich zig Berichte über Sicherheitslücken finden - die vom Bundestag eingesetzte Version hat , obwohl schon vor Tagen eine neue Version heraus kam , noch einige kritische Sicherheitslücken offen - .
Ob sie in der konkreten Implementierung auch ausnutzbar sind / waren habe ich aus naheliegenden Gründen nicht probiert .
Lizenz
Wie bereits schon mehrfach angesprochen geht es um das kostenlos erhältliche „ Simple Machines Forum “ ( SMF ) .
Dabei steht SMF keineswegs unter einer Open Source Lizenz und ist auch keine Freie Software :
» Freie Software « hat etwas mit Freiheit zu tun , nicht mit dem Preis .
Um das Konzept zu verstehen , ist an » frei « wie in » freier Rede « , und nicht wie in » Freibier « zu denken .
Aus der Definition Freier Software der Free Software Foundation
Die Lizenzbestimmungen zum SMF untersagen zum Beispiel das Weiterverteilen ( Redistribution ) der Software .
Zudem müssen die Copyright - Hinweise unverändert auch in der Ausgabe ( also auf jedem damit umgesetzten Forum ) erhalten bleiben .
Dies war in den ersten Tagen / Wochen nach dem Start der Online - Petitions - Website nicht der Fall , wie auch schon Matthias Dietrich beschrieben hat .
Ein klarer Verstoß gegen die Lizenzbedingungen .
In der Zwischenzeit wurde dies korrigiert und der Hinweis ist vorhanden .
Eine weitere Lizenzbedingung mag dem Bundestag vielleicht nicht schmecken : bei jeder Modifikation oder Erweiterung muss dem Hersteller eine kostenlose Lizenz zur Nutzung dieser eingeräumt werden .
Simple Machines LLC muss demnach das Recht erhalten , die Online - Petitions - Erweiterungen zu nutzen und zu verbreiten :
When a Modification to the Package is released , a non-exclusive royalty - free right is granted to Simple Machines LLC to distribute the Modification in future versions of the Package Aus der Simple Machines License
Sicherheitslücken
Wie auch bei anderen PHP / MySQL - Boards üblich werden auch beim Simple Machines Forum immer wieder teils kritische Sicherheitslücken bekannt .
Die Verwendung dieses Boards für geschäftskritische bzw .
missionskritische
Anwendungen kann daher nur als grob fahrlässig bezeichnet werden .
Bei der Online - Petitions - Webseite wird derzeit wurde bis 12 .
November Version 1.1.6 verwendet , für die am 4 .
November ein Code Execution Exploit sowie am 5 .
November ein weiterer Code Execution Exploit bekannt wurden .
Das bedeutet , dass ein Angreifer eigenen Programmcode auf einem Server , auf dem das SMF läuft , ausführen kann - und damit in der Lage ist , die Webseite beliebig zu manipulieren , Daten auszuspähen bzw .
zu manipulieren und weitere Angriffe zu starten .
Obwohl bereits eine Version 1.1.7 veröffentlicht wurde , ist bis jetzt ( 10 . November ) immer noch die alte Version im Einsatz .
Update : Obwohl schnell eine fehlerbereinigte Version 1.1.7 veröffentlicht wurde , dauerte es bis zum 12 .
November , bis diese bei der Online - Petitions - Webseite installiert wurde .
Code - Qualität
Ein kritischer Blick auf den Source - Code des Simple Machine Forums bringt einige Unzulänglichkeiten zu Tage , viele davon typisch für PHP - Anwendungen :
Flache Code - Struktur : Aufgrund fehlender Namensräume ist es oft üblich , Code nicht hierarchisch zu ordnen sondern alles auf eine Ebene zu klatschen .
So sind dann im Haupt - Source - Verzeichnis vom SMF auch 66 PHP - Dateien ohne hierarchische Ordnung zu finden .
Exzessive Verwendung globaler Variablen : Über 70 Variablen sind global deklariert .
Dies erschwert das Verständnis und die Wartung des Codes , reduziert die Robustheit und erhöht die Gefahr für Fehler und Sicherheitslücken .
Schwer durchschaubarer Spaghetti-Code : Nicht nur , dass über 300 Code - Zeilen eine nicht überschaubare Länge von mehr als 200 Zeichen haben ( die Längste Zeile enthält 1470 Zeichen ) .
Auch viele Unterfunktionen bestehen aus hunderten von Zeilen .
parse_bbc hat zum Beispiel 1423 Zeilen Code .
Da drin verstecken sich 144 if - Abfragen , mindestens 85 logische Operatoren , 25 mal elseif , 38 else und 49 mal der Ternäre Operator ( ?- Operator ) ...
Wer soll sowas warten ?
Wenn das der Psychopath mit der Kettensäge sieht ...
Ab einer bestimmten Komplexität ist Code für Menschen nicht oder nur noch sehr schwer zu verstehen und nicht sinnvoll testbar .
Diese Komplexität , die auch als zyklomatische Komplexität oder McCabe - Metrik ( nach Thomas J. McCabe ) bekannt ist , besagt , wieviele verschiedene Wege mindestens durch ein Programm ( teil ) führen .
Um den Code übersichtlich und testbar zu halten , sollten dies möglichst wenige sein : McCabe empfiehlt 10 , Perl : : Critic und die passende Regel Subroutines : : ProhibitExcessComplexity erlauben per default 20 .
Bei der angesprochenen Funktion parse_bbc sind es deutlich über 300 .
Dass man BBCode auch mit sauberem und übersichtlichem Code parsen kann zeigt beispielsweise Tina Müller beim CPAN - Modul Parse : : BBCode .
PHP - Typisch werden keine Module für Standardaufgaben wie das Parsen von URLs oder die Validierung von E - Mails genutzt , sondern alles selbst gebaut .
Für Perl - Programmierer gibt es das CPAN , PHP - Programmierer haben eben nichts vergleichbares .
Ebenfalls PHP - Typisch enthält die SMF - Distribution keine Unit- oder Regression - Tests .
Ohne automatisierte Tests sind viele Fehler nur schwer erkenn - und reproduzierbar .
Die Dokumentation ist relativ knapp und rudimentär gehalten , auch wenn ich da schon deutlich schlimmeres gesehen habe .
SMF ist weder objektorientiert programmiert noch wird ein Datenbankabstraktionslayer verwendet .
Dies erschwert die Entwicklung von Erweiterungen .
SMF verwendet MySQL mit dem MyISAM - Tabellentyp .
Damit kann keine Datenintegrität gewährleistet werden , es erfüllt noch nicht einmal die Mindest - Anforderungen an eine ACID - konforme Datenbank .
Dies kann zum einen Auswirkungen auf die Datenkonsistenz haben : MyISAM gibt keine Garantie , dass keine kaputte Daten in die Datenbank gelangen .
Update : ACID - Konformität ist eine Anforderung des BSI Grundschutz - Katalogs ( M 2.124 Geeignete Auswahl einer Datenbank - Software ) , die damit nicht eingehalten wird bzw .
mit MySQL gar nicht eingehalten werden kann .
Zum anderen ist die Performance bei parallelen Lese -/ Schreib - Operationen , wie sie bei vielen Web - Anwendungen vorkommen , sehr schlecht : ein Schreibzugriff muss warten , bis alle Lesezugriffe fertig sind und umgekehrt .
Dies kann einen Server sehr schnell unter der Last zusammenbrechen lassen .
( Update , 8 . Februar 2009 : was nicht nur theoretischer Natur ist sondern sich nun auch praktisch bestätigt hat )
Zum anderen ist die Performance bei parallelen Lese -/ Schreib - Operationen , wie sie bei vielen Web - Anwendungen vorkommen , sehr schlecht : ein Schreibzugriff muss warten , bis alle Lesezugriffe fertig sind und umgekehrt .
Dies kann einen Server sehr schnell unter der Last zusammenbrechen lassen .
( Update , 8 .
Februar 2009 : was nicht nur theoretischer Natur ist sondern sich nun auch praktisch bestätigt hat ) Das Simple Machines Forum läuft in der verwendeten Version 1.1 nur mit MySQL .
MySQL bzw .
genauer die MySQL Client Library ist nach Auffassung von MySQL aber nur unter wenigen Umständen ohne Lizenzkosten nutzbar .
Dies gilt zum Beispiel dann nicht , wenn die MySQL nutzende Software nicht unter der GPL oder einer anderen Lizenz steht , die unter die „ Free and Open Source Software ( " FOSS " ) License Exception “ fällt .
Für die Simple Machines Licence gibt es keine solche Ausnahme .
Daher ist dabei eine kostenpflichtige Lizenz ( ab 479 Euro pro Jahr ) zu erwerben .
In der Ausschreibung wurde aber explizit verlangt , dass kostenpflichtige Lizenzen nur bei gesonderter Begründung erlaubt sind ( Frage 10.4 des Fragenkatalogs ) ...
PHP - Code , HTML und CSS werden beim SMF miteinander vermischt .
Zukünftige Design - Änderungen sind damit in vielen Fällen sehr schwer und nur durch Code - Änderungen möglich - was wie bereits oben beschrieben auch der Ausschreibung widerspricht .
Gleichzeitig bringt dies wiederum Probleme beim Aktualisieren der Software mit : Gibt es eine neue SMF - Version , muss diese u. U. mühsam mit den eigenen Änderungen verglichen und manuell eingespielt werden .
Der Bundestag verlangt , dass die Software als Peak 10000 Besucher pro Minute verträgt .
Bei Zeiten von rund 200 Millisekunden bei der Generierung und Auslieferung alleine der Startseite ist fraglich , ob diese Werte erreicht werden können ...
Insgesamt stellt sich die Frage , wie man seriöserweise überhaupt auf die Idee kommen kann , eine solche Foren - Software als Basis für eine Geschäftskritische Anwendung auszuwähen .
Die Probleme sind zu massiv und umfangreich , als dass man sie ignorieren sollte .
Und sie sind zu tiefgreifend , um sie durch Erweiterungen und Fehlerbehebungen in den Griff zu bekommen .
Um die Anforderungen einzuhalten und ein gut wartbares Produkt zu erhalten ist seriöserweise eine komplette Neuentwicklung zu empfehlen .
Der Auftragnehmer : araneaNET GmbH
Die Umsetzung der neuen Online - Petitions - Website des Bundestages wurde laut Impressum und Pressemeldung durch die Firma araneaNET GmbH aus Potsdam durchgeführt .
araneaNET
GmbH bezeichnet sich selbst als ein „ BSI - zertifizierter Technologieberater “ .
Warum ein solches Unternehmen dann aber eine Software einsetzt , die offensichtlich nicht die Anforderungen der BSI - Grundschutz - Kataloge ( bzw. Grundschutz - Handbuch ) einhält , bleibt unverständlich .
Laut Eigenaussage liegen die Kompetenzen von araneaNET in Bereichen , die ich als Softwareentwickler und Gestalter von Web - Anwendungen in den Systemadministrations - Bereich einordnen würde , keinesfalls aber im Bereich der Erstellung benutzerfreundlicher Web - Applikationen .
Interessant ist dabei der Punkt Open Source , dort stehen als angebotene Leistungen :
Support von Open Source basierten Betriebssystemen ( Novell Open Enterprise Server , SuSE Linux Enterprise Server )
Eigenentwicklung einer Open Source Produktreihe zur Verwaltung und Management von IT - Ressourcen
Neben dem Support für Novell / SuSE-Betriebssysteme haben sie also auch noch eine ganze eigene „ Open Source Produktreihe “ im Programm .
Nur : bis auf ein paar kurze Beschreibungen was die Produkte denn können sollen und der Angabe „ Open Source - keine Lizenzgebühren “ findet sich nicht viel : neben einer Kurzbeschreibung je ein PDF - Flyer und eine Demo - Website für araneaSOURCE | documentare , auf der nicht viel passiert .
Kein Source und keine Angaben zur Lizenz .
Dabei geht Open Source viel weiter und hat erstmal nichts mit kostenlos oder kommerziell / nichtkommerziell zu tun - wenn dann also bei einem „ Open Source “ - Projekt noch nicht mal der Source zu finden ist , dann finde ich das durchaus ... ungewöhnlich .
Auch auf eine Anfrage an die angegebene E - Mail - Adresse war keine Antwort zu erhalten .
Eine Google - Suche findet im Wesentlichen nur ein paar alte Pressemeldungen ( Stand : 9 . November 2008 ) .
Das alles mag nicht viel bedeuten , auch wenn ich persönlich auf überschwengliche Pressemeldungen allergisch reagiere , vor allem wenn lange nach der Ankündigung nichts zu sehen ist .
Nach Open Source sieht es auf jeden Fall eher weniger aus .
Zu den Kernkompetenzen der araneaNET
GmbH gehört nach eigener Angabe weder Informationsdesign noch die Erstellung von Websites oder gar Community - Websites noch die Erstellung von gebrauchstauglichen und benutzerfreundlichen Bedienkonzepten .
In den Ausschreibungsunterlagen wurde vom Bundestag aber explizit gefordert , dass dem Angebot „ drei bis fünf Referenzen über vergleichbare Aufträge vorzulegen “ seien .
Vielleicht wurde hier also „ vergleichbare Aufträge “ besonders weit ausgelegt ?
Und sicherlich schadet es auch nicht , an dem ein oder anderen Projekt des Wirtschaftsministeriums teilzunehmen .
Fazit
Dass die Umsetzung der Online - Petitions - Webseite alles andere als optimal ist , ist deutlich zu sehen : Schlechte Bedienung , fehlende Funktionalität bzw .
nicht eingehaltene Anforderungen , mangelnde Barrierefreiheit , sicherheitskritische Basis , altbackenes Design und rechtswidrige Datenabfrage .
Man kriegt eben das , was man bezahlt .
Natürlich kann man in einigen der hier genannten Kritikpunkte anderer Meinung sein , aber bei einem Projekt des Bundestages habe ich einfach besonders hohe Ansprüche !
In gewisser Weise wird die neue Webseite allerdings dem gerecht , was den Petitionsausschüssen von Bund und Ländern nachgesagt wird : sie würden wenig wahrgenommen , seien das Stiefkind aller Ausschüsse und für Abgeordnete , die angeblich sonst nichts können .
Aber gerade deswegen wäre ein moderner , gut bedienbarer und zukunftsweisender Auftritt nötig , nicht ein Rückschritt ins Web 1.0 .
Aber , welche Lehren lassen sich aus der Sache ziehen ?
Lehren für Bieter
Für den ( potentiellen )
Auftragnehmer lässt sich vor allem eine Lehre ziehen : sei billig !
Und zwar so billig , dass es kaum möglich ist , hochqualitative Arbeit zu leisten .
Also wirklich billig , in allen seinen Bedeutungen .
Oder anders gesagt :
Wer billig ist , hat die besten Chancen auf den Zuschlag .
Das ist aber auch egal , merkt erstmal sowieso keiner - und ansonsten überhaupt erst dann , wenn es zu spät ist .
Und ebenso wichtig ist , wie auch an anderen Stellen zu beobachten ist : immer schön dick auftragen , die eigenen Leistungen so sehr übertreiben bis man es selbst nicht mehr aushält , irgendwie zertifizieren lassen und mit dem Strom schwimmen .
Wenn Open Source modern ist , dann mache Open Source .
Oder sage zumindest , dass
Du das machst , irgendwer wird es schon glauben .
Lehren für Ausschreibende
Das klingt fatalistisch , ein bisschen ist es das auch .
Aber ich habe auch Hoffnung , dass es anders laufen kann .
Dazu gehört sicherlich , dass sich die ausschreibenden Behörden oder Unternehmen besser mit den Bereichen auskennen , in denen sie etwas ausschreiben .
Ohne Wissen geht es nicht - und wenn von den Mitarbeitern des Bundestages sich keiner auskennt , dann muss man dies eben mit kompetenten externen Partnern machen .
Vermutlich ist dies im Fall der Online - Petitions - Webseite des Bundestages sogar passiert , denn die Ausschreibungs - Unterlagen und das Lastenheft sind im Großen und Ganzen nicht zu beanstanden .
Aber ich habe die Vermutung , dass bei der Auswahl der Angebote weniger Sorgfalt angewendet wurde , sondern nur ein paar Punkte anhand des einzureichenden Fragebogens mit dem angebotenen Preis verrechnet wurden .
Dabei ist bei genauerem Hinsehen klar , dass ein Angebot auf Basis des Simple Machine Forums einige Anforderungen ohne exorbitanten Aufwand gar nicht erfüllen kann .
Dafür ist die Software zu sehr auf die Zielgruppe eher privater Foren - bzw .
Board - Betreiber zugeschnitten .
Bei solchen Aufträgen halte ich es daher für die Ausschreibenden schwer , nach Aktenlage zu entscheiden .
Dann gewinnt nämich der , der am meisten übertreibt .
Vermutlich wäre es sinnvoller , eine Auswahl der in Frage kommenden Angebote zu erstellen und diese dann genauer unter die Lupe zu nehmen , inklusive Präsentation durch die Anbieter .
Vielleicht auch schon von mehreren Bietern ein Pflichtenheft auf Basis ihres Vorschlages erstellen lassen - diese werden das zwar nicht umsonst machen , aber lieber etwas mehr Geld ausgeben als nachher ein schlechtes Produkt zu erhalten .
Inwieweit das alles mit dem Ausschreibungsrecht vereinbar ist mag ich nicht beurteilen , in anderen Fällen klappt sowas aber auch .
Eine perfekte
Welt ist natürlich ein weit entferntes Wunschdenken , aber man kann sich dieser ja Schritt für Schritt nähern ...

Update , 7 . Februar 2009 : Petitions - System des Bundestages bricht zusammen
Obama and McCain address final - day rallies guardian.co.uk
Election officials are braced for the biggest turnout in US history today as voters finally deliver their verdict on Barack Obama and John McCain to bring to an end a gripping , two - year campaign .
Although officials expressed confidence that polling booths would cope , campaigners and analysts expressed fears that the strain could see long queues and stations having to extend opening hours into the night .
The effect would be a delay in declaring results in key states .
With all the main polls putting Obama well ahead , political analysts from right and left said they expected him to easily reach the 270 of 538 electoral votes needed to win the presidency , and many predicted a landslide , with him taking 350 or more electoral seats .
The Washington - based Pew organisation , one of the most respected pollsters which accurately predicted the vote in 2004 , yesterday put Obama on 52 % and McCain on 46 % .
RealClearPolitics , a website that averages out the main polls , put Obama on 51 % to McCain 's 44 % .
If the polls are borne out today , he would become the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976 to win 50 % or more of the popular vote .
The excitement generated by Obama 's candidacy is expected to see between 130 million and 140 million Americans vote , easily eclipsing the 121 million who turned out in 2004 .
Obama and McCain both began multi-state tours yesterday in Florida , before heading towards their home states today .
There was a poignant start to Obama 's tour when he learned of the death of his 86 - year - old grandmother , Madelyn Payne Dunham , while he was campaigning in Florida .
She helped raise him and in a campaign advertisement this year he described her as having " taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland " .
Obama decided to continue with his appearances and later told a rally in Jacksonville , Florida : " After decades of broken politics in Washington , eight years of failed policies from George Bush and 21 months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of Maine to the sunshine of California , we are one day away from change in America . "
Obama was unable to avoid providing occasional glimpses throughout the day that he expected to become the 44th president .
In a courteous gesture he might not have made if the race was closer , Obama said he wanted to " congratulate McCain on the great race that he has fought " .
Exuding confidence , he told a rally the previous night : " The last couple of days , I 've been just feeling good . "
As polling day nears , he has become more reflective , telling CBS yesterday that he had found the toughest part of the two - year campaign was the rightwing attack on his wife , Michelle .
He described this as " just completely out of bounds " .
McCain , at a rally in Tampa , Florida , insisted he could still pull off a surprise win .
" The pundits may not know it and the Democrats may not know it , but the Mac is back .
We 're going to win this election . "
The Democrats , as well as political analysts , were less sanguine than election officials about trouble - free voting , saying that with 300,000 precincts across the country , there would be problems .
Democratic officials complain that in some states Republican election officers are not opening enough booths in areas that are predominantly African - American in the hope that some voters , put off by queues , will go home without voting .
Professor Michael McDonald , an election expert at Virginia 's George Mason University , said : " I would not be surprised if we had long lines , potentially keeping polling places open longer on election day . "
He anticipated problems in states that had not allowed early voting in significant numbers , such as Virginia , Pennsylvania and Missouri .
The Democrats are outspending the Republicans on final - day advertising by at least two to one .
They are also likely to have more staff and volunteers out , with 770 offices nationwide to McCain 's 370 .
MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) -- Barack Obama sometimes gets ribbed for his outsized ideas , like the massive stage built in Denver , Colorado , to accept the Democratic presidential nomination .
But an artist in Barcelona , Spain , may be about to outdo the candidate himself .
Large - format sketches have long been a focus of artist Jorge Rodriguez - Gerada 's work .
The artist plans to create a gigantic face of Obama sculpted from gravel and sand , which will cover nearly 2.5 acres ( 1 hectare ) of Barcelona beachfront before the U.S. elections .
" The size of the piece is intrinsic to its value , " the artist , Jorge Rodriguez - Gerada , said Saturday .
He hopes it will be big enough to be seen on Google Earth .
" Obama 's personality -- his youth , personal history and message of a new politics -- has fused with the historical moment to create someone larger than life , " says the artist 's dossier about the work , titled " Expectation . "
The huge size also alludes " to the global impact of this election , " the dossier adds .
iReport.com : What do you want to ask Sen. Obama ?
Rodriguez - Gerada , 42 , is a Cuban - born American who grew up in North Plainfield , New Jersey , near New York , and now lives in Barcelona .
The artist , who has long focused on large - format sketches and other designs , said he had been planning to put an anonymous face on Barcelona 's Mediterranean beachfront but shelved the idea .
Then , six weeks ago , he decided it should be Obama 's face .
" Everybody 's doing work about Obama , " he said .
" I was talking to my wife about the importance of this election internationally .
It all came together . "
The idea , that is .
The execution of the project is still a work in progress , but with a lot of help pouring in .
The artist has created what he calls a " vectored image " from different photos of Obama , showing the candidate 's face looking left over his shoulder .
He will use 500 tons of material -- mainly gravel but also sand and possibly some soil in black , brown and white tones -- to create the image on a flat piece of land slightly raised and overlooking the Mediterranean , near downtown Barcelona .
The artist and a Barcelona newspaper say the city has temporarily ceded use of the land for the project .
The portrait of Obama 's face will be 445 feet long by 264 feet wide ( 139.28 by 82.67 meters ) and the artist hopes to have it done by late next week or no later than November 3 , the day before the U.S. elections .
The materials have been donated , along with bulldozers and their drivers .
The crews will initially spread the materials along white lines , and other markers that will be laid out according to the sketch .
Then , the artist 's technical team will direct volunteers with garden rakes to put the final touches on the materials , making sure the various colors are spread properly on the ground in order to depict Obama 's eyes , hair , cheeks and collar , according to the plans .
Rodriguez - Gerada said he 'll need to raise about $ 18,700 ( 15,000 euros ) for other costs , such as rakes and gloves for volunteers , documentation , even portable toilets for the crew .
He said it's his " biggest work ever , in scale and complexity . "
He 's a self - described political independent until recently , when he joined Democrats Abroad in Spain .
But he added that the art project is his alone , without help from any political organization or campaign , and he wo n't be paid for it .
Rodriguez - Gerada said this project also aims to address the issue of " trying to find heroes with empathy for the problems of the world .
We really need empathy from Barack Obama .
There 's a need to do positive things for the future . "
Obama 's giant face would be environmentally friendly , with all natural colors , so the materials could be recycled , the artist said .
Rodriguez - Gerada 's not sure how long the face would remain in place in Barcelona , because the site is slated to be used for a new municipal building .
But even if the face is n't permanent , it might be the start of outsized artistic images of Obama .

Radar reported last night that the National Enquirer , fresh off breaking the John Edwards scandal , was hot in pursuit of the Bristol Palin pregnancy story .
“ I definitely think we triggered the announcement , ” Editor David Perel told Politico this morning .
Perel said that the Enquirer has three reporters — from “ the Edwards team ” — up in Alaska .
He said reporters were putting out calls all weekend to members of Palin ’s family and those around her , as well as the family of the father , Levi Johnston .
Perel said there was enough to go on for this week ’s print edition , even before Monday ’s statement .
So what about the media ’s aggressive coverage of Palin ’s child ’s pregnancy versus not pursuing Edwards ?
“ I think it ’s an inconsistent position with everyone in the mainstream media , with how they justified not covering Edwards , ” Perel said , adding that “ maybe they learned their lesson " from sitting on the Edwards infidelity rumors for so long .
Perel said that the Alaska - based team will continue on the Palin beat .
“ We did a pretty nice investigation for what we call Week One , ” he said .

A happy Veterans Day to sustainablog readers who ’ve served in the US military … and happy Remembrance Day to Canadian vets .
For many veterans of the US armed forces , the rewards of their service are intangible : pride , discipline , commitment to country and community .
Of course , veterans also receive more tangible benefits — educational assistance , low - interest home loans , health care — but as we ’ve seen over and over again , the provision of these services is often less than ideal .
Yesterday , the American Society of Interior Designers announced a partnership with Rebuilding Together ’s Veteran Housing Initiative to support our veterans by assisting them with home renovation ; part of that support will include “ [ providing ] REGREEN resources , the nation ’s first sustainable residential remodeling guidelines , to Rebuilding Together affiliates . ”
[ social_buttons ]
REGREEN , a partnership between ASID and the US Green Building Council , was launched in March , and is dedicated to “ … the development of best practice guidelines and targeted educational resources for sustainable residential improvement projects . ”
The ASID / RT partnership will begin with a pilot project in the Washington , D.C. area , and will involve “ … [ renovating ] the home of a deserving veteran . ”
Of course , this is n’t the first green building program aimed at veterans : Dawn Killough took note of Homes for Our Troops back in August .
Nevertheless , it ’s good to see that sustainable building and design initiatives are n’t limited to high - price commercial and residential building : people who need the economic benefits of green design ( lower energy and utility costs , for example ) are receiving this kind of assistance , and it should reap rewards for these veteran homeowners , and the communities in which they live .
Furthermore , these kinds of efforts can serve as a model for other housing non-profits , and even for - profit builders of housing for lower - income people … and show that green building is n’t just fashionable , but creates economic benefits .
Shoot , there might even be a long - term stimulus effect …
I look forward to following the progress of this partnership .
But , this is just one effort — are you aware of other projects aimed at greening housing for veterans , low - income homeowners , renters ?
If so , share ’em below …

Turns out the Cleveland Browns are not quitters after all .
And they have Phil Dawson to thank for this wild victory .
Dawson capped a five field - goal outing by making a career - long 56 - yarder with 1 minute 39 seconds remaining Monday night to secure the visiting Browns ’ 29 - 27 win against the reeling Buffalo Bills .
Cleveland ended a two - game skid and rallied to avoid wasting a 13 - point lead for a third consecutive time .
The Bills ( 5 - 5 ) had a chance to win with a clutch kick of their own , but Rian Lindell missed a 47 - yard attempt with 38 seconds left .
Buffalo has lost four in a row and five of six , looking nothing like the team that got off to a 4 - 0 start .
Trent Edwards endured another sloppy performance , tossing three interceptions in Buffalo ’s first four possessions .
60 Minutes ' Steve Kroft examines the complicated financial instruments known as credit default swaps , and reveals how these little - known derivatives played a central role in precipitating the current market meltdown .
In essence , speculators bet that homeowners would n't be unable to pay back their mortgages , and when those people started defaulting and the speculators tried to cash in their wagers , there was no money to cover the literally trillions of dollars in payouts .
What it really boils down to is an unregulated gambling racket that Congress voted unanimously to create and legalize .
The world 's financial system teetered on the edge again last week , and anyone with more than a passing interest in their shrinking 401 ( k ) knows it 's because of a global credit crisis .
It began with the collapse of the U.S. housing market and has been magnified worldwide by what Warren Buffet once called " financial weapons of mass destruction . "
They are called credit derivatives or credit default swaps , and 60 Minutes did a story on the multi-trillion dollar market three weeks ago .
But there 's a lot more to tell .
As Steve Kroft reports , essentially they are side bets on the performance of the U.S. mortgage markets and the solvency on some of the biggest financial institutions in the world .
It 's a form of legalized gambling that allows you to wager on financial outcomes without ever having to actually buy the stocks and bonds and mortgages .
It would have been illegal during most of the 20th century , but eight years ago Congress gave Wall Street an exemption and it has turned out to be a very bad idea .
Ben and Jerry's ' Democracy Never Tasted So Sweet ' Free Scoop

Bring along your ' I Voted ' sticker and enjoy a cool treat .
They are n't the only brand offering up free goodies for voters .
Check out what Krispy Kreme is doing for customers on election day .
It 's a weighty job .
It 's no exaggeration to say that the president makes life and death decisions all the time .
We were interviewing Michael Isikoff of Newsweek yesterday on The Young Turks and we discussed this part of his latest story :
As NEWSWEEK reported last summer , President Bush approved more relaxed rules of engagement for U.S. forces along the Afghan - Pakistan border .
The Pentagon once required " 90 percent " confidence on the part of intelligence agencies that a " high - value target " was present before approving Predator strikes inside Pakistan .
Under the revised rules , U.S. officials on the ground now need only 50 to 60 percent confidence to shoot at compounds suspected of sheltering foreign fighters , according to knowledgeable U.S. sources who would speak of sensitive matters only anonymously .
Think about that .
Even if you have a president with a conscience , one out of ten times someone is going to walk into the Oval Office and say , " I 'm sorry Mr. President , our intelligence did n't pan out - we accidentally hit a wedding .
Ten civilians killed . "
That is tough .
That is what Obama will have to deal with .
Once you think about it that way , you almost do n't want the job .
Now let 's move on to a president without a conscience .
George Bush .
Think about the decision that Isikoff explains above .
I understand hitting a target that has 90 % certainty of being Al Qaeda fighters , simply because you 'll almost never a hundred percent certainty .
We can't have a president frozen with indecision or who never takes a shot no matter how certain his intelligence people are that we have Al Qaeda on the other end .
But I at least want the president up at night worrying about the consequences of his decisions .
Every time he gives the order , people die .
We just hope that we get it right most of the time ( and even if you have the right guys , it should give you small amount of pause if you 're human ; let alone the tragedy of hitting the wrong people ) .
Look at what Bush does instead - lowering the bar to about 50 % certainty that it 's an actual enemy target .
That means half the time he blows up a wedding , or a group of kids playing in the yard , or innocent men sitting in a coffee house , or a just an average family sitting around their kitchen table .
And why is he doing this ?
Obviously , because he wants to get Osama bin Laden or another top Al Qaeda leader before he leaves office .
In other words , for his reputation .
This is why I do n't like George Bush .
You 're not supposed to say it in polite circles , but I think he is a despicable person .
Yes , I mean that on a personal level .
I think he shows sick indifference to the lives of others .
Maybe it 's standard fare for politicians to be more concerned about their own careers than the lives of others , but there is a line .
Would you take a 50 % chance that you 'd kill innocent civilians ?
Could you live with that ?
And think about this - why did he lower the bar recently ?
We 're seven years out from 9/11 .
It 's not like the hunt for Al Qaeda has taken on some new urgency now .
No , what has taken on urgency is Bush 's legacy as he prepares to leave office .
That 's the only thing that has changed .
There is an inescapable conclusion here - Bush has ordered more innocent people to their deaths so that he can try to salvage his reputation before he leaves office .
Maybe the man does n't think Pakistani lives are worth the same as our lives .
What 's the big deal if you have the wrong people ?
They 're all Muslims that live in that area anyway , right ?
I know some conservatives definitely feel this way .
But a president should be smart enough and decent enough to understand that there are real families with real human beings who did n't do anything to us there .
They did n't have it coming .
Earlier I mentioned a kitchen table .
We 're used to our own kitchen tables .
We know how they look and it feels like home to us .
It almost seems strange to think of a family sitting around a kitchen table in North Waziristan .
But they do .
The husband comes home from probably a back - breaking day of work .
They have aspirations for their kids .
They 're worried about the violent jihadists that are rumored to be in the area ( like we 're worried about crime in our neighborhoods ) .
The wife is making soup .
The son has just come in from playing soccer .
The dad is at least glad to see his only son come home .
And then boom .
Lights out .
We just dropped a bomb on the wrong house .
They 're all dead .
That has to keep you up at night if you 're the person making that decision .
If it does n't , you 're a monster .
Now , Bush cavalierly lowers the bar and risks killing more civilians just like that family .
And he does it for his own political gain .
He is a terrible person .
Watch The Young Turks Here

The Republican party is in shambles and wingnut / washed up rocker Ted Nugent knows just how to fix the party .
Make no mistake , conservative values and ideologies are embraced by Americans .
The polls all indicate Americans are fed up with the Pelosi-led , do nothing congress , and do not support more government programs and control .
Sounds to me like we have a conservative revolution brewing .
Conservative leaders and thinkers such as Newt Gingrich , Jed Babbin , Governor Jindal of Louisiana , Thomas Sowell , Glenn Beck , Michelle Malkin , Governor Sarah Palin and others need to turn up the heat and bring this less government , more individual freedom and strong national defense revolution to a boil .
It is time .
Ted calls his piece : Rino Season
Is Now Open
He 's so delusional he does n't seem to understand that Americans have voted down Conservatism completely by electing Obama with a huge mandate .
And the Democrats are closing in on 60 seats in the Senate .
Yes Ted , Americans sure are fired up about conservatives .
And how does he feel about Obama ?
How do different wines taste ?
What is the relationship between wine varieties and flavor components ?
This visualization attempts to show the strength of these relationships .
I culled descriptive flavor words from over 5,000 published wine tasting notes written between 1995 - 2000 in a major Australian wine magazine .
Written by Carl Tashian for Visualizing the Five Senses , a class at ITP @ NYU .
Special thanks to chef Adam Melonas and sommelier Maria José Huertas for categorizing the flavor words .
Why is it a problem to place consideration of risk at the forefront of collective or institutional decision - making processes ?
Imagine that you had an array of specialized individual consultants that you could involve , one at a time , in your personal choices .
What would go wrong if you always chose to have a specialist in risk management be the first or dominant consultant you used in making decisions ?
Suppose you watch a documentary on climbing Mount Everest .
It ’s an upbeat travelogue , so it does n’t dwell on the deaths , the frozen mountain of shit , the crowding .
You say to your consultant , “ I find that really interesting .
I ’m really drawn to it .
What do you think ? ” .
If your first consultant is a risk manager , they ’re going to tell you about the high death rate from climbing Everest and about the immense expense of climbing Everest , which may threaten your financial solvency .
You are n’t ever going to get a chance to think about what interested you .
Did your heart thrill at the thought of standing on the highest mountain in the world ?
Or did you just want to go to the top of a mountain , any mountain ?
Did you want a motivating goal to drive a fitness program in roughly the same way people buy lottery tickets just to authorize dreaming about being rich ?
Did you want to just see what it looks like down in basecamp at Everest ?
Or are you interested in Nepal and Sherpa culture ?
You will not get the chance to ask what you valued in the thought of Everest in that initial inchoate moment of feeling .
If you just want to get way high up in some scenic mountains and you do n’t care how , the risk manager will have a useful answer for you after you have come to that conclusion .
Go to Zermatt , get on the cable car to the Klein Matterhorn , and enjoy .
If you want a safe hike , hike up to the Gornergrat and then go back on the railway .
If you just need an imaginary goal for fitness , you do n’t need the risk manager to step in and explain that trying to train too fast for climbing Everest will risk injuries –you need someone to design a fitness program that steps you up methodically .
If on the other hand , what really grabbed you was the idea of standing at the top of the highest mountain in the world , you still need to think without risk first .
Why do you value that ?
What ’s valuable about it ?
What awoke in you at that thought ?
Only after you ’ve thought that through should you ask , “ Is it worth it ? ” Because then you ’re asking : might I die ?
Be seriously injured ?
Spend my entire life savings ?
Get stuck in a queue for three years running ?
Be dismayed because the vision in your head is nothing like the current reality of climbing Everest ?
The risk manager ’s job is in theory just to lay out relative risks to you and leave you to think on it , but in practice most risk management is about risk reduction , never really about risk amplification–and yet , in some value - driven decisions , the risk is either necessary or even desired .
A man set on flying in a wingsuit through a narrow rock arch is looking for something risky and difficult to accomplish .
So if you listen to that litany of risks but you have n’t gotten clear in your own head what was driving the thought of “ stand at the top of the highest mountain ” , you may get talked down into something like “ Go to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire ” when actually what you really should get talked into is “ train for a peak in the Andes that ’s less crowded but equally dramatic and challenging ” , because you do n’t mind the risk of death and you do n’t mind the expense , you just mind the idea of standing in line with a bunch of other rich people looking at a mountain of frozen shit and some corpses that nobody wants to move .
Evaluating risk and liability should happen when we begin to act on decisions , not when we first envision them .
Risk evaluation should not propose , it should only dispose .

I understand why “ neoliberal ” seems like a word that is so expansively pejorative that it may seem to have no specific descriptive value .
But we need a word for a common form of organizational design and a common culture of shared decision - making that has dominated the 21st Century so far .
“ Managerial ” and “ technocratic ” grasp parts of that form but have their own shortcomings .
What are the specifics of the form that I think is best named by the word neoliberal ?
I ’m going to work up a definition here without a lot of reference to many of the excellent academic works that try to do the same , partly to clarify for myself what I ’m referring to with the term and to open up other possible words or labels .
First , a strange intertwining of utopian self - description layered over both internal deliberative process and external communications with a private , confidential and protected work process that acknowledges problems , shortcomings , and the social realities within the organization and in the organization ’s situatedness in the world , and yet is also curiously enough the space where the organization ’s actual goals and mission can be discussed , sometimes in fairly idealistic ways .
This may sound as if it only applies to higher education , but I think this is a reasonable description of law firms , hospitals , corporations , think - tanks , non-governmental organizations and so on .
The gap between how an organization presents itself to the world and how its internal cultures of work function is not particular to our neoliberal moment , but that gap is now especially intense and disorienting .
It has become all but impossible to speak forthrightly in ways that are visible , public and transcribed about the gaps between what an organization performs as its values and the ways in which values are inhabited and invoked in its actual practices .
Neoliberal organizations sometimes appropriate metaphorical framings of their internal processes and nature that do not at all match how they actually work or why they exist .
Especially favored is talk of “ community ” –the “ Walmart community ” , the “ World Bank community ” , the “ United Way community ” –and to talk of “ mission ” .
We need not understand these appropriations entirely cynically –their adoption and use is not often a coherent , calculated , top - down strategy with clear instrumental intent .
But generally they neither provide clarity nor opportunity for reflection .
Mission and community are invoked instead as a deferment of and disguise for hierarchy .
Sometimes cynically , sometimes mournfully : many organizations that have fallen in line with neoliberal sensibilities and practices do so with a sense of regretful surrender to a way of being that is everywhere and nowhere at once .
Second , organizations subject themselves and all who work on their behalf to the agonies of incremental progress towards goals that are chosen because they can be measured concretely and analyzed quantitatively .
The reasoning here is that values are often unquantified , complicated , arguable , so they cannot be used as a way to judge institutional or individual performance .
Increasingly , even , values are replaced under neoliberalism by missions and goals ( and stating those in measurable terms is increasingly favored ) .
Why is the measurement of performance important ?
Because institutions compete with one another and must prove their worth in commodified terms to clients and customers .
The better the performance on goals , the more valuable ( not value - driven ) the institution is .
And employees are seen in competitive terms to one another and to the larger labor markets they were hired from .
To justify remaining on the payroll , they must every year deliver incrementally more value in the accomplishment of the mission .
These missions are never rendered as startlingly new or fundamentally recommissioned , so progress must always be now and forevermore incremental , because to have a year in which progress happens with sudden speed amounts to a confession of persistent past failure–and sets up an impossible futureward expectation .
The point here is that neoliberalism in this sense despises the idea of the individual or collective maintenance of values , because that is something that might simply happen year in and year out , in stewardship or duty .
The lighthouse is maintained so the boats do not crash in the storm : it does n’t have to prove that it has been .5 % more effective in navigational efficiency compared to most lighthouses and hence should be preferred as the lighthouse of choice .
Neoliberalism abhors the language of values except as a way to manipulate people who still believe in vocation or mission into providing .05 % more quantifiable output in the coming year–or accepting 1 % less support for doing so .
Third , neoliberalism assumes and even often mandates the dissolution of public goods and accordingly also forces individual organizations to regard forms of large - scale collaboration on behalf of public goods as both improvident and illicit .
Governing authorities within neoliberal institutions , whether boards , owners , executives or even in rare cases , larger collectives , understand their due diligence as applying nearly exclusively to a single specific institution and often insist upon or reinforce its sovereign distinction from other institutions .
Institutions can join associations , but they do so much as nations might join international organizations , as permanently separate , autonomous and voluntary participants in associational bodies .
Much of this is explained in terms of compliance with antitrust statutes or other laws , and indeed , under neoliberalism , this is the one form of relation that institutions acknowledge to public goods or the wider society : a need to comply both with governmental regulation ( in letter , at least ) and often even with quasi-legal codes or regulatory obligations that are envisioned as necessarily and undebatably authoritative .
E.g. , neoliberalism insists on the autonomy of organizations except in terms of domination by other organizations or in terms of contractual obligations ( thought even those are frequently subject to complicated evasion and abrogation ) .
Competition , yes ; compliance , yes .
Collaboration ?
Reluctantly if is perceived to be allowed , and never at the risk of asserting genuine collective interest in a way that creates bonds of obligation , reciprocity and desire .
Older institutional infrastructures that do so are treated as undigested and troublesome fragments .
Fourth , neoliberalism thinks about resources in two primary ways : as something to be ceaselessly accumulated and as something to be regarded , seemingly paradoxically , as forever scarce .
No neoliberal institution , whether company or NGO or university or local non-profit ever sits comfortably on available resources , even asset - based wealth .
The organization must always have more , and the organization must always imagine itself as never having enough .
That is so pervasive a disposition that it spreads readily to everyone who works for any given organization , all the way down to entry - level employees .
No one imagines being custodians of a secure resource , spending it wisely as , in the older meaning of the term , trustees .
Everyone is looking for more , and everyone is eager to prove that they both need more and have done their part to get more .
Thus do companies sitting on unspeakably large cash reserves and non-profits with endowments in the billions convince themselves that they suffer from scarcity and its numerous psychological and cultural afflictions .
But at the same time , organizations are keenly aware that they have vast assets both tangible ( property , capital equipment , investments ) and potential ( unused or underused intellectual property , underutilized space or services , etc. ) and they work with great intensity to protect both what they own and what they might own someday .
Neoliberalism both seeks rents and works to protect its existing rents ; a neoliberal society is primarily an asset - based one .
And asset - based societies favor the first in and punish the last in –they are in some grand sense Ponzi schemes .
People chase IPOs with frankly idiotic companies like Juicero because they know that there is no other way to climb the ladder past the first few rungs : the existing base of accumulated wealth inside older neoliberal organizations is so vast that no new entrant can compete without the equivalent of an accumulative miracle .
( Or , as in “ disruption ” , without essentially destroying some class of asset holders and grabbing like children at the pinata candies that spill out –but just as at most pinata parties , the greedy and the bullies get most of the candy . )
— — — –
I take this detour to explain why risk management , usually in the form of legal counsel , stands in front of conversation and deliberation within institutions about values , even in institutions that are not ostensibly devoted to profit or growth .
That layer of institutional decision making exists to protect the assets that allow institutions to grow and compete in a world of rent - seekers–and the mission of protecting those assets dictates most of the rest of what I have described as neoliberal organizational culture .
The institution makes utopian promises that it knows are impossible , but it cannot acknowledge the gap or apologize for it , because such statements invite a lawsuit from a stakeholder who experienced that gap .
The institution seeks endless incremental improvement because dramatic reconsiderations of its purpose are far too risky –leave that for start - ups !
–but simply maintaining a steady hand at an ongoing mission is also too risky in an environment that requires everyone to perform competition against others .
Making decisions based upon deep underlying values–or deciding what those values really are –is too risky : what if the values lead you to some commitment that you ca n’t control or sublimate as necessary ?
This all sounds terribly abstract , and I mean it to sound that way , because I honestly think this is a deep habitus that runs across many kinds of organizational cultures that we are all influenced by and often are unaware of , that we take to be common sense or pragmatically necessary .
However , moments of crisis have a tendency to surface some of what is ordinarily buried inside everyday life .
So I will turn to a less abstract example : how U.S. higher education has made decisions in the face of the covid - 19 pandemic .
A necessary prelude to this analysis is that American higher education , like American businesses and civic organizations , has had to make decisions on its own in part because of the deliberately engineered failure of national leadership and the resulting divergent range of state and municipal leadership across the country .
In societies with more coherent national leadership , institutional leaders have had to worry about a much more constrained range of decisions that are being left to them .
In the US , higher education has been left to fill a howling void within a very constrained time frame .
Under that kind of pressure , no group of leaders , no community of professionals , could be expected to get everything right , no matter how they went about making decisions .
However , if you look at higher education in that crucible , I think you can see everywhere the signs of risk management and legal counsel being involved in the proposition , not disposition , of decisions .
Institutions like many community colleges that already make extensive use of online education and that do not have to deal with students coming from across the country or from outside the United States to be in residence on campus have had a more natural pathway to the fall semester .
They still have the same concerns about making classrooms safe for any in - person use if they decide to do that , the same problems with courses that aim to teach students physical skills for operating machines or using particular tools , and the same basic issues with operating in a disastrous economic environment .
On the other hand , institutions that put on - campus residential life at the heart of their operations almost universally made an abrupt decision in March of 2020 to send students home from dormitories and to close on - campus facilities to use by both students and employees .
Since that time , most residential institutions , public and private , small and large , have been wrestling with the question of what to do with summer programs and with the fall 2020 term .
Resolving that question has depended from the very beginning on having a forecast or model of the pandemic ’s likely course over the remainder of 2020 .
So the first and very sensible decision that almost every institution made was to wait until May or June to commit to any course of action and in the meantime consider the possible strategies they might employ in the fall .
The basic alternatives were also clear : operate normally with basic precautions , open fully but with unusual or extensive responses to the pandemic , open in a ‘ hybrid ’ or limited format with extensive pandemic management strategies , or close completely for a semester .
In the event that the pandemic was coming to some form of natural end by June , a normal opening would have been the obvious strategy , but even in March no reputable authority or forecaster saw that as likely or possible .
So the real debate almost from the beginning has been between full residential opening with extensive pandemic management , hybrid or limited openings that saw some or most students study online from their homes or off - campus housing , and a complete shutdown for the entire fall term .
It would be unfair to suggest that risk assessment be excluded from the making of this decision .
Anyone contemplating the stakes in this decision would be instantly aware that if the wrong option were chosen , the results could be illness and death , but also the chaos and financial costs of once again sending students home in an unplanned response to a deepening crisis .
But even here , that assessment ought to come after a deeper values - driven exploration of the question , “ What do we care about the most in thinking about a semester ?
What do we value about our work together when it is operating normally ? ”
Let me lay out what it looks like to decide about covid - 19 policies with those questions as the first you answer , rather than post - facto narratives that are attached , sometimes awkwardly or mysteriously , to decisions that were reached with risk , liability and image maintenance in mind .
A university or college could decide that first and foremost , they value students having the most deeply transformative and empowering educational experiences possible within the time that they are matriculated students , that the major reason the institution exists and should exist into the future is the provision of this experience .
Answering in this fashion does n’t have to be a consumerist answer : an institution could also maintain , in a values - driven way , that what it means by experience is not just a simple transactional service .
If this is the primary driving value , then a university might well decide that it is important to open despite covid - 19 .
But it is at this point that considering other values and considering pragmatic challenges to a values - driven decision should enter the picture .
For example , what other values might a university hold as rivalrous or at least important ?
A university might hold that it also values the production of knowledge in the form of scholarly research , clinical trials , and so on .
It might also take the rhetoric of “ community ” seriously and value its faculty , staff and students not as employees and customers , but in terms of their human relations–and obligations –to one another .
The university might regard its service to either a local public or some wider regional , state or national public to be deeply important , whether that is providing popular spectator sports for smaller cities and towns that otherwise have no local professional teams or it is as a civic benefactor , protector of open land , or source of cultural events .
It might even put one or more of those values above the provision of the most transformative educational experience for students , though I think few institutions would if it was put in these terms .
Putting these things in terms of values and subordinating talk of revenues , liabilities or risks sorts values into primary and dependent columns .
If the primary value is the most transformative and empowering education for enrolled students , then a university might decide that a precondition of that education are faculty and staff who are driven by their own autonomous and individual motivations to educate and produce knowledge , and that this in turn means requires an institution that genuinely means it when it pronounces itself a community .
Which in turn may turn over yet more dependent values .
For most of us , the word community implies non-hierarchical relationships between people living near one another .
When we mean it in a positive sense , most of us think about life in community in terms of mutual obligation to one another , as collective and shared responses to life ’s challenges .
It might not decide that , of course : there is a possible ( maybe even existing ) university where the people in control of it have decided that delivering the best education for students requires maximum hierarchical efficiency or it requires strong conformist alignment behind a single culture for both employees and students or it requires the maximum frictionless delivery of a commodified service to individual paying consumers .
Each of those might dictate a different position on opening in the fall of 2020 .
But for the university that says first that it values a vision of education as both individually and collectively empowering and transformative and that second it values the production of knowledge in service to wider publics and third it values organizing the labor of both of those commitments in terms of community , the decision about opening in the fall of 2020 rests on the interrelationship of these three values and what might keep them from being fully lived into .
They may have some intrinsic tensions .
Scholarship and teaching frequently inform one another , but not invariably so .
Communities that have to allocate a finite set of resources rarely make everyone feel happy even if they have completely democratic , consensus - driven deliberative processes .
In the case of covid - 19 , other tensions enter in .
What if some members of a community are more vulnerable to the disease ?
What if multigenerational communities specifically are vulnerable because of that ?
What if closure of other services or of critical infrastructure outside the university make it impossible to produce scholarship ?
The whole point about enunciating values clearly as a starting place is that you get to see where they conflict with one another and you get to decide how to resolve those conflicts .
That might mean putting one value above another .
It might mean deciding how to resolve conflicts between different values on a situational basis while continuing to insist that they are otherwise equal in the obligations they place upon people making decisions .
Risk , liability and revenues now finally enter the picture in their proper place .
Does the university need revenues that only reopening can provide in order to exist in six months or a year so that it can continue to fulfill those values ?
Do people in community need to avoid the danger of infecting one another in order to live up to what is meant by community ?
Is providing students a transformative and empowering education incompatible with increasing the chance that either they or their teachers and supporters might be sickened or that their families might be sickened as a result of contact with their children ( either on delivery to campus or return to home ) ?
Is it ever right to think of a fulfilling and transformative education as putting the life or safety of students at risk ?
I think it is perfectly possible to answer this question as “ yes ” : we accept that athletics involves the risk of serious injury , we accept that scholarly research in the world may involve the risk of injury , assault or death from accident or from the unpredictable actions of other people , we accept that the stresses of education may produce suffering or mental debility .
If we came to the conclusion that in a population of 5,000 students , around .1 % of those students would attempt to commit or commit suicide due in part to the stresses of the educational environment , most of us would still judge that the value of the education is such that we should continue to provide it .
But we would also likely say that we need to put resources into reducing that number to zero or as close to it as possible–and that if particular features of that education were causally responsible for that small fraction of cases , they should be modified or abandoned .
You do n’t start from the risk , but you eventually put it into relation alongside the values .
Even those of us who say , “ It is never acceptable to put a single life at risk to education a thousand people ” need to start first with what we value and get to risk assessment afterwards .
For the most part , institutions influenced by the culture of neoliberalism do n’t build that way .
Values or principles get declared as retroactive narratives designed to explain or justify commitments that were made to protect a particular configuration of assets from a perceived set of risks or liabilities .
I think you can see the signs of that all over how higher education as a whole has stumbled into the fall of 2020 , all the way back to Brown University President Christina Paxson ’s early op - ed that served more or less as a template for what would follow across the sector .
Students must come back , there must be testing and social distance and mask - wearing , there must be plexiglass installed .
But Paxson ’s essay really does n’t explain very thoughtfully why the provision of education at institutions like Brown is in fact important , because most of higher education takes for granted that what they offer is important and necessary without really thinking up to that importance from foundational values .
You can almost sense a kind of fear behind that early summer thinking that this crisis might actually reveal that absence –that forced to explain why we must do what we do , the sector as a whole finds itself stumbling for the deep convictions that would provide a stirring and persuasive answer and that in the giving of this answer , the question of “ What is to be done ? ” would begin to spell out its more specific answers .
If higher education has answered the question backwards , that ’s because it has been working from an analysis of revenues and from a reactive analysis of risks as they appear , both of which represent an attempt to cope with a profound rupture in our lives as if they were a whack - a- mole game at a carnival .
No answers that have deep meaning to sustain a community or that explain the reasons for the education to which we are so devoted can come via that route .
I also think it is no coincidence that both forms of institutional process are understood in modern institutional life to be the most necessarily unknown and unshared information within the institution ’s forms of self - knowledge–undercutting the value placed on community and on the production ( and consumption ) of formal knowledge as a public good .
The contract , the lawsuit ( or fear of one ) , the balance sheet are all documents that encode a particular vision of human values and human possibility and they are by their nature kept from community view and are exempt from its deliberations .
One could propose that by their natures , they enable all the other values that we might uphold .
That , at least , deserves an open discussion of the kind that neoliberal culture has generally foreclosed .

For almost 70 years , he 's seen off every " baddie " fate has thrown at him , from The Joker and Mr Freeze , to Catwoman and The Riddler .
But now Batman 's alter ego , Bruce Wayne , seems to have finally met his match : a middle - aged comic book writer from Glasgow .
In the final instalment of Batman R.I.P. , the latest series chronicling the veteran superhero , the Scottish author Grant Morrison apparently kills Mr Wayne , after allowing him to be ejected from a speeding aeroplane , without his famous cape and mask .
The closing page of Morrison 's new comic book , released to a mixture of frenzied anticipation and mounting controversy in the US – and in UK newsagents yesterday – ends with an eerie picture of the outfit fluttering to earth .
Wayne is missing , presumed dead .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Rumours of Wayne 's demise have been circulating for months , not least because of the title of the new DC Comics series , but reached fever pitch this week when Morrison , 48 , told an interviewer that the hero faced " a fate worse than death " .
He added : " This is the end of Bruce Wayne as Batman .
But , like I say , it 's so much better than death .
People have killed characters in the past but to me , that kind of ends the story .
I like to keep the story twisting and turning .
So what I am doing is a fate worse than death .
Things that no one would expect to happen to these guys at all . "
The comments prompted an instant backlash from fans , who flooded the internet with protests .
" Do not buy this book , " wrote one blogger .
" Bruce IS Batman .
There has to be a campaign against this . "
Another disgruntled fan wrote simply , " Thanks for vomiting over my childhood " .
Either way , yesterday 's apparent end of Wayne 's crime - fighting career – at the hands of a crime syndicate called The Black Glove who inject him with heroin and crystal meth – certainly marked the end of an era .
The character , a wealthy Gotham City socialite who publicly appears to be a feckless playboy , has been behind Batman 's mask since the hero made his first outing in 1939 , with his occasional sidekick Robin , in the publication Detective Comics .
He has spawned a popular TV series , and a slew of blockbuster films , including this year 's The Dark Knight , which took more than $ 500 m ( £ 325 ) at the box office , making it the second highest - grossing film on record .
And it is tipped for several Oscars , with the late Heath Ledger odds - on to secure the best supporting actor gong at February 's awards ceremony , thanks to his performance as The Joker .
Co-stars included Christian Bale and Gary Oldman .
But the enduring commercial value of the Batman franchise means that Warner Brothers , who own DC Comics , are unlikely to kill off the superhero altogether .
Morrison , a famous figure in science - fiction circles who was employed to plot the superhero 's future in 2006 , has already announced plans for a new series of Batman comics called The Battle for the Cowl , featuring a " replacement " for Wayne .
That may not satisfy hardcore fans , and spokesmen for DC Comics were refusing to offer on - the - record guidance on the implications of their newly - released comic book 's ending .
But sources close to the firm indicated that reports of Wayne 's death may , in the words of Mark Twain , may have been slightly exaggerated .
" This is certainly the most serious thing that 's ever happened to Wayne , far worse , for example , than the incident where he broke his back during the 1990s , " one expert said .
" But even if readers were actually shown his body , ( and remember , they have n't in this case ) there will always be potential for a comeback . " said one expert .
Morrison has a history of courting controversy , for example , revealing two years ago that Batman has a son , but he is anxious not to upset longstanding fans , the source added .
" In comic books , we have something called The Bucky Clause , which means that no character is actually dead forever .
I hope fans will look at the circumstances of what Grant Morrison has done to Batman , and read between the lines , and find a reason to hope that he will be back . "
When NASA released this image from their Lunar Orbiter 1 back in 1966 , the first photograph ever of the Earth rising above the Moon 's surface , it was low resolution but they still amazed the world .
This week , they have surprised every space aficionado re-releasing the same image in ultra-high definition .
The cool part now is that NASA has n't used any upscaling or magical infinite zoom - in filter from CSI .
Instead , they have created a new technology that uses refurbished analog machines and a new digital process that fully extracts the information stored in the program 's old magnetic tapes , something that was impossible to do in the 60s .
Click on the image to watch it in its 3673 x 1740 pixel glory .
The Lunar Orbiter missions included five spacecrafts dedicated to map the entire lunar surface , a task necessary to select the landing sites for Apollo .
The first three missions focused on twenty potential landing sites , while the two last ones - which flew high altitude polar orbits - took photographs of 99 % of the surface with a resolution that ranged from 60 meters to an stunning 2 meter .
While these probes were not as sophisticated as the HD cameras of the Selene spacecraft developed by the Japanese space agency , the NASA orbiters had a clever imaging system that achieved similar results four decades ago .
It included a dual lens camera - one 610 millimeter narrow angle for high resolution and an 80 millimeter wide angle for medium resolution - , a film processor , and a scanner .
Both lenses were aligned to expose the same part of the 70 millimeter film roll , so the high resolution image area was centered with the medium resolution area .
This was more complicated that it sounds :
Since the spaceship was cruising above the lunar surface , they had to compensate for that motion .
Using an electro - optical sensor to measure the distance while a small motor shifted the film so the second exposure exactly matched the first one .
After that , the film was processed , scanned , and the information send back to Earth , where it was stored in analog tapes .
Now , the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project at NASA 's Ames Research Center , is retrieving and analyzing all the data stored in those tapes .
To do this , first they restored the original tape recorders and 1,500 of these tapes .
Then they digitized the data into modern computer , putting it through special software designed to extract all that information to produce the image you are seeing here .
Their goal is to do this with every single image lurking inside those tapes , which then will be mapped to standard coordinates and sent to NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
Their objective is not only preserving and enhancing these historical documents , but also provide the scientific community with refreshed information prior to next year 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission .

VERDICT OF HISTORY ON BUSH WILL BE HARSH , AUTHOR SAYS
By Sherwood Ross
The judgment of history may well be that the United States has been “ taken into , and kept in , the Iraq War by a guy who is not quite right in his head , ” a distinguished legal scholar says .
“ It may take 25 or 50 years , but it is almost certain that one day this character will be exhibit number one for the danger of having a nut job in the oval office , ” says Lawrence Velvel , dean of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover .
Writing in his latest book , “ An Enemy of the People , ” ( Doukathsan Press ) Velvel said , “ In everyday life , someone who refuses to recognize the actual facts of the world around him , and who instead lives in a dream world in his head , is regarded as not being sane , as being , to use the blunt words , insane or crazy .
Why is it different when it is a national leader who refuses to recognize facts in the world and instead lives in a dream world in his head ? ” 
Velvel goes on to say , “ Most interesting is the idea that Bush suffers from a condition called “ ˜dry drunk ’ .
Essentially , this means that even if one eventually stops drinking , as Bush did , years of alcoholism cause irreversible damage to brain chemistry .
Results of this damage include such Bushian traits as rigid judgmentalism , irritability , impatience , grandiosity , obsessive thought patterns , incoherent speech and other unlovely characteristics . ” 
“ Bush also seems to have chacteristics , ”  Velvel continues , “ that , whether or not they are characteristic of “ ˜dry drunks ’ are symptomatic of people who do n’t fully have a grip .
These include immense anger , exploitativeness , arrogance , lack of empathy , and difficulties arising from relationships with one ’s father . ” 
“ With regard to the specific analyses of Bush , there seems to be wide agreement that Bush is a sociopath , defined , one gathers , as someone who feels no empathy with others , who cannot feel for others , who does not feel or care for their pain ( to use Clintonian jargon , ”  ) Velvel writes .
“ That Bush is utterly devoid of empathy seems plainly true to me .
Unlike Lincoln or even Lying Lyndon Johnson , who sent people to their deaths but agonized over it , Bush is thought by the shrinks , and appears to the lay eye , to give not one damn about how many Americans he kills , let alone Iraqis . ” 
Explaining why Bush can’t feel guilt , Velvel writes : “ Given his defense mechanisms , one gathers , and his psychology of having to overcome obstacles , overcome his father , etc. , one gathers that Bush is a sociopath ( or another word for it , a psychopath ) .
Using charm as a vehicle for aggrandizement , he can’t allow himself to feel guilt and so feels no empathy for all those he smashes up in his pursuit of is grandiosity and delusions . ” 
Velvel professes amazement that a man of Bush ’s character could rise to the White House : “ One wondered how he could have been picked as the nominee and then elected .
After all , it was clearly early - on that he not only had been a long - time drunk , but had failed at every business venture , so that time and again he had to be rescued by Daddy ’s friends and wanna be friends . ” 
He goes on to say , “ Bush ’s life refutes fundamental values we grew up with : hard work , competence , intelligence , modesty .
His life , with its drunkenness , serial failures , lack of competence , repeated salvation via Daddy and Daddy ’s friends , all followed by the presidency no less , and by disastrous ill - considered policies , makes a joke of the values we absorbed as youths and still try to live by . ” 
Living in his Father ’s shadow , Velvel writes , “ his own lack of diligence and intelligence caused him to be mediocre or a failure everywhere for about 25 years ; he was mediocre at Andover ; he was mediocre at Yale ; he was a drunk to the point where he could cure himself only by stopping cold turkey ” ¦ conceivably he escaped a securities prosecution only because Daddy was president . ” 
Velvel writes , “ One view is that Bush has a narcissistic personality .
Due to insecurities , he has constructed a grandiose vision of himself and is thus immune to the criticisms or views of those who do not go along with his views .
Because he is no intellect ( to put it mildly ) , he dismisses intellect entirely , and utilized his strength , personal affability , to win over others .
Narcissistically , he apparently will do anything to protect his psyche from the destruction of being shown wrong — including causing the deaths of thousands of Americans and Iraqis in pursuit of a mere long shot opportunity to proceed . ” 
The author believes it is necessary for psychiatrists to investigate political personalities to find out what makes them different from the rest of us once in power .
“ It seems to me that people in today ’s America who seek and reach office are different from you and me and other decent people in this society , ”  Velvel writes .
“ They are willing to say and do things that would make a lot of the decent people gag , maybe make all of the decent people gag .
Psychiatry should investigate , should analyze , what kind of people these are who will say and do these things , and why they are like they are .
Why investigate and analyze this ?
For the obvious reasons , so that we can know what we are faced with , and can start looking for and electing a better kind of person . ” 
Dean Velvel is cofounder of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , a law school purposefully dedicated to providing minorities , immigrants , and working - class students a quality , affordable legal education .
The dean has been honored for his contributions to the reform of legal education by The National Law Journal and has been described as a leader in the law school reform movement by The National Jurist .

Dear Cecil :
In Science magazine a while back an article about the latest attempts to calculate pi to the umpteen zillionth decimal place made a passing reference to a curious Oklahoma law .
It said Oklahoma legislators had passed a law making pi equal to 3.0 .
I also remember Robert Heinlein in one of his novels mentioning that Tennessee had passed a similar law .
Did either of these states ever pass such a law ?
Are they still on the books ?
What are the penalties if I proclaim that pi equals 3.14159 … ?
Wulf Losee , Andover , Connecticut
Cecil replies :
Cecil had heard this story too , only the state in question was Kansas , leading him to believe the whole thing was made up by big-city sharpies having a little fun at the expense of the rustics .
However , with the help of Joseph Madachy , editor of the Journal of Recreational Mathematics , I ’ve learned the story does have a germ of truth to it .
It happened in Indiana .
Although the attempt to legislate pi was ultimately unsuccessful , it did come pretty close .
In 1897 Representative T.I. Record of Posen county introduced House Bill # 246 in the Indiana House of Representatives .
The bill , based on the work of a physician and amateur mathematician named Edward J. Goodwin ( Edwin in some accounts ) , suggests not one but three numbers for pi , among them 3.2 , as we shall see .
The punishment for unbelievers I have not been able to learn , but I place no credence in the rumor that you had to spend the rest of your natural life in Indiana .
Just as people today have a hard time accepting the idea that the speed of light is the speed limit of the universe , Goodwin and Record apparently could n’t handle the fact that pi was not a rational number .
“ Since the rule in present use [ presumably pi equals 3.14159 … ] fails to work … , it should be discarded as wholly wanting and misleading in the practical applications , ” the bill declared .
Instead , mathematically inclined Hoosiers could take their pick among the following formulae :
(1) The ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference is 5 / 4 to 4 .
In other words , pi equals 16/5 or 3.2
(2) The area of a circle equals the area of a square whose side is 1/4 the circumference of the circle .
Working this out algebraically , we see that pi must be equal to 4 .
(3) The ratio of the length of a 90 degree arc to the length of a segment connecting the arc ’s two endpoints is 8 to 7 .
This gives us pi equal to the square root of 2 x 16/7 , or about 3.23 .
There may have been other values for pi as well ; the bill was so confusingly written that it ’s impossible to tell exactly what Goodwin was getting at .
Mathematician David Singmaster says he found six different values in the bill , plus three more in Goodwin ’s other writings and comments , for a total of nine .
Lord knows how all this was supposedly to clarify pi or anything else , but as we shall see , they do things a little differently in Indiana .
Bill # 246 was initially sent to the Committee on Swamp Lands .
The committee deliberated gravely on the question , decided it was not the appropriate body to consider such a measure and turned it over to the Committee on Education .
The latter committee gave the bill a “ pass ” recommendation and sent it on to the full House , which approved it unanimously , 67 to 0 .
In the state Senate , the bill was referred to the Committee on Temperance .
( One begins to suspect it was silly season in the Indiana legislature at the time . )
It passed first reading , but that ’s as far as it got .
According to The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers , the bill “ was held up before a second reading due to the intervention of C.A. Waldo , a professor of mathematics [ at Purdue ] who happened to be passing through . ”
Waldo , describing the experience later , wrote , “ A member [ of the legislature ] then showed the writer [ i.e. , Waldo ] a copy of the bill just passed and asked him if he would like an introduction to the learned doctor , its author .
He declined the courtesy with thanks , remarking that he was acquainted with as many crazy people as he cared to know . ”
The bill was postponed indefinitely and died a quiet death .
According to a local newspaper , however , “ Although the bill was not acted on favorably no one who spoke against it intimated that there was anything wrong with the theories it advances .
All of the Senators who spoke on the bill admitted that they were ignorant of the merits of the proposition .
It was simply regarded as not being a subject for legislation . ”
As for Representative T.I. Record — well , I have n’t been able to confirm this .
But some say he changed his name to Quayle .
The wisdom of Solomon : Not what it ’s cracked up to be
Dear Cecil :
Your response to the question about attempts to legislate pi suggests not only that your scholarship is weak but that you are a heathen .
When King Solomon constructed the Temple of Jerusalem , the Second Book of Chronicles , chapter 4 , verses 2 and 5 , tells us :
“ Then he made the Sea [ a big tub ] of cast bronze , ten cubits from one brim to the other ; it was completely round .
Its height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference .
It was a handbreadth thick ; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup …..
It contained three thousand baths . ”
The ratio of 30 cubits for the circumference to 10 cubits for the diameter “ from one brim to the other ” of the “ completely round ” circle gives the value of pi as being exactly 3 .
Perhaps reliance on the Word of God motivated the Indiana legislators you trashed .
You should have checked with the ultimate reference .

Cecil replies :
Some of the mail I get is unbelievable .
As I attempted to point out , the Indiana legislature did not consider making pi equal to 3 , but rather to 3.2 , 4 , or approximately 3.23 , depending on which formula you used .
Neither the text of the bill nor any of the commentaries regarding it refer to the Bible .
Perhaps Tennessee , Oklahoma , Kansas or one of the other states I mentioned was the one that attempted to a legislate a pi of biblical proportions .
Interesting you should bring this up , though .
In 150 A.D. a Hebrew rabbi and scholar named Nehemiah attempted to explain away the anomaly in Chronicles by saying that the diameter of the tub was 10 cubits from outer rim to outer rim , whereas the 30 cubit circumference was measured around the inner rim .
In other words , the difference between the biblical notion of pi and the actual value may be accounted for by the width of the tub ’s walls .
How ’s that for tap dancing , eh ?
Nehemiah lived a long time ago , but I feel he ’s my spiritual kin .

If you have been around Chinese for any length for time , you cannot help but notice that many of us are very particular about anything that has to do with numbers .
I do n’t even know if it ’s really “ numerology ” as is understood in the West but it really has to do with how a particular digit is phonetically sounded out .
The Chinese culture is very superstitious .
It is taken for granted that there are ghosts , goblins , and spirits living in our midst .
This attitude has diminished slightly in modern times with the concerted effort of the Chinese government since the establishment of the Peoples Republic to “ re-educate ” the population to abandon some of the more obvious unscientific and irrational thinking .
But superstitions associated with numbers still persist .
Today , in the Chinese communities of very modern and technologically advanced metropolis in Asia such as Hong Kong , Taipei , Singapore or in North America such as San Francisco , Vancouver and Toronto , you will probably not see joysticks and incense burning at the entrance of businesses to ward off evil spirits , but real estate agents will attest to the fact that they cannot possibility sell a house with address “ 5358 4th Street ” to a Chinese family .
The hang - up with numbers among Chinese is a direct result of the conjunction between a superstitious culture and a monosyllabic language .
Each word in the language has a monotonic sound and is represented in writing by a single character .
But then many different characters or words have the same sound so if you just hear one character or word pronounced , you can not pin down the meaning .
In other words , homonyms are numerous in the language .
The equivalent in English would be words like “ see ” and “ sea ” or “ break ” and “ brake ” which when just sounded out cannot be properly identified unless they are put in a phrase or sentence .
Now , consider a language where every word has that problem .
It is therefore not surprising that most Chinese jokes are puns and play on rhyming words .
In addition to the monosyllabic nature of the spoken word , it is also tonal and inflection dependent , i.e. the same sound when uttered with rising or falling tone or inflection will have a different meaning .
Of the many dialects in China , the Cantonese dialect has the most possible tonal variation for the same sound – basically with the same sound , say it four different ways tonally , you get four different concepts ( written out differently . )
Some sounds have as many as 7 possible tones and inflections – while 3 or 4 are common .
Take the sound “ ma . ”
When said with a flat tone , it means “ mother , ” from flat to low , it means “ horse . ”
When pronounced with a low to high inflection , it means , “ to scold or chastise ” and from low to a lower inflection it means “ jute or hemp . ” [ ok , find a native Cantonese speaker and ask him / her to sound out “ ma ” the different ways and challenge yourself to figure out the difference – it ’s subtle . ]
Understanding this linguistic aspect of the culture , one can appreciated why many Chinese superstitions are fantastic associations of words and phonetic play on words .
The word for bat is “ fook ” which phonetically is the same as the word for “ good luck ” and the word for deer is “ luk ” which is a phonetically the same as the word for “ promotion and career success ” and is also phonetically identical to the number “ 6 . ”
So the tradition gift for a college graduate would be embroidery or posters with bat and deer motive and any gift sets of six of anything is good .
The word for “ tangerine ” is phonetically the same as the word for “ gold ” so during Chinese New Year feasts , we give each other tangerines .
When we say “ Here ’s some tangerine for you ” it is completely phonetically indistinguishable from saying “ Here ’s some gold for you . ”
Even though I grew up with this type of thinking , I cannot say how much of this is taken seriously or just fanciful word play .
But when it comes to homonyms or words that just rhymes with numbers , it is taken as serious as the incest taboo !
Because of the difference in pronunciations of the numbers in different dialects , superstitions associated with numbers differ in different regions of China .
But by far , in Southern China , where Cantonese is the predominant dialect , superstitions associated with Cantonese pronunciation of the numerals are numerous .
This is also true of Chinese communities in all major cities in Southeast Asia , Canada and the U.S. where Cantonese speakers are in the majority .
So , here are the homonyms and rhymes of the 9 digits when sounded out in Cantonese :
One – “ yat ” – means “ certainty ” when used in a sentence .
Two – “ yee ” – homonyms with word for easy .
Three – “ sarm ” – rhymes with “ sarn ” – life , to give birth .
Four – “ say ” – rhymes with “ saay ” – to die , death .
Five – “ ng ” – homonym with word for not ; prefix to negate any verb or make opposite any adjective like “ un - “ in English .
Six – “ luk ” – homonym with word for career success , promotion .
Also homonym with word for deer .
Seven – “ chut ” – the number is associated with death !
Eight – “ bard ” – rhymes with “ fard ” – to prosper and accumulate wealth .
Nine – “ gauw ” – rhymes with “ gow ” - enough or sufficient .
Also homonym with word for dog .
Ten – “ sup ” – not a problem in Cantonese but in pronounce in Mandarin , it ’s a homonym with word for death and rhymes with “ four . ”
So now we can have some fun with numbers .
You certainly do n’t want to live on 4th street ( “ death ” street ? ) and of course 2nd street is always good ( “ easy ” street . )
Combine the digits and you can really max out with good fortune living in house no .
368 on 2nd Street ( “ life , career success , and prosperity ” on “ easy ” street . )
If you have to rent an office in a professional building , go for Suite 288 ( “ easy to prosper ” and “ prosper . ” ) and stay away from Suite 2424 ( “ easy death , easy death . ” )
Precede any good number with the digit 5 and things become problematic – so 58 is “ no prosperity ” and 53 is “ no life ” or worst yet “ infertile . ”
While 13 may be an unlucky number in the West , 14 to the Cantonese is “ certain death . ”
Advice to the uninitiated : when in doubt , string on the 8 ’s – the more the merrier and you ca n’t go wrong whenever a number has lots of 8’s .
What you have to realize is that because rhythms and homonym are such an integral part of the spoken language , you cannot avoid thinking about “ death ” every time you say “ four ” or think “ prosperity ” whenever you say “ eight . ”
It is then necessary to make sure that bad words do n’t come out of your mouth if you can avoid it at all .
You avoid numbers like 4 , 5 or 7 and go for 3 ’s and 8 ’s if you have a choice to select anything that has numbers .
If you live on 4th street , you cannot avoid giving directions to visitors on how to get to “ death street . ”
The problem compounds if you already have the predisposition to believe that ghosts and spirits surrounds you .
Why tempt fate by saying “ death ” , “ certain death ” , “ no life ” , “ no prosperity ” , “ enough career success ” etc if you can avoid it at all .
When you give out your telephone number to a potential client , do you really want to say “ die , die , die ” if the last 3 digits of your telephone number is “ 444 ? ”
When I accompany my mom to the doctor , I cannot possibly tell her we are going up to Suite 414 ( “ death , certain death . ” )
From my personal experience and observation , most of the Chinese population in the U.S. are fairly well educated and are a little less superstitious then their countrymen in the “ old country . ”
However , that is not true of Chinese business owners .
They are a very superstitious lot when it comes to numerology which may influence their ability to make money – lots of money .
There is no end to their quest for business addresses , telephone numbers and auto license plates with the correct lucky , good fortune , prosperity - inducing digits .
Houses and business addresses with good , lucky numbers can fetch a higher selling or rental price if the buyer is Chinese .
Stories abound in Asian business centers of business tycoons who paid over a million US dollars for lucky number license plates or telephone numbers .
So , here ’s a couple of moneymaking ideas for you if you live in a community with lots of Chinese .
If you have a cell phone number or license plate with lots of 8 ’s , 3 ’s , or 6’s and no 5 ’s to negate all the good stuff , try auctioning it off – some Chinese business owner will buy it from you for sure .
You can be certain that all personalized license plates in California with lots of 8 ’s , 3 ’s and 6’s have been purchased by Chinese .
If you work in auto sales , discount a $ 20,000 car to $ 18,888 for a Chinese propect and you ’ll make the sale !
Now , the Real Estate Sale Agent of the Year Award should go to the agent who can sell a house with address No. 5358 on 4th Street to a Chinese family !
House number “ no life / infertile , no prosperity ” on “ death ” street is a no sale but to a diehard skeptic like me it may be a bargain .

This page is devoted to learning methods building on kernels , such as the support vector machine .
It grew out of earlier pages at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics and at GMD FIRST , snapshots of which can be found here and here .
In those days , information about kernel methods was sparse and nontrivial to find , and the kernel machines web site acted as a central repository for the field .
It included a list of people working in the field , and online preprints of most publications .
Nowadays , this no longer makes sense , partly because the field is very popular , so there are too many people and papers to make such lists useful , and partly because search engines do the job much more conveniently .
But what really forced us to do a major update of the site was the fact that spammers discovered our site , and it was no longer possible to operate a system which was built on the trust that people who submit an entry do so to improve the quality of the site .

Some 6,000 Ecstasy pills were seized Friday during a police raid on two synagogues in Rishon Lezion 's Shikun Hamizrach neighborhood .
Local police , who were tipped off about the drugs a few days ago , found 3,000 Ecstasy pills and a pistol concealed in the ceiling of a synagogue on Shivtei Yisrael Street .
An additional 3,000 pills were found in the bathroom of another synagogue located nearby .
Investigators said the drug dealers , who are still at large , apparently planned to sell the pills at a party that was scheduled to be held in the coming days .
Beating Kelvin's Partition of Space
Several views of the Weaire - Phelan partition are shown below .
A fundamental region of 8 different colored cells is shown .
Two cells ( green and blue ) are dodecahedra , and the other six are 14 - sided with two opposite hexagonal faces and 12 pentagonal faces .
The 14 - sided cells stack into three sets of orthogonal columns , and the dodecahedra fit into the interstices between the columns .
There is no proof that the Weiare - Phelan partition is optimal , or that Kelvin 's partition is optimal for a single shape of cell .
R. Kusner and J. Sullivan have proved analytically that the polyhedral Weaire - Phelan foam beats any foam with the Kelvin topology , removing any possible doubts about numerical inaccuracies .
The area calculations and these images were made with the Surface Evolver program , with the datafiles twointor .

Schumer : $ 500 billion to $ 700 billion stimulus
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , said Sunday that he thinks the economic stimulus package should be between $ 500 billion and $ 700 billion .

He added that Congress is working on getting the economic package to President - elect Barack Obama by Inauguration Day .
" I think it has to be deep .
In my view , it has to be between $ 500 and $ 700 billion , and that 's because our economy is in serious , serious trouble . "

The adorable twin panda cubs bred in captivity just months after killer earthquake
As these adorable twin giant panda cubs playfully roll around on the floor , they seem worlds away from the devastating earthquake that destroyed much of their habitat in south west China .
They are one of the first twins delivered this year at the Bifengcia base of the China Giant Panda Protection and Research Center in Yaan , in the Sichuan Province .
The cubs are said to be in good health just five months after an earthquake left an important panda habitat , the Wolong Nature Reserve , largely destroyed .
Peek - a - boo : A carer looks after one of the giant panda cub twins in an incubator
Cuddly :
The twins celebrated their 100 day birthday in keeping with traditional Chinese tradition
But there was cause for celebration for the endangered species as the centre prepared a naming ceremony for the twin cubs 100 days days after their birth - in keeping with traditional Chinese custom .
Thirteen giant panda have been born this year at the centre .
Scientists at the research base hope to increase the captive population of giant pandas and ultimately reintroduce the distinctive black and white animals to the wild , with the help of artificial breeding .
Affectionate : A researcher cuddles one of the twins
Breeding success :
The twins are among the thirteen giant pandas that have been born this year at the research base
Before the earthquake - which hit on May 12 killing 70,000 people - there were 63 pandas kept at Wolong .
After the quake hit , 53 of them were transferred to breeding bases in other areas .
The rest were kept in safe places at Wolong .
Among the panda casualties were one killed , one missing and another became sick and died .
Time out :
One of the twins spreads out while the other enjoys a snack
There are only around 1,590 pandas living in China , mostly in the Sichuan area and the northwestern provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu .
Last year , the number of captive bred giant pandas was 239 .
Giant pandas are known for being sexually inactive .
Their numbers have been dwindling because of of their shrinking habitat .
I met up with old friend and design thinking colleague Colin Burns last night .
He is back living in bucolic Scotland these days and one of his many activities is to help out his friends Henry and Mo with their delicatessen in Kenmore on Loch Tay .
The story Colin told me was that his wife Elaine came up with the idea of Credit Crunch cookies when Henry and Mo were talking about how the sale of cookies had soared since the credit crunch stories had started .
You can check out Credit Crunch Cookies here and while I know this is shameless promotion I think it is a fantastic example of someone taking advantage of new consumer behaviors in a recession .
Cookies represent an inexpensive way of having a treat when times are tough .
This is something I have been wondering about quite a bit recently .
If a recession hits the reset switch for all of us then what new behaviors emerge that represent opportunities for innovation ?
Thinking back it seems like low cost airlines emerged in the recession of the late 80's and early 90's when consumers decided flying cheaply was more important than reserving your seat or having a crumby meal .
That recession created a new industry that has gone on to disrupt nearly all of the existing incumbents .
I would argue that the recession of 2001 created new behaviours as well .
The uncertainty created by 9/11 combined with the new access to the internet was a boon to any service that provided information , advice and reassurance .
Google was the big winner but so was Trip Advisor , Angie 's List and WebMD .
While the dotcom crash weeded out many of the weaker on - line offerings it also reinforced those that really did offer more for less just when we wanted it .
I am very interested in what new behaviors might emerge this time around and ultimately what innovations they may inspire .
Will it be something to do with people changing their attitude toward saving versus spending ?
Will the growing uncertainty of the world encourage us to look for lives that are more resilient and sustainable versus ones where we are on the limit and vulnerable to the next downturn ?
It seems to me that now is the time that companies would be well served to think about this so that they are ready with the answers when the market turns .
After all it is n't only Credit Crunch Cookies that have the potential to make a killing .

WITH the price of crude mired at half the peak of $ 147 it reached in July , this may seem like an odd time to invest in oil wells .
Despite trimming its output along with other members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) in an effort to prop up prices , that is just what the United Arab Emirates plans to do .
Short - term price movements , its oil minister insists , should not distract from the world 's enduring thirst for oil .
Indeed the collapse of oil prices , one of the few reasons around for economic cheer , may be setting the stage for another spike .
Just now oilmen are focused on the rapidly slowing demand for their product .
Since early October , reckons the boss of BP , a big oil firm , America 's consumption of crude has fallen by perhaps 2 m barrels a day , or about a tenth .
Sales of cars in America fell even more steeply last month — by 32 % .
There is also gloomy news from emerging markets , which have been the driving force in the oil markets of late .
Demand for oil is growing much more slowly in China and India , for example , and car sales are down in both countries .
There is even talk of global oil demand falling next year , for the first time since 1991 .
In the face of these grim statistics , OPEC decided last month to pump 1.5 m fewer barrels a day ( about 2 % of global consumption ) , starting from November 1st .
Several of its members want another cut soon .
The output of big Western oil firms is also declining , thanks to decreasing output from their existing fields and a relative dearth of new opportunities to replace them .
Production continues to fall in once - prolific spots such as Russia , Mexico and the North Sea .
So far , faltering demand has outweighed feeble supply , keeping the price near $ 70 a barrel .
That is below the level needed to justify further investment in the expensive projects open to Western oil firms , such as extracting oil from the viscous tar sands of Canada .
The boss of Total , another big oil firm , puts the cost of developing new tar - sands operations at $ 90 a barrel .
Naturally enough , several firms have delayed planned expansions and cut investment budgets .
Some refiners are following suit .
The cost of production is no more static than the price of oil .
Falling prices for important raw materials , such as steel and natural gas , should help to bring down development costs .
By the same token , the cost of hiring some kinds of drilling rigs is falling .
The strengthening dollar also helps , points out Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank , since that tends to increase oil firms ' dollar - denominated revenue relative to expenses in other currencies .
But according to Francisco Blanch of Merrill Lynch , the rising cost of capital is likely to outweigh all these benefits .
Tar - sands schemes , like most oil projects , are very capital - intensive and so very sensitive to changes in financing costs .
He believes that higher borrowing charges could push the cost of new tar - sands developments as high as $ 150 a barrel by 2010 .
So if demand for oil has started growing again by then , and if tar sands remain the source of marginal production , then the oil price will have to rise back to this summer 's levels to stimulate increased supply .
“ The age of easy oil ” , warns the Emirati minister , “ is gone forever . ”
Let me be clear on one point : I ca n’t predict the short - term movements of the stock market .
I have n’t the faintest idea as to whether stocks will be higher or lower a month  or a year  from now .
What is likely , however , is that the market will move higher , perhaps substantially so , well before either sentiment or the economy turns up .
So if you wait for the robins , spring will be over .

A little history here : During the Depression , the Dow hit its low , 41 , on July 8 , 1932 .
Economic conditions , though , kept deteriorating until Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in March 1933 .
By that time , the market had already advanced 30 percent .
Or think back to the early days of World War II , when things were going badly for the United States in Europe and the Pacific .
The market hit bottom in April 1942 , well before Allied fortunes turned .
Again , in the early 1980s , the time to buy stocks was when inflation raged and the economy was in the tank .
In short , bad news is an investor ’s best friend .
It lets you buy a slice of America ’s future at a marked - down price .
Over the long term , the stock market news will be good .
In the 20th century , the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts ; the Depression ; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics ; oil shocks ; a flu epidemic ; and the resignation of a disgraced president .
Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497 .
You might think it would have been impossible for an investor to lose money during a century marked by such an extraordinary gain .
But some investors did .
The hapless ones bought stocks only when they felt comfort in doing so and then proceeded to sell when the headlines made them queasy .
Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable .
They should n’t .
They have opted for a terrible long - term asset , one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value .
Indeed , the policies that government will follow in its efforts to alleviate the current crisis will probably prove inflationary and therefore accelerate declines in the real value of cash accounts .
Of course there ’s nothing all that unusual about a spy going to work for a Washington thinktank .
Ex -CIA employees do it all the time : so do all sorts of other spooks , who would otherwise be haunting the world ’s darkest corners .
No big deal .
But what I ’ve never seen , and do n’t recall ever hearing about , is the spectacle of a spy for a foreign country being hired by any organization that hopes to influence U.S. foreign policy .
Well , here ’s one for the record books : the Middle East Forum has hired Steve Rosen , once the head of policy development for the America Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
Rosen is accused of stealing highly classified information from the U.S. government and passing it on to Israeli government officials .
Rosen was the sparkplug of AIPAC , known for implementing  with notable success  the powerful lobbying group ’s efforts to influence the executive branch .
The very effective modus operandi of this behind - the - scenes wheeler dealer was summed up by his reported comment that :
" A lobby is like a night flower .
It thrives in the dark and dies in the sun . "
Slinking about in the shadows , Rosen and his sidekick Keith Weissman  an Iran expert  cultivated one Larry Franklin , the Pentagon policy department ’s top Iran analyst , and pried top secret intelligence from him , including information on al Qaeda , the Khobar Towers terrorist attack , and Iranian armaments .
Before the FBI descended on him , Franklin had been passing information to the AIPAC espionage team for over a year , planning to advance his career using the influential lobby as his sponsor : he hoped for a spot on Bush ’s National Security Council .
In return , he gave his handlers access to some of America ’s most closely guarded secrets .
When FBI agents finally paid him a visit , he led them to a treasure trove of stolen top secret dossiers kept in his Alexandria,0 Virginia home  a veritable library of classified information , 83 documents in all , spanning three decades .
The arrest was prefigured by two FBI raids on AIPAC headquarters in Washington : federal law enforcement descended on the building early in the morning , without warning , surrounded the place and carted away loads of evidence .
Four AIPAC officials were handed subpoenas .
Franklin pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years in a federal prison and a $ 10,000 fine , agreeing to testify for the prosecution .
Rosen and Weissman pleaded innocent , and their top - flight lawyers have kept pretrial maneuvering ongoing for four years this past August .
Their very effective method : greymail .
Apparently , the purloined information is so sensitive that it cannot be revealed without compromising America ’s national security interests in a major way : the defense has delayed the trial by insisting that all this information be discussed in open court , or else the defendants will not be able to get a fair hearing .
What is amazing about this case is n’t just the long delay in the legal proceedings , but the brazenness of the accused : they openly proclaim their guilt  that is , they admit to the actions detailed in the indictment  while maintaining that they did absolutely nothing wrong .
Spying ?
Who  us ?
Why , we were just exercising our " First Amendment rights " like any journalist out to get a scoop .
With one big difference , though : legitimate journalists do n’t report their findings  classified sensitive purloined information  to the intelligence agencies of foreign nations .
The contempt the defendants and their lawyers have for the very concept of American national security permeates this case like a bad smell , and is enough to make any patriot  heck , any ordinary American  sick to his or her stomach .
To give some further indication of the unsavory flavor of this case , I ’ll only note the latest wrinkle : in a recent court session , defense lawyers argued that the information their clients are accused of stealing was already known to the Israelis .
This has been another of what I call the " chutzpah defense " mounted by Rosen and Weissman ’s legal team : the Israelis do n’t need to steal our secrets , they aver , because they already know everything worth knowing anyway .
As Josh Gerstein , a former writer for the now - permanently - set New York Sun , puts it on his blog :
" Both sides in the case seemed to agree that if information came from Israel , even if it passed through U.S. Government hands , it could not be a basis for the charges against Rosen and Weissman .
That seemed puzzling , since the mere fact that information came from a foreign government is usually a good enough reason to get it classified . "
The government has gone easy on the AIPAC defendants , and their former employers .
An apparent attempt was made by some in the Justice Department to indict not only Rosen and Weissman , but AIPAC itself .
This was quashed by the chief prosecutor , Paul J. McNulty  who has since gone on to graze in greener pastures  and the case was limited from the outset : only Franklin , Rosen , and Weissman were charged .
As Grant F. Smith shows in his recent book , AIPAC ’s organizational forerunner as Israel ’s Capitol Hill amen corner  the AZC , American Zionist Council  was financed almost entirely by overseas sources , i.e. Israel , and yet was not required to register as an agent of a foreign government .
Particularly fascinating is his original research into the findings of Senator J. William Fulbright , remembered today as an acerbic critic of the Vietnam war , who investigated and uncovered financial conduits running from Israeli government agencies to AIPAC in its AZC incarnation .
Everybody knows AIPAC is indeed an agent of a foreign government , i.e. the Israelis .
What most do n’t know , however , is that , unlike all others , it is exempt from complying with the Foreign Agents Registration Act .
This immunity  the legal genesis of which Grant traces in his fascinating account  created an opening for the Israeli government and its various overseas agencies to act with impunity within our borders .
This includes not just advocacy , but also providing the organizational mask behind which intelligence - burglars like Rosen , Weissman , and god - knows - who - else are hiding .
AIPAC quickly threw Rosen and Weissman overboard , the apparent price for avoiding a wider prosecution , and Rosen ’s quest to reemerge found limited sympathy on his old stomping grounds , the Washington policy wonk circuit .
The Forward reports :
" Rosen has been looking for his way back to the foreign policy scene for a long while , but he found that in most cases , doors of think tanks and advisory groups were closed .
" They ’d pat me on my back and say it is not fair , but there are only a few that agree to stand up , " Rosen said , praising the Middle East Forum for ‘ having the courage ’ to reach out to him . "
While the presumption of innocence is obligatory in a narrow legal sense , one has only to read the indictment to see that Rosen and Weissman not only stole classified information , but knew perfectly well they were breaking the law , and went to great pains to avoid detection .
At one point , the indictment has the defendants shifting meeting locations three times , going from restaurant to restaurant in the clear knowledge that they were likely being followed .
Document exchanges were avoided : Franklin briefed his handlers verbally .
Recordings of these conversations are the core of the government ’s case , and their substance is highly sensitive .
Wrangling over what to play in open court has delayed the trial for four years .
In playing for time , the defense is hoping that the incoming administration will rein in the Justice Department and quash the case , and there is good reason to suspect that this is true .
In any case , what kind of a public policy organization would hire Rosen , in hopes of influencing U.S. foreign policy ?
The Middle East Forum is a hate - the - Muslims " educational " organization , run by Daniel Pipes .
Pipes and his pals have followed the time - honored traditions of smear artists everywhere in maintaining an academic blacklist , " Campus Watch , " which keeps tabs on college professors deemed insufficiently friendly to Israeli government policies .
Pipes believes a " substantial " number of American Muslims are plotting to overthrow the government and establish an Islamist theocracy in America , and that this represents a real threat : it ’s all downhill from there .
In one of his recent screeds , Pipes attacks Barack Obama for his supposed " links " to Sirhan Sirhan , Robert F. Kennedy ’s assassin .
Yikes .
M. J. Rosenberg , blogging at Talking Points Memo , asks : " Are these people crazy ? " and concludes they ’re " crazy / irrelevant rather than crazy / dangerous , " and yet Rosen wielded enormous influence in Washington , at one point .
Jeffrey Goldberg , over at the New Yorker , relates a conversation with Rosen :
" He pushed a napkin across the table .
‘ You see this napkin ? ’ he said .
‘ In twenty - four hours , we could have the signatures of seventy senators on this napkin . ’ "
Rosen may have personally fallen on hard times , having to take up with a loony like Pipes , but one has to remember that the organizational framework that spawned his treason is not only alive and well  but it could still deliver those 70 senatorial signatures on a napkin with the greatest of ease .
Crazy , yes  and dangerous , too .

Dems seem uninterested in regulating White House political office under Obama Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday November 13 , 2008
Print This Email This Less than a month ago , Democrats excoriated President Bush and his administration over the conduct of the White House Office of Political Affairs , and a House panel recommended the office be closed or reorganized .
With Democrat Barack Obama preparing for his move into 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. , the calls to reform the office , which coordinates the president 's initiatives with key factions of his party , have grown silent , and all indications are that a political apparatus will continue to exist in the White House for the foreseeable future .
On Thursday , Politico noted that Obama had been virtually silent on calls to eliminate the White House 's politics office , and Marc Ambinder reported that it was " probably true " that Obama 's White House would include the operation .
Congressional Democrats , meanwhile , almost certainly will not move forward with any legislative attempts to shut down the political affairs office or re-write the law that allows it to exist anytime soon .
" That 's probably not going to be a priority that they 're going to push , " an aide to a Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee tells RAW STORY .
The continued operation of a taxpayer - funded White House political operation discouraged some good - government advocates who hoped that an Obama presidency would herald a new era of integrity .
" I would be very disappointed if Obama would continue that office , " Craig Holman , a lobbyist for Public Citizen said in an interview Thursday .
" I never thought his silence was due to the fact that he wanted to continue a Karl Rove style administration , and I do n't know what he has in mind for it . "
Last month , the committee issued a 27 - page report ( .pdf ) cataloguing the various ways Bush 's White House abused the office , including arranging taxpayer - funded trips for cabinet secretaries to appear with embattled members of Congress around election time .
Under Bush , the political affairs office was headed by Karl Rove and Ken Mehlman , among others .
The report recommended shuttering the office , which Ronald Reagan established upon entering the White House in 1981 .
" If the political affairs office is retained , " the report said , " it 's activities should be restructured to ensure that it serves the interests of the taxpayer , not the political party of the president . "
Whether such restructuring will occur remains to be seen , but the enthusiasm for such reforms seems to have waned .
A spokesman for President - elect Obama said the transition team would not comment on the political affairs office .
A representative for Oversight Chairman Henry Waxman did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
In recent weeks , Waxman and the rest of the Oversight Committee has been focused largely on the financial services industry and probing the causes of the ongoing financial crisis .
The committee held a hearing on hedge funds and financial markets Thursday .
However , there are other indications that the California Democrat seems less enthusiastic about continuing the tenacious watchdog role he 's occupied during the last two years of the Bush administration , beginning with the fact that the day after the election Waxman announced his intention to overthrow Rep. John Dingell ( D - MI ) as chair of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee .
It 's not uncommon for the Oversight Committee to be a bit more lax during times of unified party control of Congress and the White House .
For example , Rep. Tom Davis ( R - VA ) , who chaired the committee before the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006 , issued just 10 subpoenas to investigate the Bush administration , compared to the 1,000 subpoenas former Republican Oversight Chairman Dan Burton issued during the Clinton administration , Waxman noted in a speech this summer .
However , Waxman promised to be as hard on a potential Obama administration as he 's been on President Bush .
" Investigations should be driven by genuine need , not partisan priorities , " Waxman told attendees of a National Press Club luncheon in June , according to an account of the speech in CongressNow ( via Nexis ) .
" It 's just as important to investigate and to hold the executive branch accountable , even if it's the same political party as Congress . "
Now that Obama 's election is complete , it remains to be seen whether Waxman follows through on that commitment regarding the White House Office of Political Affairs is concerned .
" I wish Waxman would stick to his guns ; he knows this office should not be paid for by taxpayers , " Holman told RAW STORY .
" The fact that he's not making any public comment on it suggests to the public that maybe his oversight has just been partisan . "
This recipe is without using any preservatives .
Use this jam on a toast or simply use it on your cakes , it is definitely a wonderful treat .

Company Introduces Zinc Fuel Cell Power Pack
November 26th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Lithium ion technology has been getting lots of attention recently , but zinc - air tech has been largely ignored –until now .
A California start - up called Power Air plans on introducing a PDA - sized zinc fuel cell box that can be used to charge electronics .
Power
Air ’s fuel cells work by dissolving zinc in an electrolyte solution .
Exposure to air provokes the formation of zinc oxide , which releases electrons and generates electricity .
In order to charge electronics , consumers will have to open a lid on the power pack to make the current flow .
A gel inside the pack will contain the zinc powder and electrolyte solution .
The prototype power pack , which can store between 15 and 20 watt hours ( 7 to 10 charges ) , will be introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show in January .
Power
Air estimates that the pack will cost $ 20 .
Eventually , Power Air hopes that its zinc fuel cells will be used in boats and vehicles .
And with growing concerns that lithium supplies are being depleted , zinc - air fuel cells may just be the next big thing .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
By Simon Butler
November 17 , 2008 --
In Green Left Weekly , Climate and Capitalism and Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal , I argued that population reduction schemes provide no answers to the threat of climate change .
Population - based arguments wrongly treat population levels as the cause , rather than an effect , of an unsustainable economic system .
This means they tend to divert attention away from pushing for the real changes urgently needed .
Campaigning for such measures as the rapid introduction of renewable energy and the phasing - out of fossil fuels , along with a shift to sustainable agricultural methods , should instead be the highest priority of the environmental movement .
Strategies to reduce human population also end up blaming some of the world ’s poorest people for the looming climate crisis , when they are the people least responsible .
Instead , it is the powerful , vested interests that profit most from the fossil - fuel economy who pose the real threat to the planet .
They must be confronted .
A section of those who accept the idea of population reduction on environmental grounds would protest that their own ideas are n’t designed to substitute for the introduction of renewable energy , but to complement it .
Others would be indignant at the suggestion that their views have anything in common with the overt racism expressed by the likes of prominent US population theorist Garrett Hardin .
Hardin argued against providing food and medical aid to countries in the Third World facing famine .
Such humanitarian aid only encourage more babies to survive , driving up “ overpopulation ” and resulting , he said , in further environmental destruction . [ 1 ]
Population theories still retain their appeal to people who are genuinely worried about the threat of global warming , are concerned with enduring poverty in the global South and would reject Hardin ’s callous conclusions .
The rapid world population increase over the past two centuries appears to offer a plausible explanation of how the world got itself into ecological distress — reducing world population seems like a plausible solution .
Sustainable Population Australia ( SPA ) is an example of an environmental group that couches its population reduction arguments in the framework of a professed humanitarian response to the perils of climate change . [ 2 ]
A “ key document ” published in 2007 by SPA and available on its website predicts a depressingly dire future for humanity .
According to SPA : “ Without a planned humane contraction , this century will see social chaos and human suffering on an unprecedented scale . ” [ 3 ]
If population reduction schemes are not implemented , they warn , then population reduction will be inflicted on us anyway — in the form of famine , war and disease . [ 4 ]
SPA supports the introduction of renewable energy , believes foreign aid should be increased , opposes immigration selection on racial grounds and argues wasteful and excessive consumption in the big polluting countries in the First World must be reduced .
But SPA contends that the environmental benefits of these measures will not be enough .
Any gains , SPA asserts , will be wiped out by increased human consumption unless a planned world population reduction occurs as well . [ 5 ]
SPA concludes the “ most important single action … governments should take is to begin at once to implement humane strategies to reduce population ” [ 6 ]
But SPA ’s “ humane ” position still fails to provide either an effective , or a truly humane , strategy to avert the consequences of climate change for a number of reasons .
There is no factual basis to the SPA ’s claim that a shift to renewable energy could be simply negated by population increases .
Clearly , in a zero-emissions or low - emissions economy , population levels will impact on the environment in a very different , more sustainable way .
SPA simply does not take this into account .
Furthermore , the argument still serves to divert attention away from the genuine , urgent need for widespread renewable energy by insisting population reduction schemes should take number one priority .
This is dangerous because it dovetails with the message coming from the advocates of “ business as usual ” policies who imply , against the evidence , that renewable technology is not advanced enough to replace fossil fuels today .
SPA recommends a global average of one child per family as part of its strategy for a sustainable world .
Yet they fail to examine the case of China , which has enforced a one - child policy on its population for three decades .
There are many problems with this far - from - humane policy .
But if assessed solely on sustainable climate outcomes then China ’s population reduction scheme can only be considered to be a spectacular failure .
To sustain their emphasis on population control , SPA has to downplay the inconvenient truth that the world ’s rate of population growth is actually declining , not blowing out of control .
The growth rate of greenhouse gas emissions , however , is expanding dangerously today .
While there is no direct link between population increase and greenhouse gas emissions there is a clear and obvious link between expanding fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas increases .
In common with other populationist arguments , SPA fails to tackle the question of political power in society .
That ’s why SPA ’s “ humane ” argument is couched largely in terms of containing , or mitigating , the apparently inevitable effects of environmental destruction .
There ’s little in SPA ’s position that gives hope that the climate justice movement can actually win the political battle for social justice and a safe climate in time .
Population control measures assume the absolute worst case scenario from the outset — a future world so harsh and so polluted they hold it will become more “ humane ” to stop people in the global South from being born at all !
There is a kernel of truth in this apocalyptic scenario .
Left unchecked , human - induced climate change is a serious threat to life on the planet .
But the challenge this poses , however , is to fight for an alternative model of development based on meeting the needs of people and the planet , before it is too late .
Part of the problem is that groups such as SPA tend to see the people of the global South as passive victims of climate change — not as potential agents of sustainable change .
Environmental movements in the Third World are active , growing and involving far greater numbers than the movements in the First World .
Millions are fighting for a sustainable world today , so their children and grandchildren can have hope for a decent life in the future .
As Walden Bello , executive director of Focus on the Global South , has pointed out : “ The challenge facing activists in the global North and global South is to discover or bring about those circumstances that will trigger the formation of a global mass movement that will decisively confront the most crucial challenge of our times . ” [ 7 ]
Population control theories all relegate the billions of people in the global South to being just a part of the problem .
But this outlook is radically false .
They are , in fact , what Bello calls “ the pivotal agent in the fight against global warming ” .
The populations of the global South are not responsible for climate change .
Rather , they are an essential component of a safe climate solution .
Our strategy should be to join up with them in this fight for the future — not draw up plans to reduce their numbers .

Examining The Key Political Issues Of Our Day
President - elect Barack Obama promised his daughters they could bring a puppy with them to the White House .
And , according to Deb Wood , that puppy will be rescued from a shelter .
The Oregonian pets columnist went on to suggest that family allergy issues will dictate a breed , or mix , that " does n't shed . "
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel said Thursday U.S. President - elect Barack Obama ’s stated readiness to talk to Iran could be seen in the Middle East as a sign of weakness in efforts to persuade Tehran to curb its nuclear program .
“ We live in a neighborhood in which sometimes dialogue -- in a situation where you have brought sanctions , and you then shift to dialogue -- is liable to be interpreted as weakness , ” Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said , asked on Israel Radio about policy change toward Tehran in an Obama administration .
Her remarks sounded the first note of dissonance with Obama by a senior member of the Israeli government since the Democrat ’s sweeping victory over Republican candidate John McCain in the U.S. presidential election Tuesday .
Asked if she supported any U.S. dialogue with Iran , Livni replied : “ The answer is no . ”
Livni , leading the centrist Kadima party into Israel ’s February 10 parliamentary election , also said “ the bottom line ” was that the United States , under Obama , “ is also not willing to accept a nuclear Iran . ”
Obama has said he would harden sanctions on Iran but has also held out the possibility of direct talks with U.S. adversaries to resolve problems , including the dispute over Tehran ’s nuclear ambitions .
The West believes Iran ’s nuclear enrichment program is aimed at building atomic weapons , an allegation the Islamic Republic denies .
Israel , believed to have the Middle East ’s only atomic arsenal , has said Iran ’s nuclear program is a threat to its existence and that it was keeping all options on the table to stop it .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States has new intelligence indicating Iran is reorganizing in an effort to assert its influence inside Iraq and may be behind several recent attacks , according to a senior U.S. official who spoke with CNN Monday .
An Iraqi soldier outside in Dora district , Baghdad , Iraq , on Tuesday .
The information underscores a view by Gen. David Petraeus , who assumes command of U.S. Central Command later this month , and Gen. Raymond Odierno that progress in Iraq remains fragile and that it is too soon for a major additional U.S. troop drawdown .
The senior official , who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the intelligence , said the U.S. military had recently arrested an Iraqi general who says he was paid by Iran to derail a pending agreement that would allow U.S. troops to remain in Iraq after the end of the year .
The general was arrested a few weeks ago at the Iranian border carrying large sums of cash , according to the source .
The man has known ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) , the U.S. official said .
The United States believes the IRGC has ties to terrorist operations and Iran 's programs to develop chemical and biological weapons .
Odierno , who took over for Petraeus as the top U.S. military official in Iraq , told the Washington Post on Sunday that intelligence reports indicated Iran was bribing Iraqi officials in an attempt to undermine the status - of - forces agreement between the United States and Iraq .
But , the general said , he had no proof of the bribes .
The senior official described overall Iranian efforts as a " reorganization " rather than a " resurgence . "
As a result of the U.S. troop surge , many Iranian - backed fighters in Iraq fled back across the border .
U.S. intelligence believes some fighters may have come back into Iraq , but most are still in Iran .
According to the latest assessment of U.S. intelligence , the Iranian effort has broken into three main groups : Asaib - al - haq ; Khataib Hezbollah ; and a reorganized so - called " special groups " effort , the official said .
He noted that the first two groups represent fighters are coordinated by Iranian elements , instead of Iraqi cleric Muqtada al Sadr 's group , which formerly controlled them .
" They are now directly funded and trained by the IRGC , " the U.S. official said .
It is believed the IRGC is trying to model this effort after Hezbollah in Lebanon , he said .
That view would suggest the Iranians will try to exert their influence through social outreach organizations , such as providing schools , health care and other services in Iraq .
All three groups " have changed tactics and are primarily focused on assassinations and kidnappings , " along with targeted bomb attacks , rather than the large - scale attacks against Iraqi civilians seen in the past , the official said .

Children as young as nine held in sweltering cells
No money to improve conditions , says ministry
Baghdad , Monday September 8 2008
Hundreds of children , some as young as nine , are being held in appalling conditions in Baghdad 's prisons , sleeping in sweltering temperatures in overcrowded cells without working fans , no daily access to showers , and subject to frequent sexual abuse by guards , current and former prisoners say .
At Karkh juvenile prison , Omar Ali , a 16 - year - old who has spent more than three years there , showed the multiple skin sores he and many other fellow inmates have contracted through lying on thin , sweat - soaked mattresses night after night .
" The electricity comes from a generator and it's only switched on during the two - hour weekly session when visitors come in , and for two or three hours in the evening .
We are convinced the guards sell the generator fuel on the black market , " he said .
Daytime temperatures in Baghdad last week averaged 44C ( 112 F ) .
They barely drop below 38 C at night .
Water supplies in Karkh are spasmodic , and Omar said he was able to shower only once every three days .
Boys sleep in four dormitories , averaging 75 inmates in a cell about 5 metres by 10 metres , on double bunks or the concrete floor .
Guards often take boys to a separate room in the prison and rape them , Omar alleged .
They also break prison rules by lending their mobile phones to boys to ring home , on condition that each time their families top the phone up by $ 10 or $ 20 .
The teaching staff resigned en masse in November because of low pay , according to an international official .
As a result , the children lounge around aimlessly with no daytime activities , other than an exercise yard .
Though the boys in the prison have been convicted , international standards for fair trials are never met .
" Trials last on average for 25 minutes , no witnesses are called , confessions are used as the only evidence , and court - appointed defence lawyers get the case file on the day of the trial , leaving no chance to consult the defendant in private , " an international adviser in Baghdad said on condition of anonymity .
Omar Ali was 13 when interior ministry special forces raided his house in a predominantly Sunni suburb in October 2004 .
He and his 14 - year - old brother were arrested .
A week later the special forces came back and took their father .
All three are still in custody .
The ministry is under Shia control and its forces have repeatedly been accused of targeting innocent Sunnis .
Sahar Muhammad , the boys ' mother , told the Guardian that when she was able to visit her sons they told her they were beaten repeatedly in the first days of custody and ordered to sign a blank sheet of paper on which charges would be written later .
Raad Jamal was 17 when US forces raided his home in the mixed Sunni and Shia district of Doura in June last year .
His mother , Suad Ahmed Rashid , who was with him during the interview , told the Guardian : " During the US raid an American officer told my daughter : ' Tell your brother to confess he is with al - Qaida so we can send him to Camp Bucca [ a US prison near Basra ] or else we 'll hand him to the Iraqis and they will torture him ' . "
Raad and a friend were taken to a US base and were transferred next morning to the seventh brigade of the Iraqi army 's second regiment .
Raad said he and his friend were hung from the ceiling on ropes , beaten with electric cables , and taken for interrogation one by one .
" They said everyone who comes here has to confess , " Raad said .
He was then sent to another Iraqi army base .
" I stayed there about six months .
I did n't confess anything I did n't do .
They write false statements and ask you to press your thumb on it .
I refused but they forced my thumb on to the paper , " he said .
At the juvenile court Raad encountered a sympathetic judge .
" The judge did not accept my confession .
He said I was innocent but for administrative reasons I would have to go to Tobchi until I was released . "
He spent a few months in Tobchi and was released in March .
Last year officials from the United Nations Assistance Mission to Iraq ( Unami ) visited Baghdad 's Tobchi prison , where children awaiting trial are held .
They reported that detainees provided " particularly worrisome allegations of ill - treatment or other abuse of juvenile males , several of whom told Unami they had been beaten and sexually abused while held in the custody of the ministries of the interior and defence prior to transfer to a juvenile facility .
Upon examining them Unami observed injuries consistent with beatings . "
The UN found severe overcrowding at Tobchi , with around 400 inmates in a prison with an official capacity of 206 .
" In some cells juveniles were taking turns to sleep on the floor without mattresses , " the UN reported .
The ministry of labour and social affairs ( Molsa ) , which manages the prison , said shortages of funds prevented improvements .
Kadhim Raouf Ali , deputy director general of Molsa 's juvenile department , told the Guardian that inmate numbers in Tobchi had been sharply reduced this year thanks to speeded - up releases under the new amnesty law .
There were only 226 inmates now .
But he admitted Karkh was still overcrowded .
It was holding 315 children while capacity was 250 .
Child detainees in US custody in Iraq fare better than those in Iraqi hands , said Shatha Alobosi , an Iraqi woman MP .
Former inmates interviewed by the Guardian confirmed that there is less overcrowding and brutality .
Now , as Iraqi pressure mounts for a return of sovereignty , the US has been moving to release all under - 18s .
In December last year it held 950 children .
The current total is 180 .
" We anticipate having less than 100 juveniles in detention by the end of Ramadan [ later this month ] , and hopefully release all juveniles to their families before the end of this year , " First Lieutenant Randi Norton , a US military spokesman , said .
The Iraqi Islamic party , the main Sunni party in parliament , takes a special interest in detainees , adult as well as juvenile , since the majority are Sunnis .
It gives aid to poor families who have no breadwinner , and has urged the authorities to improve conditions and release prisoners .
" We still have a long way to go .
The problem is how to make a major and drastic reform of the judicial system , and change the mentality of officers in the army and police , " its leader , the Iraqi vice president Tariq al - Hashemi , told the Guardian .

San Franciscans rejected a measure that would have legalized prostitution in the city .
Measure K lost by an overwhelming majority on Wednesday with more than half the precincts reporting .
San Francisco 's mayor and top prosecutor spoke out Wednesday against the controversial ballot measure that would have decriminalized prostitution in the city , saying it would remove the ability of law enforcement to curb human trafficking and provide services for victims .
Speaking on a dingy street corner in the Tenderloin District , the site of a now - closed massage parlor , Mayor Gavin Newsom and District Attorney Kamala Harris pushed a message that prostitution is not a victimless crime .
" We can not give a green light or a pass to predators of young women , " Harris said .
" This is so much bigger than what happens between consenting adults behind closed doors , " she added .
Harris said prostitution often accompanies drug crime , violence and quality of life in neighborhoods such as the Tenderloin .
She said passage of Proposition K would not be " compassionate . "
Newsom echoed Harris ' comments .
" If Prop K passes , can you imagine living here ? " he asked , motioning to the surrounding Tenderloin streets .
" This is serious business , " he said .
" We 're trying to clean up the Tenderloin . "
" If people really knew what was happening in these massage parlors , there would be outrage , " Newsom said .
Supporters of the measure , who plan to hold their own news conference this afternoon , have said the legislation aims to increase safety for women and help sex workers report violence without fear of arrest .
The proposition calls on police to make sex workers ' safety a priority by instead focusing on enforcing laws against assault , rape , kidnapping and extortion , supporters say .
They argue it would actually strengthen the prosecution of sex traffickers and protect immigrant women from arrest and deportation .
Yes , Its Thanksgiving !

When many of you are done playing games or watching videos for the night , you chose to give back by launching Stanford University ’s Folding@home application on your PLAYSTATION 3 .
Whether you do it to benefit society , or just because the visualizations look cool , over a million of you have found the experience to be rewarding .
Now it ’s Folding@home ’s turn to be recognized .
Earlier today , the Japan Industrial Design Promotion Organization awarded Sony Computer Entertainment the “ Good Design Gold Award 2008 ” for our support of the Folding@home project on PS3 .
Folding@home is a distributed computing project which aims to understand protein folding and misfolding , and how they are related to diseases such as Alzheimer ’s and many forms of cancer .
We take special pride in the words said by the judges of the event , which gave the Gold award to only 15 projects out of over 3,000 nominees .
In their words :
“ Analysis of proteins for the purpose of shedding light on diseases is just one example of solution design for social issues , a stance that indicates the direction that design should take in the future .
Motivating the people who will be involved in these studies will be the key to success , but the program functions well as an idea for making participation in this project visible on a global scale . ”
Many people have worked to get this application working , both in Sony Computer Entertainment and in Stanford University , but all of this would not be doable without the participation and the donation given by you - the active community .
So allow me to extend my thanks and hope to see you all continue to contribute to this important project .

Leave it to California to first , stall a budget for a record 85 days only to pass a budget that amounts to kicking the economic shiny can down the pothole - filled road .
We may want to save those cans for their redemption value since things are getting progressively worse .
Only 6 weeks after being signed , the budget is now facing a stunning $ 11.2 billion deficit .
It took longer to pass the first budget than it took us to once again drive off an economic cliff .
What exactly happened here ?
Well first , the initial budget passed in September for the 2008 - 09 fiscal year amounted to a buffet of gimmicks , illusions , and putting your hand in one pocket , taking $ 20 out and shifting it over to your other pocket deluding yourself that you are now richer .
So how did they pass that budget ?
*$ 3.3 billion in sale of authorized Economic Recovery Bonds
*$ 1.9 billion in changes to accrual accounting
* $ 5.1 billion of lottery proceeds
*$ 1.4 billion in other initiatives
*$ 8 billion in spending cuts
This is what it took to pass a $ 143 billion budget on September 23 .
More debt and accounting smoke and mirrors .
Nothing really addressed the structural problems facing the state .
Barely enough time to catch our breath but here is what awaits California .
This comes from the Special Session 2008 - 09 report :
“ Economic conditions have deteriorated dramatically since the Governor signed the 2008 Budget Act of September 23 .
This deterioration was reflected in General Fund revenue collections for the month of September that came in $ 923 million below forecast .
As a result , California faces a revenue shortfall of $ 11.2 billion this year .
Specifically , the Department of Finance estimates that General Fund revenues will be approximately $ 567 million lower in 2007 - 08 , $ 10.7 billion lower in 2008 - 09 , and $ 13 billion lower in 2009 - 10 than earlier projections . ”
This coming from our government so you know things are actually worse .
So where was this supposed and deceptive money going to come from ?
Let us look at the revenue sources for the state :
54 % of the state revenue comes from the personal income tax .
Another 26 % is pulled from sales taxes .
Corporate tax pulls in about 12 % .
So by and large , most of the state revenue comes from people paying taxes on earnings .
Which leads us to our first obvious reason why this budget shortfall is not a surprise .
Let us now look at 5 reasons why 2009 will make 2008 look like a picnic for the state .
Condition # 1 – Employment
Hard to tax someone when they are unemployed .
The unemployment rate in the state is exploding :
California ’s unemployment rate stands at 7.7 % .
The last time the rate was this high was in 1996 and puts us at the 4th highest rate of unemployment in the country .
Now , what we are seeing is a vicious cycle that feeds on itself where people get fired , they do n’t spend , do n’t pay taxes , and it feeds and reinforces itself .
Remember these are state estimates which are always in the Pollyanna camp and are tantamount to asking a real estate agent if buying today is a good decision .
It is highly doubtful that the state has even crunched the numbers for October since they lag .
You thought September was bad ?
Just wait until the October numbers are processed .
There is no economic fundamental sign as to why employment will suddenly explode once again next year .
California was much too reliant on finance , insurance , and real estate for its health .
We have tied our anchor to the biggest bubble in history and the industries that pumped the air into this bubble .
And unemployment is getting longer and more painful .
Let us first look at the duration of unemployment in the state :
Currently , over 350,000 people have been unemployed 5 to 14 weeks .
This a jump from September of 2006 when the number was 250,000 .
In addition , those unemployed 27 weeks or more has shot up in the last year alone .
Currently there are over 200,000 people that fall in this category when only in September of 2007 there were 150,000 .
What does this tell us ?
It is much harder to find a job and more and more are losing their jobs unfortunately .
Let us now look at how people lose their jobs :
This is probably a more revealing chart .
Those considered by the state as “ job losers ” has jumped up exponentially .
In September of 2006 400,000 people were categorized as job losers and now the number is well over 600,000 .
Why is this category important ?
These are people that lost their job and not by their own choice .
They were fired , a company went bankrupt , or the company money just ran out .
Overall , there are currently 1,425,000 people unemployed in the state :
Going back to the budget , with personal income tax being the highest revenue source and job losses only growing , you can expect less money to come into the state next year .
Let us take a look at the actual data and look at certain industries :
It should not come as a surprise that the biggest job losses are in fields related to the housing industry .
Condition # 2 Housing
According to DataQuick the median price of a home sold in California for October was $ 280,000 .
The peak using DataQuick as our source was $ 484,000 for the state in May of 2007 .
What this now means is statewide the California median home price is now down a jaw dropping 42 % in slightly over a year .
I have very little doubt that we wo n’t see a housing bottom until 2011 and with this budget I am only more convinced that this will be the case .
Last month 51.1 percent of all sales were foreclosure resales .
Given that 40,317 homes sold , 20,602 of these homes were foreclosures .
That is a stunning number .
You may think that the sales are starting to pick up pace .
Do not kid yourself .
This number is simply keeping pace with the amount of distress inventory hitting the market .
Let us look at the numbers for the most recent dataset :
September 2008 Distress Indicators
Notice of Defaults : 21,665
Trustee Sales : 20,510
REOs : 27,373
It is highly likely that most of the 21,665 Notice of Defaults will go into foreclosure .
For the 3rd quarter , only 20 percent were able to save their home once in this stage .
Meaning , 8 out of 10 will lose their home .
What that also means is there are more distress properties hitting the market each month than actual sales .
Even with the new SB 1137 legislation the drop in NODs and foreclosures will be extremely short lived .
Why ?
It only addresses one facet of this complex equation .
It basically seeks to do for distress data the same it did with the budget .
Sweep the problem under the rug for another day .
Look at condition # 1 regarding jobs and you ’ll see why these measures fail to address the true problem .
Employment never justified these prices in the first place .
We are also entering the fall and winter selling season which historically is always slower .
When tax payments start rolling in the state is going to realize that the 2009 - 10 budget is simply unsupportable .
Condition # 3 – State Budget Kicking Can Down
It is worth noting that the recent budget pass in September was the equivalent of putting a band - aid on a broken bone .
Sure , it feels good because you are doing something but it failed to address the true magnitude of the problem .
There is major revenue short falls .
Something needs to be done .
And that is where the hard choice is .
Do you cut additional jobs thus fueling the perpetual cycle and adding more people to the unemployment lines or do you raise taxes and risk hurting some businesses in the state ?
At this point , it seems like a combination is necessary .
A dogmatic approach to this will not take us anywhere .
The last budget split on this ideological perspective and look where it got us .
6 weeks and we are back to the drawing board .
I have no idea how we still have an A + rating but hey , some of those collateralized debt obligations had A+ ratings right before they imploded so take that for what it is worth .
Take a look at the above revenue and you see where we are heading .
Also , just wait until folks do their taxes for next year .
Big money comes from capital gains and you can rest assured that many people are a lot less wealthy today .
The state better adjust quickly and gear up because we have less than 2 months before we enter 2009 .
After that , many will be claiming losses on their tax returns so that revenue is out the window .
If unemployment keeps going up that is fewer that pay into the tax base .
Sales have fallen drastically as well .
You need only look at the recent example of Circuit City , many here in California , which decided to close down 155 stores .
We are reaching the endgame here .
That is , we are now at the moment where we realize the full extent of this Ponzi financial system .
The only thing that kept things going up was simply the momentum itself .
It detached from any economic or market fundamentals .
It was by all definitions a bubble .
Sadly , the state budget assumed a decade of bubble growth was somehow normal .
Now , we need to quickly adjust to the actual reality .
That bubble is long gone and big profits with it .
Have we forgotten about the years of Real Homes of Genius plaguing the market ?
Condition # 4 – Global Crisis
I never understood why some folks believed so strongly in decoupling :
: “ California will never go down .
Because guess what ?
Even if people are n’t buying here the world is doing fine and they ’ll buy real estate here . ”
These folks fall under the decoupling camp and they are largely silent and absent today .
All you needed to do was travel and realized everyone drank the debt elixir .
Some have modified their stance .
It is unequivocally clear that foreign buyers are not snapping up real estate .
In the few cases that they are , they are buying in Beverly Hills or Santa Monica and not the Inland Empire or other L.A. locations where the bulk of people live .
The fact that this is a global crisis leaves us largely to our own devices .
Even by current measures , prices in California are still too high .
People across the country view our prices still as bubbly .
They certainly are n’t going to rush in and buy up these homes .
Who are they going to rent them to ?
The unemployed ?
Makes absolutely no sense .
It is much too big of a risk .
Plus , most lenders now require solid credit and anywhere from 20 to 30 percent down for any investment property .
You tell me how Americans have $ 56,000 or $ 84,000 sitting around for an investment property ?
Not many and those that do are buying out in other states where prices make more sense .
This global credit crisis is gigantic .
It is estimated that current declines have wiped out over $ 10 trillion globally .
This is n’t chump change .
That is the size of our national debt .
Condition # 5 – Consumer Behavior
Finally , people are more cautious .
People are now psychologically scarred and realize that more pain may be coming down the pipeline .
Why would someone want to buy a home if they are not certain about their job situation ?
Maybe they are getting their hours cut back .
Maybe they ’ve just watched their 401k lose 40 % of its value and they are wondering how they will survive in retirement .
Many have seen their home equity disappear .
Everyone knows someone or is personally hit by this economic crisis .
This goes beyond simply a credit crisis .
This is not just a subprime mess .
This is hitting on so many fronts and simply shows how complex our global system is .
Let us look at what we are battling with :
* Growing unemployment
* Deflation in housing prices
* Credit crisis
* Automobile sector on the verge of collapse
* Big ticket consumer stores going under
* Commodities bubble popping
* Commercial real estate collapsing
* Banks going under
Obviously , the above does a number on the psyche of the public .
I would assume many are even holding off on buying say a new car , TV , or computer and making do with what they have .
Many of the economic consumerist models relied on folks spending over and over and always replacing slightly old items with newer flashier models .
We ’ll be seeing more older cars on the road .
This new paradigm of consumer awakening is hitting at the worst time , the holiday shopping season .
With that said , California is now forced to make hard choices .
There is no other way .
We are in what I call Stagpression .
That is a situation where we are holding off depression with mountains of debt .
Not exactly a method or recipe for recovery .

Walter Block versus Bryan Caplan on Fractional Reserve Banking
DIGG THIS
What appears below is a series of letters between me and Bryan Caplan .
I regard Bryan as a brilliant young man , and an important contributor to libertarianism .
He is , however , a bitter critic of all things concerning Austrian economics ( I have a review forthcoming in the Journal of Libertarian Studies of his recent book , The Myth of the Rational Voter : Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies ; see this for my critical comment on his gratuitous three page attack on Austrians as " market fundamentalists " ) .
On the other hand , in my view , Caplan is fast becoming a rising star among the neo-classicals ; he writes voluminously and negatively about Austrian economics .
But he always spells that name correctly , and , thus , garners far more publicity for us than would otherwise be the case .
I would vastly prefer that mainstream economists attack praxeologists rather than ignore us .
In that way , they set up targets for us , and better enable us to break out into the society at large .
Indeed , Caplan has become a sort of one - man industry in this regard , so calling forth a dozen or so rejoinders to his criticism .
On this , see the appendix 1 at the end of this article .
The present debate got started when I read that Caplan had characterized Rothbard ’s position on fractional reserve banking ( frb ) as " crazy . "
Further adding insult to injury , he denotes this position as too easy of a target to hit out against .
Now , I suppose , I think of Milton Friedman roughly in the way that Caplan regards Rothbard .
Yet , I never characterized Friedman ’s views as " crazy " nor as a " too easy " target .
That really got in my craw , and led me to write to Caplan .
This correspondence took place during the month of October , 2008 .
I have edited this very slightly , e.g. , getting rid of some of the ums and aws , on both our parts , updating the bibliography I had originally sent to Bryan and Jeff Hummel ( the latter was copied on this in its entirety , but did not contribute to it ) , etc .
Part I .
Walter Block wrote :
Dear Bryan and Jeff :
Reading from here , I see the following :
“ Yesterday at the FEE seminar , I got to hear the excellent Jeff Hummel thoroughly debunk the crazy Rothbardian view that fractional reserve banking is “ fraudulent . ”
It was fun ( and funny ) lecture , but the target was too easy . ”
I infer , then , that you guys , both of you , have published attacks on the “ crazy Rothbardian view . "
I ’m trying to put together a bibliography on both sides of this “ easy ” target , see below .
Yet , I do n’t have anything from either of you on this list .
Please send me the cites of your pubs debunking the Rothbard - Hoppe view that frb amounts to fraud , counterfeiting and theft .
Have you guys even read the other side of this debate ?
Best regards , Walter

If I ’ve published anything on this , I do n’t recall .
And yes , in my misspent youth I read lots of defenses of 100 % reserves .
I even believed them .
If I were going to write something on this , it would be very short .
I ’d probably just quote P&M : — — — — — — —–
No administrator is needed to prevent non-fraudulent sales ; if a man simply sells what he calls “ bread , ” it must meet the common definition of bread held by consumers , and not some arbitrary specification .
However , if he specifies the composition on the loaf , he is liable for prosecution if he is lying .

Block :
How about if a man sells a square circle to a willing buyer ?
How about if the contract is incompatible with private property rights , on the basis of which all contracts are supposed to lie , at least according to libertarian theory ?
How about if the “ contract ” involves two people each owning 100 % of something like a gold ounce ( which I take to be a logical contradiction ) ?
Caplan :
At worst , this would make a contract void for vagueness , but not “ fraudulent . ”
The more natural response , though , is to interpret apparent contradictions in contracts charitably .
Block : May I have your permission to share this correspondence with others ?
Caplan : Of course .

Caplan :
You ’re just being difficult , Walter .
If you asked a married couple “ Who owns your car ? ” many people would say “ We both own it .
Fully . ”
You can either berate them for self - contradiction , or interpret their statement charitably through the usual lens of marital property .
Block :
It is merely “ vague ” when two different people have full property rights over the same identical thing ?
I do n’t think so .
Look , you and I can both be PART owners of a car : you use it on odd days , me on even ones .
But we both ( logically ) cannot be FULL owners of one and the same car .
That is a logical contradiction , an utter impossibility .
But , yet , in frb , there are indeed two different people with FULL rights to the same thing , a given amount of money .
There is simply no “ charitable ” way to interpret this .

Caplan :
[ Sarcasm . ]
Then I guess it ’s time to invalidate millions of marriages as well as frb for their contradictory assignment of property rights .
Block :
Two people can no more FULLY own a car than there can be two people in the same identical place .
Married couples typically SHARE ownership in cars they do n’t , they CAN ’T , both fully own it .
Let me try again on this .
Under libertarianism , rights cannot conflict .
If there is any conflict , there is an improper specification of rights .
But , if A ( husband ) and B ( wife ) each fully own a car , then there IS a conflict in rights .
Each has a right to do with the car what he or she wants .
Now , there may not be an ACTUAL conflict , if they both want the car used for the same purpose .
But , there is still a conflict in RIGHTS .
A wants the car used for washing it ; B wants to take it on a trip .
They both have a RIGHT to use the car for these incompatible purposes .
That ’s frb for you : a contradiction in terms .

Subject : Re : frb easy target
Caplan : I understand your point .
What I ’m saying is that you are taking loose ordinary language too literally .
If people in a marriage — or a frb — say that both sides have “ full ” ownership of something , they do n’t literally mean that , ad it is silly to claim that they are contradicting themselves .
What do they really mean ?
Roughly speaking , whatever ’s customary .
Block :
I ’ve failed to make my point as clear as I should have .
Let me try again .
I do n’t at all agree that in marriages , or in any other kind of partnerships , the two parties FULLY own the property in question .
Rather , they SHARE ownership .
Sometimes the husband , or partner A decides , sometimes the wife , or partner B decides , for example , how to use the car .
The only way that both parties can have FULL rights over the car is to have TWO cars .
If they have only ONE car between them , which is the assumption we have been operating under , how can they each have the right to FULLY determine the use of the car ?
Now , it may be , and I certainly “ concede ” this , that there may be no conflict in actual use of the car .
A might allow B to fully determine its use .
But that is NOT what I am talking about .
I ’m not talking about , that is , practicality , actual use , nothing like that .
I am talking about RIGHTS , solely about rights .
I do n’t know how to say this more clearly : two different people cannot have full rights to any one thing .
Only one person can .
Part VII .
Block :
I do n’t really think that “ ordinary language ” really applies here .
Most people , married or not , do n’t think much about frb , property titles , etc .
My sense of ordinary language is that no one , no one at all , speaks of “ full ” ownership .
Only people like Rothbard , Hoppe , Hülsmann and me talk about it , and people like you , Hummel , White , Selgin , deny it .
Consider this : A deposits 10 ounces of gold in B ’s bank ; B gives A a demand deposit for these 10 ounces .
B turns around and lends C 9 of these ounces , giving C a demand deposit for these 9 ounces .
Thus , A and C both own full rights to these 9 ounces .
There is now a problem of over - determination or conflict in rights .
A and C both have a FULL right to these selfsame 9 ounces of gold .
They are both FULL owners of these 9 ounces .
But , one of the essences of the libertarian philosophy we share is that there CANNOT be a conflict in rights .
Any seeming conflict is due to a misspecification or one or the other right .
Yet , here , with frb , we have a GENUINE conflict in rights .
Thus , frb is incompatible with libertarianism .
Note , I am NOT talking about practicality .
It might well be ( given no bank run ) that A and C will not ACT incompatibly with one another ; that is , both will not demand that B pay them these 9 ounces , an utter impossibility .
No , I am talking about RIGHTS .
Right now , before any bank run , there is STILL a rights contradiction .
I ca n’t see my way clear to agreeing with you that these thoughts of mine stem from “ taking loose ordinary language too literally . ”

The Best of Walter E. Block
Ever since I heard about the study of typography I was fascinated by it .
Upon the word “ typography ” it clicked for me , “ how interesting … the study of type , typefaces , and the design that is shaped by it . ”
On the web we face some typographic challenges and limitations , the typefaces , font smoothing , and control we have over all typographic elements is inconsistent at best .
However that has n’t stopped several great designers from using typography as the only significant element of design on their websites .
They found a way to create beautiful and stunning visuals with out complex graphics , shading , color changes , backgrounds , etc … they let the type speak and the results are amazing .
Did I miss any ?
Leave them in the comments and I will add them to the list .
President - Elect Obama
The American people went to the polls today and the voices of the American people were heard .
Loud and clear .
This was not just a victory for Barack Obama and the Democrats , this was a mandate .
Truth be told the results tonight are not surprising , only those holding out unrealistic hopes still believed that Barack Obama would not be elected as the next president of the United States .
Because the results were so predictable I had plenty of time to brace myself for this , I accepted the results long ago .
John McCain was a horrible candidate from the beginning .
I apologize for the whole state of New Hampshire to all conservatives out there because if it was not for my state John McCain would never have been the nominee in the first place .
The man that stopped President Bush from appointing conservative judges , and the man that supported giving amnesty to illegal aliens should never have been the Republican nominee in the first place .
Because I readied myself for the impending left hand turn the country was ready to take , I began to look at small victories in a tough year for Republicans .
These goals were the election of Jeb Bradley in New Hampshire , the re-election of John Sununu in New Hampshire , and stopping the Democrats from achieving a 60 vote super majority .
For the most part those victories alluded me also , Jeb Bradley lost as did Sununu .
The only victory that can be claimed by Republicans is the fact that they held off the senate 60 vote super majority .
The American people have rejected Republicans all across the country , the country has turned not just left but hard left , and as the country moves in this direction it is time to look at the reasons why .
The reason is obvious and can be summed up simply ; George W Bush .
George W Bush ran as a “ compassionate conservative ” in 2000 , but what conservative agenda has he pursued and won ?
Nothing .
George Bush grew the government and spent more money than any previous Democrat president .
George W Bush put Republicans behind the eight ball , he has single - handedly set the Republican party back at least twenty years .
I have defended this man for almost two years on this blog through thick and thin , I ignored the fact that he never saw a spending bill that he did n’t like .
I started to turn on him during the illegal alien amnesty bill .
His claim that there are jobs that Americans wo n’t do is insulting .
Americans will do whatever it takes to take care of their families .
I came back to him , where else could I go ?
But then President Bush socialized the economy , the mortgage industry , and the banks .
That is when he lost me for good , he started America down the path to socialism that Barack Obama will continue and for that I will never forgive him .
The end result of George W Bush ’s presidency is Barack Obama ’s presidency .
The results will be devastating .
Where do conservatives go from here ?
I have no idea .
We must regroup and refocus , we must get back to true conservative ideals , something that George W Bush forgot somewhere along the line .
It is going to be a long uphill battle , but it is a battle that must be fought .
It is up to the people to rebuild the party that George W Bush destroyed .
Tonight is Barack Obama ’s night , but tomorrow the fight resumes .
And I pledge to treat President Obama with the same respect that the left has treated President Bush .
What is this ?

Veteran drummer Ginger Baker has declared he is willing to drop his trousers in court to prove he never got jiggy with a woman accused of defrauding him of £ 30,000 , the Telegraph reports .
Baker , 69 , now lives in South Africa , where he befriended Lindiwe Noko at the bank where she worked as a clerk .
He called in cops when £ 30 k went awol from his account , and Noko subsequently claimed she and the former Cream sticksman were lovers and he gave her the cash as a gift .
Not so , insists Baker , who is now prepared to whip off his strides to prove the point .
He explained : " I 've a scar that only a woman who had a thing with me would know .
It 's there and she does n't know it 's there . "
The case is due to be heard in January .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Citigroup says it will expand its foreclosure prevention efforts and try to keep 130,000 troubled borrowers with $ 20 billion in mortgages in their homes .
The news follows similar initiatives announced earlier this year by IndyMac Bank , which was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last summer , as well as Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) each of which heralded enhanced housing rescue efforts .
Banks are undoubtedly feeling pressured to be more aggressive in aiding home owners , given how many billions of taxpayer dollars have poured into the industry to stem the credit crisis .
The Citi ( C , Fortune 500 ) effort , dubbed the Citi Homeownership Assistance Program , targets 500,000 Citi borrowers .
CitiMortgages CEO
Sanjiv
Das said he expects that more than a quarter of these people , with mortgages worth about $ 20 billion , will take advantage of the program over the next six months .
" We 're reaching out to borrowers in areas of steeper - than - usual falling prices and higher - than - average unemployment , " said Das , including California , Michigan , Florida , Nevada , Ohio and Arizona .
" These areas are where the concentration of at - risk mortgages are the highest . "
The new initiative differs from Citi 's existing mortgage mitigation efforts in that it's a much more proactive plan , said Eric Eve , Senior Vice President , Global Community Relations for Citi .
The company will determine where the need for mortgage modification is greatest , based on economic conditions , and send out letters to its borrowers in these areas to tell them that help is available should they need it .
Borrowers on the brink
This new initiative is open only to borrowers who are still current on their loans but are at risk of defaulting - particularly those borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are currently worth .
Additionally , their loans must be owned by the bank , rather than sold off to investors .
Citi already has a program in place to work with borrowers who are delinquent , reducing interest rates to as low as 1 % for as long as two years for borrowers who are judged capable of keeping up with lower payments .
The bank says that its ongoing mortgage mitigation efforts have produced about 370,000 work outs since the beginning of 2007 .
For borrowers who have yet to default , Citi will now aim to reduce their monthly mortgage payment , including property taxes and insurance , to 40 % or less of their income .
To do that , it will freeze or reduce interest rates , extend the lifetime of the loan or even reduce the loan principal .
Das said the new plan will be implemented immediately and the workouts will be handled in a very fast , streamlined fashion to aid as many homeowners as quickly as possible .
Each of these new foreclosure prevention efforts , from Citi , IndyMac , Bank of America and JPMorgan , represent a significant step forward in resolving the housing crisis , according to Jared Bernstein , senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute .
But , he adds , the problem remains overwhelming .
" These programs are helping but the help is marginal - in the hundreds of thousands of homeowners , " he said .
" But help is needed by millions . "
Even after taking these new bank programs into account , Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody 's Economy.com , estimates that 1.6 million Americans will lose their homes this year either in a foreclosure or distressed sale .
Some 1.9 million are projected to lose their homes in 2009 .
It 's certainly doubtful that the banks ' housing relief programs will be as successful as they hope .
For example , IndyMac 's program was launched in late August , and slated to help as many as 40,000 borrowers .
But in late October , FDIC chief Sheila Bair told a congressional committee that the bank had only completed 3,500 work outs .
So Bank of America 's claim that it will help 400,000 homeowners , and JPMorgan Chase 's goal of rescuing another 400,000 borrowers should probably be taken with a grain of salt .
Bigger plans
Still , Bernstein welcomes every effort .
" Let a thousand flowers bloom , " he said .
" It 's like an experiment and , if we 're smart , we 'll see what plans work and what does n't . "
Then , the best aspects of the various plans could be applied to as many at - risk mortgages as possible .
But the bottom line is that the bank programs wo n't be nearly as effective as any massive foreclosure prevention effort that may yet be implemented by the U.S. government , according to Bernstein .
And there is a possibility that such a program may yet emerge .
Congress already enacted its Hope for Homeowners initiative , which will allow borrowers to refinance their mortgages into loans backed by the Federal Housing Authority .
Now there is talk of a new $ 50 billion plan that could bail out as many as 3 million homeowners .
" We can keep the number below a million [ homes lost ] next year with an effective government effort , " said Zandi .
" It would be very doable but also very costly . "
The single best thing about the bank programs , according to Bernstein , is that they do n't cost the taxpayers anything .
" You have to be happy about that , " he said .
One of Britain 's most authoritative judicial figures last night delivered a blistering attack on the invasion of Iraq , describing it as a serious violation of international law , and accusing Britain and the US of acting like a " world vigilante " .
Lord Bingham , in his first major speech since retiring as the senior law lord , rejected the then attorney general 's defence of the 2003 invasion as fundamentally flawed .
Contradicting head - on Lord Goldsmith 's advice that the invasion was lawful , Bingham stated : " It was not plain that Iraq had failed to comply in a manner justifying resort to force and there were no strong factual grounds or hard evidence to show that it had . "
Adding his weight to the body of international legal opinion opposed to the invasion , Bingham said that to argue , as the British government had done , that Britain and the US could unilaterally decide that Iraq had broken UN resolutions " passes belief " .
Governments were bound by international law as much as by their domestic laws , he said .
" The current ministerial code , " he added " binding on British ministers , requires them as an overarching duty to ' comply with the law , including international law and treaty obligations ' . "
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continue to press for an independent inquiry into the circumstances around the invasion .
The government says an inquiry would be harmful while British troops are in Iraq .
Ministers say most of the remaining 4,000 will leave by mid-2009 .
Addressing the British Institute of International and Comparative Law last night , Bingham said : " If I am right that the invasion of Iraq by the US , the UK , and some other states was unauthorised by the security council there was , of course , a serious violation of international law and the rule of law .
" For the effect of acting unilaterally was to undermine the foundation on which the post - 1945 consensus had been constructed : the prohibition of force ( save in self - defence , or perhaps , to avert an impending humanitarian catastrophe ) unless formally authorised by the nations of the world empowered to make collective decisions in the security council ... "
The moment a state treated the rules of international law as binding on others but not on itself , the compact on which the law rested was broken , Bingham argued .
Quoting a comment made by a leading academic lawyer , he added : " It is , as has been said , ' the difference between the role of world policeman and world vigilante ' . "
Bingham said he had very recently provided an advance copy of his speech to Goldsmith and to Jack Straw , foreign secretary at the time of the invasion of Iraq .
He told his audience he should make it plain they challenged his conclusions .
Both men emphasised that point last night by intervening to defend their views as consistent with those held at the time of the invasion .
Goldsmith said in a statement : " I stand by my advice of March 2003 that it was legal for Britain to take military action in Iraq .
I would not have given that advice if it were not genuinely my view .
Lord Bingham is entitled to his own legal perspective five years after the event . "
Goldsmith defended what is known as the " revival argument " - namely that Saddam Hussein had failed to comply with previous UN resolutions which could now take effect .
Goldsmith added that Tony Blair had told him it was his " unequivocal view " that Iraq was in breach of its UN obligations to give up weapons of mass destruction .
Straw said last night that he shared Goldsmith 's view .
He continued : " However controversial the view that military action was justified in international law it was our attorney general 's view that it was lawful and that view was widely shared across the world . "
Bingham also criticised the post- invasion record of Britain as " an occupying power in Iraq " .
It is " sullied by a number of incidents , most notably the shameful beating to death of Mr Baha Mousa [ a hotel receptionist ] in Basra [ in 2003 ] " , he said .
Such breaches of the law , however , were not the result of deliberate government policy and the rights of victims had been recognised , Bingham observed .
He contrasted that with the " unilateral decisions of the US government " on issues such as the detention conditions in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
After referring to mistreatment of Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib , Bingham added : " Particularly disturbing to proponents of the rule of law is the cynical lack of concern for international legality among some top officials in the Bush administration . "
My post 15 Ways to Tell Its Not Cloud Computing has had a lot of play – 24 trackbacks and counting …
A lot of the commentary so far has generally approved of the angle I took , though clearly there are strong dissenting voices .
Before I proceed to one of them I just want to point out that 15 Ways was always intended to take a strong position , though hopefully with some humour .
That is , the post was somewhat rhetorical .
Of course not all enterprises are going to suddenly drop enterprise IT and do everything over at Amazon Web Services .
That would be a. absurd and b. impossible .
But on the flipside I see a lot of over - complication from major players – around something that originally simply spoke to provisioning architecture for developers without the headaches .
Cloud started as a description of a web phenomenon , not an enterprise , phenomenon .
Can enterprises learn from Web simplicity ?
Of course they can , and should .
Can web companies learn from enterprise middleware scalability patterns ?
Yup .
However - whatever else the cloud is , it should not just be an excuse to try and rewarm technology that has already failed in the marketplace .
It should not be an excuse to sell a new complexity .
And so to pushback .
I am really happy that I got such a considered and thoughtful response from Eric Novikoff of ENKI Consulting , who does some work with 3 Tera .
You might want to read my original piece first , but I will leave everything inline , my original 15 points in bold .
I thoroughly disagree with this “ backwards ” definition of cloud computing .
James Staten of Forrester defines Cloud Computing as “ A pool of highly scalable , abstracted infrastructure , capable of hosting end - customer applications , that is billed by consumption . ”
This is a definition that is amenable and extensible to the enterprise .
This list of “ nots ” is not . >
If you peel back the label and its says “ Grid ” or “ OGSA ” underneath … its not a cloud .
Cloud computing as defined by Staten can be delivered from a variety of architectures , including Grids or SalesForce ’s Big Iron .
That ’s the point of the cloud : abstracted infrastructure . >
If you need to send a 40 page requirements document to the vendor then … it is not cloud .
More and more cloud vendors are offering solutions rather than cpu cycles .
CPU cycles are great for programmers , but businesses want to solve business problems .
Without a definition of what the customer ’s problem is , and an honest and transparent reply from the cloud vendor , you are running on hopes and dreams instead of a known value delivery system .
The result is that the companies most successful with Amazon have dedicated staff and management to ensure a successful cloud deployment and to make sure Amazon does n’t change something underneath that breaks their app .
Where is the savings in that ? >
If you ca n’t buy it on your personal credit card … it is not a cloud Businesses do n’t like to pay for expenses on personal ( or business ) credit cards .
In fact , they prefer a budgetable monthly spend which of course contradicts with consumption billing .
Our customers * do n’t want * to pay by credit card , by and large .
Only the web2.0 - in - a - garage startups are interested in credit card payment : possibly because they ’re financing their business that way .
>
If they are trying to sell you hardware … its not a cloud .
This seems like it should be true .
However , corporate customers are reticent to send internal data out into a public cloud .
Why would n’t they buy hardware from a cloud vendor to get similar advantages , delivered internally ? >
If there is no API … its not a cloud .
You wo n’t get much disagreement from me on that , but most of our customers are n’t interested in an API , so they probably would disagree .
They just want to deploy and go , not write their own cloud operating system . >
If you need to rearchitect your systems for it …
Its not a cloud .
That would be nice , but I have n’t seen one cloud that does n’t require some rearchitecting .
Wholesale rearchitecting is often required to get around Amazon ’s peccadilloes , and even the AppLogic system we deploy on , despite it ’s virtual datacenter analogy , still has some characteristics that require minor architecture changes for some applications .
Whether or not you have to rearchitect depends more on how much you encoded your expectations of the hardware environment into your code than it does the particular cloud you deploy to .
>
If it takes more than ten minutes to provision … its not a cloud .
If you ca n’t deprovision in less than ten minutes … its not a cloud .
Where are you measuring the time period from ?
We can bring up a virtual private data center in the cloud in 2 minutes .
But our customers often take days , weeks , or months to figure out how they want to provision from the moment they decide to .
For businesses , the time from decision to deployment is a better measure than time to provision . >
If you know where the machines are … its not a cloud .
This simply points up disagreements about the definition .
Most customers who demand high performance ( say , running Oracle ) and certification ( say , HIPAA ) both want and need to know where the machines are .
They are unlikely to deploy to clouds where the architecture is so opaque that they can’t meet their requirements .
>
If there is a consultant in the room … its not a cloud .
This is false on two counts .
First , those companies who have successfully deployed their entire operations to the Amazon cloud have dedicated staff to manage Amazon deployment .
Call them “ internal consultants ” if you will – people whose job is to manage / consult on the cloud .
Second , a large number of reseller / consultants have sprung up to facilitate the use of Amazon .
Amazon is becoming something like a physical server : you need someone to run it for you .
These consulting / reselling companies do that .
They may not be “ in the room ” however , which is one of the benefits of Cloud Computing : it creates an internet - enabled ecosystem of knowledge workers you can use with your application without providing a cube for them . >
If you need to specify the number of machines you want upfront … its not a cloud .
This is an assumption that Amazon has catered to .
If you do the math , you ’ll see that Amazon bought it ’s cloud business by selling under its costs .
Especially in the early days , keeping huge reserve capacity up and running was a cost that was not passed on to the users .
Many of today ’s cloud providers manage their inventory of physical hardware to reduce their costs , by offering discounts on usage to customers based on contracts .
This will ( and does ) lower the prices for customers over the “ big daddy in the sky with infinite computing power ” cloud model .
You ’re going to see more of it .
If cloud computing is a commodity with perfect competition , like air travel , you ’re going to see vendors deploying intense strategies to manage their unused capacity .
>
If you need to install software to use it … its not a cloud .
Cloud computing and open source seem to go hand in hand .
My experience is that each of my customers wants a different version of their operating system , database , etc .
Cloud vendors typically provide a library of code images , but they cannot custom - configure to meet an individuals ’ needs .
The trick is not avoiding installation , but making it easy . >
If you own all the hardware … its not a cloud .
There definitely are cloud providers out there who have their customers lease the underlying hardware , which defeats the concept of usage - based billing .
However , your statement would get puzzled looks from many large enterprises who run their own clouds .
Its funny I get such strong reactions from consultants like Jeff and Eric .
I just ca n’t work out why that is 😉
So what about these “ puzzled looks ” from folks that Eric says have built their own behind the firewall cloud .
An enterprise guy is welcome to call the infrastructure they ’ve been building out a cloud .
Everything is a cloud these days , right ( one of the reasons I wrote 15 ways of course ) ?
An end to end VMWare shop is going to be in pretty good shape for rapid provisioning , for example – which is why VMware is certainly in the running as a CloudOS player .
When I say that IBM lacks a cloud strategy what I mean is that its cloud strategy is currently too diffuse , too complex , and not closely enough managed .
Where are the simple on ramps ?
We currently have such a bad case of definition sprawl that some segmentation is required .
I like Tim O’Reilly ’s recent three leg definition – Utility computing , Platform as a Service and Cloud - based end - user applications .
But we need more segmentation on the Utility side , to take account of “ enterprisey ” concerns and mores .
To get a little bit goldilocks about all of this the 451 has done an awesome job of cloud segmentation with a report I… can’t find on the internet , mind the firewall guys - but its actually too granular as a I remember it .
Its not my intention to put forward my own segmentation at this point but I do want to point to a recurring theme from Eric , about my missing the point – we could call this the Hidden Costs of Amazon Web Services argument .
Or AWS TCO Smackdown or something .
I will refer at this point to another post by Novikoff , where he talks about his experiences as an SDForum Cloud Event .
Each of the companies using EC2 had developed intense internal expertise on Amazon ’s service .
That ’s right , you read correctly : on Amazon ’s service .
Not on Cloud Computing in general ( though there are those who argue that EC2 and Cloud Computing are the same thing ) but rather on the intricate technical and organizational details of dealing with Amazon and its service as well as optimizing their use of it .
It was n’t a surprise to me that these companies , dependent on Amazon for their success , would get to know the service well .
What did surprise me was the lengths to which they went to mitigate the risks .
Generally , if you have doubts or fears about something , you want to learn all you can about it .
These companies showed incredible technical depth at understanding EC2 ’s characteristics and peccadillos .
They asserted that it was critical to their success .
But this seems to me to be in direct conflict with the ideal of Cloud Computing , which is the democratization of information technology ; in other words , lowering the barriers of entry .
I think this is an admission that Cloud Computing technology in any form is still not polished enough for completely casual use .
At ENKI , we realized this early on and decided to strive to be the “ onramp to the Cloud ” by providing all the services necessary to use our cloud without having to know anything about Cloud Computing .
At Redmonk we tend to think low barriers to entry do n’t require consultants to navigate – but that ’s just us .
As is clearly the case right now the turbulence surrounding the cloud conversation is a barrier to entry , which is where people like Eric and RedMonk come in .
The truth is I am probably half right , and half wrong .
I leave the reader to decide to turn the dial to parse Eric ’s comments and my own .

WHAT ONCE WAS UNTHINKABLE has come to pass this year : massive bailouts by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve , with the extension of billions of the taxpayers ' and the central bank 's credit in so many new and untested schemes that you can't tell your acronyms or abbreviations without a scorecard .
Even more unbelievable is that some of the recipients of staggering sums are coming back for a second round .
Or that the queue of petitioners grows by the day .
But what happens if the requests begin to strain the credit line of the world 's most creditworthy borrower , the U.S. government itself ?
Unthinkable ?
American International Group ( ticker : AIG ) , which originally had to borrow what was a stunning $ 85 billion from the Fed to keep it from cratering in September , upped the total Sunday to $ 150 billion .
Monday , Fannie Mae ( FNM ) reported a $ 29 billion third - quarter loss , far in excess of forecasts , raising the specter that the mortgage giant may need more money after the Treasury pledged to inject $ 100 billion in preferred stock financing in September .
Meanwhile , American Express ( AXP ) received Fed approval to convert to a bank holding company , joining the likes of Morgan Stanley ( MS ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , that have a direct pipeline to borrow from the Fed or the Treasury 's TARP , the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program .
And , of course , Detroit is looking for a credit line from Washington .
General Motors ( GM ) Friday warned it could run out of cash next year without a government loan .
GM plunged another 23 % Monday , to 3.36 , as several analysts helpfully recommended selling shares of the beleaguered auto maker that already had lost more than 85 % of their value .
Visiting the White House Monday , President - elect Obama pressed President Bush to support emergency aid for GM and other auto makers .
The prospect for federal aid for GM ironically weighed on its shares as one bearish analyst said the price of the bailout could be a wipeout of common holders .
Be that as it may , it 's all adding up .
If the late Sen . Everett Dirksen were around today , he might comment that a trillion here , a trillion there and pretty soon you 're talking about real money .
Trillions are no hyperbole .
The Treasury is set to borrow $ 550 billion in the current quarter alone and $ 368 billion in the first quarter of 2009 .
" Near - term pressures on Treasury finances are much more intense than we had thought , " Goldman Sachs economists commented when the government announced its borrowing projections last week .
It may finally be catching up with Uncle Sam .
That 's what the yield curve may be whispering .
But some economists are too deaf , or dumb , to get it .
The yield curve simply is the graph of Treasury yields of increasing maturities , starting from one - month bills to 30 - year bonds .
The slope of the line typically is ascending -- positive in math terms -- because investors would want more to tie up their money for longer periods , all else being equal .
Which it never is .
If they expect yields to rise in the future , they 'll want a bigger premium to commit to longer maturities .
Otherwise , they 'd rather stay short and wait for more generous yields later on .
Conversely , if they think rates will fall , investors will want to lock in today 's yields for a longer period .
The Treasury yield curve -- from two to 10 years , which is how the bond market tracks it -- has rarely been steeper .
The spread is up to 250 basis points ( 2.5 percentage points , a level matched only in the past quarter century in 2002 and 1992 , at the trough of economic cycles .
Based on a simplistic reading of that history and the Cliff Notes version of theory , one economist whose main area of expertise is to get quoted by reporters even less knowledgeable than he , asserts such a steep yield curve typically reflects investors ' anticipation of economic recovery .
Never mind that the yield curve has steepened as the economy has worsened and prospects for recovery have diminished .
Like the Bourbons , the French royal family up to the Revolution , he learns nothing and forgets nothing .
As with so much other things , something else is happening this year .
The steepening of the Treasury yield curve has been accompanied by an increase in the cost of insuring against default by the U.S. Treasury .
It may come as a shock , but there are credit - default swaps on the U.S. government and they have become more expensive -- in tandem with an increase in the spread between two - and 10 - year notes .
This link has been brought to light by Tim Backshall , the chief analyst of Credit Derivatives Research .
The attraction of investors to the short end of the Treasury market is " juxtaposed with the massive oversupply and inflationary expectations of the longer end , " he writes .
Backshall is not alone in this dire assessment .
Scott Minerd , the chief investment officer for fixed income at Guggenheim Partners , a Los Angeles money manager , estimates that total Treasury borrowing for fiscal 2009 will total $ 1.5 trillion - $ 2 trillion .
That was based on $ 700 billion for TARP , a $ 500 billion - $ 750 billion " cyclical deficit , " an additional $ 500 billion stimulus program and some uncertain amount for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
Minerd doubts that private savings in the U.S. and foreign purchases of Treasury debt will be sufficient to meet those government cash requirements .
That leaves the Fed to take up the slack ; that is , monetization of the debt .
However it comes about , Backshall 's charts of the yield curve and the spread on U.S. Treasury CDS paint a dramatic picture .
Both the yield spread and the cost of insuring debt moved up sharply together starting in September .
Let 's recall what happened that month : the Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac bailouts , the AIG bailout and the Lehman Brothers failure .
The two lines continued their parallel ascent with the announcement and ultimate passage of the TARP last month .
And evidence mounted of an accelerating slide in growth .
Cutting through the technical jargon , the yield curve and the credit - default swaps market both indicate the markets are exacting a greater cost to lend to Uncle Sam .
And it 's not because of anticipated recovery , which would reduce , not increase , the cost of insuring Treasury debt against default .
All of which suggests America 's credit line has its limits .
At the beginning of the Clinton administration in the early 1990s , adviser James Carville was stunned at the power the bond market had over the government .
If he came back , Carville said he would want to come back as the bond market so he could scare everybody .
President - elect Obama may come to think Clinton had it easy by comparison .

In the Unix world , " jailbreak " refers to the process where an entire filesystem is open for public access .
Under " jail , " only a small subset of a disk can be read from and written to freely .
Over the weekend , members of the xda-developers forum discovered that you could log into your own system via an Android Market application and start a background process that allows you to access your phone with full system privileges .
Jailbreaking How -To
Gaining system privileges ( " root privileges " ) represents the first step toward fully customizing any Unix - based system like the G1 or the iPhone .
Over at ModMyGPhone , Administrator Kyle Matthews has posted a preliminary list of the G1 file system , as well as complete step - by - step instructions on how to remount the entire system with full read / write privileges .
These steps are based on the original instructions at the xda-developers forum and require a copy of PTerm from the Android Marketplace .
The G1 jailbreak represents just the first step toward opening up the system for general use .
Expect to see a full suite of Unix tools debut soon as they did when the iPhone was jailbroken .
You 'll also likely see a number of customizing tools that allow you to change themes on the phone , including backgrounds and icons ; it will take time before fully graphical command - line applications are developed and distributed .
The G1's relatively low cost and open system offers an exciting new Unix - based platform for any number of hobby and professional uses .
i Phone versus G1
Compared to the iPhone , jailbreaking the G1 was a walk in the park .
The first iPhone jailbreaks required remote access tools that emulated iTunes ' mobile device management calls .
With tools that pretended to be iTunes , the device allowed itself to be accessed and its file system to be modified .
Nothing in the original jailbreak was straightforward and most everything required custom - built software .
In comparison , the G1 jailbreak consists of using a Terminal program , starting a background process and issuing a few standard Unix commands .
Over the last year and a half , Apple has kept moving the ball .
Each iPhone jailbreak has proven harder than the last , as Apple has locked down the iPhone platform and iTunes itself .
The iPhone dev team has had to resort to ever more clever ways to bypass Apple 's relentless policing .
In contrast , the G1 has been developed by the Open Handset Alliance project .
It 's extremely unlikely that this alliance , which is committed to an open platform , will engage in the same kinds of protective shenanigans that Apple has resorted to .
The Android philosophy states that " anyone can contribute to Android and influence its direction .
That means that anyone can download , build , and run the code needed to create a complete mobile device . "
So why jailbreak an already - open device ?
One big jailbreak advantage is that it allows you to bypass the G1's internal storage .
Until now , you were limited by the G1's built - in memory for installing and running programs .
With the jailbreak , you can install applications onto a local SD card and run them from the card .
Running low on memory ?
Just swap cards in and out .
Jailbreaking also allows you to use low - level tools that run in the background .
Want your G1 to call home and report your location every 20 minutes ?
A simple Unix process , called a daemon , can handle that for you .
You can set daemons up to remind you of appointments , to scan for nearby wireless devices and more .
The world of handheld computing does n't begin or end with graphic interfaces .
There 's an enormously rich world of possibilities available through command line processes .
Most importantly , jailbreaking gives you complete control of your system from the bottom up .
It lets you stop thinking of your phone as a handheld gadget and start using it as a fully - capable Unix platform .
People , a video this redonkulous comes across our Cute Overload desks once in a blue moon .
It 's .. well , it 's so bad it 's good .
Never mind the translation , you 'll get it .

First Look
Now in custody : Face of Mumbai's terror
November 29 , 2008
They may have come prepared for raining death and havoc on innocents , but the sole terrorist arrested in the audacious terror strike on Mumbai is not so sure he himself wanted to die , says the tabloid Mumbai Mirror .
His photograph was the one that was flashed by all the media on Thursday , of a young man clad in a Versace t- shirt and cargo pants , a haversack on his back , holding an Ak - 56 rifle and walking across Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus [ Images ] , firing indiscriminately .
Mumbai Mirror quotes the Anti Terrorist Squad confirming that this is the terrorist who is currently in custody .
On Wednesday night , this terrorist spewed bullets in CST station and killing a large number of innocents , before moving to Metro cinema junction nearby , and from there towards Girgaum Chowpatty [ Images ] where in an encounter he shot dead inspector Tukaram Umbale from the Gamdevi police station .
Another Mumbai tabloid , Mid-Day , says this terrorist was the one who shot ATS chief Hemant Karkare [ Images ] , encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar and additional commissioner of police Ashok Kamte outside CST station , and quotes Mumbai Commissioner Hasan Gafoor to confirm this .
From here the terrorist escaped in Salaskar 's own vehicle towards Metro cinema and finally towards Girgaum Chowpatty in a stolen Skoda car where , while his co-terrorist was shot down , he was captured .
Mumbai Mirror describes the terrorist in custody as being around 21 years old , speaking fluent English , and hailing from Gipalpura in Faridkot in Pakistan .
The newspaper says this terrorist , after being shot in the hand , pretended to be dead but was found out on the way to hospital and was promptly arrested .
He was initially tight - lipped but cracked up on seeing the mutilated body of the other terrorist and cried out , ' I do not want to die , please put me on saline . '
Ammunition , a satellite phone and a layout plan of CST station were recovered from the terrorist , who is said to be singing like a canary in custody .
According to the tabloid , the chief of the terrorist operation had come to Mumbai a month ago , took photographs of the various sites , filmed strategic locations apart from training the group to ' kill till the last breath ' .
Each terrorist was given 6 - 7 magazines with 50 bullets , eight hand grenades an AK - 57 , automatic loading revolver and a supply of dry fruits .
The terrorist told his interrogators that the group had left Karachi in one boat and on reaching Gujarat hoisted a white flag .
On interception by the Coast Guard near Porbandar and being questioned by its two officers , they managed to kill one of them and overpowering the other , forcing him to take them till Mumbai .
A few nautical miles away , there were three speedboats waiting for them , which they took to reach the Colaba coast after killing the other Coast Guard officer as well .
On landing the 10 men broke up into groups .
Four went to the Taj Mahal hotel [ Images ] , two to Trident , two towards Nariman House , and two towards CST station -- one of them being the captured terrorist .
He is currently kept in an undisclosed location where the police interrogation has been so intense that he went back on what he told the hospital authorities .
' Now I do n't want to live , ' the newspaper reports him as saying .

DAMASCUS , Syria , Nov. 23 ( UPI ) -- A Syrian official says Iraq 's neighbors should officially oppose its use as a launching pad for acts of aggression against other nations .
Syrian Interior Minister Bassam Abdulmajid , at a meeting of the Security Cooperation and Coordination Committee for Iraq 's Neighbors in Damascus Sunday , criticized a U.S. raid staged last month allegedly aimed at attacking Iraqi terrorists taking shelter across the Syrian border .

The Kuwait news agency , KUNA , said Abdulmajid called for the group to issue a formal policy stating , " Iraq is not to be used as a launch pad for any acts of aggression against neighboring states under any circumstance . "
The group was formed in 2006 by the interior ministers of Iraq 's neighbors in an attempt to assert control over their borders with Iraq and to stop the infiltration of arms and fighters into the country .
Iraqi Foreign Undersecretary Lubaid Abbawi told the group that important political and security developments within Iraq have encouraged the return of refugees to the country , KUNA reported .
Farmers say odd - shaped fruit and veg taste just as good Supermarket giant Sainsbury 's has said it will challenge a ban on selling " ugly " fruit and vegetables which fail to meet EU rules on size and shape .
The move could reduce prices by up to 40 % and cut down on the one - fifth of produce wasted , the retailer said .
The store has written to EU Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel over what it calls " bonkers " regulations .
It decided against selling a Hallowe 'en range of mis-shapen fruit and veg for fear shop managers could be prosecuted .
' Customer choice ' Sainsbury 's said it would also write to Environment Secretary Hilary Benn about the issue , and has launched an online poll for customers .
Among the items the supermarket chain said cannot be sold are : Cauliflowers less than 11 cm ( 4.3 in ) in diameter
" Forked " carrots ( with more than one root )
Onions not at least two thirds covered with skin Sue Henderson , of Sainsbury 's , said : " We have been struggling to fit a square peg in a round hole for too long now when it comes to conforming to the more controversial elements of the EU regulations .
" We 're not allowed to use up to 20 % of what 's produced in this country and in the current credit crunch climate , we cannot continue to waste this much food before it even leaves the farms .
She added : " Buying wonky veg would have saved cash - strapped Britons up to nearly 40 % on some items such as carrots .
" It not only saves money , it also reduces waste and supports our British farmers .
We strongly believe that now is the right time to challenge the impact these regulations have on our customer 's choice . "
Richard Hirst , chairman of the National Farmers ' Union 's ( NFU ) horticulture board , said nature " did not always comply with a perfectly - rounded apple and poker - straight carrot " .
" People should be given the chance to buy odd - shaped fruit and veg as they taste just as good , he said .

One of the unique seasonal activities to do this time of year is to make a trip out to a nearby farm and wander through mazes carved out of corn fields .
Designers of these mazes often make them to form interesting pictures or written messages when seen from a bird ’s - eye view .
I ’ve selected a handful to look at here from Google Maps , Yahoo !
Maps , and Live Search Maps , so enjoy !
Farms which create cornfield mazes are really lucky if they get their mazes captured in the satellite or aerial photos used by the online mapping providers .
Cornfield mazes are by nature seasonal , so there ’s generally only a small number of months in which their patterns could be seen and captured from the air .
Those mazes that are lucky enough to get photographed while they are live can enjoy yet further promotional value all year long as people find the pictures and show them to their friends .
A few of the corn field mazes out there this year are sporting political patterns to derive a bit of promotional value , piggybacking on the fervor surrounding the presidential election .
Other cornfield maze creators appear to be using their crop art to yet further enhance their income by selling advertising space into their patterns —
I ’ve provided a number of examples of these below as well .
Sponsorship messages and ads carved into fields are done by folks who are banking on those ads getting seen by people flying over , getting photographed , getting shown in evening news shows , and getting further distributed through online map images .
I ’ve spoken before about advertising targeting online maps , and it ’s clear that mapvertising like this may grow as an ultra - niche marketing tactic , continuing to heat up in sync with consumer interest in online mapping systems .
Anyway , enjoy this small sampling of the cornfield mazes ( as well as “ maize field mazes ” ) .
Also , find a cornfield maze near your location this month and make the effort to visit in person to get the full , experiential enjoyment out of a really unique thing !
Some of the sites I used when locating corn mazes are included at the end of this article , including some of the top corn maze directories which list mazes by their geography .
Many of the farms out there offer additional activities such as picking out your own pumpkins , hayrides , smaller hay bale mazes , nighttime “ haunted ” maze visits , and more .

On November 6 , South Dakota ’s governor Michael Rounds declared a state of emergency as heavy snow blanketed the state and threatened all parts of it — including Native American reservations .
They , however , were excluded from his declaration .
They ’ll get no badly needed help , and it ’s an all too familiar story for our nation ’s original inhabitants .
They ’ve been abused and slaughtered for over 500 years .
At Mabila , Acoma Mesa , Conestoga , the Trail of Tears , Pamunkey , Mystic River , Yellow Creek , Sand Creek , Gnadenhutten , and Wounded Knee .
At far too many other places as well at a cost of many millions of lives , now forgotten and erased from memory .
Worst still , our Native people continue to be systematically repressed and mistreated .
They live in poverty and despair .
They ’re mocked and demonized in films and society as drunks , beasts , primitives , savages , and people to be Americanized or warehoused on reservations and forgotten .
Their cultures are willfully denigrated .
Their legacy is one of millions slaughtered , betrayal , treaties made and broken , stolen lands , rights denied , and welfare criminally ignored to this day .
The Lakotahs are one of many examples , and the Republic of Lakotah web site highlights their plight .
It welcomes “ all self - sufficient People who come with an open Heart , a Passion for Freedom and a Love for Grand Mother Earth . ”
In a commentary titled “ Broken Promises & Laws , ” it describes a Broken People whose lands were stolen , buffalo massacred , people slaughtered , and who were herded onto reservations in violation of Treaties successive US governments signed and then abrogated .
The Treaty of 1851 , for example , in which the government requested a right - of - way for a road through Lakotah lands to the newly - discovered Montana gold fields .
It became known as the Bozeman Trail to be used only until all gold was removed .
By the Civil War it was gone and the government reneged .
Forts were erected on its right of way .
Lakotahs demanded they be removed .
The US refused , war ensued , and it ended with the Treaty of 1868 .
It stated , “ The government of the United States desires peace , and its honor is hereby pledged to keep it . ”
It also re-affirmed all rights the Indians were granted under the 1851 Treaty .
Those rights and all others were abrogated and denied .
Western North and South Dakota Lakotahs are one of seven Sioux tribes comprising the Great Sioux Nation and are best known by their redoubtable leaders — Sitting Bull , Crazy Horse , Red Cloud and Black Elk , among others .
Names even young school children know but not their heroic feats and the great price they and their people paid .
Before the 1770s , Sioux held territories from Minnesota to the Rocky Mountains and from the Yellowstone to the Platte Rivers .
Until the Treaty of 1868 , they were the richest Native American nation of the northwestern plains , but years earlier their lives were irrevocably changed .
Treaties were made and broken .
Settlers , railroads , and mining interests took their lands and resources .
In 1874 , General George Custer invaded the most sacred Lakotah territory , the Black Hills ( Paha Sapa ) , and with him came gold seekers .
An illegal occupation followed along with billions of dollars of stolen resources and great numbers of lives lost .
All in the name of progress to colonize the continent ’s West .
All at the expense of our Native peoples who lost everything as a result .
The earlier 1787 Northwest Ordinance was deceptive on its face .
Supposedly to afford Indians “ justice ( and ) humanity , ” it , in fact , expanded the nation to admit new states on stolen Native American lands .
Wars followed .
Broken promises and treaties as well in violation of Article 6 of the Constitution that states :
“ This Constitution , and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ; and all Treaties made , or which shall be made , under the Authority of the United States , shall be the supreme Law of the Land ” — binding without qualification on the executive , legislature and judiciary .
The Sioux acted in good faith to avoid confrontation , but in vain .
The executive , Congress , and judiciary denied them their lands , vital resources , and basic rights through a succession of repressive laws :
* Homestead Acts — for settlers only that gave them title to 160 acres of “ underdeveloped ” land outside the original 13 colonies ; 1.6 million in all got around 270 million acres , or 10 % of all US land between 1862 - 1886 ;
* Allotment Acts __ various “ act(s ) to provide for the allotment of land in severalty to Indians on the various reservations and to extend the protection of the laws of the United States over the Indians , and for other purposes ; ” for example , the 1887 Dawes
Act that distributed mostly unwanted and unviable land in Oklahoma ; it was done by dividing reservations into privately - owned parcels to destroy Native cultures , impose western values , and achieve forced assimilation ;
* the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 to force citizenship on all Native Americans ; the words of one spoke for many : “ United States citizenship was just another way of absorbing us and destroying our customs and government ; how could these Europeans come over and tell us we were citizens in our country ; we had our citizenship ; ” it ’s “ in our nations ; ” forcing their citizenship on us “ was a violation of our sovereignty ; ”
* the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act ( aka the Wheeler - Howard Act or the Indian New Deal ) ; it reversed Dawes provisions and created what Native Americans call the first Apartheid Act that still applies ; the 1964 Bantu Development
Act copied this law and institutionalized black and white separation in South Africa ; the same practice exists now in Occupied Palestine , in US inner cities , and wherever else white supremacists want unwanted people kept out of their restricted spaces ;
* forced relocations continued during the 1950s and 1960s ;
* Supreme Court rulings against Native American religious practices ; in City of Boerne v. Flores ( June 1997 ) , the Court ruled against the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration
Act that prohibited the government from “ substantially burdening ” a believer ’s religious practices ; the Court held that this act attempted to overturn its own First Amendment interpretation ; in Employment Division v. Smith ( April 1990 ) , the Court ruled that Oregon could deny unemployment benefits to a person fired for violating a state prohibition on the use of peyote , even for a religious ritual ; in other words , this and similar practices are n’t protected under the First Amendment freedom of religion provision ; and
* Native Americans on reservations are n’t entitled to the same constitutional rights ( like free speech , religion , assembly , and due process , etc. ) as other Americans even though they ’re legal citizens ; non-Indian people when on reservations ( so - called “ tribal trust status lands ” ) also relinquish these rights while there ; in addition , “ tribal sovereignty ” benefits leaders alone , not their people , and tribal chiefs get their authority from the Interior Secretary and US - run Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) .
“ Tribal sovereignty ” is a profound misnomer .
It belies any sense that Indians on reservations are self - governing .
They are not .
There are no checks and balances , no separation of powers , no constitutional protections , and the US government owns the lands as federal territories under “ plenary power ” in trust status .
In 1978 , the Supreme Court ruled that Indian tribal chiefs and councils ( not US law ) have full authority over their people , and these “ governments ” are empowered by Washington .
Indian tribes are beholden to the government for help and need permission for most everything they do .
Their people on reservations remain warehoused , abused and forgotten .
The notion of “ sovereignty ” is another indignity , a charade , and silent outrage against our proud original inhabitants .
Out of sight and mind in tribal “ homelands , ” no different than South Africa ’s former bantustans and equally oppressive .
The Republic of Lakotah Today : A Broken People the Result of Broken Promises and Broken Laws
To this day , Native Americans and the Lakotah people are victims of what Ward Churchill calls “ A Little Matter of Genocide ” that he explained in his book by that title .
It ’s from American Indian Movement founder , Russell Means , who spoke of “ a little matter of genocide right here at home ” by which he meant a process still ongoing .
In 1944 , jurist Raphael Lemkin first defined the term to mean :
the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group ” that corresponds to other terms like “ tyrannicide , homocide , infanticide , etc . ”
Genocide “ does not necessarily mean the… destruction of a nation , except when accomplished by mass killings … .
It is intended … to signify a coordinated plan ( to destroy ) the essential foundations of the life of national groups ” with intent to eradicate or substantially weaken or harm them .
“ Genocidal plans involve the disintegration ….of political and social institutions , culture , language , national feelings , religion … economic existence , personal security , liberty , health , dignity , and ” human lives .
The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( adopted December 1948 and took effect in January 1951 ) defines genocide in legal terms as follows :
“ any ( acts like those Lemkin cited ) committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , the national , ethnical , racial or religious group ( by ) killing ( its ) members ; causing ( them ) serious bodily or mental harm ; ( or ) deliberately inflicting ( on them ) conditions ” that may destroy them in whole or in part .
Destroying peoples ’ cultures , preventing them from practicing their religion , speaking their language , and / or passing on their traditions to new generations are acts of genocide .
Nowhere does the Constitution let government abuse its people or deny them their rights .
Nowhere does it authorize genocide , either in or outside the country , or permit the theft and occupation of their lands or any others .
Nowhere does it say “ We the People ” are the chosen few or that the minimum function of government is less than to insure the “ general welfare ” as stated in the Preamble and Article I , Section 8 as follows :
“ The Congress shall have power to … provide for … ( the ) general welfare of the United States ” — the so - called welfare clause for all its citizens .
Nowhere does it sanction rampant crime , unequal justice , political or corporate corruption , dishonest officials , raging social problems , the right to ignore the law , or to be able to slaughter and abuse its Native people .
Nonetheless , it happens .
Most egregiously to native Indians for over 500 years and counting .
Before early Europeans arrived , the Americas ( North and South by expert estimates ) were home to over 100 million indigenous peoples .
From 1492 to 1892 , US Census Bureau figures showed less than 250,000 survived .
Or put another way — white Europeans committed the greatest ever genocide that was rivaled only , but not equaled , by the one against black Africans who were stolen into slavery for the “ new world . ”
Millions of them died during capture and the Middle Passage .
Our Native peoples in even greater numbers — victimized by ritual slaughter .
By being hacked apart , buried alive , trampled under horses , hunted as game and fed to dogs , shot , beaten , stabbed , and even scalped for bounty or as trophies .
They were also hung on meathooks like beef , thrown into the sea from ships ( the way blacks were ) , worked to death as slaves , starved , frozen to death during forced marches and internments , and infected with deadly diseases .
Our disturbing “ civilization ” that ’s untaught in American schools , and when it is Indians are the villains and the settlers their victims .
History on its head the way Hollywood portrays it and still does .
Ward Churchill recounts otherwise about what he calls “ the American holocaust ” and compares it to the Jewish one under the Nazis .
He explains that :
“ Distinctions … between right , center , left and extreme left in the US are quite literally nonexistent on the question of genocide of indigenous peoples .
From all four vantage points , the historical reality is simultaneously denied , justified , and in most cases celebrated ( or just forgotten .
But preposterous as these arguments are , all of them are ) outstripped by a substantial component of zionism which contends not only that the American holocaust never happened , but that no ‘ true ’ genocide has ever occurred , other than the Holocaust suffered by the Jews ” in Nazi Germany .
It ’s an all too familiar pattern of historical revisionism or denial to view one people ’s ordeal as important , preeminent or unique and another ’s as non-existent — depending , of course , on who suffered and who caused it .
After WW II , Zionist Jews copyrighted Hitler ’s genocide , rebranded it “ The Holocaust , ” framed it as a one - off event , and created the myth of unique Jewish suffering .
The Plight of the Lakotah People
The Republic of Lakotah web site recounts it from the first official political and diplomatic contacts “ between Lakotah and the ( US ) government began in earnest after the United States ( completed ) the ( so - called ) Louisiana Purchase in 1803 . ”
It refers to “ fantasy ” US history about the purported French sale of 530 million acres for a mere $ 15 million — part of which belonged to Lakotahs who were n’t consulted or consented to the transaction .
The first “ peace and friendship ” treaty followed in 1805 .
Like others later on , it was systematically ignored and violated as settlers invaded , encroached , and occupied Lakotah lands .
Throughout the 19th century , the US government “ engaged in multiple military , legal and political strategies … to deny Lakotah our right to freedom and self - determination . ”
Even after the Supreme Court ’s 1883 Ex Parte Crow Dog decision , it persisted .
The Court recognized Lakotah freedom and independence in ruling that tribes held exclusive jurisdiction over their internal affairs .
It did n’t matter as in 1885 Congress passed the Major Crimes
Act to extend US jurisdiction into Lakotah territory , and more egregious actions followed .
One was the 1903 Supreme Court Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock decision that recognized near absolute plenary congressional power over Indian affairs , virtually exempt from judicial oversight .
It was an outrageous ruling to let the government freely expropriate tribal lands and resources on the pretext of fulfilling its federal trust responsibilities .
Quite simply , it empowered Washington and rendered Indians impotent over their own internal affairs , with no rights of any kind without Washington ’s permission .
This ruling was then used to violate hundreds of treaties between the government and indigenous peoples , including Lakotahs .
As a result , the sacred Black Hills were stolen along with billions of dollars of resources from them .
America was on the move .
Lakotahs were in the way , so they were shoved aside through all the various ways described above .
Today , the Republic of Lakotah explains the “ Genocidal Results of the Failed American Indian Policies of the United States ” under the following headings :
Mortality
Lahotah men have the world ’s lowest life expectancy at 44 years ;
the Lakotah death rate is the highest in America ;
the Lakotah infant mortality rate is three time the US average ;
one - fourth of Lakotah children are fostered or adopted by non-Indian households — a willful Americanization policy to destroy their culture and existence ;
Lakotahs have epidemic levels of disease and illness ; and
teenage Lakotah suicide is 150 % higher than the US national average .
Poverty
median income is a shocking $ 2600 - $ 3500 a year ;
97 % of Lakotahs live below the poverty line — unmatched anywhere in the world except by other indigenous peoples ; and
most families can’t afford heating oil , wood , propane or any way to heat homes .
Unemployment
it ’s at 80 % or higher ; and
government funding for job creation is lost through cronyism and corruption .
Housing
it ’s so inadequate that many elderly die each winter from hypothermia ( freezing to death ) ;
one - third of homes lack clean water and sewage ;
40 % have no electricity ;
60 % no telephone ;
60 % are infected with potentially fatal black molds ; and
an estimated 17 people on average live in each family home — many with only two or three rooms ; some homes built for six to eight people have up to 30 living in them .
Drugs and Alcohol
drug addiction afflicts over half of Lakotah adults ; two known meth - amphetamine labs are allowed to operate ; and
alcoholism affects 90 % of families .
Disease
the tuberculosis rate for Lakotahs is about 800 % higher than the US national average ;
cervical cancer is 500 % higher ;
diabetes 800 % higher ; and
the Federal Commodity Food Program provides sugar - rich foods that cause high rates of diabetes , heart disease , and other preventable illnesses and diseases .
Incarceration
the rate for Indian children is 40 % higher than for whites ;
Indians have the second largest state prison incarceration rate in the nation after blacks ; and
most Indians live on reservations that are supposed to be self - governing – in principle , that is ; around 2 % of Indians live under state jurisdiction .
Threatened Culture
only 14 % of Lakotahs speak their native language ;
it ’s not being taught inter-generationally ; the average age of fluent Lakotah speakers is 65 ; thus the language is endangered and on the verge of extinction ; and
the Lakotah language is forbidden to be taught in US government schools — a further indignity inflicted on the people .
A Final Comment
In September 2007 , the UN General Assembly adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples .
It passed 143 - 4 with only Australia , New Zealand , Canada and the US voting “ no . ” Eleven nations abstained .
This document enumerates the “ collective rights of the world ’s 370 million native peoples , calls for the maintenance and strengthening of their cultural identities , and emphasizes their right to pursue development in keeping with their own needs and aspirations . ”
The Declaration affirms the right of native peoples “ to the recognition , observance and enforcement of treaties concluded with States or their successors .
It also prohibits discrimination against indigenous peoples and promotes their full and effective participation in all matters that concern them . ”
This document concluded 25 years of “ contentious negotiations over the rights of native people to protect their lands and resources , and to maintain their unique cultures and traditions . ”
In that and the above stated respects , it ’s historic and important .
Nonetheless , America has its own “ traditions ” over and above those of others it disdains and abuses – the poor , non-whites , the disadvantaged , labor , non-Jews and Christians , virtually everyone outside its white supremacists elites , and clearly its Native peoples from the earliest settlers to the present day .
Nothing ’s changed from then to now — Broken Promises , Broken Laws , Broken Treaties , and Broken Hope for a Broken People suffering hugely in the United States of America — out of sight and mind and not an issue for the dominant news media .
Very much one for people who care .
« California : Ungovernable | Main | Daily Polling Report : The Day After » Truth And Reconciliation
by Turkana I 've been out of commission the past few days , but Meteor Blades yesterday explained the necessity of holding the Bush criminals accountable .
Barack Obama 's promises of a broad bipartisan focus on solving our country 's problems may prove as wise as the similar message of the Civil War president whose words echoed in the Grant Park speech .
But that healing cannot occur , not wholly , unless the crimes that have brought our nation to such a ruinous condition - morally , economically and politically - are investigated thoroughly and a proper penalty imposed .
Most importantly , the bent machinery that allowed , nay encouraged , those crimes must be rebuilt with safeguards so that they never occur again .
That 's not vengeance .
It 's justice .
And true healing and progress cannot come about without it .
We are a nation of laws or we are n't .
We are all equal under the law or we are n't .
And if we once again allow criminal Republicans to get away with their crimes , they will eventually find their ways back to the corridors of power where they can engage in new and ever more sinister depredations .

Several councils have banned the use of Latin terminology
A number of local councils in Britain have banned their staff from using Latin words , because they say they might confuse people .
Several local authorities have ruled that phrases like " vice versa " , " pro rata " , and even " via " should not be used , in speech or in writing .
But the ban has prompted anger among some Latin scholars .
Professor Mary Beard of Cambridge University said it was the linguistic equivalent of ethnic cleansing .
Some local councils say using Latin is elitist and discriminatory , because some people might not understand it - particularly if English is not their first language .
Bournemouth Council is among those which have discouraged Latin .
It has drawn up a list of 18 Latin phrases which its staff are advised not to use , either verbally or in official correspondence .
The council denies that it places a ban on Latin words .
A council spokesman said : " We advise against using certain words , particularly when staff are writing to those whose first language may not be English .
" The advice is intended as a guide only , not a direction . "
However , the council 's Plain Language Guide lists Latin under the heading " Things To Avoid " .
Other local councils have banned " QED " and " ad hoc " , while other typical Latin terms include " bona fide " , " ad lib " and " quid pro quo " .
But the move has been welcomed by the Plain English Campaign which says some officials only use Latin to make themselves feel important .
A Campaign spokesman said the ban might stop people confusing the Latin abbreviation e.g. with the word " egg " .
OTTAWA – The once - mighty Liberal party has raised less money from fewer donors so far this year than the NDP , traditionally the poor sister of Canadian politics .
According to quarterly financial returns posted by Elections Canada , fewer than 35,000 donors contributed a total of $ 3.6 million to the Liberal party from January to September this year .
Over the same period , the Conservatives vacuumed up almost $ 15 million from more than 125,000 individuals .
Even the NDP did better than the Liberals , raking in $ 3.7 million from almost 44,000 contributors .
The dismal financial news comes just as Liberals are digesting the results of the Oct. 14 election , in which the party fell to its lowest share of the popular vote – 26.2 per cent – since Confederation .
Party president Doug Ferguson said he expects the party will be left with a $ 2 - 3 million campaign debt after it receives rebates on campaign expenses from Elections Canada .
Moreover , since each party receives a public subsidy worth $ 1.95 per vote , the Liberals ' reduced vote share will translate into an annual loss of $ 1.6 million for the party .
Ferguson acknowledged the Liberals ' financial straits are worrying .
But he noted that the party traditionally rakes in the bulk of its donations in the fourth quarter and predicted that by year end the Liberals will surpass the NDP in fundraising .
However , the party will have to compete for scarce dollars with a half dozen or more Liberal leadership contenders , who will soon be scouring the country for donations .
Candidates to succeed outgoing Leader Stephane Dion are expected to bolt quickly out of the gate after the Liberal national executive meets next weekend to set the timing , location and rules for the leadership convention .
The convention is most likely to be held next May in Vancouver .
The Liberal party has been struggling to raise money since 2004 , when political financing reforms severely limited personal and corporate contributions .
Stephen Harper 's Conservatives tightened those rules even further in 2007 , banning corporate donations outright and capping annual personal contributions at $ 1,100 .
Traditionally most reliant on big corporate donations , the Liberal party has had the most trouble adapting to the new regime .
By contrast , the Tories have thrived , tapping into their Reform party roots to master the art of raising lots of small donations from thousands upon thousands of individuals .
" There 's a recognition that we do have to change our fundraising culture , " Ferguson said .
" I 'm concerned , of course , but I sense a desire and a willingness of the party to make the changes we need to make and turn things around . "
Ferguson said his goal is to eventually match the Conservatives ``dollar for dollar . "
Dion has also made fundraising his top priority during his remaining few months as leader .
He blames the Liberals ' election defeat on the fact that the party could not afford to counter costly Tory attack ads that denigrated him and his controversial carbon tax plan .
Ferguson hypothesized that the Tories and NDP have been able to tap into a sense of grievance and passion among their supporters to raise money .
But Liberals , who tend to be moderate centrists , are generally less aggrieved or impassioned and it's consequently proved harder to motivate them to give money .
" At either end of the political spectrum , I think people are more motivated to give .
I think it 's because of emotion . "
Still , Ferguson said the jaw - dropping fundraising success of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama proves that average people will open their wallets if they 're inspired .
" We have to give meaning and value to being a Liberal .
We also have to give them inspiration . "

As an Alaskan I 'm concerned about the integrity of the vote , in fact I 'm concerned about my own vote counting .
When I completed the ballot the official took and instead of scanning it , he put it in a side slot .
The stated reason was the machine was n't printing .
This did n't make much sense and I questioned the head official who indicated that when the ' new ' machine arrived all those in the side slot would be scanned at that time .
So I do n't really know if my ballot was ever scanned .
I have a call into the DOE .
What I do n't see in the above article is what or where the ' found ' ballots were from .
Are these regular election day ballots or are these absentee ?

and the number of uncounted ballots in California jumps from 1.6 million to way over 2 million over the weekend .
HEY , election officials can't even count BALLOTS , and institute appropriate accounting checks and balances and reporting for that , why should anyone believe they ( or their secret vote counting computers ) can count VOTES , when they can't even count and report BALLOTS properly ?

As a concerned citizen from Michigan and trally never wanting to hear your governor say , I know what I know what I know !
I 'm very concerned that this woman may be unvetted and run again for any public office .
I am concerned that the total vote in Alaxka is at a little over 314,000 while you have a 670,000 Native Eskimo population .
Does that mean that the majority of them dib not care to vote or just were excluded ?
You also have aminority of African Americans living in Alaska who seemingly have been barred from participation in the politics of Alaska , were their ballots just thrown in a box like the person 's above ?
This episode in ALaska history does not bear well .
And that Palin recently made effort to enter the world on a national stage does not suggest Alaska has much to offer in world governance .
Maybe ALazka should begin to look at impeachment proceedings !
Do n't destroy youselves Alaska , you 're a state I once skated to across the tarmac on the way to Vietnam .

It is unbelievable .
Count the ballots and move on .
I am so sick of Democrats and their conspiracy theories .
They need to be investigated for all of the corruption in that Party .
They are responsible for the financial crisis , the negative mood in America , and for the new Socialist President we will have .
It really is sad that the Democratic Party has become what it is .
Very , very sad .

Dear MegaWhy ,
I 'm always baffled when people dismissively invoke the notion of misguided , partisan conspiracy theories .
I missed the part where conpiracy theories got a bad name .
Was it the Bay of Pigs ?
Was it the Gulf of Tonkin Incident ?
Was it the Iran - Contra Scandal ?
Was it the Pentagon Papers ?
Was it the CIA 's involvement in the overthrow of Allende in Chile ?
Arbenz in Guatemala ? or Mossadeqh in Iran ?
Was it the litany of lies and misinformation leading up to the Iraq War ?
or the lies told us about the FISA program ?
or the lies that we 're not torturing people around the world ?
or the lies about imminent societal collapse if we do n't sign on for the bailout ?
Perspectives are funny things .
I myself am sick and tired of ignorance , denial , and a failure to take responsibility for any aspect of the incredible mess we 're in after eight years of Rebulicans being in power .

I do n't see how any election in Alaska could be " called " for any candidate , when the day of the elections , the new commentators were saying that it would be at least 10 days before the total results from Alaska could be tallied .
How could this be considered voter fraud when the news media already knew in advance the results would be 10 days minimum forthcoming ?

Do n't let them swear Ted Stevens back in before the official counting is done , as they did with Brian Bilbrae in CD50 in 2006 .
Once he is sworn in , no matter what the final vote count comes in at , and no matter what any court should find , the Senate has the final say over which members of the Senate get to stay and who shall go .
I 'm not sure what the swearing - in rules are , but the Repugs made a rapid jet trip to San Diego to pick up Brian Bilbrae ( R ) a week after the election took place with over 60,000 ballots to be counted , flew him to D.C. and swore him into the House of Representatives .
The subsequent court encounter ended when House Speaker at the time , Dennis Hastert , informed the court that it had no jurisdiction , since the man had already been sworn in .
So we know this is not beyond the Repugs to do , so what does a simple 7 - felony conviction have to do with holding a senate seat .
Dems - better be on the lookout for this before the rest of the " newly discovered " ballots are counted .

Definition : Rubulican noun .
An unfortunate creature suffering from Hearing AIDS , which is a disease acquired from listening , uncritically , to @ssholes such as Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly .
They are easy to identify since they have two major traits : continuously spouting opinions which are in obvious conflict with reality and calling everyone else one of democrat|socialist | communist|left - winger .
They also call the Democratic Party the Democrat Party ( apparently this is considered clever , albeit ignorant ) .
Since the Rubulican is an extreme Right Winger ( aka Fascist ) , all other parties appear leftist , so they almost always mistake Green party members ( and even Libertarians ) as Democrats .
Rubulicans are anti-science unless it further enhances their goal of transferring all remaining wealth of the poor and middle class to the top 0.1 % of the wealthy .
Rubulicans believe that saving the environment is a waste of time since the ' End Of Days ' is REAL SOON NOW and since earth will be HELL after the Rapture it is our duty to f_ck it up as much as possible .
Rubulicans appear to have no ability to think on their own .
They all appear to acquire their opinions from the same small number of sources .
They will repeat the same , discredited nonsense over and over .
It 's nice of the Rubulicans to drop by .
They have a lot in common with RonDroids .

For Christene - # 8 -
You are correct in saying they indicated it would take some time , in fact 21 days , not 10 , as they must provide for ballots postmarked by the 4th to arrive by the 19th to be counted by the 25th .
However , they also said they were dealing with about 50,000 in the reports you are alluding to including the expected mail - ins .
Suddenly there are now over 90,000 .
That is the news .
Somehow , about 40,000 votes just got discovered .
As for the election outcome being called , that may happen by media outlets but they have no authority .
The actual call is made by the chief electoral officer and in theory - Florida 2000 proving it is just that - the call is not made until all votes are counted .

Rubulicans also want Mandatory Voter Ideas , that must be some kind of litmus test that if you do n't have a clue who you are voting for , your vote is not allowed to count .
The only problem with that is that the Rubulican has their ideas formed by think tanks funded by the 1%ers , repeated by Wingnut radio and then think that the idea came out of thin air from their own wittle pea brain .
Instead of preventing the poor and minorities from voting , maybe the Rubulican should do us all a favor and just stay home on election day because they do n't have any idea .

# 4 Both parties are responsible for the market crisis and looming depression .
Congress was told by the people to cut this crap out , not to bail these thieves out , to force the bad bids into the light , lower the leveraging , ala the Denninger Genisis Plan ( OR something like it ) so that this junk could clear out and trust would be restored in the markets .
Instead they ( that 's plural ) PLANNED for this to happen .
At this point we ( that 's you and me ) do n't know where the money is going .
THEY WON'T FUCKING SAY !!!
Congress , is feasic to whats up and yet is willfully refuses to stop it .
Considering the amount of money ( 100 trillion ) involved is more than in recorded history , I have to say BOTH parties are the worst socialists in world and recorded history .
To brow beat progressives for wanting things like the vote to be counted , healthcare , infrastructure , etc. , is a mere pittance compared to the socialist ( and criminal oath breaking ) theft by credit , money / counterfeit and murder ( from war ) going on .
You need to turn off the Radio and Tube friend .
Good thing you are in the right place ( bradblog ) to see past all that crap , if you dare look .
On the other hand if your part of the dead - enders ( to steal back a figure of speech from Rumsfield ) there 's not much we can do for you and eventually you 'll be exposed in this format .

When you vote you sign in .
When your absentee ballot is received , it is added to the " voted " list .
When you vote early , you sign in .
So is there a discrepancy between the " voted " list and the number of ballots ?
Should n't be that hard to verify .
But then again , it 's Alaska .

Listen to the whining Democrats .
You got your socialist president candidate elected , so what more do you have to whine about ?
I give it about 2 years , when you realize YOUR taxes are going up , you job is gone , interest rates on your home start to climb , and you listen for the latest level of terror alert and where the last strike was .

The democrats are resorting to voter fraud AGAIN .
Look at MN .
Exit polling had the republican up by 8 points .
The democrats have stolen enough ballots to get it down to less then 300 votes .
Maybe the democrats should change the name of their party to ACORN .
Palin was the most qualified candidate .
Palin 2012 [ed note : Exit polls had the DEMOCRAT up by 8 points .
Knowing disinformation will get you banned here and there is almost no way to believe you do n't know this is disinformation .
This is your warning . -- 99 ]

Whining Democrats ?
It 's you pompous Rupuglikkkans that are the whiners .
At least Dems are prepared to pay some extra taxes in order to get our country back to where it should be ( and would be if Rupubs had n't practically destroyed it in the ast 8 years , unlike you Rupubs who only thin of your selfish butts .
Y'all lost get over it !

My son lives in Chicago and witnessed postal carriers opening absentee ballots and tearing them up .
After they tossed them out the window of the vehicle , he looked at them , only those with a particular candidate were found .

To be clear , they are just counting ballots as they find them - a bad count on top of previous bad counts - or are they going to put them together at some point and just do a new top - down statewide recount ?
Because they SHOULD do the 2nd .
And MegaWhy -- Dems are responsible for the financial crisis ?
Really ?
After 8 years of a Republican Administration who always got their way , even from a bare majority Dem congress , and after 20 years prior to that where even Clinton followed the Republican financial deregulation ?
After Republican free - traders designed passed and controlled the entire financial system , it is DEMOCRATS fault it imploded ?

I contacted a reliable source in the Begich campaign .
" Ballots keep coming in and are allowed .
We give longer than most states of overseas absentee ballots to arrive because it takes them longer to get here .
Several thousand continue to arrive and will until around Nov. 17 , which is around the cutoff date .

Vivian Schiller , who heads the online operations of The New York Times , will leave the paper to become the president and chief executive of National Public Radio , the network announced on Tuesday .
Ms. Schiller , 47 , will take over NPR on Jan. 5 , heading a nonprofit corporation with a budget of more than $ 150 million and an endowment of more than $ 240 million .
It provides news and entertainment programming to more than 800 public radio stations around the country and claims an audience of 26 million people .
Ms. Schiller will succeed Kevin Klose , who served as president for 10 years , and Dennis L. Haarsager , the interim chief executive .
Mr. Klose recently became NPR ’s president emeritus and president of the NPR Foundation .
The network has gone through several high - level power struggles in recent years , including clashes with Bush administration appointees at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting who suggested that NPR had a liberal bias .
In 2006 , it pushed its top news executive into a lesser job , and last March , the NPR board forced out Kenneth Stern just 18 months after naming him chief executive .
It ’s one of those rules of basketball .
Never pick the white guy .
Was n’t that the lesson of White Men Ca n’t Jump ?
When the United States won gold in Beijing this past summer , do you know how many white guys were on the team ?
Zero .
When the Boston Celtics won the 2008 NBA title , how many white guys did they have on their team ?
Technically two ( Scott Pollard and Brian Scalabrine ) , but neither played so effectively zero .
But what if you had to construct a team entirely of white guys ?
What ’s more , let ’s not include any foreign born players .
European basketball has helped prop up an ever shrinking production of white players from the U.S. So no Dirk Nowitzki ( Germany ) , no Pau Gasol ( Spain ) , and no Steve Nash ( Canadian ) among others .
Here ’s you current All Whitey team for the United States :
THE STARTING FIVE :
PG – Kirk Hinrich , Chicago Bulls
When the Bulls drafted Derrick Rose , Hinrich became a back - up on his own team .
But he ’s good enough to be the starter for this team and probably for another NBA team once he leaves Chicago .
He ’s an agile defender and a decent spot - up shooter , with the ability to distribute like a true point guard .
He ’s not a pure scorer , and that ’s acceptable for a point guard , who should be more of a distributor .
However , he ’s not a great penetrator and his shooting has generally been lackluster in his NBA career outside of the 2006 - 07 season .
SG – Mike Miller , Minnesota Timberwolves
The former Florida Gator possesses one of the most gorgeous shots in the game , and is easily a successful shooting guard .
At least on the offensive side of the ball .
His size at 6 - 8 also allows him to be a force on the boards .
Where he struggles is on the defensive side , where his lack of lateral movement is exposed as a shooting guard .
He can play small forward as well , where his defensive short comings are less obvious .
He ’s on this team as a secondary scorer , making 40 percent or more of his 3 point attempts .
Plus , he brings one of the worst hairdos in the league to the team .
SF – Mike Dunleavy , Jr. , Indiana Pacers
Dunleavy broke out last season , showing good range and increased accuracy from both two and three point range .
He ’s a natural small forward , where his lack of quickness is covered up by his ability to recognize plays and take the occasional charge .
His lack of strength also makes him more of a slasher / cutter type that can spot up when needed .
Dunleavy basically gets by with a decent offensive game and the smarts to cover up any physical deficiencies .
On this team , he ’s basically our top scorer who will also help set up other guys .
PF – David Lee , New York Knicks
Another former Florida Gator , Lee is a high - efficiency forward who rebounds like crazy .
He shoots well from the floor and from the free throw line , although he lacks a strong offensive game .
He ’s basically a player that can burn you if others draw the defensive focus .
In New York he often rode the pine in favor of higher priced busts like Eddy Curry , but new coach Mike D’Antoni has give Lee a starting gig this year and he appears headed for his best season yet .
His rebounding and high - percentage shooting are probably undervalued by many in the game .
He ’s starting here mainly to be a rebounding machine .
C – Chris Kaman , Los Angeles Clippers
Yes , I know Kaman represented Germany in the most recent Olympics .
But he ’s basically American .
He was born in Michigan , holds dual citizenship ( U.S. and Germany ) , and only acquired German citizenship last July in order to compete in the Olympics ( his great - grandparents were German ) .
So he counts for this team .
Kaman ’s developed over the past few seasons into a post scorer and one of the game ’s best rebounders .
He ’s a force on the blocks offensively , and can actually shoot from the line .
That ’s rare for a big man .
He ’s also ambidextrous , making him strong with both hands and tough to defend .
On the defensive side , his rebounding prowess comes into play and he ’s an outstanding shot blocker .
Unlike most players on this team , he ’s not a defensive liability .
And he can compete with Mike Miller for worst hair .
Kaman ’s basically the franchise with his offensive and defensive game .
THE BENCH :
C- Brad Miller , Sacramento Kings
Miller seems to be towards the tail end of a strong career , and had a bit of a career revival last season .
How long he can keep that up remains to be seen , but for now he holds a spot on this team over guys like teammate Spencer Hawes .
At his best , Miller is one of the most skilled 7 - footers to ever play the game .
He possesses a strong outside shot , solid ball handling skills , strong passing skills , and is a great free throw shooter .
What he lacks is finish around the rim , a low - post game , and quickness or athleticism in general .
This prevents Miller from being an elite player in the Robinson / Olajuwon mold and also makes him a mediocre defender .
Miller ’s our insurance for when Kaman gets injured .
SG – Kyle Korver , Utah Jazz
Every team needs a shooter coming off the bench , and on this one it ’s Kyle Korver .
Basically a Mike Miller - lite , he ’s a long - range specialist , who came come into without being a terrible defender .
Like Miller , he ’s deadly from three point range and his size and active hands make him a passable team defender .
Plus , an all white guy team is n’t complete without a member of the Utah Jazz .
I think it ’s just one of those rules that the Jazz have white guys and that one of them has to make this squad .
PG – Steve Blake , Portland Trailblazers
He ’s started 195 NBA games , but he ’s not really starter material .
Still he does enough positives , without really hurting you .
He distributes the ball without turning it over , he can knock down open jumpers , and can play just enough defense to not look horrid out there .
Best used in a reserve role , Blake is this team ’s back - up point guard , who can spell Hinrich for 15 - 20 minutes a night .
PF – Kevin Love , Minnesota Timberwolves
Only a rookie , Love makes this squad for his collegiate accomplishments and likely success in the pros .
Standing a burly 6 - 10 , Love has good size , but not great athleticism .
What Love does possess is a bevy of basketball tools .
He ’s a strong long range shooter , as well as an accomplished post scorer .
His greatest asset is probably his passing , where he ’s described as an unbelievable outlet passer .
He ’s also a strong rebounder .
Love compares pretty favorably to another player on this team , Brad Miller .
Love ’s end of the bench for now , but hopefully moving on up shortly .
SF – Wally Szcerbiak , Cleveland Cavaliers
Fun fact , Szcerbiak was born in Madrid , Spain .
But do n’t worry , he ’s all American and plenty qualified for this team ( his American dad was playing overseas at the time ) .
Szcerbiak wins a spot on this squad at the expense of Jason Kapono .
Szcerbiak ’s game is , and stop me if you heard this before , being a deadly accurate outside shooter while possessing below - average athleticism .
He struggles off the dribble , but can score spotting up and in the post .
And unlike Korver , he ’s more of a pure scorer than a long - range specialist .
His defense is passable if not left in one - on - one situations .
Szczerbiak ’s claim to fame right now is probably his $ 10 million expiring contract , making him trade bait for teams looking for cap space .
Szcerbiak backs - up Dunleavy .
PF – Troy Murphy , Indiana Pacers
Despite his 6 - 11 size , Murphy is a good three point shooter .
He ’s also a rugged rebounder and has become a good distributor .
The bad ?
He ’s terrible on defense .
He ’s slow , not much of a shot blocker , and at times a bit soft .
Basically this left provides you with a quietly efficient offensive game mixed in with loudly sub -par defense .
That should make a decent bench guy , and on this team he ’ll be the scoring option if the starter are having an off night .
PF – Nick Collison , Oklahoma City Thunder
Collison ’s only 6 - 9 , but he ’s a strong rebounder and a decent enough shooter .
Collison plays a bunch of center for the former Super Sonics , but he ’s undersized in that role and more naturally a power forward .
His use off the bench will be for rebounding and defensive purposes .
He ’s not a scorer like Troy Murphy , but he can provide some inside presence without being an extreme liability on defense .
He can also slide into the paint if needed .
Amazing at it seems , Collison ’s gotten consideration to represent the U.S. in various international events .
Here Collison is a frontcourt back - up .
Honorable Mention : Luke Ridnour ( Milwaukee Bucks ) , Brent Barry ( Houston Rockets ) , Jason Kopono ( Toronto Raptors ) , Luke Walton ( Los Angeles Lakers ) , Adam Morrison ( Charlotte Bobcats ) , J.J. Redick ( Orlando Magic ) , Spencer Hawes ( Sacramento Kings ) , Aaron Gray ( Chicago Bulls ) , Joel Przybilla ( Portland Trailblazers ) .
So there you have it .
The best All White team one can come up with at this moment .
The question is how good are they ?
How many games could they win in an NBA season ?
Are they even a playoff team ?
And can they defend anyone ?
What do you think ?
[ poll id = ” 8 ″ ]
And one more bonus for getting this far , whitey Chris “ Birdman ” Anderson in the dunk contest :
They are looking for the hockey stick .
Hockey sticks are the shape technology startups hope their sales graphs will assume : a modestly ascending blade , followed by a sudden turn to a near - vertical long handle .
Those who assembled in San Jose in late October for the Singularity Summit are awaiting the point where machine intelligence surpasses that of humans and takes off near - vertically into recursive self - improvement .
The key , said Ray Kurzweil , inventor of the first reading machine and author of 2005 's The Singularity Is Near , is exponential growth in computational power - " the law of accelerating returns " .
In his favourite example , at the human genome project 's initial speed , sequencing the genome should have taken thousands of years , not the 15 scheduled .
Seven years in , the genome was 1 % sequenced .
Exponential acceleration had the project finished on schedule .
By analogy , enough doublings in processing power will close today 's vast gap between machine and human intelligence .
This may be true .
Or it may be an unfalsifiable matter of faith , which is why the singularity is sometimes satirically called " the Rapture for nerds " .
It makes assessing progress difficult .
Justin Rattner , chief technology officer of Intel , addressed a key issue at the summit : can Moore 's law , which has the number of transistors packed on to a chip doubling every 18 months , stay in line with Kurzweil 's graphs ?
The end has been predicted many times but , said Rattner , although particular chip technologies have reached their limits , a new paradigm has always continued the pace .
" In some sense - silicon gate CMOS - Moore 's law ended last year , " Rattner said .
" One of the founding laws of accelerating returns ended .
But there are a lot of smart people at Intel and they were able to reinvent the CMOS transistor using new materials . "
Intel is now looking beyond 2020 at photonics and quantum effects such as spin .
" The arc of Moore 's law brings the singularity ever closer . "
Judgment day
Belief in an approaching singularity is not solely American .
Peter Cochrane , the former head of BT 's research labs , says for machines to outsmart humans it " depends on almost one factor alone - the number of networked sensors .
Intelligence is more to do with sensory ability than memory and computing power . "
The internet , he adds , overtook the capacity of a single human brain in 2006 .
" I reckon we 're looking at the 2020 timeframe for a significant machine intelligence to emerge . "
And , he said : " By 2030 it really should be game over . "
Predictions like this flew at the summit .
Imagine when a human - scale brain costs $ 1 - you could have a pocket full of them .
The web will wake up , like Gaia .
Nova Spivack , founder of EarthWeb and , more recently , Radar Networks ( creator of Twine.com ) , quoted Freeman Dyson : " God is what mind becomes when it has passed beyond the scale of our comprehension . "
Listening , you 'd never guess that artificial intelligence has been about 20 years away for a long time now .
John McCarthy , one of AI 's fathers , thought when he convened the first conference on the subject in 1956 , that they'd be able to wrap the whole thing up in six months .
McCarthy calls the singularity , bluntly , " nonsense " .
Even so , there are many current technologies , such as speech recognition , machine translation , and IBM 's human - beating chess grandmaster Deep Blue , that would have seemed like AI at the beginning .
" It 's incredible how intelligent a human being in front of a connected computer is , " observed the CNBC reporter Bob Pisani , marvelling at how clever Google makes him sound to viewers phoning in .
Such advances are reminders that there may be valuable discoveries that make attempts at even the wildest ideas worthwhile .
Dharmendra Modha , head of the cognitive computing group at IBM's Almaden research lab , is leading a " quest " to " understand and build a brain as cheaply and quickly as possible " .
Last year , his group succeeded in simulating a rat - scale cortical model - 55 m neurons , 442bn synapses - in 8TB memory of a 32,768 - processor IBM Blue Gene supercomputer .
The key , he says , is not the neurons but the synapses , the electrical - chemical - electrical connections between those neurons .
Biological microcircuits are roughly essentially the same in all mammals .
" An individual human being is stored in the strength of the synapses . "
Smarter than smart
Modha does n't suggest that the team has made a rat brain .
" Philosophically , " he writes on the subject , " any simulation is always an approximation ( a kind of ' cartoon ' ) based on certain assumptions .
A biophysically realistic simulation is not the focus of our work . "
His team is using the simulation to try to understand the brain 's high - level computational principles .
But computational power is nothing without software .
" Would the neural code that powers human reasoning run on a different substrate ? " the sceptical science writer John Horgan asked Kurzweil , who replied : " The key to the singularity is amplifying intelligence .
The prediction is that an entity that passes the Turing test and has emotional intelligence ... will convince us that it 's conscious .
But that 's not a philosophical demonstration . "
For intelligence to be effective , it has to be able to change the physical world .
The MIT physicist Neil Gershenfeld was therefore at the summit to talk about programmable matter .
It 's a neat trick : computer science talks in ones and zeros , but these are abstractions representing the flow or interruption of electric current , a physical phenomenon .
Gershenfeld , noting that maintaining that abstraction requires increasing amounts of power and complex programmning , wants to turn this on its head .
What if , he asked , you could buy computing cells by the pound , coat them on a surface , and run programs that assemble them like proteins to solve problems ?
Gershenfeld is always difficult for non-physicists to understand , and his video of cells sorting was no exception .
Two things he said were clear .
First : " We aim to create life . "
Second : " We have a 20 - year road map to make the Star Trek replicator . "
Twenty years : 2028 .
Vernor Vinge began talking about the singularity in the early 80s ( naming it after the gravitational phenomenon around a black hole ) , and has always put the date at 2030 .
Kurzweil likes 2045 ; Rattner , before 2050 .
Turning back time
These dates may be personally significant .
Rattner is 59 ; Vinge is 64 .
Kurzweil is 60 , takes 250 vitamins and other supplements a day , and believes some of them can turn back ageing .
If curing all human ills will be a piece of cake for a superhuman intelligence , then the singularity carries with it the promise of immortality - as long as you 're still alive when it happens .
It is in this connection between the singularity and immortality , along with the idea that sufficiently advanced technology can solve every problem from climate change to the exhaustion of oil reserves , that gives the summit the feel of a religious movement .
Certainly , James Miller , assistant professor of economics at Smith College , sounded evangelical when he reviewed how best to prepare financially .
He was optimistic , reviewing investment strategies and assuming retirement funds wo n't be needed .
HowStuffWorks founder Marshall Brain , by contrast , explained why 50 million people will lose their jobs when they can be replaced by robots .
" In the whole universe , there is one intelligent species , " he said .
" We 're in the process of creating the second intelligent species . "
The anthropologist Jane Goodall may disagree .
She sees a different kind of singularity - the growing ecological devastation of Africa - and worries about the disconnection between human minds and hearts .
" If we 're the most intellectual animal , " she said , " why are we destroying our only home ? "
If Goodall 's singularity comes first , the other one might never happen at all - one of those catastrophes that Vinge admits as the only thing he can imagine that could stop it .
Earlier this year , I inherited responsibility for the website of the Knight Digital Media Center at UC Berkeley ’s Graduate School of Journalism .
The site is built with Django , a web application framework written in Python .
The J - School has primarily been a PHP shop , using a mixture of open - source apps — lots of WordPress , Smarty templates and piles of home - brew code .
Because it ’s grown organically over time with no clear underlying architecture and a constantly changing array of publications to support , the organization sits on top of dozens of unrelated databases .
These are my notes and observations on how the J - School got into this mess , why we ’ve fallen in love with Django , and how we plan to dig ourselves out .
Bailing Wire
I personally have no formal CS or programming background .
Over the course of the six years I managed most of the J - School web properties , I learned just as much PHP and shell scripting as required , on an as - needed basis .
Job pressures and constant deadlines never allowed time for pure training .
Even without training , I ’ve been extremely productive with ad - hoc PHP .
I ended up developing and / or implementing some very effective web apps , such as a course and instructor review system , events database , story submission database , application and review system , online quiz system , etc. – all more or less stitched together with bailing wire and duct tape .
But everything people say about PHP systems not scaling well eventually came around to bite us – our systems are sprawling .
Login systems are disconnected , disparate databases that should be unified are spread all the place .
Instead of a centralized content management system , we have dozens of loosely connected CMSs .
From a certain perspective , this made sense , as much of what we do is not about running a single site , but a loose federation of barely related sites .
At a journalism school , students , classes , and organizations demand one publication site after another , few of which have anything to do with one another .
But at a certain point , non-unified systems simply fail to scale .
It ’s not about traffic , but about consistency .
You ca n’t require students and faculty to create new logins all over the place , and you ca n’t expect web developers to master dozens of different platforms that work in dozens of different ways .
Over the past year , we ’ve known it was time to consolidate as much as possible into a single , centralized framework or CMS .
The scaling problem is organizational — too many parties , too many tools , too many different ways of doing things , too many cooks in the kitchen .
A classic example of PHP spaghetti .
Quite a while ago , we realized that something had to give .
We needed to rebuild everything in a single system – one that came with a foundation flexible enough to model everything the organization is and does , and to build any kind of web - based representation or tools we needed on top of that model .
We needed something more than a typical CMS .
We did n’t want to have to shoehorn parts into places where they do n’t belong .
We wanted a system to work for us , rather than against us .
Framework vs. CMS
What ’s the difference between a content management system and a framework ?
Look at it this way :
If you write in a raw language , like PHP or Perl , it ’s like going to Home Depot and buying lumber and nails .
You have absolute flexibility , but you ’re responsible for every square centimeter of the house you build .
If you deploy a content management system , it ’s like buying a house – you can rearrange the furniture , but you ’re pretty much stuck with the floor plan .
A framework lies somewhere between those two poles – as if you ’re buying parts of a pre-fab house .
“ Now I need walls .
Now plumbing .
Now kitchen appliances .
Now air conditioning . ”
The nitty gritty stuff is taken care of , but you have full control over which pieces you use and how they fit together .
“ Now I need a commenting system .
Now I need RSS .
Now I need search .
Now I need form validation . ”
CMSs have a nasty habit of becoming inflexible .
Editorial staff get tired of hearing “ we ca n’t do x , y , or z because the CMS wo n’t let us . ”
CMSs make assumptions about how you work , and about how a site is structured .
As long as you work within that set of assumptions , all is well .
But try to bend a CMS to do things it was n’t meant to do , and you open the door to failure .
For example , we do a ton of work with WordPress .
WordPress assumes that the basic content type is the story , and that that story has a headline , summary , article body , and maybe a bit of metadata .
WordPress is an amazing tool , ideally suited to publication - oriented sites such as blogs and focused publications .
But building a custom database application involving arbitrary arrays of fields , or building custom workflow tools , would be a matter of bending WordPress in ways it was n’t meant to be bent .
You may or may not be successful , but you ’ll probably never call your solution graceful .
You ’ll always be working against , not with WordPress ’ assumptions about the structure of your content .
It ’s true that WordPress is much more than just a blogging system – it ’s a darn good CMS for a lot of site types .
But you would n’t use it to be build an equipment checkout system , or an alumni database , or an application processing system .
Its limitations come from its assumptions .
In contrast , a framework is a toolkit you use to build the CMS that matches your organization ’s specific needs .
No assumptions , just tools and conventions you can use to model data structures and create a workflow based on those structures .
A framework takes care of much of the heavy lifting involved in the creation of highly customized web apps , so you do n’t have to pour countless hours into things like fighting spam , managing fine - grained permissions , building CRUD tools , etc .
Because a framework works at a lower level than a CMS , it generally has a steeper learning curve .
In exchange for that learning curve , you get more flexibility as your organization changes , grows , and scales .
It ’s a middle ground between ( on one hand ) raw code that makes no assumptions but leaves you responsible for every bit , and ( on the other ) a full - blown CMS that makes too many assumptions about content types , and often feels convoluted and / or limiting ( not to mention bloated , which most major CMSs are ) .
There are web application frameworks written in many languages .
PHP has Cake , Symfony , Zend and others .
Ruby is famous for Rails .
Perl has Catalyst and Gantry .
Python has Zope , TurboGears , and , in recent years , Django .
I have n’t done enough work with frameworks to be able to offer meaningful side - by - side comparisons , but I can tell you what it ’s been like for a PHP guy to learn Django over the past six months .
Starting From Scratch
Here ’s why PHP is so popular :
You do n’t have to learn much up - front .
Start with an HTML page , drop in one measly function call , and you get immediate gratification .
Need to do something else ?
Look up another function and drop it in .
Over time , you get a head - full of function calls you can use in a pinch , and get to call yourself a programmer .
It ’s a double - edged sword .
The fact that PHP takes no real study to become productive means there are millions of PHP developers who do n’t have a grasp of “ real ” programming concepts .
Like me .
That does n’t mean we are n’t productive , but it does mean we tend to build things in non-optimal ways under deadline pressure .
And we tend to build things that turn around and bite us in the ass when organizations and data models grow , change , and evolve , because our code is littered with secrets and mysteries , and because we lack the foundations needed to be “ real ” programmers .
I ’m generalizing grossly ( and being unnecessarily self - deprecating ) to make a point .
For me , learning a framework has been another story .
There is no “ instant gratification ” entry point .
You need to have a grasp of the language the framework is written in .
For Django , that means learning some Python – at the very least lists , dictionaries and tuples .
You need to learn that language ’s programming structures – how it handles conditionals , loops , I /O , etc .
You need to have some basic grounding in object - oriented programming principles – something I ’ve simply never gotten around to .
In most cases – certainly in Django – you need to learn MVC ( model view controller ) or in Django ’s case MTV ( model template view ) principles .
And you need to learn the framework itself .
How it thinks , how data moves through the system , where to look when things go wrong .
Finally , you need to know how to deploy .
Because PHP is built into virtually every Apache host out there , deployment is something most PHP devs do n’t have to think about .
For Rails or Django , it ’s a different story .
Suddenly you ’re compiling apache modules , building database bindings , configuring the web server … or looking around for a host who ’s done all of that for you .
I signed up for an online Python course through University Extension .
I spent many , many hours reading documentation , blog posts , and watching tutorial videos .
I went through the official tutorials , and struggled to get development environments working both locally and on production servers .
Nothing about it was easy .
Which is ironic for a system designed to make you more productive .
After years of extreme productivity , I felt like I had been thrown back to Square One , and was starting my web development education all over again .
Painful , but much - needed .
Only after I started to assimilate and internalize the absolute elegance of the Django weltanschauung did I realize just how bad the systems I ’d built over the years really were – both from data modeling and coding perspectives .
I needed to completely re-think the way I was doing things .
It was time for a hard reset .
After several months of diving in , experimenting , failing , getting frustrated , and finally succeeding , I realized :
It ’s all about the data model .
Get this right and you win .
Think long and hard about the data model your organization is built around , and build web apps around that .
Get this right and you can build any view , any tool that will do right by the organization .
Get it wrong and you ’ll struggle forever .
Amateur approaches will only get you so far .
Learning on a catch - as - can basis will only get you halfway there .
You may be a hero in the short term , but in the long run , real accomplishments come from real programmers .
It takes time to learn the bigger picture , but if you do it , you win .
As a PHP dev , I was n’t used to having to spend long periods of time reading documentation .
I read just enough to get each little job done .
Django made me sit back and read everything .
To grasp the gestalt of what I was dealing with before trying to move forward .
As long as you expect it to be easy , you ’ll be disappointed .
As with all things in life , there ’s the easy way , and there ’s the right way .
The right way takes extra effort , but pays off in the end .
Yes , Django will make you more productive and enable you to solve hard problems quickly – but only after you ’ve put in the effort to wrap your head around completely new ways of doing things .
The paradox is that Django ( and Rails ) claim to make web development easier .
And it ’s true – they do .
But only after slogging through a long ramping - up period .
More work up front in order to do less work later .
I ’ve been incredibly lucky to be allowed a big stretch of time to learn Python / Django on the boss ’ clock .
The key is in getting people on board , convincing them that moving the organization forward means training time is required .
You ca n’t just change languages / systems in mid-stream and expect everything to carry on at the same pace it has been .
The larger organization has to feel the pain of the current systems as well , and therefore to support the time / expense of real training .
Why Django ?
Since we were already a PHP shop , why would n’t we choose one of the existing PHP frameworks ?
Yes , we could have gone that route , but none of the PHP frameworks have the credibility or momentum of Rails or Django .
I do n’t want to say that PHP is a bad language , but it was n’t built as an object - oriented language from the ground up .
The web framework momentum today is in cleaner , more O - O languages .
And from what we could see , the PHP - based frameworks themselves did n’t look as clean as Rails or Django .
We had learned the hard way , and were ready to move on .
To be fair , I ’ve only experimented briefly with Ruby on Rails , and am not qualified to say a lot about it .
What I do know is that there have been a lot of complaints about RoR scalability and stability over the past few years .
I ’m sure the Rails community would refute those claims as myths , but for whatever reason , they have been prevalent .
And in my reading of half a dozen comparisons between the two frameworks , I have n’t yet found one that showed faster development times or better scalability for RoR over Django .
When you do n’t have the resources to compare things side - by - side for yourself ( how long would it take to learn enough about every framework on the market in order to do a truly objective comparison / analysis ? ) , you have to lean on the opinion of developers who actually have .
And from what I can tell , most developers who have tried both prefer Django over Rails .
The fact that the RoR community is much larger than Django ’s was certainly a point in Rails ’ favor , but not enough to tip the scales for us .
One of the real “ wins ” for Django is in its automatically generated “ admin ” interface .
Once your data models have been defined , a mini-CMS is built for you around that data model , with all of the form widgets properly reflecting the models ’ relationships .
If a field is a ForeignKey to another model , you get a picklist of that foreign model ’s instances .
If a field is a DateTime , you get slick little date / time pickers .
If a field describes a many - to - many relationship with another model , the admin gives you a combo box .
If a field is designated required , the right database constraints and field validations are put in place automatically .
The Django admin is n’t perfect and is n’t suitable for all tasks , but for the most part it “ just works , ” and saves you tons of time .
In most cases , you can forget about ever having to write CRUD apps .
In the journalism context , it means the developer can sit down with the reporter , get a good handle on the data models that describe the feature , and the journalist can start entering data immediately , while the developer continues work on the public - facing site .
People will tell you “ Django is a framework , not a CMS . ”
That ’s true , but the presence of the admin means you essentially get a CMS for free , alongside the framework .
The admin is a huge win for Django .
If the Admin does n’t serve a particular purpose , no problem – build your own custom workflow on top of the model you ’ve defined , outside of the Admin .
Rails does n’t have anything comparable , as far as I know .
On the flip side , Django is currently missing an equivalent of Rails ’ official “ migrations ” system , which helps keep database schemas in sync when an application ’s data models change .
Right now , it ’s a mostly manual affair .
However , there are currently three separate Django projects in the works to address this need .
Thankfully , all three developers are now working together to bring their projects into a single unified solution , eventually to be bundled in Django core ( listen to Russell Keith - Magee on episode 44 of This Week in Django to learn more about why model migrations is an inherently hard problem ) .
Unlike Rails , no one complains about Django not scaling to very high traffic situations , or about ongoing stability problems .
And no one complains about the project being run / controlled by difficult people .
Django grew out of the real publishing needs of a real - world news publication trying to do difficult things on tight deadlines ( hence “ The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines . ” )
It may look like a small player , but it ’s battle - hardened .
According to Google Trends , interest in Django over the past year has surpassed Rails .
Something ’s going on .
( The search above excludes “ Reinhardt ” to eliminate results on jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt )
To reiterate : I am not dissing on Rails .
I have n’t used it enough to have an opinion , and I know it ’s chock - full of excellent code and good practices .
I just have the strong impression Django has an edge in terms of development speed , scalability , quality docs , and no -bull OSS leadership .
The open sourcing of Django and the creation of the Django Software Foundation opened the doors to wider adoption , and the September release of Django 1.0 – a version guaranteed to be production - ready and stable – will give bean counters confidence .
But nothing speaks to market confidence in Django more loudly than its blessing by Google .
Google engineers have been Python - centric for years ( Python creator Guido van Rossum works at Google ) .
But when Google launched AppEngine – a cloud - based web app framework – they released it with just one deployment option : A somewhat modified version of Django .
In their eyes , Django was not only good enough to run in heavy production , but also deemed easy enough to learn that they were willing to ask developers to learn it if they wanted to use AppEngine .
Any other company would have looked for the lowest common denominator and made AppEngine work with the most popular languages / frameworks first , in order to snare the the most possible developers .
Not Google – they let their love for the language and the framework speak for itself with the offering ( of course AppEngine will support more languages in the future , but it ’s been all - Django so far ) .
And oh yeah – Django has a magical pony .
Digging In
In September , two of us spent a few days at Google headquarters in Mountain View for the first annual DjangoCon – an international conference bringing together heroes of the Django world with developers who traveled from all corners for the privilege .
Heard a lot of great talks , learned heaps about Django best practices , met some great people , etc .
Drank the Kool - Aid and got all fired up ( video from the complete session is available on YouTube ) .
Shortly after , I realized that part of my Django education needed to involve creating my own pluggable Django application , so set to work on a multi-user , multi - group task list management system called django - todo ( yes , I could have built a blog engine from scratch like most Django newbies do , but the truth is I have no intention of ditching WordPress any time soon , so doing that would only have been an academic exercise ) .
I was able to finish Django - todo in about a week , and eventually got it up onto Google code , where it ’s gotten some good feedback and a few dozen downloads .
Even got a mention in episode 40 of This Week in Django !
Django is renowned for its excellent documentation .
It ’s true that the documentation is incredibly thorough and well - presented , but from a newbie ’s perspective , I often found it frustrating , since you do n’t know what to search on to find answers to specific problems .
Trying to figure out how to make global variables available to my templates , I found nothing , because the answer is in Django ’s “ context processors . ”
All well and good if you already know that that ’s what you need to search on .
Similarly , quite a few of the code examples in the docs show interactions with the Django API through Python shell examples .
Those examples do a good job of showing how the API interaction is occurring , but offer no help for the newbie trying to figure out how to actually implement things .
For example , I found the docs on Django ’s pagination functionality completely inscrutable .
Shell examples ?
Why should users be submerged by that level of abstraction ?
Show me a web - based example – with working snippets from model , view , and template – applicable to common scenarios , which I can use as a starting point .
Fortunately , I found an excellent blog post on Django pagination in the wild .
After corresponding with the author a bit , I was able to modify the official documentation ( which is bundled with every Django checkout ) , submit a Trac ticket , re-build the docs , submit an svn diff patch , and get it accepted into the official docs — which is why you see it there now .
Hosting on Birdhouse
If there ’s one big downside to working with a framework based on a language that lacks the widespread support of PHP , it ’s in deployment .
When you work in PHP , you never have to wonder whether your host will support your app or framework of choice .
PHP is like air or water – it ’s just there .
If you want to deploy a site with Ruby on Rails , it ’s a bit more difficult – you ’ve either got to run / manage your own server , or find a web host that supports RoR out of the box .
Luckily for Ror developers , the world ’s most popular web hosting control panel cPanel supports RoR natively in recent builds .
Django folks do n’t have it so good .
cPanel does n’t yet support Django ( though I ’ve filed a feature request ) .
So if you ’re not managing your own server , you ’ve got to choose from among a fairly limited selection .
Trouble is , I already run a cPanel - based web hosting service .
If I was going to be able to deploy any of the sites I was already starting to build , I was n’t going to be able to wait around for official Django support in cPanel – I ’d have to roll my own .
Fortunately , this problem had already been largely solved by @mandric , who has been the hidden mentor / kick - starter behind Django activity at the J - School , and who wrote up an excellent summary on setting up Django with cPanel .
Based on his notes , I was able to get Django working on a cPanel host myself , and took my own notes on the process .
Today , Birdhouse Hosting officially supports Django hosting .
Looks like the first official Django user on Birdhouse will be a commercial wine database with a fairly sophisticated data model .
More on that as the project comes along .
A Django Shop
Long story short , we finally came to a decision :
The J - School is now officially a Django shop .
For better or worse , we ’re embarking on the long road toward unifying all of our toolsets around Python and Django .
Which means A ) Finally creating that mythical Grand Unified Database that represents the entire organization and B ) Rebuilding a whole lot of tools around that new database .
There ’s a lot more web to the J - School than meets the eye — we ’ve got a pretty expansive hidden intranet and a whole lot of less - visible sites to support that most J - School site visitors never see .
It ’s going to be a ton of work , and there will be plenty of bumps in the road , but I ’m excited — not just at the prospect of getting all of our stuff into one bucket for a change , but at the learning opportunities this decision represents .
Despite the many frustrations I ’ve had with the early stages of the learning process , Django development is fun .
There ’s nothing like watching things “ just work , ” the feeling that “ web development was meant to be this way . ”
I look forward to not having to struggle against the expectations and limitations of a monolithic content management system , or of the ghostly chains of bad historical decisions .
The process is going to rock as much as the final result .
Wish us luck .
1. Paulson appears on Face The Nation and says " Our banking system is a safe and a sound one . "
If the banking system was safe and sound , everyone would know it ( or at least think it ) .
There would be no need to say it .
2. Paulson says the list of troubled banks " is a very manageable situation " .
The reality is there are 90 banks on the list of problem banks .
Indymac was not one of them until a month before it collapsed .
How many other banks will magically appear on the list a month before they collapse ?
3 . In a Northern Rock moment , depositors at Indymac pull out their cash .
Police had to be called in to ensure order .
4. Washington Mutual ( WM ) , another troubled bank , refused to honor Indymac cashier 's checks .
The irony is it makes no sense for customers to pull insured deposits out of Indymac after it went into receivership .
The second irony is the last place one would want to put those funds would be Washington Mutual .
Eventually Washington Mutual decided it would take those checks but with an 8 week hold .
Will Washington Mutual even be around 8 weeks from now ?
5. Paulson asked for " Congressional authority to buy unlimited stakes in and lend to Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) " just days after he said " Financial Institutions Must Be Allowed To Fail " .
Obviously Paulson is reporting from the 5th dimension .
In some alternate universe , his statements just might make sense .
6. Former Fed Governor William Poole says " Fannie Mae , Freddie Losses Makes Them Insolvent " .
7. Paulson says Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are " essential " because they represent the only " functioning " part of the home loan market .
The firms own or guarantee about half of the $ 12 trillion in U.S. mortgages .
Is it possible to have a sound banking system when the only " functioning " part of the mortgage market is insolvent ?
8. Bernanke testified before Congress on monetary policy but did not comment on either money supply or interest rates .
The word " money " did not appear at all in his testimony .
The only time " interest rate " appeared in his testimony was in relation to consumer credit card rates .
How can you have any reasonable economic policy when the Fed chairman is scared half to death to discuss interest rates and money supply ?
9 . The SEC issued a protective order to protect those most responsible for naked short selling .
As long as the investment banks and brokers were making money engaging in naked shorting of stocks , there was no problem .
However , when the bears began using the tactic against the big financials , it became time to selectively enforce the existing regulation .
10 .
The Fed takes emergency actions twice during options expirations week in regards to the discount window and rate cuts .
11 . The SEC takes emergency action during options expirations week regarding short sales .
12 . The Fed has implemented an alphabet soup of pawn shop lending facilities whereby the Fed accepts garbage as collateral in exchange for treasuries .
Those new Fed lending facilities are called the Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) , the Term Security Lending Facility ( TSLF ) , and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility ( PDCF ) .
13 . Citigroup ( C ) , Lehman ( LEH ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS ) , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and Merrill Lynch ( MER ) all have a huge percentage of level 3 assets .
Level 3 assets are commonly known as " marked to fantasy " assets .
In other words , the value of those assets is significantly if not ridiculously overvalued in comparison to what those assets would fetch on the open market .
It is debatable if any of the above firms survive in their present form .
Some may not survive in any form .
14 . Bernanke openly solicits private equity firms to invest in banks .
Is this even close to a remotely normal action for Fed chairman to take ?
15 . Bear Stearns was taken over by JPMorgan ( JPM ) days after insuring investors it had plenty of capital .
Fears are high that Lehman will suffer the same fate .
Worse yet , the Fed had to guarantee the shotgun marriage between Bear Stearns and JP Morgan by providing as much as $ 30 billion in capital .
JPMorgan is responsible for only the first 1/2 billion .
Taxpayers are on the hook for all the rest .
Was this a legal action for the Fed to take ?
Does the Fed care ?
16 . Citigroup needed a cash injection from Abu Dhabi and a second one elsewhere .
Then after announcing it would not need more capital is raising still more .
The latest news is Citigroup will sell $ 500 billion in assets .
To who ?
At what price ?
17 . Merrill Lynch raised $ 6.6 billion in capital from Kuwait Mizuho , announced it did not need to raise more capital , then raised more capital a few week later .
18 . Morgan Stanley sold a 9.9 % equity stake to China International Corp. CEO John Mack compensated by not taking his bonus .
How generous .
Morgan Stanley fell from $ 72 to $ 37 .
Did CEO John
Mack deserve a paycheck at all ?
19 . Bank of America ( BAC ) agreed to take over Countywide Financial ( CFC ) and twice announced Countrywide will add profits to B of A .
Inquiring minds were asking " How the hell can Countrywide add to Bank of America earnings ? "
Here 's how .
Bank of America just announced it will not guarantee $ 38.1 billion in Countrywide debt .
Questions over " Fraudulent Conveyance " are now surfacing .
20 . Washington Mutual agreed to a death spiral cash infusion of $ 7 billion accepting an offer at $ 8.75 when the stock was over $ 13 at the time .
Washington Mutual has since fallen in waterfall fashion from $ 40 and is now trading near $ 5.00 after a huge rally .
21 . Shares of Ambac ( ABK ) fell from $ 90 to $ 2.50 .
Shares of MBIA ( MBI ) fell from $ 70 to $ 5 .
Sadly , the top three rating agencies kept their rating on the pair at AAA nearly all the way down .
No one can believe anything the government sponsored rating agencies say .
22 . In a panic set of moves , the Fed slashed interest rates from 5.25 % to 2 % .
This was the fastest , steepest drop on record .
Ironically , the Fed chairman spoke of inflation concerns the entire drop down .
Bernanke clearly cannot tell the truth .
He does not have to .
Actions speak louder than words .
23 . FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said the FDIC is looking for ways to shore up its depleted deposit fund , including charging higher premiums on riskier brokered deposits .
24 .
There is roughly $ 6.84 Trillion in bank deposits .
$ 2.60 Trillion of that is uninsured .
There is only $ 53 billion in FDIC insurance to cover $ 6.84 Trillion in bank deposits .
Indymac will eat up roughly $ 8 billion of that .
25 . Of the $ 6.84 Trillion in bank deposits , the total cash on hand at banks is a mere $ 273.7 Billion .
Where is the rest of the loot ?
The answer is in off balance sheet SIVs , imploding commercial real estate deals , Alt - A liar loans , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds , toggle bonds where debt is amazingly paid back with more debt , and all sorts of other silly ( and arguably fraudulent ) financial wizardry schemes that have bank and brokerage firms leveraged at 30 - 1 or more .
Those loans cannot be paid back .
What can not be paid back will be defaulted on .
If you did not know it before , you do now .
The entire US banking system is insolvent .

No way .
Actually , I refuse to review High School Musical 3 .
We all know it ’s rotten .
Which brings me to my point : where the hell are the movies ?
I mean the ones for mass audiences , designed to make sentient beings want to go see them ?
Especially the comedies … people used to go to them and laugh … they had a good time …any of this ring a bell ?
Did they stop making those and nobody announced it , or what ?
It ’s kind of important .
Because it ’s pretty well agreed that not since the Depression of the 1930s has America been so clearly headed down the crapper .
And we need to figure out how we might cope with this New Depression of ours .
If it ’s anything like the Old Depression , we ’re talking 25 % unemployment , bread - lines , soup kitchens , suicide rates through the roof , the rise of both Fascism and Communism , the grapes of wrath , and roaming hordes of sad - faced Okies .
Not so good .
But there was one real benefit of the Old Depression that is pertinent to our discussion : film comedy became just fucking great , that ’s all .
Hilarious , bracing tutorials in smart irreverence .
Think about it : the Marx Brothers , W.C. Fields , Mae West , Warner Brothers cartoons , screwball comedy , all of them functioning like a slap upside the head .
Suddenly a fierce anti-authoritarian intelligence was celebrated in cinema , and the average American IQ seemed to go up about 30 points .
W.C. Fields : no dope .
From 1930 right up through about 1943 , it was good to be comically smart in the movies .
Because if you were n’t smart , it was just too damn bad for you .
Consider the slang that erupted out of Depression - era films , most notably the 150 words for “ fool , ” all delivered in tones of maximum scorn : sap , mug , dope , chump , jerk , boob , goof , goon , twerp , sucker , palooka .
And we ’re in just the right mood to resurrect those terms , too .
What are we now if not a nation of embittered chumps who got taken for a ride ?
In other words , sloppy Seth Rogen comedies are just not going to do the job anymore , presuming they were ever doing any sort of job at all , which is doubtful .
We need furious satire , violent pratfalls , black comic spleen , irreverence to the tenth power , calls for anarchy , riots , raucousness , genius , the works !
And we need ‘em now , in heaping portions .
The Coen brothers have been dishing it out for years , most recently with Burn After Reading , but as great as they are , they ca n’t do it all alone .
We ’re barely getting by with our sparse TV provisions : The Daily Show , The Colbert Report , occasional Letterman outbursts , and SNL skits , which we ’re consuming like starving jackals .
Ca n’t those morons in Hollywood see we ’re hungry ?
Well , lessee , what ’s on the menu down at the ol ’ Cineplex ?
Besides High School Musical 3 there ’s Beverly Hills Chihuahua .
It ’s as if the film industry has decided to put us on a bland comedy diet at precisely the moment when we ’re howling for red meat .
Who diets in a Depression anyway ?
And do n’t even get me started on the dramas .
W. , Changeling , Pride and Glory , Synecdoche , New York .
Grim , glum , moldy - looking , all repellent as if by design .
Is Hollywood suicidal ?
Are these films simply cries for help ?
Maybe Hollywood really is done entertaining us .
Maybe we ’re going to wind up re-running the old ‘ 30s comedies again , like they did in the 1960s , and everyone will troop off to revival houses to watch Duck Soup and The Awful Truth and Never Give a Sucker an Even Break .
It ’s a terrible waste of a Depression , if so .

ORLANDO , Fla. , Nov. 9 ( UPI ) -- Florida researchers say a hissing cockroach that grows as big as 5 inches inadvertently could be released in the state and , if so , would thrive .
The Madagascar hissing cockroach is one of four species of roach readily available on the Internet to lizard owners who purchase them illegally , said Phil Hoehler , an entomologist with the University of Florida .

Roaches are a good replacement for crickets as reptile food because they are less expensive and do n't smell as bad as crickets , Hoehler told the Orlando ( Fla . )
Sentinel in a story published Sunday .
The Turkestan cockroach , lobster roach and the orange spotted roach also are potential invaders , though they have yet to be spotted , Koehler warned pest - control operators in a recent magazine article .
" This is not good news for anybody , " said Hoehler , noting where there are cockroaches , there will be escapees and Florida has the perfect climate for them .

A basis B of a vector space V is a subset B of V , such that the elements of B are linearly independent and span V .
That is to say , every element ( vector ) of V is a linear combination of elements of B , and no element of B is a linear combination of the other elements of B .
Moreover , every basis determines a unique decomposition of any member of V into coordinates relative to B .
This post gives a simple Haskell implementation for a canonical basis of a vector space , and a means of decomposing vectors into coordinates .
It uses [ indexed type families ] ( associated types ) , and is quite general , despite its simplicity .
The Haskell module described here is part of the vector - space library ( version 0.4 or later ) , which available on Hackage and a darcs repository .
See the wiki page , interface documentation , and source code .
The library version described below ( 0.5 or later ) relies on ghc 6.10 .
Edits :
2008 -11-09 : Tweaked comment above about version .
2008 -02-09 : just fiddling around
Additive groups and vector spaces
We ’ll need a bit of preliminary before jumping into basis types .
An additive group has addition operation , with an identity ( zero ) and an additive inverse : class AdditiveGroup v where
( ^+^ ) ∷ v → v → v
zeroV ∷ v
negateV ∷ v → v
A vector space is an additive group with scalar multiplication , so it also has an associated type of scalars : class AdditiveGroup v ⇒ VectorSpace v where
type Scalar v ∷ *
( *^ ) ∷ Scalar v → v → v
This associated type could instead by written as a functional dependency ( fundep ) .
In fact , the type family implementation in ghc 6.9 is not quite up to working with the code in this post , so the library contains a ( 6.9 - friendly ) version together with as a fundep ( Data.
VectorSpace ) and the version given in this post ( Data . AVectorSpace ) .
Sometime after ghc - 6.10 is released , I will retire the fundep version and rename AVectorSpace to VectorSpace .
Similarly , the library temporarily contains Data .
ABasis .
Basis types Since Haskell does n't have subtyping , we can't represent a basis type directly as a subset .
Instead , for an arbitrary vector space v , represent the ( canonical ) basis as an associated type , Basis v , and a function that interprets a basis representation as a vector .
class VectorSpace v ⇒ HasBasis v where
type Basis v ∷ *
basisValue ∷ Basis v → v
Another method extracts coordinates ( coefficients ) for a vector .
Each coordinate is associated with a basis element .
decompose ∷ v → [( Basis v , Scalar v ) ]
We can also reverse the process , recomposing into a vector , by linearly combining the basis elements : linearCombo ∷ VectorSpace v ⇒ [ ( v , Scalar v ) ] → v
linearCombo ps = sumV [s *^ v | ( v , s ) ← ps ]
recompose ∷ HasBasis v ⇒ [( Basis v , Scalar v ) ] → v
recompose = linearCombo ∘ fmap ( first basisValue )
The defining property is recompose ∘ decompose ≡ id
Exercise : why might decompose ∘ recompose not be the identity ?
What if the decomposition were represented instead as a finite map ?
Primitive bases
Any scalar field is also a vector space over itself .
For instance , instance AdditiveGroup Double where
zeroV = 0 . 0
( ^+^ ) = ( + )
negateV = negate
instance VectorSpace Double where
type Scalar Double = Double
( *^ ) = ( * )
The canonical basis of a one - dimensional space has only one element , namely 1 , which can be represented with no information .
instance HasBasis Double where
type Basis Double = ()
basisValue ( ) = 1
decompose s = [ ( ( ) , s ) ]
Composing bases Pairs of additive groups form additive groups : instance ( AdditiveGroup u , AdditiveGroup v )
⇒ AdditiveGroup ( u , v ) where
zeroV = ( zeroV , zeroV )
( u , v ) ^+^ ( u ' , v' ) = ( u ^+^ u' , v ^+^ v' )
negateV ( u , v ) = ( negateV u, negateV v )
Pairs of vector spaces , over the same scalar field , form vector spaces : instance ( VectorSpace u , VectorSpace v , Scalar u ~ Scalar v )
⇒ VectorSpace ( u , v ) where
type Scalar ( u , v ) = Scalar u
s *^ ( u , v ) = ( s *^ u , s *^ v )
Given vector spaces u and v , a basis representation for ( u , v ) will be one basis representation or the other , tagged with Left or Right : instance ( HasBasis u , HasBasis v , Scalar u ~ Scalar v )
⇒ HasBasis ( u , v ) where
type Basis ( u , v ) = Basis u ` Either` Basis v
The basis vectors themselves will be ( ub,0 ) or ( 0 , vb ) , where ub is a basis vector for u , and vb is a basis vector for v .
As expected then , the dimensionality of the cross product is the sum of the dimensions .
basisValue ( Left a ) = ( basisValue a , zeroV )
basisValue ( Right b ) = ( zeroV , basisValue b)
The decomposition of a vector ( u , v ) contains left - tagged decompositions of u and right - tagged decompositions of v . decompose ( u , v ) = decom p2 Left u ++ decomp2 Right v
where decomp2 ∷ HasBasis w ⇒ ( Basis w → b ) → w → [ ( Scalar w , b ) ]
decomp2 inject = fmap ( first inject ) ∘ decompose
Triples etc , can be handled similarly .
Instead , the library implementation reduces them to the pair case : instance ( HasBasis u , s ~ Scalar u
, HasBasis v , s ~ Scalar v
, HasBasis w , s ~ Scalar w )
⇒ HasBasis ( u , v, w ) where
type Basis ( u , v, w ) = Basis ( u , ( v , w ) )
⋯
Exercise : complete this instance definition ( without peeking ) .
Bases in spaces
What about other vector spaces , particularly infinite dimensional ones ?
The result type for decompose is not convenient : decompose ∷ v → [( Basis v , Scalar v ) ]
Moreover , its definition for pair types would have to be changed , e.g. , to use interleaving instead of append .
On the other hand , this type can be thought of as an association list , representing Basis v → Scalar v .
Instead , we might use the function representation directly : decompose ∷ v → ( Basis v → Scalar v )
In that case , the definition of decompose on pairs is decompose ( u , v ) = decompose u `either` decompose v
which beautifully mirrors the basis type definition : type Basis ( u , v ) = Basis u ` Either` Basis v
I guess we'd have to somehow extend the definition of recompose as well , or avoid it .
One example of an infinite dimensional vector space is a function over an infinite domain .
The additive group and vector space instances follow a standard form for applicative functors applied to an additive group or vector space .
In this case , the applicative functor is ( ( → ) a ) .
instance AdditiveGroup v ⇒ AdditiveGroup ( a → v ) where
zeroV = pure zeroV
( ^+^ ) = lift A2 ( ^+^ )
negateV = fmap negateV
instance VectorSpace v ⇒ VectorSpace ( a → v ) where
type Scalar ( a → v ) = Scalar v
( *^ ) s = fmap (( *^ ) s )
As a basis for a function space a→u , let 's use the subset of functions that map one domain value to some basis vector for u and map all other domain values to zero .
By linearly combining these functions , we can construct any function in a→u that is nonzero for finitely many domain values .
If we stretch the notion of linear combinations beyond finite combinations , perhaps we can go further and cover at least the countably infinite domain types .
To represent these functions , it suffices to record the choice of domain element and the representation of the corresponding basis vector for u : instance ( Eq a , HasBasis u ) ⇒ HasBasis ( a → u ) where
type Basis ( a → u ) = ( a , Basis u )
basisValue ( a , b ) a ' | a ≡ a ' = basisValue b
| otherwise = zeroV
The actual implementation is a bit more efficient , avoiding recomputation of basisValue b for each a' .
Decomposing a function into its coordinates is even simpler : decompose g ( a , b ) = decompose ( g a ) b
Some isomorphisms
This instance rule for functions will be applied repeatedly for curried functions .
For instance , Basis ( a → b → u ) ≡ ( a , ( b , Basis u ) )
The isomorphic uncurried form has an isomorphic basis : Basis ( ( a , b ) → u ) ≡ ( ( a , b ) , Basis u )
Pairing in the range instead of domain gives rise to another pair of isomorphisms : Basis ( a → ( b , c ) ) ≡ ( a , Basis b ` Either` Basis c )
Basis ( ( a → b , a → c ) ) ≡ ( a , Basis b) ` Either` ( a , Basis c )
The rules for basis types look like logarithms , especially if we add a basis for ( ) : type Basis ( ) = Void
type Basis ( u , v ) = Basis u ` Either` Basis v
type Basis ( a → u ) = ( a , Basis u )
Compare with : log 1 = 0 log ( u × v ) = log u + log v log ( ua ) = a × log u
The rules are also essentially the same as the ones used for memo tries , but phrased in terms of logarithms instead of ( explicit ) exponents .
A basis B of a vector space V is a subset B of V , such that the elements of B are linearly independent and span V .
That is to say , ...
Even if a wife 's voice is not music to a man 's ears , it may be melodic to his brain .
Psychiatrist Michael Hunter and fellow researchers at the University of Sheffield in England monitored the brain activity of 12 men as they listened to voice recordings and found they process male voices differently from those of females .
Women 's voices stimulate an area of the brain used for processing complex sounds , like music .
Male voices activate the " mind 's eye , " a region of the brain used for conjuring imagery .
One reason , Hunter suggests , is that women generally have shorter vocal cords and a smaller larynx , giving them higher - pitched voices .
Women 's voices may also have more " natural melody , " he adds .
Qualities like pitch and volume vary more during speech .
" There 's more prosody in female speech . "
Newspaper articles about Hunter 's research said that men find the female voice more difficult to hear and understand .
But Hunter thinks the opposite is true .
Because the brain is apparently deciphering the modulation in women 's voices , a female voice might be able to communicate more information per sentence than a male voice .
" Most people at a railway station say female announcers are clearer , " he says .
" Maybe it 's this added input . "
Hunter speculated about why the male voice activates the brain 's visual region : " Perhaps men listening to male voices try to picture what the speaker looks like . "
Hunter 's findings might also explain why hallucinations usually involve male voices .
" If the brain had to produce a voice from nothing , it might go for a more basic version — the male voice . "
The next step , he says , is to find out whether men's or women 's voices are music to the female brain .
" Men Hear Women 's Melodies . "

A team of Princeton University scientists has discovered that chains of proteins found in most living organisms act like adaptive machines , possessing the ability to control their own evolution .
The research , which appears to offer evidence of a hidden mechanism guiding the way biological organisms respond to the forces of natural selection , provides a new perspective on evolution , the scientists said .
The researchers -- Raj Chakrabarti , Herschel Rabitz , Stacey Springs and George McLendon -- made the discovery while carrying out experiments on proteins constituting the electron transport chain ( ETC ) , a biochemical network essential for metabolism .
A mathematical analysis of the experiments showed that the proteins themselves acted to correct any imbalance imposed on them through artificial mutations and restored the chain to working order .
" The discovery answers an age - old question that has puzzled biologists since the time of Darwin :
How can organisms be so exquisitely complex , if evolution is completely random , operating like a ' blind watchmaker ' ? " said Chakrabarti , an associate research scholar in the Department of Chemistry at Princeton .
" Our new theory extends Darwin 's model , demonstrating how organisms can subtly direct aspects of their own evolution to create order out of randomness . "
The work also confirms an idea first floated in an 1858 essay by Alfred Wallace , who along with Charles Darwin co-discovered the theory of evolution .
Wallace had suspected that certain systems undergoing natural selection can adjust their evolutionary course in a manner " exactly like that of the centrifugal governor of the steam engine , which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident . "
In Wallace 's time , the steam engine operating with a centrifugal governor was one of the only examples of what is now referred to as feedback control .
Examples abound , however , in modern technology , including cruise control in autos and thermostats in homes and offices .
The research , published in a recent edition of Physical Review Letters , provides corroborating data , Rabitz said , for Wallace 's idea .
" What we have found is that certain kinds of biological structures exist that are able to steer the process of evolution toward improved fitness , " said Rabitz , the Charles Phelps Smyth ' 16 Professor of Chemistry .
" The data just jumps off the page and implies we all have this wonderful piece of machinery inside that 's responding optimally to evolutionary pressure . "
The authors sought to identify the underlying cause for this self - correcting behavior in the observed protein chains .
Standard evolutionary theory offered no clues .
Applying the concepts of control theory , a body of knowledge that deals with the behavior of dynamical systems , the researchers concluded that this self - correcting behavior could only be possible if , during the early stages of evolution , the proteins had developed a self - regulating mechanism , analogous to a car 's cruise control or a home 's thermostat , allowing them to fine - tune and control their subsequent evolution .
The scientists are working on formulating a new general theory based on this finding they are calling " evolutionary control . "

The work is likely to provoke a considerable amount of thinking , according to Charles Smith , a historian of science at Western Kentucky University .
" Systems thinking in evolutionary studies perhaps began with Alfred Wallace 's likening of the action of natural selection to the governor on a steam engine --- that is , as a mechanism for removing the unfit and thereby keeping populations ' up to snuff ' as environmental actors , " Smith said .
" Wallace never really came to grips with the positive feedback part of the cycle , however , and it is instructive that through optimal control theory Chakrabarti et al. can now suggest a coupling of causalities at the molecular level that extends Wallace 's systems - oriented approach to this arena . "
Evolution , the central theory of modern biology , is regarded as a gradual change in the genetic makeup of a population over time .
It is a continuing process of change , forced by what Wallace and Darwin , his more famous colleague , called " natural selection . "
In this process , species evolve because of random mutations and selection by environmental stresses .
Unlike Darwin , Wallace conjectured that species themselves may develop the capacity to respond optimally to evolutionary stresses .
Until this work , evidence for the conjecture was lacking .
The experiments , conducted in Princeton 's Frick Laboratory , focused on a complex of proteins located in the mitochondria , the powerhouses of the cell .
A chain of proteins , forming a type of bucket brigade , ferries high - energy electrons across the mitrochondrial membrane .
This metabolic process creates ATP , the energy currency of life .
Various researchers working over the past decade , including some at Princeton like George McClendon , now at Duke University , and Stacey Springs , now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , fleshed out the workings of these proteins , finding that they were often turned on to the " maximum " position , operating at full tilt , or at the lowest possible energy level .
Chakrabarti and Rabitz analyzed these observations of the proteins ' behavior from a mathematical standpoint , concluding that it would be statistically impossible for this self - correcting behavior to be random , and demonstrating that the observed result is precisely that predicted by the equations of control theory .
By operating only at extremes , referred to in control theory as " bang - bang extremization , " the proteins were exhibiting behavior consistent with a system managing itself optimally under evolution .
advertisement
" In this paper , we present what is ostensibly the first quantitative experimental evidence , since Wallace 's original proposal , that nature employs evolutionary control strategies to maximize the fitness of biological networks , " Chakrabarti said .
" Control theory offers a direct explanation for an otherwise perplexing observation and indicates that evolution is operating according to principles that every engineer knows . "
The scientists do not know how the cellular machinery guiding this process may have originated , but they emphatically said it does not buttress the case for intelligent design , a controversial notion that posits the existence of a creator responsible for complexity in nature .
Chakrabarti said that one of the aims of modern evolutionary theory is to identify principles of self - organization that can accelerate the generation of complex biological structures .
" Such principles are fully consistent with the principles of natural selection .
Biological change is always driven by random mutation and selection , but at certain pivotal junctures in evolutionary history , such random processes can create structures capable of steering subsequent evolution toward greater sophistication and complexity . "
The researchers are continuing their analysis , looking for parallel situations in other biological systems .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation .
Its banks secured in the warmth of the southern spring , Australia is not news .
It ought to be .
An epic scandal of racism , injustice and brutality is being covered up in the manner of apartheid South Africa .
Many Australians conspire in this silence , wishing never to reflect upon the truth about their society 's Untermenschen , the Aboriginal people .
The facts are not in dispute : thousands of black Australians never reach the age of 40 ; an entirely preventable disease , trachoma , blinds black children as epidemics of rheumatic fever ravage their communities ; suicide among the despairing young is common .
No other developed country has such a record .
A pervasive white myth , that Aborigines leech off the state , serves to conceal the disgrace that money the federal government says it spends on indigenous affairs actually goes towards opposing native land rights .
In 2006 , some A$ 3bn was underspent " or the result of creative accounting " , reported the Sydney Morning Herald .
Like the children of apartheid , the Aboriginal children of Thamarrurr in the Northern Territory receive less than half the educational resources allotted to white children .
In 2005 , the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination described the racism of the Australian state , a distinction afforded no other developed country .
This was in the decade - long rule of the conservative coalition of John Howard , whose coterie of white supremacist academics and journalists assaulted the truth of recorded genocide in Australia , especially the horrific separations of Aboriginal children from their families .
They deployed arguments not dissimilar to those David Irving used to promote Holocaust denial .
Smear by media as a precursor to the latest round of repression is long familiar to black Australians .
In 2006 , the flagship current affairs programme of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Lateline , broadcast lurid allegations of " sex slavery " among the Mutitjulu people in the Northern Territory .
The programme 's source , described as an " anonymous youth worker " , was later exposed as a federal government official whose " evidence " was discredited by the Northern Territory chief minister and the police .
The ABC has never retracted its allegations , claiming it has been " exonerated by an internal inquiry " .
Shortly before last year 's election , Howard declared a " national emergency " and sent the army to the Northern Territory to " protect the children " who , said his minister for indigenous affairs , were being abused in " unthinkable numbers " .
Last February , with much sentimental fanfare , the new prime minister , Labor 's Kevin Rudd , made a formal apology to the first Australians .
Australia was said to be finally coming to terms with its rapacious past and present .
Was it ?
" The Rudd government , " noted a Sydney Morning Herald editorial , " has moved quickly to clear away this piece of political wreckage in a way that responds to some of its own supporters ' emotional needs , yet it changes nothing .
It is a shrewd manoeuvre . "
In May , barely reported government statistics revealed that of the 7,433 Aboriginal children examined by doctors as part of the " national emergency " , 39 had been referred to the authorities for suspected abuse .
Of those , a maximum of just four possible cases of abuse were identified .
Such were the " unthinkable numbers " .
They were little different from those of child abuse in white Australia .
What was different was that no soldiers invaded the beachside suburbs , no white parents were swept aside , no white welfare was " quarantined " .
Marion Scrymgour , an Aboriginal minister in the Northern Territory , said : " To see decent , caring [ Aboriginal ] fathers , uncles , brothers and grandfathers , who are undoubtedly innocent of the horrific charges being bandied about , reduced to helplessness and tears , speaks to me of widespread social damage . "
What the doctors found they already knew - children at risk from a spectrum of extreme poverty and the denial of resources in one of the world 's richest countries .
Having let a few crumbs fall , Rudd is picking up where Howard left off .
His indigenous affairs minister , Jenny Macklin , has threatened to withdraw government support from remote communities that are " economically unviable " .
The Northern Territory is the only region where Aborigines have comprehensive land rights , granted almost by accident 30 years ago .
Here lie some of the world 's biggest uranium deposits .
Canberra wants to mine and sell it .
Foreign governments , especially the US , want the Northern Territory as a toxic dump .
The Adelaide to Darwin railway that runs adjacent to Olympic Dam , the world 's largest uranium mine , was built with the help of Kellogg , Brown & Root - a subsidiary of American giant Halliburton , the alma mater of Dick Cheney , Howard 's " mate " .
" The land grab of Aboriginal tribal land has nothing to do with child sexual abuse , " says the Australian scientist Helen Caldicott , " but all to do with open slather uranium mining and converting the Northern Territory to a global nuclear dump . "
What is unique about Australia is not its sun-baked , derivative society , clinging to the sea , but its first people , the oldest on earth , whose skill and courage in surviving invasion , of which the current onslaught is merely the latest , deserve humanity 's support .

People have been paying more attention to the impact that their technology use has on the environment .
Thus we ’ve had a slew of of gadgets that take advantage of the sun ’s rays for power .
However , there are other sources of renewable power that are untapped .
If you want to be the coolest eco-friendly tech lover on the block , you might look into the HyMini .
Rather than concentrating on drawing solar energy for power , the HyMini has a turbine that uses the wind to charge your gadgets .
It has ports for many cameras , phones and other devices .
While I think this $ 50 gadget is interesting , I do n’t actually think it is all that practical .
The main reason is that you need air traveling at 9 mph to turn the turbines fast enough for a charge .
That would make it ideal for attaching to your car , however , you ca n’t have winds of more than 40 mph , as it just wo n’t hold up .
Make one of these that can take 70 + mph winds and you ’ve got yourself an awesome product .

Marilyn Sterling , R.D. Concerned parents who want to raise healthy vegetarian children often ask about their children 's specific nutritional requirements .
Are they getting enough iron or calcium ?
Should they be taking supplements ?
Will they be as strong and grow as fast as their omnivorous friends ?
These are valid concerns , but all of them can be resolved if parents provide a balanced and varied diet .
Of course , vegetarianism means different things to different people .
At one end of the spectrum are vegans , who eat no animal products whatsoever .
They exclude all foods associated with animals , including honey and gelatin .
Then there are lacto - ovo vegetarians , who eat eggs and dairy products but no meat .
Lactovegetarians eat dairy but not eggs or meat .
At the other end of the spectrum are semivegetarians , who occasionally eat fish or fowl but no red meat and definitely emphasize a plant - based diet .
Vegetarian children are becoming more common as many parents choose vegetarianism in their search for alternative lifestyles .
Parents , however , must understand how to translate children 's special nutritional needs into tonight 's dinner .
Vegetarians are often nutrition savvy and can provide a model of healthy eating , but there are different nutritional requirements for children and adults .
Most important , children have higher metabolic rates and consequently higher energy requirements than adults .
Vegetarian diets are typically high in fiber , so children eating this diet , unlike their carnivorous counterparts , get sufficient fiber . [ 1 ]
But bulky , fibrous foods can fill up small stomachs before enough calories are consumed .
Recent studies confirm that sufficient calories may be a concern for preschool vegetarians , [ 2 ] so they need plenty of higher - calorie , nutrient - dense foods such as nut butters and dried fruit .
Studies from 15 and 20 years ago raised concerns that vegetarian children were shorter , [ 3 ] but a landmark study of a commune called " The Farm " in Summertown , Tenn. , found that slightly slowed toddler growth completely normalized by age 10 . [ 4 ]
Children older than seven who follow a nutritious vegetarian diet can be expected to grow well -- maybe even better than their omnivorous counterparts .
[ 5 , 6 ]
Some nutrients are found predominantly in animal products , so vegetarians must make sure these nutrients are included in their diets , whether by careful food selection or supplementation .
Prime among them is iron , which is required for making red blood cells .
Vegetarian children do have fewer red blood cells than omnivores .
[ 7 , 8 ] When levels are too low , the result is anemia , which may cause learning and psychomotor problems , fatigue and infection .
My observation is that vegetarian children whose basic diet consists of fast food , macaroni and cheese , instant noodle soups and pizza are often anemic .
Vegetarian children in carnivorous households who eat only parts of the family meal often eat a high - starch diet that puts them at risk of anemia .
I have noticed that children who eat beans or tofu several times a day and dark green vegetables along with a source of vitamin C at mealtime ( to increase iron absorption ) have plenty of red blood cells .
Despite the risk of lower iron levels affecting learning in young children , older vegetarian children may actually have higher IQs than carnivores . [ 9 ]
Anemia is also caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency .
Because vitamin B12 is found in all animal products , deficiency is of primary concern for vegans .
B12 is stored in the body , so a deficiency can take several years to manifest .
However , only dietary B12 is incorporated into breast milk , so it is important for breast - feeding vegans to get enough B12 .
The risk is a B12 deficiency in the baby , which can cause severe neurological damage .
Because B12 is also found in bacteria , young children do get a bit from putting toys or objects in their mouths .
A B12 deficiency in young vegan children can slow their growth .
[ 10 - 12 ]
Clearly vitamin B12 supplementation is in order for breast - feeding vegans , their babies and vegan children .
The high - fiber content of vegetarian diets also retains some minerals in the gut , reducing absorption of iron , zinc , iodine , calcium and selenium . [ 13 ]
Phytates , the fibers found in whole wheat , are the worst offenders .
A zinc deficiency is more critical in vegetarian children than in adults for two reasons .
First , children need relatively more zinc per pound of body weight than adults .
Second , adults can adapt to a diet low in zinc by absorbing a higher percentage of the mineral from their food , whereas children are unable to make this adjustment .
Because lactovegetarians consume dairy products , a good source of zinc , they are usually not deficient in it .
However , the main source of zinc in vegan diets is wheat , the same grain that inhibits its absorption .
Insufficient zinc may reduce appetite and decrease resistance to infection . [ 14 ]
Parents should make sure their vegan children eat nuts , seeds , legumes , whole grains and soyfoods in order to get enough zinc .
Calcium content is probably the most controversial aspect of vegan diets .
While soy - based supplemental formulas and soy milks fortified with calcium can substitute for cow 's milk , many children raised on dairy - free diets have low calcium intakes .
In the past , calcium intake never concerned me -- after all , we did n't evolve drinking milk past infancy -- but I 've seen too many dairy - free children with poor teeth or bone problems .
Children who drink milk substitutes not fortified with calcium are at most risk .
Vegan children should drink two cups of fortified soy or other milks daily and eat tofu made with calcium and other foods rich in calcium .
Vitamin D , required to absorb calcium , is also added to some soy - and rice - milk substitutes .
Vegan children in gloomy climates may not get enough sunshine to manufacture vitamin D .
On rare occasions , dark - skinned young vegans even have rickets , a vitamin D deficiency disease , when they are breast - fed exclusively past six months or eat lots of whole wheat .
[ 15 , 16 ] Breast milk alone does n't provide enough vitamin D for darker - skinned toddlers , so if they do n't get a couple hours of sunlight a week , a vitamin D supplement is suggested .
What about fats and oils ?
For their first two years , children need dietary cholesterol to form myelin nerve coatings .
Breast milk is high in cholesterol .
After age two , cholesterol requirements decline , and children can make all the cholesterol they need in their livers .
Studies of school - age vegetarian and carnivorous children found they have the same cholesterol levels . [ 17 ]
In general , vegetarian children have a higher ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids in their diets .
Their lower level of saturated fats could lead to healthier adulthoods .
However , chocolate , butter and cheese are high in saturated fats , while crackers , pastries and deep - fried food may contain harmful trans fatty acids .
Making careful food choices in any vegetarian diet is still necessary to ensure children eat the optimal fats .
DHA , docosahexaenoic acid , for example , is an omega - 3 fatty acid found in breast milk , cold - water fish , plant sources such as flax or pumpkin seeds , and dark green vegetables such as kale or chard .
DHA is important for fetal and infant brain development . [ 18 ]
Although breast milk remains the primary source of DHA , researchers found significant variations in breast - milk DHA levels around the world .
The lowest concentrations were found in vegan and American mothers , and the highest in mothers who ate fish regularly .
[ 19 ] Plant - based DHA supplements are available , and vegans should consider them if their diets lack this essential fatty acid .
Parents may think raising a healthy vegetarian child requires a Ph.D. in nutrition , but they should n't feel daunted .
Major problems are rare , usually affecting babies whose parents make up their own , inadequate infant formula using soy milk or other bases without providing additional nutrients .
In fact , well - fed vegetarian children may actually be healthier because they escape contamination from hormones and other chemicals fed to food animals .
Eating lower on the food chain means children accumulate fewer pesticides and other toxic organochlorines such as PCBs and dioxin . [ 20 ]
These chemicals accumulate from birth in fat tissue , so healthy childhood diets can provide lifelong protection .
Adult vegetarians with a healthy lifestyle have a 30 percent lower chance of dying prematurely , and most causes of adult death are long - term conditions that may actually begin in childhood .
[ 21 ]
Children who eat healthily from birth are instilled with intelligent eating habits -- a skill that can mean a lifetime of good health . *

We 've covered the sickening case of serial rapist Jeffrey Marsalis before , but Self magazine has followed up and given it a little more context .
That context is , of course , that date rapes remain extremely hard to prosecute or get convictions on , as 8 of Marsalis 's 10 + victims already know ... and hopefully one more is not about to find out .
The results from a study of jury trials in rape cases are pretty stark .
Until now , it ’s been impossible to know exactly how many of these cases collapse in court , because no prosecution data was being collected .
But the research and training group End Violence Against Women International in Addy , Washington , just completed a four - year study across eight states and has allowed SELF an exclusive early look at its conclusions .
Of all the rape cases that come across prosecutors ’ desks , stranger - rape cases have the best courtroom odds , with 68 percent ending with a conviction or guilty plea .
But when a woman knows her assailant briefly ( less than 24 hours ) , a mere 43 percent of cases end in a conviction .
When they know each other longer than 24 hours , the conviction rate falls to 35 percent .
Even fewer , 29 percent , of intimate partners and exes are punished .
“ And keep in mind , the cases that come through the prosecutor ’s door are the strongest ones — strong enough for the police to have referred them along in the first place , ” notes EVAW International research director Kimberly Lonsway , Ph.D .
And , that does n't even include the women who choose not to report to the cops who serve as the gatekeepers for referring winnable cases to the prosecutors .
According to government estimates , a mere 19 percent of rapes , including stranger rapes , are ever reported in the first place .
As Valliere notes , women who have been sexually assaulted find so many reasons not to call police , including denial , shame or their hazy grasp of the facts due to drugs or alcohol .
Many survivors assume they wo n’t be believed .
Still others , such as Marie and Leigh , are mortified into silence by what they see as their complicity in their own attacks .

And , if that 's not depressing enough for you — because , notably , it does n't mention whether those acquaintance rapes involved violence or not — the reasons why are even more so .
“ To a juror , a rapist is a guy who jumps out of the bushes and throws a woman to the ground , ” [ Lynn Hecht Schafran , director of the National Judicial Education Program of Legal Momentum ] explains .
“ She has terrible injuries , and she leaps up and reports it immediately to the police .
Anything that falls short of that story is questionable . ”

So , basically , if your rapist is n't violent enough , you 're going to have trouble securing a conviction if you 're even one of the 1 in 5 women who goes to the police in the first place — which might be part of the reason plenty of victims do n't .
Since we last wrote about Marsalis a year ago , he pled no contest to " unlawful restraint " charges in an 11th sexual assault case in Philadelphia that had n't been part of either of his first two trials —- in exchange for prosecutors agreeing not to pursue another trial on one of the rape charges on which the jury had deadlocked in his second trial .
After fighting it for the better part of a year , he was finally extradicted to Idaho in August to face charges of raping a co-worker there in 2005 .
That trial is expected to begin in January of 2009 , 4 years after he sexually assaulted his victim .
Whatever the results , he will eventually have to return to Pennsylvania to serve out the remainder of his 10 - 21 year sentence on the 2 sexual assaults prosecutors managed to actually convict him of .
Marsalis is a walking reminder of the statistics : having known most of the 12 victims in these 4 cases more than 24 hours , at best , he 'll be convicted of assaulting 33 % of them .

Our Questions About How Serial Rapist Jeffrey Marsalis Got Away With It , Answered
Fossil fuels , especially oil , are a particular problem .
Even though the amount of resources seems huge , the cost of extraction ( in terms of fossil fuel resources , man-hours , and fresh water ) increases greatly after we have extracted the easy - to - extract oil , natural gas , and even coal .
Substitutes ( such as ethanol and solar voltaic ) are expensive in terms of fossil fuel use , man-hours , and fresh water .
It is also difficult to ramp up quantities to the level needed to substitute for fossil fuels .
We also know that the world is n’t infinite .
There are a finite number of atoms in the earth and its atmosphere .
The ability of our atmosphere to absorb pollutants is limited .
The ability of our soil to withstand repeated mistreatment is limited .
The amount of our non-renewable resources is limited .
We all know the world is n’t flat .
Any of us would be laughed out of the room if we built a model with a flat earth as one of its major assumptions .
Since I have written in the past on the financial crisis , I took the opportunity to respond .
This was my summary of the current financial situation , its connection to our limited resources , and what we need to do to solve the crisis .
I never actually use the words " peak oil " and , in fact , the precise timing of peak oil is irrelevant .
The issue is really the financial squeeze that occurs when resources starts to become expensive to deliver , and that does n't really require peak oil .
Recently , two major actuarial organizations asked members to submit essays on the financial crisis .
The only limitation was that the papers had to be very short -- they should fit on two typewritten sheets of paper .
Finite Resources but Unending Growth
In spite of the clear issue of a finite world , the financial community has taken as one of its central beliefs that Economic Growth is Good , and is in fact to be expected .
A close corollary is that Leverage is Good .
Our monetary system is very closely tied to debt , and would come to a screeching halt if lending stopped .
Our banks and insurance companies depend on lending , with banks using lending as their primary source of revenue , and insurance companies using bonds for much of the asset side of their balance sheets .
How did we come to believe that never ending growth was possible ?
One way was a simple look backward .
Growth has continued since the industrial revolution .
There was a tie - in with energy resources all along .
The industrial revolution brought coal to make creation of goods easier .
We later added oil , natural gas , and uranium as additional energy sources .
The world ’s use of energy has ramped up over a long period , practically without interruption .
Another way we justified the idea of unending growth was through economic models that ignored the contribution of energy and , of course , ignored the fact that we are living in a finite world .
Economic models of this type include the Solow - Swan Growth Model that considers the contributions of labor and capital , and the Cobb - Douglas production function that considers labor , capital , and productivity .
Neither of these models has built in limits , either .
The Tie Between Energy Resources and Economic Growth
Robert Ayres and Benjamin Warr showed a close tie between energy resources and economic growth in 2004 .
They found that when they used an economic model that considers both growth in energy use and growth in energy efficiency , it explains the vast majority of US economic growth between 1900 and 2000 , except for a residual of about 12 % after 1975 .
Common sense also tells us that energy resources are required for growth , and even to keep our current economy functioning .
There is very little economic activity that we can perform without diesel or gasoline or electricity .
Common sense would tell us that models such as the Solow - Swan Growth Model and the Cobb - Douglas production function are incomplete .
We Are Reaching Limits
No matter what kind of resources we are working with , they do n’t simply “ run out ” , as we use more and more of them .
Instead , they become more and more difficult to extract .
In the case of minerals , the ore concentrations become lower and lower .
Mines need to be built deeper and deeper .
Fossil fuels become of lower quality and more difficult to extract quickly .
For many years , depletion was not really an issue .
Resources were so vast , and the leverage provided by energy from fossil fuels was so great , that we could extract as much of almost anything we wanted ( oil , natural gas , coal , uranium , copper , phosphorous , gold , platinum , indium , gallium , fresh water , and many other things ) very cheaply , in the quantities needed for whatever use was desired .
What has happened in the last few years is that we have started reaching the point where extraction of many of these resources is becoming much more difficult .
In April , 2007 , the CEOs of Royal Dutch Shell and of French oil company Total SA were quoted as saying that the days of “ easy oil ” are gone .
Just this past week , the International Energy Agency released a report whose executive summary begins , “ The world ’s energy system is at a crossroads .
Current global trends in energy supply and consumption are patently unsustainable environmentally , economically , socially . ”
Our Current Economic Crisis
Now that we are reaching a point where the extraction of fossil fuels and minerals of all types are starting to reach limits , we find that if the economy starts to heat up , the price of many commodities starts to skyrocket .
Part of this is competition for limited resources .
Part of this is the high cost of extraction of these resources , now that we are increasingly reaching limits .
Food prices are affected as well , partly because oil ( for machinery ) and natural gas ( for nitrogen fertilizer ) are used in food production , and partly because competition with corn production for ethanol drives land prices up .
Once food and fuel prices rise , people find it difficult to repay debt , and debt defaults rise .
Now debt defaults are rippling through the economy .
The poor financial condition of banks makes them unwilling to lend .
This lack of credit is making it difficult for many direct and indirect buyers of commodities to buy products of many types ( oil , natural gas , uranium , and copper , for example ) .
Prices are plummeting for a wide range of products because prices are relatively inelastic .
These lower prices have a feedback effect on new production of commodities .
In a paper to be published in Journal of Energy Security shortly , I show that the credit crisis and the resulting lower commodity prices are leading to cut backs in planned production of energy products of all types ( fossil fuels , renewables , and uranium ) .
As a result , if the economy does start to heat back up again , we will have another round of commodity price increases .
This , of course , will be followed by another round of debt defaults .
What Is the Solution ?
In a finite world , we will soon find ourselves in a level or declining economy , simply because there are not enough easily - extractible resources to support growth without causing huge price spikes , followed by debt defaults , and another round of credit contraction and commodity price crashes .
The only solution I can see is to develop a new monetary system that is not debt based , and is not expected to grow .
Ideally , it would decline as there are fewer resources , and as the economy naturally declines .
With a flat or declining economy , long - term debt no longer makes sense .
The likelihood that borrowers will be able to repay loans with interest becomes quite low , because the economic system as a whole is not growing and producing a surplus that can be used toward interest payments .
It is much easier for a borrower to repay a 20 - year mortgage with interest when he is getting promotions and salary increases than when his employer is downsizing and cutting hours .
Somehow , a monetary system needs to be devised which operates without debt , except for very short - term debt to facilitate commercial transactions .
In addition , we need to extract ourselves from the debt morass we have created .
There is now far more debt and far more promises like Social Security and Medicare than can possibly be honored with existing resources .
The only way I can imagine transitioning to a new form of monetary system is by having an overlap period in which both monetary systems are in place .
The new money might initially be limited in supply and only be good for food and energy products ( somewhat like a rationing system ) .
People would receive some pay in each monetary system .
Eventually , the new monetary system would replace our current seriously problematic system .

Much of what happens in the brain is not evident to the brain itself , and thus people are better at playing these sorts of tricks on themselves than at catching themselves in the act .
People realize that humans deceive themselves , of course , but they do n't seem to realize that they too are human .
A Princeton University research team asked people to estimate how susceptible they and " the average person " were to a long list of judgmental biases ; the majority of people claimed to be less biased than the majority of people .
A 2001 study of medical residents found that 84 percent thought that their colleagues were influenced by gifts from pharmaceutical companies , but only 16 percent thought that they were similarly influenced .
Dozens of studies have shown that when people try to overcome their judgmental biases -- for example , when they are given information and told not to let it influence their judgment -- they simply can't comply , even when money is at stake .
And yet , if decision - makers are more biased than they realize , they are less biased than the rest of us suspect .
Research shows that while people underestimate the influence of self - interest on their own judgments and decisions , they overestimate its influence on others .
For instance , two psychologists , Dale Miller and Rebecca Ratner , asked people to predict how many others would agree to give blood for free or for $ 15 , and people predicted that the monetary incentive would double the rate of blood donation .
But when the researchers actually asked people to give blood , they found they were just as willing to do it for nothing as they were for a $ 15 reward .
The same researchers measured people 's attitudes toward smoking bans and asked them to guess the attitudes of others .
They found that smokers vastly overestimated the support of nonsmokers for the bans , as did nonsmokers the opposition of smokers to the bans -- in other words , neither group was quite as self - interested as the other group believed .
Behavioral economics bolsters psychology 's case .
When subjects play laboratory games that allow them to walk away with cash , self - interest dictates that they should get all the cash they can carry .
But scores of experiments show that subjects are willing to forgo cash in order to play nice .
For instance , when subjects are given a sum of money and told that they can split it with an unseen stranger in any proportion they like , they typically give the stranger a third or more , even though they could just as easily have given him nothing .
When subjects play the opposite role and are made the recipients of such splits , they typically refuse any split they consider grossly unfair , preferring to walk away with nothing than to accept an unjust distribution .

Keating said the Sizzler , which can be fired from submarines and surface ships “ is a very sophisticated piece of hardware and we are currently not as capable of defending against that missile as I would like . ”
Keating 's concerns about China 's buildup were echoed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates who last week expressed concerns about the secrecy surrounding China ’s large - scale military buildup and continuing double - digit percentage increases in military spending .
Gates told reporters on March 5 that he is concerned with the size of the budgets , the continuing increases and how the money is being spent .
“ We 've proposed engagement with the Chinese , and a strategic dialogue , so we can have a better understanding of what an 18 percent increase in the budget means and what their strategic modernization programs mean , who they think the enemy is and so on , and for us to provide equivalent information , ” Gates said .
He commented following release of the Pentagon ’s annual report on China ’s military power that stated China ’s arms buildup is speeding up and is “ scoped ” for power projection capabilities beyond a regional conflict over Taiwan .
Adm . Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , also said he is concerned that official Chinese figures for defense spending do not correspond to the spectrum of military development underway .
“ In addition to that 18 percent or the number that 's tied to that , is there are other parts of what we consider research and development kinds of investments that are not included in that , ” Mullen said .
“ And it 's linking the investments to strategic intent , that 's what continues to be of concern , and that 's the transparency piece . ”
Gates said there is “ general agreement ” that the announced Chinese military budget is “ only a portion of what the Chinese spend . ”

Â Â Â Â Over the course of the weekend of November 14 - 16 , I had the pleasure of attending the Third North American Secessionist Convention .
The event was held in Manchester , New Hampshire and was sponsored by the Middlebury Institute .
I was there as an observer .
While I do not personally represent or even belong to any actual secessionist organization , I am very supportive of the idea of secession by regions and localities as a means towards the end of abolishing the American empire .
Indeed , I have at times used the phrase “ empire abolitionist ” to describe my political outlook .
Â Â Â Â About fifty - five persons were in attendance , including both delegates from secessionist organizations and independent observers such as myself .
Dr. Kirkpatrick Sale of the Middlebury Institute kicked things off on Friday night with a discussion of how the times are indeed right for secessionism .
Secession has received a certain amount of attention in the media recently because of events such as those concerning South Ossetia , the rise of the Scottish independence movement , the ongoing struggle of the Quebec secessionists and the controversy surrounding Sarah Palin and the Alaskan Independence Party .
Three dozen pro-secession groups now exist in North America and some , such as the Southern National Congress , are working to build a real political organization .
The Middlebury Insitute recently commissioned a Zogby poll , the results of which showed that twenty - two percent of Americans support the right of states to become independent republics and eighteen percent would actually support a secession movement in their own region .
Â Â Â Â Former New Hampshire state senator Burt Cohen also spoke on Friday night and made a compelling argument that the present day United States is simply too large to be governed efficiently , insisting that “ the only way to reduce the size of government is to reduce the size of the unit to be governed . ”
Ian Baldwin of Vermont CommonsÂ discussed the recent election of Barack Obama and suggested that while the election results were a great achievement for African - Americans , it remains to be seen whether Obama will undo the evils of the Bush regime such as the attacks on habeus corpus that have transpired over the last eight years .
Mr. Baldwin expressed hopes that Obama will do well as president , butÂ insisted that “ by his deeds we shall know him . ”
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â On Saturday , delegates from various secessionist movements across North America presented reports .
The first of these was also one of the most interesting .
Several representatives of the movement to restore Hawaiian sovereignty discussed the history of the original conquest of the Hawaiian Islands , originally a constitutional monarchy with its own unique culture , by the United States over a hundred years ago .
Next up was Larry Kilgore , a conservative Christian activist and Â
Texas secessionist who ran for the SenateÂ in the Texas GOP primary on an explicitly secessionist platform and received over two hundred thousand votes , approximately nineteen percent of the votes cast .
Mr. Kilgore had previously run for Governor of Texas as a secessionist and received six percent of the vote .
Â Keith Humphrey , a representative of another conservative Christian group , the Christian Exodus Project , mentioned that members of his organization had relocated to various places , including South Carolina , Idaho and even Panama , with the goal of establishing independent , self - sufficient Christian communities .
He also urged Christians to “ purge themselves of the idolatry of statism ” and practice what he called “ personal secession ” by depending on God and the Christian community rather than the state , and avoiding statist institutions through such practices as midwifery , refusing to obtain a Social Security card or birth certificates for children , establishing home schools and home - based businesses , using private currencies and engaging in barter , avoiding corporate jobs and training children in independent living .
Â Â Â Â A gentleman advocating an independent Long Island called for what he termed a “ triple secession , ” whereby Long Island would secede from the New York City , from the state of New York , and from the United States .
Fellow Virginian Tom Moore of the League of the South , the largest secessionist organization in the U.S. , discussed the recent LOS conference in Chattanooga , the theme of which involved surviving the collapse of the empire with an emphasis on regional self - sufficiency concerning food and energy production .
Advocates of an independent South will be meeting on December 5 in Hendersonville , N.C. to form a parallel , shadow government for the original thirteen states of the old Confederacy , plus Maryland .
One hundred and twenty delegates are expected to attend , including Kirkpatrick Sale as a delegate from South Carolina .
Among the business to be discussed at this first Southern National Congress , modeled on the old Continental Congress of the Revolutionary War era , Â will be a “ remonstrance and petition for redress of grievances ” and an appeal to the empire to “ cease and desist ” from its present lawless and corrupt activities .
Â Â Â Â One of the more colorful speakers was Alaskan gold miner Dexter Clark of the Alaskan Independence Party , who mentioned that his movement has been denounced by everyone from the mainstream media to Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. to the “ Doonesbury ” comic strip .
He also clarified the AIP ’s relationship with Sarah Palin , noting that while Palin never belonged to the AIP , her husband Todd belonged to the party for seven years .
Mr. Clark also showed a video of a CNN report on the Alaskan Independence Party , and discussed the party ’s history and its firebrand founder , the late Joe Vogler .
He argued that lack of political will is the primary obstacle to formulating resistance to the empire and mentioned the need for young people to get involved .
Businesses under the burden of federal regulation were also discussed as possible allies for the secessionist cause .
Â Â Â Â Thomas Naylor of the Second Vermont Republic and author of “ Downsizing the U.S.A ” , a decentralist masterpiece , talked about Vermont ’s traditions of small towns , schools , businesses , farms and sense of community , along with its town meeting tradition .
Naylor also engaged in an extensive discussion of the obstacles to secession raised by skeptics , including the legacy of the “ Lincoln myth ” that Thomas DiLorenzo has roundly debunked , the failure of the Confederate secession during the Civil War , concerns about economic feasibility , risks of potential violence and excessive nationalism .
Dennis Steele of Vermont ’s Green Mountain Brigade , a veteran of the Ron Paul movement , talked about why he formed a grassroots organization for the purpose of raising awareness concerning the issue of secession .
Â Â Â Â A fascinating lecture was provided by a longtime activist in the movement for the secession of the Quebec province of Canada , including a comprehensive overview of the many political difficulties the movement has dealt with over the decades .
Robert Pritchard of the United Republic of Texas outlined a model for a “ panarchic ” system of government for an independent Texas , whereby competing governments might operate within the same territorial area .
Such as concept is alien to much of American political culture , but a similar model functioned for centuries during the era of medieval Europe with its polycentric system of manorial , canon , royal , merchant and common law , and during the period of rule of the Middle East by the Ottoman EmpireÂ with its millet system .
Â Carolyn Chute of the Second Maine Militia mentioned that while Maine is second only to Alaska in the number of private firearms in the state , the number of murders there is quite low compared to many other parts of the nation where gun laws are more restrictive .
Â Â Â Â A fellow from New Hampshire ’s libertarian Free State project talked about the widely divergent activities of his own movement , ranging from running for the state house ( some have even been elected ! ) to civil disobedience to forming alternative economic models such as barter networks and “ time banks . ”
Sebastian Cronin , founder of the Novocadia Independence Party , which advocates formation of a separate republic by the North Atlantic states of the US and the Maritime Provinces of Canada , gave an extended presentation on peak oil .
Mr. Cronin expressed his belief that a worldwide energy crisis will be the catalyst that leads toÂ an explosion of secessionist and decentralist tendencies worldwide .
Â Â Â Â After Saturday night ’s banquet , Kirkpatrick Sale gave an interesting talk exploring the question of why there is at present so little resistance to the empire given its many , many crimes , the recent obscenity of the Wall Street “ bailout ” , one of the largest transfers of wealth from the people to the ruling class in history , being foremost among them .
Dr. Sale also expressed considerable skepticism of the coming Obama administration , suggesting that the recent federal takeover of the financial institutions combined with the election of a messianic political figure could be the beginning of a full - blown American fascism .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
On this latter point , I am regrettably inclined to agree .
Certainly the ground work has been laid for such a phenomenon .
The escalating wars on drugs , crime and terrorism given to us by the Nixon - Reagan - Bush - Clinton - Bush legacy have created the infrastructure of a police state .
The outgoing regime of George W. Bush established precedents for both formal eradication of due process domestically and unapologetic aggressive warfare internationally .
This is Â the apparatus ofÂ state that Obama , his associates , and the oligarchy whom they serve stand to inherit .
An additional complication is that because Mr. Obama is a man of color , any criticism of his actions or policies as president will inevitably be met with wild accusations of bigotry and prejudice .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Though the present level of public apathy is no doubt quite high , and perhaps made higher stillÂ by the false hopes fueled by Â the media - circus associated with the election of Obama , it would still seem that a mass secession by regions and communities reflecting a wide divergence of cultural and ideological values , but with a common emphasis on the values of decentralism and self - sufficiency , Â would be the best alternative to the present system .
The empire certainly cannot endure forever .
No empire ever does .
Sadly , it will likely take disasters much greater than the ones we have seen thus far to make such an alternative seem viable to many .
At least someone is there to cast the first stone and say the emperor is indeed without clothes .

( NewsTarget ) Vitamin D , also called the sunshine vitamin , has already been shown in studies to be important for a healthy immune system , preventing and even reversing cancer , as well as strong bones ; it has also been linked to lower incidences of depression as well as diseases such as diabetes , heart disease and multiple sclerosis .
Now , a recent study published in thehas found that low levels of vitamin D could also have a part to play in the development of Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) .
The potential link between lack of vitamin D and PD may , it seems , go beyond just being a case of being caused by general ill health and weak immunity .
There could be another chemical link , or at least that is the hypothesized theory .
The chemical dopamine in the brain helps one to control one 's physical movements .
In PD , one 's levels of dopamine are lowered because the nerve cells which make the chemical have either died or lost their usual functioning .
With less dopamine , control of physical movements becomes affected , and one begins to move slowly , have stiff muscles , shake or lose balance .
Now , previous research has shown that the part of the human brain which is the most affected by PD has high levels of vitamin D receptors .
It thus follows , theoretically , that vitamin D deficiency would have a negative impact on the functioning of that part of the brain , thereby translating to higher chances of getting PD .
For this study , the research team examined the levels of plasma 25 - hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 [ OH] D ) in a clinical research database at Emory University School of Medicine .
The participants had been recruited into the study from May 1992 to March 2007 .
In all , three groups of people were compared  99 healthy adults to act as the control group , 97 Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) patients , and 100 PD patients .
The study subjects were matched for age , gender , race and geographic location .
You may be wondering why the group of AD patients was included .
That was because the study team wanted to find out if there was a link between vitamin D insufficiency and other diseases which also cause a loss of nerve cells .
The findings of the study revealed that 55 % of the PD patients had insufficient levels of vitamin D . The corresponding figures for AD and healthy people were 41 % and 36 % respectively .
When it came tovitamin D insufficiency , or vitamin D deficiency , the correlations were similar  23 % of PD patients were deficient in the vitamin , compared with 16 % of AD patients and 10 % of healthy people .
One interesting finding was that PD patients had less vitamin D than AD patients .
According to the study team , this suggests that lack of vitamin D may be linked specifically to Parkinson's , rather than to neurodegenerative diseases in general .
It is premature to conclude that lack of vitamin D is a precursor to the development of Parkinson 's Disease .
In fact , between the two factors , we cannot even be clear about which is the cause and which is the consequence .
For example , people with restricted movements would largely be confined to indoor areas , and the subsequent lack of sun exposure could then havetheir vitamin D insufficiency .
In fact , the connection could even work both ways .
In any case , there is already a long list of reasons for us to ensure that our bodies have sufficient amounts of vitamin D. And , as many experts agree , an adequate and commonsensical amount of time spent in open sunshine ( without any sunscreen , of course ) is the best way to get our fix of vitamin D .
When we do that , we will enjoy better health all round .
As for Parkinson 's and even Alzheimer 's patients , this study also reminds them of the need to boost their levels of vitamin D. Otherwise , other health complications may result .

High blood pressure is truly a silent killer .
In fact , a heart attack or stroke may be the first sign that you even have a problem .
That 's why it 's so important to get your blood pressure checked every time you go to the doctor -- especially if you 're a woman .
High blood pressure can lead to stroke , kidney problems , heart trouble and other conditions .
About 35 million American women have high blood pressure , and a third of them do n't know it .
In part , experts say , the increase comes just because women are living longer and doctors are paying more attention to the problem .
But less - benign factors -- such as the exploding use of anti-inflammatory medicines ( which make your body retain salt ) and ever - increasing waistlines -- may be at play in what the American Heart Association calls a rise in uncontrolled hypertension in women .
Fortunately , there are many ways to control your blood pressure , even without medication .
And just knowing your numbers is half the battle , says Dan Jones , M.D. , president of the AHA .
But that does n't mean fighting high blood pressure is a cinch .
Here are the stories of three women whose high blood pressure took them by surprise .
Think about them the next time that cuff goes around your arm .
Erin O'Connell Peiffer , 45
While Peiffer exper­ienced hypertension during all three of her pregnancies , her blood pressure always returned to normal after each birth .
Later , as she juggled working and caring for her young children , the thin , nonsmoking telecommunications executive who lives outside of Baltimore , Maryland , considered herself healthy ( except for her high cholesterol ) .
Then one day about seven years ago , she could n't stop coughing during a water aerobics class .
A month later , she was shocked to find out that she had congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema , or swelling of the lungs .
High blood pressure was behind the problems .
Following open - heart surgery to repair a 99 percent blockage in her left main coronary artery , Peiffer was terminated from her job because of her illness and went on disability .
She has n't worked in seven years because of chronic chest pain and other conditions .
Health.com : Learn some tricks to lower your blood pressure
Looking back , she remembers that in her 20s , her blood pressure was elevated when she was first found to have high cholesterol .
" They said it was white - coat hypertension [ the idea that just being in a medical office can drive blood pressure up ] , " Peiffer says .
" No one said , ' Hey , you need to exercise , ' or anything . "
So she did n't .
Now she 's on two blood pressure medications -- an ACE inhibitor that lowers levels of blood vessel - tightening chemicals and a beta - blocker that slows heart rate -- and her pressure 's normal .
Daily two - mile walks help , too .
" Get a baseline number , and keep an eye on it , " she says .
" Take care of yourself first so you can be there to take care of your children . "
Carolyn J. Daniels , 43
On the way to a regular medical checkup last year , Daniels , an Atlanta , Georgia - area marketing director , was in good spirits .
Her weight was under control at 145 pounds , and she thought she was healthy .
Her blood pressure had been slightly elevated at past checkups , but she had never been told to do anything about it .
This time was different .
Her reading was 160 over 100 , and she remembers her doctor saying , " You 're like a firecracker -- ready to pop . "
Daniels was petrified : " I thought I was going to die . "
Her doctor put her on blood pressure medication immediately .

Now she takes a beta - blocker and a calcium channel blocker , which also relaxes blood vessels .
To stay healthy , she and her husband walk every other evening after dinner .
The hardest part ?
Giving up the fried foods she loves .
" Every now and then , I 'll cheat and have some fried chicken over at my sister 's house , " she confesses .
But she 's learned to broil , bake , and stir - fry tomatoes , collards , cabbage , and other vegetables .
Daniels is among the 43 percent of African - American women who have hypertension .
The risk for African - Americans is much higher than for Asians or whites , although it 's not clear why .
Daniels thinks there is only one way to cope : " I felt fine , but that ' s not good enough .
It 's especially important for African - American women to go to a doctor routinely .
That 's the only way you 're going to know you have it . "
Antoinette Trammell , 50
Even though her mother had hypertension , Trammell , a hospital human resources specialist in Richmond , Virginia , did n't think about her family medical history 20 years ago when she started having headaches and blurred vision -- two of the very rare symptoms of high blood pressure .
Then one of the hospital 's nurse managers took Trammell 's blood pressure and sent her straight to a cardiologist .
Health.com : Read who is at risk of high blood pressure
Health Library MayoClinic.com : High blood pressure ( hypertension )
Her blood pressure is now under control thanks to an ACE inhibitor , a diuretic , and some overdue diet changes .
She 's trying to lose weight -- hoping to drop 30 pounds -- and the self - professed saltaholic has cut way back on her favorite foods .
" Potato chips , fries , all those good things , " Trammell says .
" I could literally put salt in my hand and eat it . "
Too much salt makes many people retain water , which increases blood volume and puts more pressure on arteries .
The diuretic also helps break that cycle .
Why was n't Trammell more active in controlling her risks at a younger age ?
Probably because she grew up on a farm , and her parents rarely saw a doctor .
Her mother died at age 80 in 2002 after a stroke and heart attack .
" Now I make sure to have my blood pressure checked once a week , " Trammell says .
" This is n't a condition that I can just take care of when I have the time . "

Advertisement Mitch Mitchell , the British drummer in the seminal 1960s band the Jimi Hendrix Experience , has been found dead in his US hotel room , authorities say .
The 61 - year - old was discovered in the Benson Hotel in Portland , Oregon , in the early hours of Wednesday .
A medical examiner told the Associated Press news agency that his death appeared to be from natural causes , but said there would be an autopsy .
Hendrix died in 1970 and the band 's bassist Noel Redding died in 2003 .
Mitchell , from Ealing in west London , had been touring with the Experience Hendrix Tour .
' Rock ' n ' roll hero '
The band was one of the most influential of the 1960s Janie Hendrix , chief executive of the tour and step - sister of Jimi Hendrix , paid tribute to Mitchell .
" He was a wonderful man , a brilliant musician and a true friend , " she said .
" His role in shaping the sound of the Jimi Hendrix Experience cannot be underestimated . "
Terry Stewart , chief executive of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum , also paid tribute to Mitchell .
He said the musician had added a " strictly percussive element to a lead instrument " .
He added : " His interplay with Jimi Hendrix 's guitar on songs like Fire is truly amazing .
" Mitch Mitchell had a massive influence on rock ' n ' roll drumming and took it to new heights . "
Mitchell performed on Hendrix classics such as Are You Experienced ?
Electric Ladyland and Axis : Bold As Love .
Mitchell drummed for Hendrix at his legendary Woodstock performance
The top session drummer also played with the likes of Eric Clapton , John Lennon , Keith Richards and Muddy Waters .
Bob Merlis , a spokesman for the tour , called his death " devastating " .
He had seen Mitchell perform two weeks ago in Los Angeles and the drummer appeared healthy and upbeat , he said .
Blues - rock guitarist Kenny Wayne Shepherd , who is also part of the tour , said Mitchell was to drums what Hendrix was to guitar .
" Today many of us have lost a dear friend , and the world has lost a rock ' n ' roll hero , " he said .

The grading proposal below is tentative and is to be discussed with the course participants .
Obama transition team boss John Podesta threw open the curtains of his operation today to reporters , signaling that the president - elect wants to move quickly , but not hastily , to set up his government .
In a pen and pad meeting with reporters — that means no cameras — Podesta , tieless , was at ease and confident as he proposed ethics rules governing the transition , promised top cabinet picks by December , and gabbed at length about the friendly and professional relationship he has with the Bush chief of staff , Josh Bolten .
He made little news at the packed briefing but pledged that news was coming as he promised to conduct the most transparent transition in history .
What we know :
He has a budget of $ 12 million , $ 5.2 million in federal money with the rest from donors .
Some 450 aides will be picking through résumés and policies as they create the government for the 44th president .
President - elect Barack Obama will name top cabinet picks in Chicago , while key White House officials could be named at Washington press conferences .
Security at transition HQ is tight , as evidenced by the long line for reporters in the picture below .
But to its credit , the able and efficient Obama press team gave fair warning , and everybody got in before Podesta arrived .
Now the above transition flowchart .
It is making the rounds in Washington tonight , though our source would not reveal the actual source of the document .
It lists suggestions for top cabinet posts , many of which have been rumored for days inside and outside the new administration .
Of note : Al Gore might be under consideration for a " climate czar " position ; Colin Powell could be education secretary ; Howard Dean might get health and human services ; Robert F. Kennedy Jr. might be the head of the Environmental Protection Agency ; and Caroline Kennedy could be the ambassador to the United Nations .
It 's just an unofficial guide but a fun one to follow .
The back - and - forth between mainstream carriers and external mega-corps may finally be coming to an end , with the almighty FCC expected to make a pivotal determination regarding the use of white space in short order .
For those unaware , white space refers to the freed spectrum that will become available when broadcasters move completely to digital TV next February , and there 's been a heated debate between carriers ( who typically " fear " unwanted interference by unlicensed use ) and tech companies like Google who see this as a great opportunity to bring wireless services to rural areas ( for instance ) .
According to a new report from Reuters , the FCC is expected to weigh in at any moment , and it'll " likely " recommend the unlicensed use of the spectrum .
The advice will be based on reports generated from years of data collection , but we 're all stuck waiting in tense anticipation until it 's released .
Anytime now , FCC ...

6 Awesome Linux cd command Hacks – Productivity Tip #3 for Geeks
This article is part of the ongoing Productivity Tips for Geeks series .
cd is one of the most frequently used command during a Unix session .
In this article , I ’ve provided 6 cd command hacks , which will boost your productivity instantly and make it easier to navigate the directory structure from command line .
Hack # 1 : Use CDPATH to define the base directory for cd command
If you are frequently doing cd to subdirectories of a specific parent directory , you can set the CDPATH to the parent directory and perform cd to the subdirectories without giving the parent directory path as explained below .
[ ramesh@dev-db ~ ] # pwd /home / ramesh [ ramesh@dev-db ~ ] # cd mail - bash : cd : mail :
No such file or directory [ Note :
This is looking for mail directory under current directory ] [ ramesh@dev-db ~ ] # export CDPATH=/etc [ ramesh@dev-db ~ ] # cd mail [ Note :
This is looking for mail under /etc and not under current directory ] [ ramesh@dev-db /etc / mail ] # pwd /etc/mail
To make this change permanent , add export CDPATH= / etc to your ~/.bash_profile
This hack can be very helpful under the following situations :
Oracle DBAs frequently working under $ ORACLE_HOME , can set the CDPATH variable to the oracle home
Unix sysadmins frequently working under /etc , can set the CDPATH variable to /etc
Developers frequently working under project directory / home / projects , can set the CDPATH variable to /home / projects
End-users frequently accessing the subdirectories under their home directory , can set the CDPATH variable to ~ ( home directory )
Hack # 2 : Use cd alias to navigate up the directory effectively
When you are navigating up a very long directory structure , you may be using cd ..\..\ with multiple ..\’s depending on how many directories you want to go up as shown below .
# mkdir -p /tmp/very/long/directory/structure/that/is/too/deep # cd /tmp/very/long/directory/structure/that/is/too/deep # pwd /tmp/very/long/directory/structure/that/is/too/deep # cd ../../../../ # pwd /tmp/very/long/directory/structure
Instead of executing cd ../../../.. to navigate four levels up , use one of the following alias methods :
Navigate up the directory using ..n :
In the example below , ..4 is used to go up 4 directory level , ..3 to go up 3 directory level , ..2 to go up 2 directory level .
Add the following alias to the .
bash_profile and re-login .
alias ..= " cd .. " alias ..2= " cd ../.. " alias ..3 = " cd ../../.. " alias ..4 = " cd ../../../.. " alias ..5 = " cd ../../../../.. " # cd /tmp/very/long/directory/structure/that/is/too/deep #..4 [ Note : use ..4 to go up 4 directory level ] # pwd / tmp / very / long / directory / structure /
Navigate up the directory using only dots :
In the example below , ….. ( five dots ) is used to go up 4 directory level .
Typing 5 dots to go up 4 directory structure is really easy to remember , as when you type the first two dots , you are thinking “ going up one directory ” , after that every additional dot , is to go one level up .
So , use …. ( four dots ) to go up 3 directory level and .. ( two dots ) to go up 1 directory level .
Add the following alias to the .
bash_profile and re-login for the ….. ( five dots ) to work properly .
alias ..= " cd .. " alias ...=" cd ../.. " alias ....=" cd ../../.. " alias .....=" cd ../../../.. " alias ......=" cd ../../../../.. " # cd /tmp/very/long/directory/structure/that/is/too/deep
# ..... [ Note : use ..... ( five dots ) to go up 4 directory level ] # pwd / tmp / very / long / directory / structure /
Navigate up the directory using cd followed by consecutive dots :
In the example below , cd ….. ( cd followed by five dots ) is used to go up 4 directory level .
Making it 5 dots to go up 4 directory structure is really easy to remember , as when you type the first two dots , you are thinking “ going up one directory ” , after that every additional dot , is to go one level up .
So , use cd… .
( cd followed by four dots ) to go up 3 directory level and cd… ( cd followed by three dots ) to go up 2 directory level .
Add the following alias to the .
bash_profile and re-login for the above cd ….. ( five dots ) to work properly .
alias cd..=" cd .. " alias cd ...=" cd ../.. " alias cd ....=" cd ../../.. " alias cd .....=" cd ../../../.. " alias cd ......=" cd ../../../../.. " # cd /tmp/very/long/directory/structure/that/is/too/deep # cd ..... [ Note : use cd ..... to go up 4 directory level ] # pwd /tmp/very / long / directory / structure
Hack # 3 : Perform mkdir and cd using a single command
Sometimes when you create a new directory , you may cd to the new directory immediately to perform some work as shown below .
# mkdir -p /tmp/subdir1/subdir2/subdir3 # cd /tmp/subdir1/subdir2/subdir3 # pwd /tmp/subdir1/subdir2/subdir3
Would n’t it be nice to combine both mkdir and cd in a single command ?
Add the following to the .
bash_profile and re-login .
function mkdircd ( ) { mkdir -p " $ @ " && eval cd " \ " \$ $ #\ " " ; }
Now , perform both mkdir and cd at the same time using a single command as shown below :
# mkdircd /tmp/subdir1/subdir2/subdir3
[ Note :
This creates the directory and cd to it automatically ] # pwd /tmp/subdir1/subdir2/subdir3
Hack # 4 : Use “ cd - ” to toggle between the last two directories
You can toggle between the last two current directories using cd – as shown below .
# cd /tmp/very/long/directory/structure/that/is/too/deep # cd /tmp/subdir1/subdir2/subdir3 # cd - # pwd /tmp/very/long/directory/structure/that/is/too/deep # cd - # pwd /tmp/subdir1/subdir2/subdir3 # cd - # pwd /tmp/very/long/directory/structure/that/is/too/deep
Note :
You can also substitute an argument from other commands in the history to the cd command using example # 12 and # 13 mentioned in the command line history examples article .
Hack # 5 : Use dirs , pushd and popd to manipulate directory stack
You can use directory stack to push directories into it and later pop directory from the stack .
Following three commands are used in this example .
dirs : Display the directory stack
pushd : Push directory into the stack
popd :
Pop directory from the stack and cd to it
Dirs will always print the current directory followed by the content of the stack .
Even when the directory stack is empty , dirs command will still print only the current directory as shown below .
# popd - bash : popd : directory stack empty # dirs ~ # pwd / home / ramesh
How to use pushd and popd ?
Let us first create some temporary directories and push them to the directory stack as shown below .
# mkdir /tmp/dir1 # mkdir /tmp/dir2 # mkdir /tmp/dir3 # mkdir /tmp/dir4 # cd /tmp/dir1 # pushd .
# cd /tmp/dir2 # pushd .
# cd /tmp/dir3 # pushd .
# cd /tmp/dir4 # pushd .
# dirs
/tmp/dir4 /tmp/dir4 /tmp/dir3 /tmp/dir2 /tmp/dir1
[ Note :
The first directory ( / tmp/ dir4 ) of the dir command output is always the current directory and not the content from the stack . ]
At this stage , the directory stack contains the following directories :
/tmp/dir4 /tmp/dir3 /tmp/dir2 /tmp/dir1
The last directory that was pushed to the stack will be at the top .
When you perform popd , it will cd to the top directory entry in the stack and remove it from the stack .
As shown above , the last directory that was pushed into the stack is / tmp / dir4 .
So , when we do a popd , it will cd to the / tmp / dir4 and remove it from the directory stack as shown below .
# popd # pwd / tmp/dir4 [ Note : After the above popd , directory Stack Contains : /tmp/dir3 /tmp/dir2 /tmp/dir1 ] # popd # pwd /tmp/dir3 [ Note : After the above popd , directory Stack Contains : /tmp/dir2 /tmp/dir1 ] # popd # pwd /tmp/dir2 [ Note : After the above popd , directory Stack Contains : /tmp/dir1 ] # popd # pwd / tmp/ dir1 [ Note :
After the above popd , directory Stack is empty ! ] # popd - bash : popd : directory stack empty
Hack # 6 : Use “ shopt -s cdspell ” to automatically correct mistyped directory names on cd
Use shopt -s cdspell to correct the typos in the cd command automatically as shown below .
If you are not good at typing and make lot of mistakes , this will be very helpful .
# cd /etc / mall - bash : cd : /etc / mall :
No such file or directory # shopt -s cdspell # cd /etc / mall # pwd /etc / mail [ Note :
By mistake , when I typed mall instead of mail , cd corrected it automatically ]

10 Great Moments in Jack Thompson ’s ( Failed ) Career
With Jack Thompson ’s recent permanent disbarment , the legal system has lost its greatest champion since Judge Juggles The Clown drowned in a courtroom filled with custard .
While his newly non-professional status frees him up for a shot at the 2009 Dumbass Olympics , we commemorate his career ’s passing by looking back at ten great Thompson moments .
1. Battling Janet Reno
Long before taking on Take Two and Rockstar , John Bruce “ Jack ” Thompson had his sights set on becoming state prosecutor in Dade county .
His opponent was then - state attorney Janet Reno , and in a contest to determine who was best suited to prove the guilt of those accused of murder , rape and kidnapping he opted for the strategy of “ calling her a lesbian ” .
No , sorry , “ calling her a lesbian in the fashion of a nine year old boy in home room ” , as he passed her a note asking her to check a box to indicate that she was heterosexual / bisexual / homosexual .
We assume he then giggled and blew spitballs at whatever the equivalent of a teacher is at a campaign event .
She placed a hand on his shoulder and explained that she was only attracted to virile men , which is why she was n’t attracted to him .
In the words of the videogamers he hates so much , PWN3D .
His response ?
To file a police report claiming her very touch on his person constituted battery , or in other words , demanding that police officers were needed to defend him from the Death Grip of a fifty year old woman .
Janet Reno went on to supervise the convictions of the Unabomber , Timothy McVeigh and the World Trade Center bombers .
Jack went on to pick and lose fights against people who provide home entertainment .
2. Batman of Rap
In 1990 Jacky , as we will now refer to him as “ Jack ” is entirely too manly a name for one who fears the Kung Fu of a woman over half a century old , decided that Rap was his new enemy .
In his campaign against 2 Live Crew ’s “ As Nasty As They Wanna Be ” he claimed that he was Bruce Wayne , a Batman to fight the evils of Rap Music .
Not just in words : he wore a Bat - watch and mailed people copies of his driver ’s license with pictures of Batman edited in .
Hands up if that sounds like the act of a well - adjusted legal professional ( there will be no hands up , as anybody who tries to raise one will find it inconveniently “ restrained ” by some kind of “ jacket ” ) .
Note that this was in 1990 , the year a Florida psychiatric evaluation certified him as sane .
Indicating that Florida has needed to seriously re-evaluate its mental health standards for nearly 20 years , as anyone who ’s been there will agree .
Unfortunately , he never emulated Batman to the point of leaping through a plate glass skylight into a warehouse full of rappers because , honestly , the results from that would have been really funny .
3. Heath High School Case
In 1997 Jackqueline filed suit against the makers of Doom , MechWarrior , several other games , most of Hollywood and the parts of the Internet with porn on them .
He claimed $ 33 million in damages on behalf the more opportunistic families of victims , and despite the fact that the sheer number of “ defendants ” meant they could pay twenty cents each and probably meet the bill , the case was dismissed for even presenting a legally recognizable claim .
The closest the legal profession can actually get to going “ Say What ? ” with a disgusted expression on its face .
His argument was that Doom was an extremely accurate military - style murder simulator , meaning either he has n’t actually seen Doom or the US Army is seriously under - reporting the number of demon- infested martian bases currently listed as combat zones .
4. Columbine , Virginia , NIU
Jacki leaped back into the spotlight and single - handedly invented the classy concept of “ massacre chasing ” , weighing in on the Virginia Tech shootings with all the tact and respect of a randy rhinoceros in a petting zoo .
And about the same level of coherence .
His tirades were slightly less accurate than a blind pygmy with a crystal ball and much less entertaining .
By the Northern Illinois Shootings Jackisha was being introduced as a “ Campus Shooting Expert ” – the fact that neither he nor Fox saw any problem with that says more about them than we could .
5 . The Penny Arcade Donation
Jackette offered ten thousand dollars to the charity of choice of anyone who made a game representing the murder of Take Two boss Paul Eibeler .
When he was taken up on the offer he cunningly revealed that the entire “ offering to give money to charity ” thing was satire .
A revolutionary new form of satire , not the definition of satire shared by dictionaries , or the rest of the English speaking world , but instead defined by Jackisha as “ dangling money in front of people in need and whipping it away at the last moment .
Also , lying and chickening out of things in an incredibly public manner . ”
The makers of gaming webcomic Penny Arcade donated the money on his behalf to the Child ’s Play charity for sick children .
There are many ways to interpret people spending five figures to make up for your bad debt : shame , guilt , withdrawal from public life to atone in a remote monastery .
Jack opted for to call the police .
On the grounds that two men donated their own money to charity .
Also , the case had about as much chance of success as a souffle - based armor - piercing bullet , showing Jack ’s keen legal acumen and the way he certainly does n’t use the due process of a free country as a club to threaten people with .
6 . Chickens out of fake debate
Thompson kept up his “ Being a lying coward in public ” streak in 2008 by challenging , nay , daring the simula - Samuel L Jackson of Newsgroper to a debate .
When he was taken up on the offer , well , guess what happened .
We can understand running from a fight from the real Samuel L Jackson .
That ’s the only sensible option – at the last count he ’s a renegade FBI SHIELD agent Jedi Samurai Mob Enforcer who plays by his own rules , and on top of all that , he ’s Samuel Goddamn Jackson .
But a fake Jackson ?
Here ’s a hint , Jacki , because it ’s become clear you do n’t understand this technology stuff : the people pretending to be tough online are pretty much the opposite .
Somebody pretending to be Sam L is likeliest the whitest , palest inoffensive non -mofo you ’ll find outside the albino ward of an osteoporosis hospital .
7. NIMF tells him to get lost
The warning sirens on the Crazy - ometer were really blaring when even the National Institute on Media and the Family announced that it was n’t him , it was them , and if he could go and scream and fling shit like a lunatic somewhere else , that would be just super .
NIMF , the people who invented the idiotic non-word “ killographic ” and have accused video games of promoting not just murder but outright cannibalism , looked at Jack Thompson and said “ Damn , but that guy is crazy ” .
8. Florida bar :
Put up or shut up .
In fact , put up AND shut up
2008 was the year that the Florida Bar finally had enough of Jack making a mockery out of their entire livelihood – only eighteen years after the first time the accused him of being insane , so you can see the lightning speed of justice in the Sunshine State .
He was ordered to attend a disbarment trial which could ban him from the legal profession for five years .
To add “ We can file extra lawsuits too ” insult to the career - injury , they filed a show cause order stating that he would have to legally prove that he has n’t been using the legal system as his own personal soapbox and Threatening - Stick .
Which at this point would be pretty tricky .
They also ruled that any further legal proceedings filed by Jack must be cosigned by another member of the Florida Bar , or put another way , they are literally saying “ You are not allowed to play with our legal system unless supervised by a responsible adult . ”
He reacted to being told that he was now legally viewed as a minor by immediately filing an appeal .
Without a signature .
9 . Walks out of his own hearing
Of course , Jack would n’t settle for disbarment .
With his behaviour he managed to get the case elevated to “ enhanced disbarment ” , forbidding him from practising law for a full decade , and stormed out of his own proceedings and accusing the judge of not having the authority to hear them .
To restate : he walked out of proceedings on the grounds that the judge in a case brought against him by the Supreme Court did not have the necessary legal authority .
Short of Jesus returning , going to law school and combining with the President and Buddha to form The Right Honourable Lawyo - Tron , it ’s hard to imagine who he imagines would have the authority .
He not only accused the judge of being unqualified but also of being mentally unbalanced and started throwing around phrases like “ killing three thousand people ” .
For those of us who ’ve been within ten meters of a law enforcement official since 9/11 , that ’s generally regarded as a bad idea .
A really bad idea .
A “ US Marshals dispatched to your home to explain why talking about committing mass murder in letters to legal officials is not a great idea , as Jack found out shortly afterwards .
10 . Permanently Disbarred
All this managed to raise the stakes to permanent disbarment , a “ never darken our doorstep again ” ruling which the Florida Bar finally issued .
Nearly two decades after grown man stated he was going to hunt down rappers under the guise of Bruce Wayne .
Of course Jack has pledged to continue the good fight , and given his past behaviour it ’s entirely possible that he ’ll still be filing suit by the time they ’ve got him both legally and physically restrained in a mental hospital , scrawling outraged and inaccurate statements with a crayon held between his teeth .

The Intel Core i7 Installation Guide
It was the dawn of a new era for Intel when they launched the new Nehalem microarchitecture with the first microprocessor to be based on it - the Intel Core i7 processor and its attendant chipset - the Intel X58 Express .
This new platform also introduces a new processor " socket " , the LGA1366 ( also known as Socket B ) , and a new interconnect , the QPI or QuickPath Interconnect .
Technical advances aside , the introduction of the new CPU socket means the new platform is not only imcompatible with LGA775 Intel processors but also the CPU coolers designed for that socket .
Other than that , migrating from the LGA775 socket to the new LGA1366 socket should be easy for those who are already familiar with the Intel Core 2 processors .
After all , it is just a larger version of the venerable LGA775 socket .
New users migrating from the AMD platforms , on the other hand , may find the new socket both foreign and even a little scary .
Hence , we decided to come up with a pictorial guide to show you just how easy it is to install an LGA1366 processor and its cooler .
We will demonstrate the process using the spanking new Intel Core i7 processor and the cooler it ships with .
Let 's get on with it !
Preparing The Socket
Unlike traditional CPU sockets , the LGA1366 " socket " does not have any holes .
Instead , it has an array of contact pins on which the CPU rests .
The pins in the LGA1366 socket are thinner and closer together than in the LGA775 socket , so they are more susceptible to damage .
When you buy a new Intel X58 Express motherboard ( e.g. the ASUS P6T Deluxe ) , you will notice that the pins are protected by a hard plastic cover .
In the example below , the plastic cover ( or PnP cap ) even has a sticker which warns you to remove it only when you want to install a CPU .
Step 1
Step 2
Step 1 : Note the J - shaped load lever at the bottom of the LGA1366 socket .
That secures the socket 's metal cover .
Step 2 : Unhook the lever by pressing down on it and away from the socket .
Bring it all the way to the other end .
This unlocks the metal socket cover .
Step 3
Step 4
Step 3 : You can now flip open the metal socket cover ( also known as the load plate ) .
This reveals the hard plastic socket cap .
Step 4 : The socket cap ( or PnP cap ) has two small protruding tabs .
Use a small screwdriver or your fingernails to hook into them , and pry off the plastic cap .
Note :
Keep the socket cover ( PnP cap ) .
You will need it if you ever need to RMA the motherboard .
Before you send the motherboard back to the manufacturer , replace the CPU with the PnP cap .
Some manufacturers will refuse to repair / replace motherboards that were not returned with the cap in place .

Livestock production has a bigger climate impact than transport , the UN believes
People should consider eating less meat as a way of combating global warming , says the UN 's top climate scientist .
Rajendra Pachauri , who chairs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , will make the call at a speech in London on Monday evening .
UN figures suggest that meat production puts more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transport .
But a spokeswoman for the UK's National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) said methane emissions from farms were declining .
People may not realise that changing what 's on their plate could have an even bigger effect
Joyce D'Silva
Compassion in World Farming Dr Pachauri has just been re-appointed for a second six - year term as chairman of the Nobel Prize - winning IPCC , the body that collates and evaluates climate data for the world 's governments .
" The UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) has estimated that direct emissions from meat production account for about 18 % of the world 's total greenhouse gas emissions , " he told BBC News .
" So I want to highlight the fact that among options for mitigating climate change , changing diets is something one should consider . "
Climate of persuasion
The FAO figure of 18 % includes greenhouse gases released in every part of the meat production cycle - clearing forested land , making and transporting fertiliser , burning fossil fuels in farm vehicles , and the front and rear end emissions of cattle and sheep .
Dr Pachauri has chaired the Nobel Prize - winning body since 2002
The contributions of the three main greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide - are roughly equivalent , the FAO calculates .
Transport , by contrast , accounts for just 13 % of humankind 's greenhouse gas footprint , according to the IPCC .
Dr Pachauri will be speaking at a meeting organised by Compassion in World Farming ( CIWF ) , whose main reason for suggesting people lower their consumption of meat is to reduce the number of animals in factory farms .
CIWF 's ambassador Joyce D'Silva said that thinking about climate change could spur people to change their habits .
" The climate change angle could be quite persuasive , " she said .
" Surveys show people are anxious about their personal carbon footprints and cutting back on car journeys and so on ; but they may not realise that changing what 's on their plate could have an even bigger effect . "
Side benefits
There are various possibilities for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with farming animals .
They range from scientific approaches , such as genetically engineering strains of cattle that produce less methane flatus , to reducing the amount of transport involved through eating locally reared animals .
" The NFU is committed to ensuring farming is part of the solution to climate change , rather than being part of the problem , " an NFU spokeswoman told BBC News .
Unnatural roots of the food crisis Snared in a homemade ' NitroNet '
Send us your comments " We strongly support research aimed at reducing methane emissions from livestock farming by , for example , changing diets and using anaerobic digestion . "
Methane emissions from UK farms have fallen by 13 % since 1990 .
But the biggest source globally of carbon dioxide from meat production is land clearance , particularly of tropical forest , which is set to continue as long as demand for meat rises .
Ms D'Silva believes that governments negotiating a successor to the Kyoto Protocol ought to take these factors into account .
" I would like governments to set targets for reduction in meat production and consumption , " she said .
" That 's something that should probably happen at a global level as part of a negotiated climate change treaty , and it would be done fairly , so that people with little meat at the moment such as in sub-Saharan Africa would be able to eat more , and we in the west would eat less . "
Dr Pachauri , however , sees it more as an issue of personal choice .
" I 'm not in favour of mandating things like this , but if there were a ( global ) price on carbon perhaps the price of meat would go up and people would eat less , " he said .
" But if we 're honest , less meat is also good for the health , and would also at the same time reduce emissions of greenhouse gases . "

Carolina Hurricanes rookie Brandon Sutter on the ice after being smacked by Doug Weight of the New York Islanders .
Speed and heavier players are responsible for more concussions in the sport .
One painful lesson every National Hockey League rookie learns is to keep your head up when skating through the neutral zone .
If you do n't , you will not see the 4,700 joules of kinetic energy skating at you with bad intentions .
During an Oct. 25 game , Brandon Sutter , rookie center for the Carolina Hurricanes , never saw Doug Weight , veteran center of the New York Islanders , sizing him up for a hit that resulted in a concussion and an overnight stay in the hospital [ video ] .
Hockey purists will say that it was a " clean hit " and Weight was not penalized .
Six days before that incident , the Phoenix Coyotes ' Kurt Sauer smashed Andrei Kostitsyn of the Montreal Canadiens into the sideboards .
Kostitsyn had to be stretchered off the ice and missed two weeks of games due to a concussion .
Sauer skated away unhurt and unpenalized .
Big hits have always been part of hockey , but the price paid in injuries is on the rise .
A total of 759 NHL players have been diagnosed with a concussion since 1997 , according to data released last month at the National Academy of Neuropsychology 's Sports Concussion Symposium in New York .
For the 10 seasons studied , that works out to about 76 players per season and 31 concussions per 1,000 hockey games .
During the 2006 – 07 season , that resulted in 760 games missed by those injured players , an increase of 41 percent from 2005 –06 .
Researchers have found two reasons for the jump in severity — the physics of motion and the ever - expanding hockey player .
In his book " The Physics of Hockey , " Alain Haché , professor of physics at Canada 's University of Moncton , aligns the concepts of energy , momentum and the force of impact to explain the power of mid-ice and board collisions .
As a player skates from a stop to full speed , his mass accelerates at an increasing velocity .
The work that his muscles contribute is transferred into kinetic energy which can and will be transferred or dissipated when the player stops , either through heat from the friction of his skates on the ice , or through a transfer of energy to whatever he collides with , either the boards or another player .
The formula for kinetic energy , K = ( 1/2 ) mass x velocity squared , represents the greater impact that a skater 's speed ( velocity ) has on the energy produced .
It is this speed that makes hockey a more dangerous sport than other contact sports , such as football , where average players are larger but they are moving at slower speeds ( an average of 23 mph for hockey players in full stride compared to about 16 mph for an average running back in the open field ) .
So , when two players collide , where does all of that kinetic energy go ?
First , let 's look at two billiard balls , with the exact same mass , shape and rigid structure .
When two balls collide on the table , we can ignore the mass variable and just look at velocity .
If the ball in motion hits another ball that is stationary , then the ball at rest will receive more kinetic energy from the moving ball so that the total energy is conserved .
This will send the stationary ball rolling across the table while the first ball almost comes to a stop as it has transferred almost all of its stored energy .
Unfortunately , when human bodies collide , they do n't just bounce off of each other .
This " inelastic " collision results in the transfer of kinetic energy being absorbed by bones , tissues and organs .
The player with the least stored energy will suffer the most damage from the hit , especially if that player has less " body cushion " to absorb the impact .
To calculate your own real world energy loss scenario , visit the Exploratorium 's " Science of Hockey " calculator .
For both Sutter and Kostitsyn , they received checks from players who outweighed them by 20 pounds and were skating faster .
The average mass and acceleration variables are also growing as today 's NHL players are getting bigger and faster .
In a study released in September , Art Quinney and colleagues at the University of Alberta tracked the physiological changes of a single NHL team over 26 years , representing 703 players .
Not surprisingly , they found that defensemen are now taller and heavier with higher aerobic capacity , while forwards are younger and faster .
Goaltenders are actually smaller these days , shorter and with less body mass , but have more flexibility than they used to .
However , the increase in physical size and fitness did not correspond with team success on the ice .
But the checks sure hurt a lot more now .

Whether you are taking a holiday in Toronto or are exploring flights from Montreal to Toronto for business reasons , why not make the most of your stay ?
There ’s something totally boring about visiting all the usual tourist traps that are just like those found in any other city around the world .
When visiting Toronto , why not look for something off the beaten path , something weird and wacky ?
Here are six of those experiences you wo n’t want to miss on your next trip to Ontario ’s capital , Toronto .
1. Cuddle Parties
Now , this is an odd one and maybe just a bit hard to explain .
A Cuddle Party is hosted by people who have been specially trained to facilitate these parties in various locations around North America .
This one happens to be located in Toronto and the whole object is to help people become comfortable with the notion of non-sexual touching .
It all involves asking and giving permission to touch , and those who have attended these parties have said they were just as entertaining as they were informative .
In this world where boundaries have become obscured everywhere from politics to academia , a Cuddle Party is just the way to teach people how to draw boundaries for themselves while recognizing boundaries in others .
Again , this is not the dry workshop or lesson you might be expecting , but it is a weird and wacky thing to do when visiting Toronto .
2. Rage Room
So , you ’ve finally gotten away from the stress and frustration at the office .
You ’ve checked for full - service flights from Montreal to Toronto for that extra bit of pampering no longer seen on most airlines and have found what you were looking for on flyporter.com .
However , do n’t let that soothing flight with air stewards treating you like royalty soothe you too much !
You want to keep some of that pent - up rage you ’ve tried not to direct at that obnoxious co-worker or that demanding boss .
Visit the Rage Room at 26 Ashwarren Road where you will get a chance to redirect that rage at inanimate objects .
One thing you will appreciate is the fact that your ‘ box ’ comes with full protective gear and your choice of weapons .
Looking for a really wacky thing to do on a trip to Toronto ?
This is where you can literally let it all out , no holds barred !
3. The Biblio - Mat
Okay , so if it ’s bizarre you are looking for , this is one experience that will delight you without being overly expensive .
Located at 1229 Dundas St. W , the Biblio - Mat is a vending machine full of vintage books .
Some are rare and others just meet the ‘ vintage ’ classification in that they are from days LONG gone by , but the most fun is when you see the book or books the machine chooses for you .
Oh , did we forget to mention that ?
Unlike your ‘ normal ’ vending machine , you put the $ 2 in and the machine spits out a book of its choice .
Now imagine going to a candy or soda machine only to be given the selection the machine wants you to have ?
As bizarre as this may sound , some books are even more bizarre than not getting to choose which books you want !
One rare 1970 - 71 catalog , the Canadian Tire Fall , actually predicted a woman ’s character and personality traits based on the shape of her breasts .
Now that ’s weird and wacky !
4. The Cineforum
It just keeps getting wackier and wackier !
How would you like to go to the cinema , only to have the movie operator stand there in the theater screaming and yelling at you ?
This is touted as an alternative movie experience and is actually hosted in the living room of the man who runs the movies .
This is situated in a home designed after the Victorian era and the host , Reg Hartt , put together this avantgarde theater back in 1992 .
He asks a ‘ donation ’ of $ 10 for those under the age of 24 and $ 20 for those 25 and older .
All films are considered to be vintage and this is one host who keeps nothing in reserve if you were to ask for a film of a more modern era .
He has been known to verbally abuse and swear at his guests .
Remember , it really all is in good fun , so come prepared to be insulted and do n’t believe you are being singled out .
Well , you are , but all in the spirit of the evening !
5. Imagine Living in Half a House !
Now , this is a weird and wacky site to behold .
This is probably one of Toronto ’s most famous pieces of real estate .
Built back in the 1890s , this house is located on what was once Dummer Street but is now rezoned as 54 ½ St. Patrick Street .
The story of this house is intriguing !
When the row of houses was sold to make way for urbanization and other construction projects , the owner was more stubborn that most .
He refused to sell and so his house , which was much like today ’s duplexes or townhouses , was separated from its neighbor in a very precise manner .
That took some doing but was made possible thanks to a creative demolition where the load - bearing wall that divided the two homes remained intact .
The exterior wall was more decorative than functional , giving the entire building the look of a single unit , and now the remaining half has become an oft - visited curiosity in Toronto .
6. Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library
While not quite as weird and wacky as you might be led to believe , there are some fairly unusual characteristics of this library located on 120 St. George Street .
Have you noticed yet that many of these weird experiences are located on streets named for saints ?
Maybe their ghosts inhabit these neighborhoods and that might be just what you ’d expect when walking into a library that is home to an original Egyptian papyrus manuscript or some of Charles Darwin ’s annotated proofs .
What about Shakespeare ’s First Folio dated 1623 and other books which can be handled by visitors ?
Reviewers of this library state that the ceiling to floor bookshelves in rooms of exposed floors are eerie enough to put you in a mindset of a Grimm ’s Fairy Tale !
If you thought the 1623 Shakespeare was old , that ancient Egyptian papyrus dated 245 B.C. is something to behold .
It is n’t just the books that make this a weird and wacky adventure but the whole atmosphere in which the library is situated .
So , there you have six of the wackiest things you could hope to experience in Toronto , and if you are n’t excited to visit any one of these , then perhaps those flights from Montreal to Toronto should have landed in the Bermuda Triangle !
Why go on a holiday or a business trip to a city where all you do is enjoy the very same sights and dining experiences you do back home ?
It ’s time for a little excitement in your life , so if you have n’t got it in you to throw your laptop at the boss or cuddle up to a perfect stranger , this is the city you ‘ should ’ be visiting .
Take time out to do something weird and wacky today to face all those mundane and totally boring tomorrows .
You ’ll be so glad you did !
Watching the world markets in recent weeks has taken on a repellent paradox of Seinfeldian proportions :
It disgusts us , yet we can not look away .
It 's also prompted a question that goes beyond mere economics :
How did we become so dissociated from where our money was going and what it was doing ?
To the atheist , the public - market underpinning of the global economy may well have come to resemble the medieval - era church in England : tithes extracted from the masses to run a bloated , corrupt institution that was , by design , entirely opaque , and demanded blind faith – lest ye be damned .
And this dissociated manipulation is n't limited to those who own stocks .
Almost every consumer gesture any of us makes is intrinsically tied to the public markets , from pumping gas to buying groceries to surfing the Web to watching TV to using your cellphone to bargain - hunting at Wal - Mart to reading this newspaper .
Corporations , most of them publicly traded , own all of those things , making your everyday routine – whoever you are and whatever you do – deeply linked to a monolithic structure in which we 're all entangled , and so few of us understand .
Douglas Rushkoff calls the market the dominant socio-economic feature of our times .
Rushkoff , an author , cultural critic , and all - purpose soothsayer , is a long - standing critic of a value system – corporatism , he calls it – that 's so pervasive now that few of us are even consciously aware of it .
" Our ability to create meaning , and create value , has all been surrendered to one kind of central corporation or another , " Rushkoff says .
And in that surrender , he argues , is a devaluation of what should be our priority : human - scale interaction , from the commercial to the personal , that connects us to community and ( imagine ) other people .
In his forthcoming book , Life , Incorporated , Rushkoff parses the unsettling evolution of humanity into corporatism 's embrace .
The term , not inadvertently , is a borrowed phrase from Benito Mussolini 's rigidly applied fascist model of pre-World War II Italy .
Except that in the world of the free market , it 's massive companies , not governments , that dictate a numbing sameness to society .
" People believe they have to outsource their savings and investments to these massive centralized investment banking bureaucracies , " he says .
" Is it any wonder why so many of us feel so disconnected ? "
Rushkoff 's complaint echoes the critique of our emerging monoculture put forth by George W.S. Trow in his 1981 book Within the Context of No Context .
Trow , writing about the apex ( to that point ) of the television industry , lamented what he described as TV 's ability to destroy local context .
TV , he argued , gave central corporate authorities – in his day , networks such as ABC , NBC and CBS – the ability to dictate culture across the breadth of the country , thus erasing the local culture that gave people and places the distinct variations in expression and experience that were so vital to society .
He likened the new cultural landscape to a grid – an apportioned , invariable expanse on which this central culture was projected , flattening the textures and nuances of individuality and place .
Sound familiar ?
It should .
Most of us funnel our money , either through the stock market or simply through what we buy , to distant , publicly traded conglomerates .
For Peter Victor , an economist at York University , the shuddering market system should be a wake - up call to the costs of such a disconnect .
" Financial institutions have proven to be opaque to 99.9 per cent of the population – including many of those who felt they understood them , " Victor says .
" The way forward is to rethink the institutional structure of our society to be supportive of what 's really important to us . "
In an economic climate that has charted record growth in recent years , it 's become easy to forget what that actually might be .
Hard times are a potent reminder .
" You do n't have to scratch very hard to find out what really matters to people are their relationships – their friends and family , " Victor says .
" I 'm talking about setting our sights on something more important than the rat race . "
Victor is the author of a forthcoming book , Managing Without Growth : Slower by Design , Not Disaster .
In it , he argues that the relentless pursuit of rapid growth has served to obscure significant personal , human - scale concerns .
Moreover , it 's a relatively recent – and stock - market driven – phenomenon .
" Until you had something like the ( public ) market , which you could say was identifiable as something separate from society , there was no `economy . '
There was just life , " Victor says .
" The situation right now is , unless a corporation can show growth consistently , they 're seen as failures , " Victor says .
" I 'm talking about setting our sights on something more important .
We have to be clear in thinking what our real goals are . "
For both Victor and Rushkoff , the major market shudders are n't just grim , they 're a ripe moment brimming with opportunity .
How so ?
As the well - known aphorism goes , it 's simple – it 's just not easy .
Rushkoff suggests a type of socio- economic locovorism : buy close , invest in community , and know where your money is going .
" If the so - called global economic collapse succeeds , we 'll return to local currency , to credit unions , " he says .
He describes a market correction in which we buy things made in our towns from people whose businesses are rooted there .
He calls it " a social economy . "
" It 's real simple , " Rushkoff says .
" A guy in my town is trying to expand his restaurant .
And he 's selling what we 're now calling `comfort dollars : '
If you give him $ 1,000 , he 'll give you $ 1,200 worth of food at his restaurant .
He gets money cheaper than a bank would give it to him , I 'm investing in my town – at 20 per cent return , thank you very much – and I 'm out of the cycle .
To me , that makes a lot more sense that buying shares in DuPont .
How does that improve my quality of life ? "
If only it were so easy .
This month , the $ 700 billion U.S. bailout of the status quo was set to swell by as much as $ 540 billion .
World markets shuddered and groaned , and crept upward once again .
For Victor , that fluctuation is the wrong measure .
If we can abandon the disembodied goal of high - speed growth and inflated public markets , and focus on steady , slow growth , " We can have a better life , " Victor says .
" We can be well - educated , well - housed and well - fed .
But if we fall back into thinking that a better life is defined by how much we buy , then we 're sunk . "
BP And Shell Dump Plans For Renewables
In The UK Due To The U.S. Governments ’
Tax Rebates And President - Elect Barack Obama
Delivering quite a blow to both Gordon Brown and Britain , BP has dumped its plans to build out wind farms and other renewable projects in Britain for projects in the United States .
The US government incentives for clean energy projects provide convenient tax shelter for oil and gas revenues – something BP is looking for with an estimated $ 8 billion earmarked for the initiative .
[ social_buttons ]
Convenience is another factor .
BP , which has a representative on the ruling board of the British Wind Energy Association , said difficulty in getting planning permission and lower economies of scale made the UK wind sector far less attractive than that of the US .
>> More on wind energy in Europe
“ The best place to get a strong rate of return for wind is the US , ” said a BP spokesman who confirmed the group would not bid for any offshore licenses .
Gordon Brown has promised to end impediments like this to ensure that Britain is a leader in the green energy revolution .
But Shell has also pulled out of investing in Britain , noting similar difficulties .
Both BP and Shell could have heavily influenced other investors : Fail !
Another reason for pulling the plug – Barack Obama .
Shell noted that his promise to spend $ 150 billion over 10 years to kick start a renewable energy revolution is very appealing .
BP said about $ 1.5 billion would be spent next year on US wind projects and the company expected to spend the rest of the $ 8 billion up to the year 2015 .
The company is proceeding with some solar and biofuels projects , but they are mostly concentrating on wind .
BP expects to have one gigawatt of US wind power installed by 2008 and to have trebled that amount by 2010 .
“ The offshore wind market is evolving and getting stronger .
Different investors will come and go at different stages of the development cycle .
But whoever the players are , we know that the offshore industry will be generating massive amounts of electricity for the UK market in the next few years , ” said a BWEA spokesman .
Sounds like someone ’s grapes are sour .
Do n’t take it personally Britain .
BP is also pulling out of China , India and Turkey — they just like us more .

Astronautsand , Mission Specialists on the STS - 126 space shuttle Endeavor mission , embarked on their first of four planned spacewalks on Tuesday , November 18 , after spending the night in the Quest airlock with its lower air pressure .
Their objective was to clean and lubricate a stubborn hinge on the Space Station .
In the process , lead spacewalker Stefanyshyn - Piper lost a crucial bag of tools .
Mission Specialist Heidemarie , a Captain in the U.S. Navy , was cleaning up a grease gun explosion in one of her equipment bags when a tool bag , about the size of a briefcase , became untethered from a larger bag and floated away .
The accident happened midway through the first 7 hour trek outside the Space Shuttle Endeavor .
She completed her portion of the cleaning and lubing activities by sharing tools with partner Bowen , a U.S. Navy Submariner on his first space flight .
At the completion of the first spacewalk , Stefanyshyn - Piper said , " Despite my little hiccup , or major hiccup , I think we did a good job out there . "
The Minnesotan flew her first shuttle mission in September 2006 .
At that time she carried out two spacewalks totaling 12 hours .
Flight STS - 126 transported a reusable logistics module that will hold supplies and equipment , including additional crew quarters , a second treadmill , equipment for the regenerative life support system and spare hardware .
Check out the floating tool purse below , as seen through the helmet camera of Astonaut Heidimarie Stefanyshyn - Piper .
One can only imagine what she might have been uttering under her breath at this point .
AUSTIN , Minn . —
The economy is in tatters and , for millions of people , the future is uncertain .
But for some employees at the Hormel Foods Corporation plant here , times have never been better .
They are working at a furious pace and piling up all the overtime they want .
The workers make Spam , perhaps the emblematic hard - times food in the American pantry .
Through war and recession , Americans have turned to the glistening canned product from Hormel as a way to save money while still putting something that resembles meat on the table .
Now , in a sign of the times , it is happening again , and Hormel is cranking out as much Spam as its workers can produce .
In a factory that abuts Interstate 90 , two shifts of workers have been making Spam seven days a week since July , and they have been told that the relentless work schedule will continue indefinitely .
Spam , a gelatinous 12 - ounce rectangle of spiced ham and pork , may be among the world ’s most maligned foods , dismissed as inedible by food elites and skewered by comedians who have offered smart - alecky theories on its name ( one G- rated example : Something Posing As Meat ) .
I ’m kind of tired , so do n’t expect this post to be entirely coherent .
I just wanted to write a little bit about the project I started recently , called Udon .
The idea came to me as the common ground between several problems I have seen recently .
I will not go into the intricate details of why I consider them problems worth addressing .
They are :
The namespace problem on Hackage , CPAN , and related module collections .
Specifically , ridding ourselves of the rigid , arbitrary taxonomy of packages without the root namespace getting uselessly polluted .
The fact that no popular DVCS allows moving files between projects while preserving history in a sane way .
The desire for a purely functional operating system .
Incidentally , these are programming culture problems # 2 , #3 , and # 4 on my list ( # 1 is , of course , FRP ) .
I ’m glad I took a break from FRP so I could see this common ground .
Udon stands for “ Universal Distributed Object Notation ” , with a tip o’ the hat to JSON .
And yes , it is a system for serializing objects .
It is a gigantic distributed store for inter-referential stateless objects , and would support a huge distributed data structure with no single computer containing all of it .
I ’ll get to the implementation details in a minute .
I ’ll first address how it helps to solve the problems above .
It will help in the implementation of a DVCS that does support moving files between projects , by more or less eliminating the idea of a project .
The versioning is all in commit objects , which refer to changes in some tree data structure ( representing the directory tree of the project ) .
This is how git works .
The difference is that there is no restriction about what tree this is ; it could be a tree “ from another project ” .
Just picture how you would write git as pure Haskell , never having to touch the filesystem or anything , everything being objects in memory .
This DVCS , or something similar , helps to solve the namespace problem .
A project could refer to the modules it uses by identity rather than name .
So instead of the cabal file saying I depend on “ binary ” , the cabal file ( well , data structure in the new model ) would say I depend on “ that thing over there ” , and then import the modules from that package using an advanced import mechanism , which allows renaming or qualifying modules , etc. to avoid collisions .
After conceiving the idea , I realized that it is essentially the filesystem for a typed , purely functional operating system , which is another one of my fancies .
Okay , that ’s probably more than enough vagueness for you math types .
The implementation is based on a flawed concept ; the same flawed concept that all the DVCSes use , that the hash of an object is a unique identifier for that object .
Basically we pretend that hash collisions do n’t exist .
Yuck .
But I could not think of any other way to do it .
( This may be the thing that prevents me from going very far with this project , since I am getting in the habit of proving my code correct , and I will never be able to do that with this code since it is not correct ) .
There is a special type called ExtRef .
ExtRef a is semantically just a value of type a .
The kicker is that it might be on someone else ’s machine , on your usb drive , or even lost forever because nobody kept its data around .
It is represented as data ExtRef a = ExtRef Hash ( Maybe a ) .
Hash is the “ unique identifier ” for the object , and you always have that .
You might have an actual copy of the object too , but if not , the Hash is there so you can find it if you need it .
This representation , and the whole Hashing idea , is hidden from the high - level interface , of course .
You work with ExtRef s through the External monad .
It ’s a coroutine monad ( free monad over i × ( o -> • ) ) which reports which ExtRefs need their associated objects to continue the computation .
The low - level interface will allow implementation of a variety of ways to handle this .
The simplest one is a local store of objects to be queried .
As things get more mature , that could be expanded into one that looks at various remote network stores ( based on some origin map or something ) , or asks the user where to look , etc .
And my hope is that the little Udon framework I ’ve described here will be sufficient to model the DVCS and the hackage package system as if everything were just pure data structures in memory .
Of course it wo n’t be quite as convenient ( you need to annotate your data structures with some ExtRefs at least ) , but it would at least encourage pure modeling of these “ real world ” systems .
Forget Banksy !
The title of World 's Most Badass Artist belongs to a Belgian conceptual artist named Wim Delvoye .
Wim 's quite famous for his unconventional art , many of which seem innocuous at a glance but contains something unexpected upon closer inspection .
Others , like Cloaca and the gothic heavy machinery laser - cut sculptures shown below are amazing technical tour - de - force pieces .
Whether these art shock you or whether you think that these are art to begin with , there 's no denying that Wim 's work are quite unique !
Here are some of the most intriguing art of Wim Delvoye :
Cloaca , the Poo Machine
Cloaca is probably Wim Delvoye 's most famous art installation .
In 2000 , he put together a complex machinery at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp , Belgium .
The machine 's sole job is to simulate " digestion " and produce poo .
Yep , you read that right .
Wim 's Cloaca machine ( cloaca is a zoological term for the posterior opening of animals ) was fed meals twice a day .
Then , viewers can follow the food as it makes its way through a series of glass containers ( in the original set up as shown above ) , which represent the various stages of digestion .
At the end of the tract , the machine produces feces , which are then vacuum - packed and sold in translucent boxes :
Cloaca has its own website , where you can find out more about the art project : Link | More on Cloaca at Wim's website ( do n't miss the Super Cloaca ! )
Mosaic
Continuing in his obsession with poo , here are Wim 's 1990 art exhibit , titled Mosaic .
The artwork consists of the complex arrangement of printed ceramic tiles into symmetrical and very ornate patterns .
Only after a closer inspection would the viewers realize that on each tile are two images of the Wim 's own turd !
Marble Floors
Again with the what - is - it - really - made - from angle , here 's Wim 's artwork Marble Floors at the Olga Korper Gallery .
If you look closely , the floor is made with ... salami slices !
( Actually , just printed pictures of salami - it 'll be gross in just a few days if he had made it from real sliced meats )

Anal Kisses
Here 's a classic
Wim art piece : with just a lipstick and a bunch of hotel stationery , Wim could probably fill an art and / or psychology student 's master thesis with crazy thinking about Freud , his mother , and other mumbo jumbo .
Why ?
Well , suffice it to say that those , erhm , are n't his lip prints ...

Wim is a vegetarian , but he has a pig / art farm outside of Beijing in China .
He 's not thinking of bacon , however - Wim has other plans for his swine : he tattoos them !
( He said that the pigs have better , longer lives than those raised for food ) .
Here 's the YouTube clip of Wim tattooing pigs :
Some of his most famous tattooed pigs :
That 's Louis , the pig tattooed with ... you guessed it , Louis Vuitton logos !

Hey , online gamers , artificial intelligence researchers need your help !
As part of an international team of researchers , Northwestern University has officially released the first online game in which human players partner with artificial intelligence ( AI ) software –- in this case with the goal of solving a treasure hunt in a virtual world .
The 3D online game , called " GIVE : Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments , " is designed to help computers use language more like people do .
Would - be gamers are invited to visit give - challenge.org , where they will team up with one of four AI software systems .
Players have from now until January to play the game and provide feedback on how well the systems give instructions for solving the treasure hunt puzzle .
" By collecting information from everyday computer users from around the world , we will be able to improve language processing for different kinds of intelligent agents , " says Justine Cassell , director of Northwestern University 's Center for Technology and Social Behavior and professor of communication studies and computer science .
The feedback from gamers will be analyzed by the game developers to compare how well each of the four AI systems did in the GIVE challenge , with the goal of making computers better partners in a variety of both virtual and real world tasks .
" The information we get will help to build better pedestrian navigation systems , develop more realistic dialogue for virtual humans in immersive virtual worlds , and eventually improve interaction with mobile robots , " says Northwestern 's Cassell , who with researchers from the United States , United Kingdom , Australia and Germany , organized the GIVE challenge .
Although computers are getting better at some language - based tasks , such as Web search , they still have difficulty holding a conversation with a person in real time .
Following in the footsteps of dialogue agents like NUMACK -- a purple virtual human that Cassell developed to give directions around the Northwestern campus -- the GIVE game will allow AI researchers to learn how computers can generate effective direction - giving commands .
GIVE is a challenge problem for AI software , and the virtual partners that are contestants in the GIVE challenge are state - of - the - art natural language generation ( NLG ) systems that have been created by research teams from the US and Europe .
The GIVE Challenge is the largest initiative ever designed to evaluate natural language generation systems , and marks the first time that NLG research has been made available for public evaluation .
GIVE provides gamers a unique opportunity to explore and improve the current state of the art in artificial intelligence .
GIVE is the first online game in which your partner in the game is the AI software itself .
The challenge adds to a growing movement among AI researchers that allows Internet users to participate in the development and assessment of intelligent software .
Some online games , including Cyc , 20 Questions and The Restaurant Game , entice online players to make the game smarter by contributing to its store of facts or common sense .
The ESP game -- in which players team up to teach the AI software how to solve a difficult problem -- aims for long - term benefits but does not allow the players to interact with any AI software directly .
As an open challenge problem , GIVE is similar in spirit to the well - known RoboCup initiative , in which researchers are challenged to build teams of soccer - playing robots .
Anyone interested can play the game at www.give-challenge.org from now until late January 2009 .

Recent efforts to get more black and Hispanic students into New York City ’s elite public high schools have fallen short , with proportionately fewer of them taking the admissions exam and even lower percentages passing it .
The performance gap persists even among students involved in the city ’s intensive 16 - month test prep institute , designed to diversify the so - called specialized high schools , including the storied triumvirate of Stuyvesant , Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech .
Among the 21,490 public school students who last year took the exam , the single gateway to eight high schools , 6 percent of blacks and 7 percent of Hispanics were offered admission , compared with 35 percent of Asians and 31 percent of white students .
The disparities were the worst at Stuyvesant , where 2 percent of blacks , 3 percent of Hispanics , 24 percent of whites and 72 percent of Asians were accepted .
( Over all , 1 in 5 test - takers is offered a spot ; racial data is not available on private school students . )
Parents of black and Hispanic students have long complained about the lack of diversity in the elite schools ’ enrollment , and the Department of Education promised two years ago to study whether the demographic lopsidedness was the result of certain groups ’ doing poorly on the grueling two - and - a - half - hour test , not taking the exam in high numbers , or simply choosing not to attend the schools .
The city abandoned that effort , but an analysis by The New York Times shows that not only do blacks and Hispanics lag behind whites and Asians in succeeding on the exam , they are far less likely to take it .
Perhaps most surprising is a close look at the students enrolled in the city ’s Specialized High Schools Institute , created 14 years ago to prepare students for high school and recently expanded by Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein .
Black and Hispanic students who attend the institute are more likely to succeed on the test .
While 90 percent of Asians and 85 percent of white students at the institute take the test , 65 percent of blacks and 70 percent of Hispanics do ; last year , of the institute graduates taking the test , 58 percent of the Asians , 49 percent of whites , 21 percent of Hispanics and 19 percent of blacks were offered admission .
( CNN ) -- People along the Texas coast were leaving home or planning to evacuate Thursday as Hurricane Ike churned toward them , slowly intensifying on its march west .
Forecasters say the storm could slam into the Texas coast -- south of Galveston -- as a powerful Category 3 storm late Friday or early Saturday .
Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were planned or underway in at least seven coastal counties .
Aransas County , on the eastern coast of Texas , has ordered a mandatory evacuation of all nonessential government employees , becoming the latest county in the state to urge residents to flee .
In Galveston , city officials ordered mandatory evacuations for part of the island town beginning at 7 a.m. Thursday .
The rest of the town will be under a voluntary evacuation order .
Only residents will be required to evacuate on the western end of the island .
Mayor Lyda Ann
Thomas defended that , saying current models call for Galveston to be hit with winds and rain only equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane .
" We do not intend to evacuate Galveston Island , " she said .
" It 's the last thing we want to do .
Our job is to protect lives and property , [ and ] right now we feel that sheltering in place is the best action for our citizens to take . "
Farther up the Gulf Coast and closer to where the National Hurricane Center predicts a direct hit , Brazoria County ordered a mandatory evacuation to begin at 8 a.m. Thursday .
Some other Texas localities have ordered mandatory evacuations , while others have left the decision to depart up to residents .
As of 5 a.m. ET Thursday , the Category 2 storm -- with top sustained winds near 100 mph -- was about 620 miles east of Brownsville , Texas , and about 285 miles southeast of the Mississippi River , the hurricane center said .
Track the storm »
Hurricane - force winds extended out up to 115 miles from the storm 's center , and tropical storm - force winds extended out up to 255 miles forecasters reported .
About 15,000 residents were leaving Galveston 's Brazoria County Wednesday after a mandatory evacuation order was issued at 10 a.m. CT ( 11 a.m. ET ) governing one ZIP code -- 77541 -- and residents throughout the county with special needs .
Galveston City Manager Steve LeBlanc issued a warning to residents of the city 's West End , citing forecasters ' estimates that the area could get tides of 6 feet above normal if the storm arrives there .
The West End is the area of Galveston most susceptible to flooding , LeBlanc said .
Other Brazoria residents were being allowed to remain as of 6 p.m. ET .
In Matagorda County , southwest of Galveston , officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for all areas except the cities of Bay City and Van Vleck .
The evacuation must be completed by at 6 p.m. ( 7 p.m. ET ) Thursday .
Galveston is likely to experience a high tidal surge , officials said , urging people living in low - lying areas or mobile homes to get out soon .
" One of the things that the public has to understand if they decide to stay , there will be a period of time during this storm when they will absolutely be on their own , " Brazoria County Sheriff Charles Wagner said .
" There will be no medical services ; there will be no fire department ; there will be no law enforcement , groceries , gasoline , drugs , electricity . "
The center issued a tropical storm warning from the Mississippi River 's mouth to Cameron , Louisiana , and a hurricane watch from Cameron to Port Mansfield , Texas , about 60 miles south of Brownsville .
Tropical storm warnings mean winds of 39 to 73 mph ( 63 to 118 kmh ) are expected within a day , and a hurricane watch means winds of 74 and higher are expected within 36 hours .
" Hurricane Ike is now in the Gulf of Mexico and making its approach toward our coast , " Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement .
" The next few days will be crucial for residents to follow the direction of local leaders and to take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their families . "
Perry put 7,500 National Guard members on standby this week , his office said , and issued a disaster declaration for 88 counties .
About 1,350 buses , several ambulances and paramedic buses were available to support evacuations .
The vehicles were positioned near Houston , Matagorda County , Nueces County and Victoria County , the governor 's office said .
President Bush declared an emergency in the state , making federal funds available for the state to prepare for the storm .
Corpus Christi officials also began the evacuation process for residents with special needs , supplying buses to transport them out of town .
Voluntary evacuations were issued in San Patricio and Victoria counties and parts of Jackson County , according to the governor 's office .
More than 1,300 inmates from the Texas Correctional Institutions Division 's Stevenson Unit in Cuero were being evacuated to facilities in Beeville and Kenedy , Perry 's office said , and 597 were transferred from the substance abuse Glossbrenner Unit in San Diego , in south Texas , to Dilley .
Naval air stations in Texas also began to prepare for Hurricane Ike 's expected arrival .
Naval Air Station Kingsville was to begin moving about 50 aircraft to El Paso , San Antonio and Fort Worth on Wednesday afternoon , the public affairs office there said .
Naval Air Station Corpus Christi will also move about 75 aircraft to other Texas locations , its public affairs office said .
Evacuations appeared to have saved lives in Cuba when Ike slammed into the island .
Four deaths were reported from the storm , according to the Cuban government .
The Cuban Civil Defense brought buses or trucks to take people to shelters .
See the damage from the storm »
Cuban state television reported that two people were killed when they tried to remove an antenna , The Associated Press said .
One man died when a tree crashed into his home , and a woman died when her home 's roof collapsed , according to the AP .
The storm shredded hundreds of homes and caused some dilapidated buildings in Havana 's older areas to collapse , the AP reported .
Watch as winds and waves pound Cuba »
The United States , which provided $ 100,000 in emergency aid to communist - run Cuba through private aid agencies after Hurricane Gustav hit the island August 30 , said Tuesday that it was considering additional emergency aid for Cuba because of Ike .
Also , the United States said it will lift restrictions on cash and humanitarian assistance sent to Cuba for the next 90 days .
The move will allow nongovernmental organizations to provide assistance and cash donations .
The storm pounded Grand Turk Island in the Turks and Caicos chain , putting a strain on the British territory 's tourism industry .

Making Bay Area friendly for electric cars BAY AREA San Francisco , San Jose , Oakland mayors unite on plan to create a network of charging stations
Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums ( left ) and Mayor Gavin Newsom look at an electric car on Nov. 20 , 2008 in San Francisco , Calif. , after announcing that the Bay Area will build an electric vehicle network with a $ 1 billion private investment in infrastructure and initiatives aimed at making them more affordable .

Bay Area environmental leaders are counting on a $ 1 billion investment to build the nation 's first electric vehicle network - with service stations to recharge batteries and garages to swap depleted batteries for fresh ones - and finally make the gasoline - free cars practical .
The Palo Alto - based company Better Place says its network of electric - vehicle charging stations will cover the Bay Area by 2012 .
In exchange for the investment from Better Place , the mayors of San Francisco , San Jose and Oakland announced plans Thursday to collectively create cohesive regulations for electric vehicles that will apply to cities and counties throughout the region .
In San Francisco , Mayor Gavin Newsom said the city will use tax breaks to promote sales of electric vehicles and encourage homes and businesses to make charging stations widely available .
The city will also look at ways to speed up the permitting process to install charging outlets at homes and businesses .
" We 're going to get serious about advancing our local climate action plans , about getting into the business of alternative transportation , " Newsom said during a news conference at City Hall .
" I do n't believe halfway is good enough .
I 'm a guy driving a hybrid ( vehicle ) and I do n't feel too good about that .
For us to get to the next level , we need unprecedented regional collaboration . "
Better Place has built similar networks in Israel , Denmark and Australia , but the Bay Area infrastructure , which will allow drivers of electric vehicles to make long - distance trips without worrying about finding a place to charge or change a battery , will be the first of its kind in the United States .
San Francisco , San Jose and Oakland will begin implementing their own policies next month , with plans to make electrical outlets for low - voltage vehicles available on all public buildings next year .
Higher - voltage charging equipment also will be made available at city parking lots and curbs - including one plan to put outlets in sidewalk streetlights in San Jose and San Francisco .
In the current economic and political climate , it 's more important than ever that the United States find creative ways to reduce its dependence on foreign oil , said Shai Agassi , founder of the investor - funded Better Place .
" We need to start thinking about this as the next generation of the car .
It 's about time we changed from car 1.0 to car 2.0 , " Agassi said .
" We 're following a model that 's worked in Israel , in Denmark .
We build the infrastructure first .
By 2012 we 'll be ready for a mass market of cars . "
Newsom said he speaks from experience on the current hurdles keeping people from owning electric vehicles .
The mayor is chauffeured in a hybrid SUV most of the time , but two years ago he got on the waiting list for a $ 100,000 electric car from Tesla Motors .
He 's told the car will finally be available next week .
But storage is going to be a problem .
The building managers of his Russian Hill complex do n't yet know how he should pay for the electricity he uses .
" This is the problem , the classic problem , " he said .
" We 're in an apartment building , and everything in the garage is shared in terms of cost .
But then a guy like me comes in , and I pull all this energy , and people say , ' Why am I paying for his electric use ? '
This is the problem .
It 's very complex . "

I do n’t generally agree with Paul Krugman .
Most people in his own profession do n’t generally agree with Paul Krugman , but he has a voice and it ’s loud in the American scene , so I ’ll address it .
He says we just ended “ the monster years “ ; 14 years of monster rule , in fact .
I agree with him there , partially .
Although I think he completely misses the point .
What he fails to address is what caused those monster years .
He fails to address the ( ir ) rationality of the American voter .
The American voter put those monsters in power , the American voter caused the insanity we see everyday in politics .
How can you agree with Krugman and say we ’ve emerged from 14 years of monster rule and not place any blame on those who elected the monsters ?
But now , somehow , they ’ve changed ?
They ’ve learned ?
Today they ’re different and renewed and advanced in their knowledge because they elected someone that you agree with ?
They ’re no longer fools , they no longer are drawn by empty rhetoric and entranced by beautifully crafted catchphrases .
Well , maybe some , but this time they ’re the good catchphrases , right ?
Wrong , just because a “ good guy ” won does n’t mean the system is right .
The system is diseased , do n’t let the warmth of Obama sunshine fool you into thinking the last 14 years did n’t happen , because they did , and they happened because of democracy , not in spite of it .
The American voter is the monster , you ’re the monster , and the monster years will never end .

Faced With a Lawsuit by State Dems , the Republicans Wave White Flag of Surrender ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/8/2008 , 10:00 am PT
Last Friday , we told you about the bogus challenges --- 6,000 of them --- made by the Montana GOP against voters in six Democratic - leaning counties in the state , based solely on the fact that the voters had filed change of address forms with the U.S. Postal Service within the last 18 months .
The GOP claimed , with a straight face , they were fighting " voter fraud " , even though there was indications of no such fraud , and the result was little more than chaos at the election offices , just 30 days out from a major election .
One of the GOP 's challenged voters turned out to be an Army Reservist who would be unable to verify his authenticity --- and thus would lose his right to vote under the challenge --- since he was in New Jersey , about to ship out for his second tour of duty in Iraq .
Well , we 've got some good news on this story , for a welcome change ...
On Monday , the state Democratic Party fought back , and announced a lawsuit against the Republicans , to stop the challenges on the basis that they were brought by the GOP only to intimidate voters and suppress turnout :
The suit alleges that [ Republican Sec. of State Brad ]
Johnson ’s office did n’t follow federal law in handling the challenges .
As a result , voters in Hill County , for instance , are being treated differently than voters in other counties , which is illegal , the suit alleges .
State Republicans also targeted voters who tend to vote Democratic , which is also illegal , the suit says .
AP 's coverage of Monday 's suit notes that " Attorneys from the Obama campaign assisted the Montana Democratic Party in crafting the lawsuit " ( we 're happy to see them step up for a change ! ) and that " State Republican Party spokesman Bridger Pierce said more challenges were planned in coming days . "
But it looks like Pierce and the Republicans have decided to cut and run , instead .
Yesterday , we 're happy to announce , faced with a party actually willing to push back by taking them to court , the Montana GOP " waved the white flag of surrender " and backed off their phony challenges , according to AP :
In a letter sent to election officials in seven counties today ( Tuesday ) , Montana Republican Party executive director Jacob Eaton said he was withdrawing the challenges and would be issuing no more .
We 'll hope the Dems do not drop their lawsuit , however , since much of the damage has been done already , whether the democracy - hating Republicans withdraw their challenges or not .
Either way , this one has a happy - ish ending .
For the moment .
Due to studies suggesting vegetarians have stronger immune systems and are 40 % less likely to get cancer , as well as recent outbreaks of E.coli traced to a Vermont slaughterhouse , PETA is urging Blue Cross of Vermont to lower insurance rates for vegetarians , while increasing those for meat eaters .
To make the point , PETA ’s Executive Director Tracy Reiman sent a letter to Bill Milnes Jr. , president of Blue Cross Blue Shield Of Vermont .

“ Given the latest news about the effects of E.coli on meat - eaters — and the mountain of evidence linking meat consumption to some of our nation ’s deadliest diseases — this change will benefit Blue Cross Blue Shield ’s bottom line while also helping to ensure that your policyholders do n’t flat line , ” Reiman wrote .
“ By giving your policyholders a financial incentive to go vegetarian – and penalizing those whose meat - based diets fuel our nation ’s worst health problems – Blue Cross Blue Shield can save millions of dollars in the long run as your members begin to require fewer cholesterol - lowering medications , chemotherapy treatments , and diabetes drugs , ” the letter concluded .
But according to Kevin Goddard , vice president of external affairs for Blue Cross , it does n’t appear they ’ll be taking PETA ’s suggestion any time soon .
“ Under Vermont law , we would not be allowed to vary rates based on the dietary and nutritional habits of various members . ” he said .
Along with a “ guaranteed issue ” law that requires insurers to offer coverage for all persons in the state , the Vermont Department of Banking , Insurance , Securities and Health Care Administration web site also lists a “ community rating , ” which stops the companies from making a person pay more for their coverage because of age , location or health condition .

Bruce Wayne has fought crime in the comics since 1939 Warning :
If you do not want to know about the plot of Batman RIP , stop reading now .
Batman 's alter ego Bruce Wayne has apparently been killed off in the latest issue of the superhero comic .
Scottish writer Grant Morrison revealed earlier this year that Wayne would either retire or be killed in a clash with crime syndicate Black Glove .
The story - Batman RIP - sees Batman shot by villain Simon Hurt , who claims to be Wayne 's father Dr Thomas Wayne .
Morrison told BBC
News there would be " a lot more twists and turns to come " before the story was finally resolved .
' Definitive story ' " It 's great that it stirs up such passion , " he said .
" Nobody loves Bruce Wayne more than me , and I hope everybody understands that this is part of the great ongoing adventure of Batman . "
The caped crusader first appeared in comics in 1939 , and has spawned a 1960s TV series and a host of films .
The " death " of Wayne 's father - shot alongside his mother by a robber when he was a boy - was the catalyst for the young industrialist to become the vigilante crime fighter Batman .
In the final scene , Hurt tries to escape in a helicopter after shooting Batman .
But the wounded superhero throws himself at the helicopter , causing it to crash .
The comic story ends without a frame showing Wayne 's body , however .
Bruce Wayne has fought crime in the comics since 1939 Morrison , from Glasgow , told BBC News on Friday that the next two issues of the Batman comic would see a " summing up " of the superhero 's career before " the absolute , final fate " of Bruce Wayne was revealed in a sister publication , Final Crisis , in January .
" It 's the end of a story that goes back to 2005 , a story to tell the definitive story of Batman , " he explained .
" We wanted to see what would happen if the most evil , richest people in the world decided they did n't like Batman , and decided to take him apart piece by piece and destroy him .
" And then have Batman come back , and we could see why he's so great , " added Morrison .
The storyline included clues which dated back to Batman comics from 40 years ago , he added .
Wayne may be dead , but publisher DC Comics shows no sign of bringing to an end the Batman franchise .
Frontrunners to take over as Batman include Tim Drake , who has been Robin since 1991 , and Dick Grayson - the original Boy Wonder - who now protects Gotham City as Nightwing .
It is not the first time a superhero has met an unfortunate end in the comic world .
Last year , Captain America was killed after being shot by a sniper in New York .

10 . Gilles de Rais
GNU
The Sadistic Aristocrat
Despite a staggering 80 to 600 body count , the man regarded by many as the prototype of today ’s serial killer barely cracks the top 10 .
This is because historical records are unreliable and Gilles de Rais ’ murderous statistics cannot be proven .
De Rais was a wealthy and powerful 15th century French nobleman who once fought side by side with Joan of Arc.
De Rais had a sick obsession with young boys and preferred victims who resembled himself as a child .
The Sadistic Aristocrat , as he came to be known , lured blond - haired , blue - eyed peasant boys to his stately home where he and a few assumed accomplices raped , tortured and mutilated them .
In 1440 , the ecclesiastical court in Nantes hanged the monster before torching his body — just to be on the safe sideDe Rais would sit on the stomach of his dying victim and pleasure himself .
Using a gene from a snapdragon flower , researchers have created a purple tomato rich in antioxidants , and a new study has shown that cancer - prone mice that were fed the altered tomatoes had significantly longer lifespans than those that dined on regular tomatoes .
The tomatoes ' purple hue was a side effect of the type of antioxidants produced , called anthocyanins .
The tomatoes produce levels of anthocyanins about on par with blackberries , blueberries and currants , which recent research has touted as miracle fruits .
But because of the high cost and infrequent availability of such berries , tomatoes might be a better source , says [ lead researcher Cathie ] Martin
[ USA Today ] .
In the study , published in Nature Biotechnology [ subscription required ] , researchers used genetically engineered mice that typically develop a variety of cancers at a young age , and live an average of 142 days .
A diet that included powder from the modified purple tomatoes
extended the life span of these mice to an average 182.2 days ; some mice lived up to 260 days .
Regular tomatoes had no affect on the average life span [ Ars Technica ] .
Professor Martin said : " This is one of the first examples of metabolic engineering that offers the potential to promote health through diet by reducing the impact of chronic disease .
And certainly the first example of a GMO [ genetically modified organism ] with a trait that really offers a potential benefit for all consumers " [ BBC News ] .
However , she stressed that the tomatoes ' beneficial effects must still be proven in humans ; if that is determined , it would still take years for the new and improved tomatoes to make it through the regulatory process and onto supermarket shelves .

Arming the Left : Is the time now ?
By Charles Southwell *
I hope you did n't open this page to read what we already know : that this is the most rightwing government we have ever had in the US , even far right of Bush I , that our rights are being eroded daily , and that our democratic process is all but gone , if it is n't already gone .
I hope you came here to read about tactics for action that will finally have some consequence .
I hope you agree that our protests , petitions , letters , and on and on , have been utterly ignored .
The fascistas that run our country laugh at us .
They believe they can do anything and that we have n't got the guts to revolt , but only to wage a war of words .
I have seen the Bush cavalcades , as they drive away , his aids sneering and jeering and laughing and mocking our protests .
They think we are a JOKE .
Tens of millions of Americans protested the war , but because we posed no REAL THREAT to their power , we were UTTERLY IGNORED .
As long as we pose no REAL threat to the powers - that - be , to what is shaping up into a dictatorship , we will continue to be ignored .
Right now , we are ignored because we present no organized power to fight this onslaught of anti-democratic , totalitarian government that we are up against .
It will take time , but it 's time to get more left - leaning liberals and outright leftists to at least POSE a threat , by getting organized and getting ARMED .
It 's time to get well past this liberal phobia and taboo about weapons and force .
After all , our liberalism was won with a REVOLUTIONARY WAR !
they used real guns in that war .
The French Revolution was also a WAR and they used real weapons there too .
Perhaps people believe that since the US federal government has the fire power to blow up the world X times over , that we have no chance , and that the 2nd amendment is therefore moot .
I used to think the same thing .
In fact , this was the major if not the only lasting upshot of the Cold War !
the Cold war was n't about one opposing ideology against the other ; it was n't about the East vs. the West .
In the end , it was about the respective governments against their own peoples .
The Cold War resulted in the repression of the peoples in those countries , and likewise , of peoples around the world .
But , it is still a myth that the US citizens are powerless against their government , a government that has become tyrannical and has usurped our democratic rights .
We are not powerless against it .
If we get organized and armed , and form a force of hundreds of thousands , we can overcome this government , or pose enough of a threat to have power .
The government cannot drop a nuclear bomb on DC .
It can not risk the lives of whole cities , without revealing its own contradictions that is .
Further , there is no guarantee that the military will remain loyal to a government that continually reveals itself as imperialistic and ruthless and having no real concern for its own personnel .
The Iraqi occupation is teaching many of them that hard lesson .
They are realizing that not Hussein , but the Bush regime , is their real enemy .
So I ask you , is n't it time that left - leaning liberals and leftists exercised their 2nd amendment rights and got organized and prepared ?
Is n't it time , before it 's too late ?
Is n't it time , before another Bush coup and the following four years of increased repression and economic ruin ?
We should remain committed to the absolute condemnation of individual acts of violence or terrorism .
Read Trotsky 's essay on terrorism , in the political education section of this website .
Our reference to Trotsky does not mean that we are Marxists .
I am merely referring to a good argument for any real revolutionaries against terrorism .
We want a democratic government , which is not predicated on a Marxist state .
In fact , we leave that to the future of the new movement for democracy , given that the future should be democratic and in a democracy , the people will decide .
But , our goal is to make a future wherein the people CAN and WILL decide !!!!!!

Japanese scientists cloned mice that had been frozen 16 years and whose cells had burst , according to Reuters .
Since the mice were not particularly well preserved , the researchers say their nuclear transfer techniques " could be used to ' resurrect ' animals " such as mammoths .
Researchers have been aiming for this breakthrough for years .
Parallel efforts in recent years have led to decoding the genetics of the extinct cave bear and a partial decoding of the mammoth genome .
" Our discovery means that recreating extinct hybrid animals is theoretically possible , " researchers said when that breakthrough came in 2005 .
In northern Siberia , researchers are attempting to create Pleistocene Park by restoring a large area of wetlands and forest to the dry landscape that existed more than 10,000 years ago .
They are re-introducing herbivores and predators they think will alter the biology and ecology of the region to its previous state .
How far back might resurrection go ?

Meggy Jr RGB is a new kit that we designed as a platform to develop handheld pixel games .
It ’s based around a fully addressable 8×8 RGB LED matrix display , and features six big fat buttons for comfy game play .
The kit is driven by an ATmega168 microcontroller , and you can write your own games or otherwise control it through the Arduino development environment .
Meggy
Jr is fast , programmable , open source and hackable .
And fun .
A unique feature of Meggy Jr RGB is that it is designed to be mounted inside a “ handle set ” — a wooden or plastic case that ’s safer and more pleasant to hold than a bare circuit board .
You can make , mod and customize your own handle sets to suit your taste–
These are like faceplates in that you can switch whenever you want to suit your mood or the game that you ’re playing , however different handle sets can radically change what the Meggy Jr looks and feels like .
Above , you can see what our basic handles ( left ) look like , as compared to a set of custom smoke - colored batwing handles ( right ) .
You can design your own custom handles , starting from our templates– either to make them on your own or to have them fabbed by laser shops like Ponoko or Pololu .
( Ponoko in particular offers some veryinteresting materials to make cases out of , like felt and bamboo ! )
You can download the two handle designs shown above as PDF and Inkscape SVG files here ( 780 kB . ZIP file ) .
Each handle design consists of a sandwich of two pieces of material that go above and below the circuit board .
For a perfect fit , fab the front piece ( the carapace ) from 0.24 ″ thick material ( or slightly thinner ) , and the back piece ( the plastron ) from 0.12 ″ ( or so ) thick material .
Above , a sweet custom handle set for Meggy Jr : Transparent blue carapace , transparent red plastron .
The possibilities are … interesting .
The Meggy Jr RGB printed circuit board , fabbed in white with black printing .
A lot of the small components are mounted underneath the LED matrix display– it ’s a big space saver .
The two big chips under there are STP16DP05B1R LED driver chips .
Up above the display are eight extra programmable LEDs that can be used for displaying extra data– like lives , score , ammo , or level .
There ’s also a little buzzer that can make appropriate bleeps buzzes and bloops , and a 16 MHz crystal oscillator .
Beyond the display , buttons , and interfaces , there are some less obvious features on the board .
If you are not using the buttons at a given moment , those six inputs to the chip can be repurposed as analog or digital inputs or as digital outputs , and access points are provided .
Also , the serial port TX and RX lines are not utilized while running the LED matrix , which means that they are available for turning Meggy into an ambient data device , or whatever else might come to mind .
This is an open source hardware project , so you ’re welcome to hack it .
Start by downloading the schematic here ( 64 kB PDF file ) .
You can also download the circuit board design here ( 114 kB .ZIP file .
The circuit board was designed in gEDA PCB — free , open - source printed circuit board software . )
We are releasing the design for this board under open source licenses and under a creative commons license as well .
Meggy Jr RGB is designed to be programmed through the popular Arduino software environment , when you hook it up to your computer with an FTDI USB - TTL cable ( shown above ) .
This is the same programming arrangement that you ’ll find on some of the popular Arduino - compatible boards such as the Boarduino and Bare Bones Boards ( not to mention Peggy 2.0 ) .
And of course , Meggy Jr RGB also supports programming through a regular AVR ISP ( in - system programming ) connection , such as the USBtinyISP .
The first version of the Arduino library for Meggy Jr RGB has been uploaded and is now available as open source project through Google Code .
This library provides fast interrupt - based screen redraw , multiple brightness levels , simple functions to write data to a video buffer , and example programs .
( Additional example programs will be added soon . )
The 8×8 LED matrix is able to produce a pretty good range of colors .
While it ’s probably not suitable for displaying video ( or true colors of any sort , really ) it works extremely well for its intended purpose– displaying brightly colored pixels for games or the display of information .
This would make an excellent computer - controlled status display .
Or disco floor for your Lego minifigures .
Now blast those bits !
Meggy Jr RGB kits are available at the Evil Mad Science Shop .
If you make some interesting mods , we ’d love to see pictures in the Evil Mad Science Auxiliary .

Quicker - melting snow cover will allow forests to encroach on meadows and , ironically , eventually aid in cooling the planet .
Regina Rochefort , a National Park Service science adviser at Mount Rainier , said the meadows surrounding the famous peak have been shrinking because of less snowfall and shorter periods of snow cover .
In the past , the snow has restricted new tree growth with freezing temperatures a limited water supply .[ social_buttons ]
So you ’re probably thinking this is great news — after all , more trees will store more carbon , right ?
But according to a study performed last year , the good news is more so that less snow will mean more water for the trees , which will dramatically increase the forest ’s overall cooling impact .
Trees are not only carbon - sinks , but they also perform two other climate - affecting tasks : they absorb light into their dark leaves — causing a warming effect — and they pull water out of the ground and into the air , creating low clouds that promote cooling .
When the ground is covered with snow , the trees cannot absorb enough water from the ground to significantly impact cooling though evaporation .
In fact , trees in snow - covered areas can often advance global warming rather than slow it down .
So , essentially , the trees on Mount Rainier may now actually be better prepared to fight global warming because of the impacts of climate change itself .
But do n’t think that the damage that caused the snow to melt in the first place will be reversed any time soon merely by trees making more clouds .
If only it were so simple .

Rich governments and corporations are triggering alarm for the poor as they buy up the rights to millions of hectares of agricultural land in developing countries in an effort to secure their own long - term food supplies .
The head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation , Jacques Diouf , has warned that the controversial rise in land deals could create a form of " neo-colonialism " , with poor states producing food for the rich at the expense of their own hungry people .
Rising food prices have already set off a second " scramble for Africa " .
This week , the South Korean firm Daewoo Logistics announced plans to buy a 99 - year lease on a million hectares in Madagascar .
Its aim is to grow 5 m tonnes of corn a year by 2023 , and produce palm oil from a further lease of 120,000 hectares ( 296,000 acres ) , relying on a largely South African workforce .
Production would be mainly earmarked for South Korea , which wants to lessen dependence on imports .
" These deals can be purely commercial ventures on one level , but sitting behind it is often a food security imperative backed by a government , " said Carl Atkin , a consultant at Bidwells Agribusiness , a Cambridge firm helping to arrange some of the big international land deals .
Madagascar 's government said that an environmental impact assessment would have to be carried out before the Daewoo deal could be approved , but it welcomed the investment .
The massive lease is the largest so far in an accelerating number of land deals that have been arranged since the surge in food prices late last year .
" In the context of arable land sales , this is unprecedented , " Atkin said .
" We 're used to seeing 100,000 - hectare sales .
This is more than 10 times as much . "
At a food security summit in Rome , in June , there was agreement to channel more investment and development aid to African farmers to help them respond to higher prices by producing more .
But governments and corporations in some cash - rich but land - poor states , mostly in the Middle East , have opted not to wait for world markets to respond and are trying to guarantee their own long - term access to food by buying up land in poorer countries .
According to diplomats , the Saudi Binladin Group is planning an investment in Indonesia to grow basmati rice , while tens of thousands of hectares in Pakistan have been sold to Abu Dhabi investors .
Arab investors , including the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development , have also bought direct stakes in Sudanese agriculture .
The president of the UEA , Khalifa bin Zayed , has said his country was considering large - scale agricultural projects in Kazakhstan to ensure a stable food supply .
Even China , which has plenty of land but is now getting short of water as it pursues breakneck industrialisation , has begun to explore land deals in south - east Asia .
Laos , meanwhile , has signed away between 2 m - 3 m hectares , or 15 % of its viable farmland .
Libya has secured 250,000 hectares of Ukrainian farmland , and Egypt is believed to want similar access .
Kuwait and Qatar have been chasing deals for prime tracts of Cambodia rice fields .
Eager buyers generally have been welcomed by sellers in developing world governments desperate for capital in a recession .
Madagascar 's land reform minister said revenue would go to infrastructure and development in flood - prone areas .
Sudan is trying to attract investors for almost 900,000 hectares of its land , and the Ethiopian prime minister , Meles Zenawi , has been courting would - be Saudi investors .
" If this was a negotiation between equals , it could be a good thing .
It could bring investment , stable prices and predictability to the market , " said Duncan Green , Oxfam 's head of research .
" But the problem is , [ in ] this scramble for soil I do n't see any place for the small farmers . "
Alex Evans , at the Centre on International Cooperation , at New York University , said : " The small farmers are losing out already .
People without solid title are likely to be turfed off the land . "
Details of land deals have been kept secret so it is unknown whether they have built - in safeguards for local populations .
Steve Wiggins , a rural development expert at the Overseas Development Institute , said : " There are very few economies of scale in most agriculture above the level of family farm because managing [ the ] labour is extremely difficult . "
Investors might also have to contend with hostility .
" If I was a political - risk adviser to [ investors ]
I 'd say ' you are taking a very big risk ' .
Land is an extremely sensitive thing .
This could go horribly wrong if you do n't learn the lessons of history . "
New American presidents traditionally get what journalists and pundits call a honeymoon .
There ’s a period sometimes lasting up to 18 months when whatever goodwill remains from the pomp and circumstance of installing a president evokes deep patriotic feelings , creating an atmosphere in which even some members of the " opposition " party are inclined to cooperate with the new administration .
I suspect that Barack Obama , despite the historic character of his election , will have a shorter honeymoon than many .
The economic problems triggered by the government - induced housing bubble have mostly to do with the injection of too much inflationary funny money into the economy , so injecting more , while it may create a temporary sensation of relief , will hardly fix the problems .
Perhaps more importantly , however , he faces foreign policy challenges  largely hangovers from the eight years of Bush foolishness , but also some that would have been apparent anyway  that he seems to have little or no idea how to approach intelligently or constructively .
The most obvious example is his apparent determination to ramp up the war in Afghanistan , already the graveyard of several empires .
U.S. commanders on the ground estimate that 400,000 troops are needed to prevail ( whatever that means ) , and that is probably an optimistic estimate based on conventional military tactics rather than a realistic understanding of what it takes for foreign occupiers , even with the cooperation of the titular government , to handle an insurgency consisting of people who live there and plan to be around when the occupiers grow weary and leave .
And there is simply no way , logistically , that the U.S. can muster 400,000 troops for Afghanistan , and the Europeans and the Australians , watching as the Afghanistan mission splinters NATO before their eyes , are more inclined to remove themselves than to fortify the mission .
Sending two or three more brigades of 4,000 people apiece may help some commanders on the ground with local , tactical problems , but otherwise it ’s a bit like the gambler who is losing at the tables deciding not to double - down but to place progressively larger bets , none of them sufficient to recoup his losses if he should get lucky and win a hand or two .
From the perspective of Western observers , Afghanistan , with its tribal and local loyalties , has always looked messy and probably always will .
Why is it so difficult to permit it to be the Afghans ’ messy situation ?
Why insist on stirring the pot ?
The Afghan situation , of course , is complicated by the fact that Taliban and other militant forces have sanctuaries in Pakistan , in a part of the country that the government has never effectively ruled .
The new government in Pakistan is still shaky , and U.S. raids into Pakistan , of the kind Obama has endorsed ( even though he might make them less frequent and more specifically targeted ) are likely to discomfit Pakistanis even more and would hardly contribute to making the government , which after all does possess nuclear weapons , more stable .
It would be surprising if developments along the Afghan - Pakistani border did n’t force a new Obama administration to make some difficult choices , between the unsatisfactory and the terrible , fairly early on .
Then there ’s Georgia .
Obama ’s running mate , Joe Biden , has if anything been more aggressive than Cheney in urging that Georgia ’s somewhat artificial independence , hardly a core U.S. interest , be defended at all costs .
With the news that independent military observers are now reasonably sure that Georgia ’s initial attacks on the breakaway province of South Ossetia were hardly a precise and strictly defensive operation but instead involved " indiscriminate artillery and rocket fire , exposing civilians , Russian peacekeepers , and unarmed monitors to harm " has further weakened whatever case there might have been for committing U.S. and other Western forces to defending Georgia .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ’s announcement that Russia plans to install missiles near Poland as a counter to the announced U.S. plan to install anti-missile defense units in Poland and the Czech Republic offers another possible complication that Obama could face early in his tenure .
The sensible thing is to try to reconstitute relatively normal relations with Russia , which even with a reduced price of oil ( which could be temporary ) is a power to be reckoned with .
There are bound to be points of conflict if the U.S. under Obama does n’t move toward strategic disengagement from the world outside the American Northern Hemisphere , but they are unlikely to be entirely unresolvable , unless an emotional commitment to Georgia prevents such commonsense steps .
It seems unlikely that an Obama administration would continue the Bush push to bringing Georgia and Ukraine into the empty shell that NATO has become .
But if tensions in the Caucasus region continue and the new administration is n’t in some kind of direct contact with Russia to determine what ’s worth having a real confrontation over and what is n’t , something resembling a real crisis could ensue .
No matter which direction an Obama administration goes in the region , it is bound to encounter criticism here at home .
Iran , of course , is also likely to prevent challenges .
Obama has said it would be unacceptable for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons , but it is unclear how that could be accomplished if Iran is really determined to get them .
Western European countries will probably give Obama something of a honeymoon , if only because he is n’t Dubya , but Germany and France have extensive commercial relations with Iran and will be reluctant to engage in confrontational activities that could endanger them  not to mention that Russia , unless something is done quickly to re-normalize relations is likely to continue to throw sand in the gears .
And we have n’t even mentioned North Korea yet , where the Bushies may have bollixed an effort to get the " hermit kingdom " to give up pursuing nuclear weapons  and where the possible demise of dictator Kim Jong - Il could throw the country into turmoil , at least until new power relationships are sorted out .
An Obama administration is also likely to come under some pressure from ostensibly humanitarian forces , largely but not solely on the left side of his party , to consider intervention in Darfur , which could easily develop into an open - ended commitment without a clear definition of what would constitute success or a path to achieving it .
Add to all this Israel and Palestine , where the Bush administration effort to get a two - state solution by the end of his term is widely acknowledged to be going almost nowhere .
Obama pledged obeisance to AIPAC , and his chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , volunteered with the Israeli Defense Forces during the first Gulf War , so the United States is not likely to be perceived as anything closer to a neutral arbiter than it was under Bush .
But will there be pressure to " do something , " even if it is unclear that anything constructive can be done ?
Will there be a new conflict between Israel and Hezbollah ?
Will an Obama administration continue to discourage negotiations between Israel and Syria , which have begun without U.S. encouragement and could be the most hopeful recent development in the region ?
And then there ’s Iraq , of course .
Will Obama stick to his 16 - month " timetable , " or will he find reasons to keep a contingent in Iraq longer , or even keep permanent military bases in the region ?
He will face preliminary decisions almost before he has had a chance to get his feet on the ground .
Finally , the world almost always presents new U.S. presidents with surprises few had anticipated .
The 9/11 attacks arguably changed the course of the Bush administrations 180 degrees and gave the neocons a purchase on real power .
Some equally unexpected ( except in the depths of some intelligence agency ) event is likely to confront Obama .
You could argue that Barack Obama deserves a longer honeymoon than most incoming U.S. presidents , for various reasons .
For better or worse , however , he is unlikely to get one .
Bush administration rules that go into effect before Obama takes office will be extremely difficult to undo .
Will Bush ’s midnight rules be reversible ?
Whether it ’s relaxing pollution control standards for power plants or allowing loaded weapons into national parks , the Bush Administration is scrambling to approve or change as many federal rules as it can before it hands off power to President - elect Barack Obama .
This surge of “ midnight regulations ” presents a thorny question for the next administration :
What can it do to void rules it thinks should be undone ?
An Obama spokesman told ProPublica that the transition team ca n’t comment on the new administration ’s strategy yet .
However , John Podesta , a leading member of the transition team , has said Obama will use his “ executive authority without waiting for congressional action ” to reverse many of Bush ’s policies .

But that authority has its limits .
While executive orders and rules that are not yet in effect can swiftly be reversed or altered by Obama ’s appointees or his own executive orders , rules that go into effect before he takes office will be extremely difficult to undo .
Rescinding a rule would require the new administration to re-start the rule - making process , which can take years and prompt legal challenges .
Another strategy that has been talked about lately – getting Congress to disapprove the rules through the Congressional Review Act — carries political risks and has been used only once before .
“ The problem with what the Bush administration is doing is that these rules are extremely cumbersome to adopt , and they are every bit as cumbersome to undo , ” said David Vladeck , an administrative law professor at Georgetown University .
“ It condemns the next administration to spend years fighting on the old administration ’s agenda . ”
ProPublica is assembling a list of these “ midnight regulations ” and will track them through the rulemaking process , regularly updating its website and detailing how the proposed changes might affect the public .
Some of the rules have lingered on the president ’s agenda for years , others are more recent proposals .
Stop the presses
Strategies to rescind a midnight regulation vary depending on its status in the rulemaking process .
After a rule has been finalized by the Office of Management and Budget , it takes 30 to 60 days for it to go into effect — 60 days for rules that cost the economy $ 100 million dollars or more , 30 days for rules that cost less than that .
During this period , Obama can void the rule by directing agency heads and OMB to halt work on it until his administration can review it .
That ’s what President Bush did in response to the dozens of rules President Bill Clinton finalized in the weeks before he left office in January 2001 .
On the day of Bush ’s inauguration , his chief of staff , Andrew Card , instructed agency heads and OMB to withdraw rules that had not yet taken effect so the Bush administration could review them first .
Many were altered to fit Bush ’s agenda or rescinded altogether .
Susan Dudley , who at the time was a research fellow at the Mercatus Institute , a conservative think tank , criticized the tradition of last - minute rulemaking and the way Clinton used it .
“ Like Cinderella leaving the ball , many of Clinton ’s 7,000 presidential appointees hurried to issue last - minute ‘ midnight ’ regulations before they turned back into ordinary citizens at noon on January 20th , ” Dudley wrote in a 2001 commentary .
Now Dudley serves as the head of OMB ’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and is a key player in finalizing Bush ’s midnight rules .
To make sure the Bush administration ’s rules would survive , White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten wrote a memo in May urging agency heads to publish all final rules in the federal register by November 1 , so they would be in effect when the next administration took office .
Despite Bolton ’s prodding , however , many regulations are still under review at OMB and still more are being submitted .
Starting from scratch
Getting rid of a rule that is already in effect is enormously difficult , because it must be replaced with another rule .
That process can take months or even years and could leave some of the Bush rules in place in the meantime .
It can also lead to lawsuits .
“ If you start the rulemaking process over again , the end product is likely to be challenged in court by somebody , and the administration would need to develop a record that supports the decision to promulgate a new rule , ” said Robert Glicksman , an administrative law professor at the University of Kansas .
Bush ’s midnight regulations also could be challenged by public interest groups , who are already considering legal actions to get some of them overturned .
If the Obama administration agrees with the group ’s position , it could promise the court to develop a new rule that both parties can agree on .
But that would open up the possibility of further legal challenges from third parties , such as utility companies or other industry interests , which could assert that the Obama administration and the group were participating in a “ collusion of interests ” without adequately considering the impact on industry .
“ By intervening , industry could buy more time and save billions of dollars by avoiding compliance to a new rule , ” said Rena Steinzor , a University of Maryland law professor who is also a member of the Center for Progressive Regulation , a Washington , D.C. - based advocacy group .
Leave it to Congress
To bypass such an arduous process , some Democrats in Congress are contemplating the use of the Congressional Review Act , an obscure Clinton - era law that allows Congress to vote to disapprove any rule finalized within about six months before Congress adjourns .
It was passed by the Republican - dominated House in 1996 , partly because Republicans wanted to shoot down Clinton - backed rules .
OMB Watch and other public interest groups have urged Congress to use the Review Act to deal with some of Bush ’s midnight regulations .
But it , too , presents challenges .
Of the nearly 50,000 rules that have been submitted to Congress since the act was passed , it has been used to overturn only one rule , according to a recent Congressional Research Service report on the act .
That happened in 2001 , when the Congress voted down a Clinton - backed ergonomics standard aimed at improving workplace conditions and equipment for workers .
Critics said the standard was too broad and too costly .
Using the Review
Act does n’t necessarily guarantee that a rule will be voided , because the rule ’s opponents may not be able to muster the votes they need .
It would have to be for a “ rule that is politically unpopular and reinforces the message that the new Congress and the President want to send , ” said Reece Rushing , a regulatory expert for the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank in Washington , D.C .
If the Congressional Review Act is used to disapprove a rule , Congress would also be required to approve any similar rule in the future .
“ This might be a lot more difficult than people think , ” said Matt Madia , a regulatory expert at OMB Watch .
Madia expects a flood of lobbying on Capitol Hill now that the Review Act is being considered as an option .
“ Everyone who has a dog in this fight is going to come to Congress , because now everyone knows about the CRA . ”

Election Official : ' 80 % of Counties Do Not Have Emergency Ballots '...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/31/2008 , 11:13 am PT
In the suburban county of Montgomery , just outside of Philadelphia , election officials have , inexcusably , been caught off guard by a new , court - mandated directive by PA 's Secretary of the Commonwealth Pedro Cortes .
The directive requires that counties have enough emergency paper ballots ( EPBs ) on hand at polling places to ensure that voters can vote if half , or more , of a precinct 's voting machines break down .
County officials admit today that they were completely unprepared for the directive , and even for the likelihood of serious machine failure , despite known problems with the touch - screen voting systems they use , or the extraordinary voter turnout long - predicted for next Tuesday .
The new directive [ PDF ] was issued yesterday , as we reported last night in our late update to our article on the lawsuit .
The successful suit was filed last week against the Democratic Secretary , by the NAACP and a local election protection coalition .
It followed on Cortes ' directive a month a go that EPBs needed to be given out to voters only in the event of failure of 100 % of a precinct 's machines .
Cortes ' original directive , and even the one issued yesterday , has been seen at odds with a PA statutory provision that allowed counties to offer paper ballots in the event that just one machine has failed .
PA uses Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) voting systems across most of the state , and is a key battleground for John McCain 's attempt to win the White House this year ...
Montgomery County 's voter services Director , Joseph R. Passarella , admits this morning that his county is unprepared for the directive , despite known problems and historical failures of electronic voting machines on Election Day in Pennsylvania and elsewhere , or even the widely - predicted unprecedented turnout that 's expected .
He also says that he believes , according to the Philadelphia Intelligencer , that an " estimated ...80 percent of the state 's other counties do not have emergency ballots , having used provisional ballots for both purposes in the past . "
Incredibly , Passarella also admitted today that he had previously planned to give just 100 provisional ballots , and 100 emergency ballots to each precinct ...
Montgomery County election officials Thursday said they would comply with Wednesday 's federal court order directing polls throughout the state to offer voters paper emergency ballots if half of the voting machines in that polling place become inoperable on Election Day .
However , officials do not have any concrete compliance plan in place at this time .
" We are just going to have to train on the fly , " said county voter services Director Joseph R. Passarella , noting that all but one of the county 's 18 poll worker training classes have been completed .
Simply placing a letter with detailed instructions on how to handle the situation in each poll 's box of Election Day supplies " would only cause more confusion , " said Passarella .
Also , there is no time to print additional individualized emergency ballots for each of the county 's 418 polling places , according to Passarella .
Even if there was time , all of the supply boxes for each poll " are packed and ready to go , " he said .
So , in other words , even though the law already says paper ballots may be given out if even one machine breaks down , and even though the machines have broken down historically , and even though there is likely to be record turnout and not nearly enough machines to serve voters as is , this county has not previously --- prior to the new directive from the SoS , or even in response to the old one , issued over a month ago --- made plans to ensure that voters would be able to vote come hell , high - water , or completely - predictable machine - failure .
Disgraceful .
Who Could Have Predicted It ?
According to Wikipedia , Montgomery , a suburban area southwest of Philadelphia , has a population of approximately 800,000 .
The Democratic - leaning county reportedly voted strongly for John Kerry in 2004 , by a margin of 56 % to 44 % , over George W. Bush .
It is the third most populous county in the state .
In the 2004 general election , 379,715 voters reportedly voted [ PDF ] on the county 's DRE voting systems at their 418 polling places .
That 's an average of 908 voters at each precinct in 2004 .
And yet , as the Inquirer reports , Passarella was prepared to have just 100 provisional and 100 emergency paper ballots on hand at each polling place this year , even with the predicted historic turnout .
To make matters still worse , Montgomery County forces voters to use the Sequoia Voting Systems ' faulty , error - prone , hackable AVC Advantage DRE touch - screen voting machines .
Those are the same machines that would n't start up at all in New Jersey on Super Tuesday this year , delaying Governor John Corzine , and countless other voters ' , ability to cast a vote at all for nearly an hour on the morning of primary day .
The same Sequoia machines in New Jersey also reportedly flipped votes from Obama to Clinton that day , before proceeding to misreport vote totals in dozens of counties , and even lose votes entirely , as reported by Princeton University in the recently released court - ordered analysis of the Advantage machines .
" As a consequence of these flaws , " the computer scientists at Princeton wrote , " voters were disenfranchised . "
The report was commissioned as part of a lawsuit by NJ election integrity advocates , and the court ordered it 's release just last week .
The researchers were also able to pick the lock on the machine in 13 seconds , and do so without breaking the machine 's security seals .
In February of 2007 , we reported on the same Sequoia Advantage machines having been hacked in five minutes by a professor at Princeton University , who had purchased five of the machines on the Internet from an on - line government equipment clearinghouse for $ 86 apiece .
NJ had purchased them for $ 8000 a piece .
John Bonifaz , of VoterAction.org , co-counsel in the successful NAACP lawsuit against the state of PA , writes via email this morning that the legal team in the case has been alerted to the report out of Montgomery County .
Eurofighter came within half a SECOND of hitting private jet in 530 mph dive - bomb practice
A Eurofighter came within half a second of hitting a private jet after screaming past the plane at 530 mph while diving , it has been revealed .
The RAF ’s £ 138 million Typhoon was simulating a bombing run with a ‘ high - angled strafe ’ when it flew past just 240 ft from the Hawker Siddeley 125 , which was preparing to land at an airport .
They missed each other by ‘ the blink of an eye ’ , air traffic experts said .
Near miss : A Eurofighter like this flew just 240ft past a private jet
The incident near Louth , Lincs , was classed as an ‘ A ’ by the Civil Aviation Authority ’s Airprox Board — meaning there was a ‘ definite risk of collision ’ .
In the report released yesterday , one air traffic controller was recorded to have said afterwards : ‘ That Typhoon just nearly took out my traffic . ’
Another added : ‘ I looked up and they were **** close . ’
The investigation discovered the Hawker Siddeley ’s collision - avoidance device detected the Typhoon — but the fighter was going so fast that emergency action by the civilian pilot made no difference .
The near - tragedy inside the Donna Nook military air training zone also raised questions about civilian pilots being allowed to cross such areas .
The Hawker Siddeley had been cleared to fly over the range at 10,000ft because controllers thought the Eurofighter would be much lower .
The incident happened at 8,000ft .
The report said : ‘ It is worrying that Donna Nook routinely allows civilian aircraft to transit an active range when high - performance aircraft are using the airspace . ’
The Typhoon crew had been warned about the Hawker Siddeley , but had not ‘ fully complied ’ with orders .
Air traffic expert Philip Butterworth - Hayes told The Sun : ‘ It brings into question the “ flexible ” use of airspace where the military is having to give up more and more because of the number of aircraft in the skies .
‘ This was less than a whisker , more the blink of an eye . ’
It has not been not disclosed how many people were on the Hawker Siddeley during the near - miss in March .
The 232 Eurofighter Typhoon is the RAF ’s newest attack jet , replacing ageing Jaguars and Harriers .
Von Prügeleien im Milieu erfährt die Justiz eher selten .
Diesmal brachte ein Missverständnis vier Männer auf die Anklagebank - und bescherte dem lädierten König der Oranienburger Straße einen letzten glanzvollen Auftritt .
Neues von Uta Eisenhardt aus dem Berliner Amtsgericht .
In Moabit herrscht Sicherheitsstufe , doch nicht nur im Kriminalgericht rüstet man sich für den Prozess gegen vier Männer mit Kontakten ins Rotlichtmilieu .
Auch das kleine Cafe gegenüber hat sich auf den extremen Hunger der braungebrannten , muskulösen Männer aus dem Publikum eingestellt - in der Mittagszeit werden Unmengen hart gekochter Eier und Quarkspeisen mit Früchten verkauft .
Kampf um den Straßenstrich
Im Gerichtssaal sitzen die muskulösen Angeklagten hinter Panzerglas , vor ihnen haben ihre Anwälte Platz genommen : Die Mandate scheinen nach der Haarfülle verteilt , denn die glatzköpfigen Anwälte verteidigen die kahlen Angeklagten und umgekehrt .
Im Prozess geht es um gefährliche Körperverletzung im Rotlichtmilieu .
Diese wurde verübt im Kampf um die wirtschaftliche Vorherrschaft in der Gastronomie und Hotellerie auf der Oranienburger Straße , die unter Insidern als lukrativster Straßenstrich Deutschlands gilt .
Uta Eisenhardt Uta Eisenhardt ist Berlinerin in dritter Generation .
Seit fünf Jahren ist sie Gerichtsreporterin und schreibt für " Spiegel " , " Zeit " , " Berliner Zeitung " , " Tagesspiegel " und die " Taz " .
In der neuen stern .
de - Kolumne " Icke muss vor Jericht " berichtet sie aus dem Berliner Amtsgericht , einem der größten Deutschlands .
Jede Woche schreibt Eisenhardt über einen Prozess mit dem gewissen Etwas : manchmal traurig , manchmal kurios - immer spannend .
Dessen unangefochtener Chef war über ein Jahrzehnt der Boxpromoter und Sportstudio- Betreiber Wolfgang Sparing * ( 56 ) , der eine Verbindung zum Rotlichtmilieu jedoch stets bestreitet .
Auch im Gerichtssaal gibt er als Berufsbezeichnung lediglich " Gastronom " an , was vom Publikum mit lautem Gelächter quittiert wird .
Heute ist der frühere König nur noch ein Großherzog , der sich sein Revier mit einem anderen teilen muss , so die Experten vom Landeskriminalamt ( LKA ) .
Seine Demontage begann mit einer Schlägerei , die ihn ins Krankenhaus und die vier Angeklagten in Untersuchungshaft brachte .
Jetzt hat Wolfgang Sparing seinen Auftritt als Zeuge und Nebenkläger , eine Rolle , die Männer aus dem Milieu äußerst selten spielen .
Mit einer Hantel attackiert
Am späten Abend des 8 .
Januar trainierte Sparing in seinem Sportstudio namens " Eisenhaus " .
Er habe gerade am Sandsack geboxt , als die vier Angeklagten in den Raum stürzten .
" Ich hatte zwei Sekunden .
Da konnte ich gerade einen der Boxhandschuhe ausziehen " , sagt der kräftige , blonde Mann mit dem charismatischen Magier - Bart vor Gericht .
Dann hätten drei Leute auf ihn eingeschlagen .
Zuerst habe er Thomas Gaffke * ( 47 ) erkannt , dann Andreas Großmann * ( 51 ) .
" Andy , du wolltest doch mal mein Freund werden ! " , will Sparing zu ihm gesagt haben .
" ' Du bist fertig , du bist weg ! ' , haben die zu mir gesagt " , erinnert sich das Opfer im Gerichtssaal .
Großmann habe ihn mit einer zehn Kilogramm schweren Hantel attackiert .
" Dabei hat er es vorwiegend auf die Knie - und Armgelenke abgesehen " , sagt der Geschlagene .
Noch während des Überfalls betrat ein Bekannter von Sparing den Raum .
Die Meute sah den zufälligen
Besucher und sei sofort gemeinschaftlich über diesen hergefallen , so der " Eisenhaus " - Betreiber .
Als sie beide bewegungsunfähig am Boden lagen , müssen die vier weiter gezogen sein , um noch zwei weitere Männer aus Sparings Umfeld zu traktieren : Einer von denen erlitt ein Brillen - Hämatom begleitet von der Aufforderung , die Waffe herauszugeben , die Sparing schützen sollte .
" Vier Herren mussten damals ins Krankenhaus " , fasst der Staatsanwalt das Geschehen zusammen .
Der Grund ?
Keine Ahnung !
Zwei Wochen lag Sparing dort : Sein linkes Wadenbein war gebrochen , ein Kreuzband im Kniegelenk hatte sich vom Knochen gelöst , der linke Arm war ausgekugelt .
Der Notarzt informierte damals die Justiz über die gefährliche Körperverletzung .
Die ist ein Offizialdelikt und wird unabhängig von der Anzeige eines Opfers verfolgt .
So musste in einem Milieu ermittelt werden , indem es naturgemäß nur wenig Gesprächsbereitschaft gibt .
Selbst das Opfer Wolfgang Sparing hält sich bedeckt : " Den Grund kann ich mir nicht erklären . "
Ein Experte des LKA schildert dem Gericht folgende Version :
Im vergangenen Jahr entbrannte um die Oranienburger Straße ein Verteilungskampf zwischen einem Motorradclub namens MC " Gremium " und diversen Lagern der als " Berliner Jungs " bezeichneten Zuhälter .
Im Dezember wurde das in Berlin - Mitte befindliche " Zille - Eck " , Hauptquartier der " Berliner Jungs " , von 20 Leuten überfallen .
Die Einrichtung wurde zerschlagen , die Anwesenden verprügelt - nur Sparing bekam nichts ab .
Da stimme etwas nicht , stellte Andreas Großmann fest .
Klartext in der " Gefährdeten - Ansprache "
Kurze Zeit später forderte Großmann vom damaligen Rotlicht - König Geld zurück , doch Sparing ließ ihn von seinen Leuten festhalten und verprügeln .
Großmann soll sich in dieser Situation an das LKA gewandt haben .
Es war nicht sein erster Kontakt zu den Beamten der Abteilung " Organisierte Kriminalität " .
Er galt als Ansprechpartner für die Oranienburger Straße , Sparing soll ihn darum auch auf Zetteln an den Bäumen als Polizeispitzel bezeichnet haben .
Die Beamten sprachen mit Großmann , als auf dem Strich Drogen aufgetaucht waren und später noch einmal , weil das LKA dort eine Waffe vermutete .
Um die Polizei vorzuwarnen , kündigte Großmann auch die bevorstehende Auseinandersetzung mit Sparing an , sagt der Staatsanwalt .
Daraufhin gab es eine sogenannte " Gefährdeten - Ansprache " durch das LKA , so nennt die Polizei die Ermahnung ihrer Pappenheimer .
Eine solche fand zwölf Tage vor der Tat in einem Cafe statt .
Der Beamte des LKA forderte Andreas Großmann eindringlich auf , keine Straftaten zu begehen .
Er soll aufgezählt haben : Nicht morden , nicht brandschatzen , nicht Sparings Kinder entführen .
Über den weiteren Gesprächsinhalt gehen die Meinungen nun auseinander .
Der LKA - Mann und der Staatsanwalt sagen : Die Möglichkeit eines Kampfes Mann gegen
Mann sei unerwähnt geblieben und darum will Großmann kombiniert haben , der sei quasi von behördlicher Seite genehmigt .
Alles nur ein Mißverständnis
Großmann dagegen sagt , der LKA - Mann habe ihm bedeutet , sie würden sich doch sowieso jeden Tag die Köpfe einhauen , also könnten sie ihre Streitigkeiten auch in einem fairen Zweikampf regeln .
Dabei seien alle Beteiligten davon ausgegangen , dass eine solche Auseinandersetzung niemals der Justiz zu Ohren kommt .
" Der LKA - Mann gab mir das Okay " , beteuert Großmann , dessen Gesicht für einen ehemaligen Boxer ungewöhnlich fein geschnitten ist .
" Hätte der Beamte gesagt , ich darf überhaupt nichts machen , hätte ich mit Sicherheit nicht die Sache selbst in die Hand genommen und es gäbe nicht diesen Prozess . "
Er sei in jener Nacht losgezogen , weil " ich es nicht besser gewusst habe . "
Ein paar Stunden vor der
Tat informierte er seine drei Freunde : Matthias Münz * ( 40 ) und den Kaufmann und Boxpromoter Thomas Gaffke - ein ehemaliger Geschäftspartner von Sparing .
Außerdem holte er noch den Türsteher Ingmar Ragwitz * ( 39 ) dazu , der in seinem Haus wohnt und Sparing gar nicht kannte .
Ragwitz sagt , er habe Andreas helfen wollen , weil der damalige Rotlicht - König einen Killer auf seinen langjährigen Freund angesetzt hatte .
Außerdem hatte Großmann gehört , der geschwächte König habe sich bewaffnet .
Darum hätten die Angeklagten Schusswesten , Schienbein - Schoner und schlagverstärkende Quarzsand - Handschuhe angelegt , damit " meine Knochen heile bleiben , wenn es los geht " , sagt Ingmar Ragwitz .
Dazu hätte es auch keiner großen Vorbereitung bedurft , argumentiert sein Verteidiger : " Die Leute arbeiten in der Sicherheit , die haben solche Dinge im Kofferraum zu liegen . "
Und wieder : die Hantel
Trotz ihrer Vorkehrungen hätten sie im " Eisenhaus " den fairen Zweikampf " Mann gegen Mann " gesucht .
Sie seien aber sofort vom Hausherrn mit der Hantel angegriffen worden , sagen die Angeklagten .
Es klingt tatsächlich plausibel , wenn sie beteuern , Sparing nutzte einen Gegenstand aus seinem Haus zum Prügeln .
Plausibler , als wenn Sparing vorgibt , die Angreifer hätten sich darauf verlassen müssen , ihr Prügelwerkzeug bei ihrem Opfer zu finden .
Mit der Abreibung von Sparing und dessen drei Bekannten hätten sich Großmann und Co. nicht begnügt , sagt ihr Opfer .
Wenige Tage später besuchten sie den Schwerverletzten im Krankenhaus .
" Herr Sparing , Sie haben Besuch ! " , habe die Schwester ihm gesagt , dann standen Großmann und vier seiner Freunde vor seinem Bett und hätten ihn fotografiert .
Die Fotos hätten sie dazu benutzt , um ihn in seinem Zustand bloßzustellen , so der Fotografierte .
Die Angeklagten argumentieren , wenn sie das hätten tun wollen , hätten sie die Fotos auch gleich im " Eisenhaus " machen können .
Ihnen sei es vielmehr darum gegangen , die Gerüchte über Messer - und Hantelverletzungen auszuräumen , die ihr Opfer herum posaunt hatte .
Kurz darauf schickten sie Sparing einen anonymen Brief : " Du solltest diesmal deine Gegner ernst nehmen " , stand darin .
Ein weiteres Schreiben , das mit " Gruppe der betrogenen , geblendeten , getäuschten , ehemaligen Partner des Wolfgang Sparing " unterzeichnet war , ging an den Boxverband .
" Die Wahrheit liegt in der Mitte "
Vehement bestreiten die vier , den Boxpromoter zu mehreren überfallen zu haben .
Würde das Gericht ihnen glauben , könnte ihnen nur einfache und keine gefährliche Körperverletzung vorgeworfen werden .
Die Strafen dafür sind erheblich milder .
Allerdings sprechen Sparings Verletzungen für einen Kampf mit mehreren Gegnern , denn der Box -Promoter wies an allen vier Gelenken starke Überdehnungen auf .
Dazu musste Sparing zuvor fixiert werden , das ist in einem fairen Zweikampf unmöglich .
Allerdings ist auch die Version von der Hantel , mit der geprügelt worden sei , unglaubhaft - denn nach einer minutenlangen Attacke mit einer solchen hätten Sparings Knochen nur noch aus Splittern bestanden .
" Beide Seiten haben Grund , die Unwahrheit zu sagen " , meint der Staatsanwalt .
" Sparing muss seinen Ruf als starker Mann wahren und Großmann den als fairer Zwei- Kämpfer " .
Die Amtsrichterin glaubt : " Die Wahrheit liegt in der Mitte " , in der Mitte der Angaben des Nebenklägers und jener der Angeklagten , die sich auch im Gerichtssaal stellvertretend über ihre Anwälte attackieren .
Zuweilen verkommt der neuntägige Prozess " zu einer pöbelnden Muppet - Show " , wie es ein Verteidiger formuliert .
Die Richterin folgt mit ihrem Urteil der Forderung des Staatsanwaltes , sie mildert lediglich ein wenig die Höhe der Strafen .
Wegen gefährlicher Körperverletzung verurteilt sie Großmann zu 34 Monaten , Ragwitz zu 27 Monaten und Gaffke zu 30 Monaten Haft .
Münz bekommt wegen Beihilfe 16 Monate Haft zur Bewährung .
Es gibt keine Gewinner
Doch obwohl König Wolfgang " zu 80 Prozent wieder fit ist " , hilft ihm die Verurteilung seiner Gegenspieler nicht :
Mit seinen für das Milieu bemerkenswerten Aussagen und Identifizierungen vor Gericht hat er in der Szene an Sympathie verloren .
Sein Reich ist zerschlagen , zukünftig muss er sich mit Großherzog Andreas das Revier teilen .
Der hat wie alle Beteiligten gegen das Urteil Berufung eingelegt und wartet nun in Freiheit auf einen neuen Gerichtstermin .

Geneva , Switzerland - The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is the world 's largest machine and was built over 20 years at a cost of billions .
It is now lying idle , for want of its smallest moving part - atoms .
" It 's extremely embarrassing , " one senior source said on condition of anonymity .
" The Collider can only use a particular type of atom from just one company , and they have chosen not to deliver at this time .
We are negotiating with them and hope to come to a speedy resolution . "
We tracked down the supplier , Will & Jesse Mining Co. , to their Ozark compound .
One of the founders , Jesse Armstrong , was willing to speak .
" We 've supplied atoms to CERN since they first started , " says the tall , heavily - bearded joint owner when we spoke in his office .
Through the open window , the mine is visible and his partner , Will ' Grizzly '
Adams can be seen hard at work , extracting the vital atoms and carefully placing them in the sealed containers that will carry them to labs all over the world .
" The fact is , we 're just not happy with what they 're doing over there now .
I do n't want anybody saying the end of the world was caused by an Ozark atom . "
The atoms found in this region are the smallest and smoothest yet found in nature , and are ideal for the high speeds and extreme conditions inside the LHC .
Low - grade atoms cannot be substituted as they will damage the delicate machinery and give less accurate measurements .
Related News Group Protest Treatment of Hadrons at CERN Evolutionary Acceleration Research Institute Ready to Start “ Squirrel Smasher ” Study Shows over 68 % of Science Stories Have Scientific Errors " Until we get those atoms , the LHC will remain inactive , " says our informant .
" We 've offered them more money .
We told them the energies involved could not possibly have any catastrophic effect on the planet .
We showed them how , if a microscopic black hole was created , it would instantaneously evaporate rather than sink into the core of the Earth and devour it from within .
But still no atoms . "
" It 's not a complete loss , though , " said the engineer , indicating the idle scanning equipment .
" It gives us plenty of time to work on our anomalous materials research . "

Detroit .
Despite the fact that the COVID - 19 crisis has pretty much decimated life as we know it , and the concept of having an actual auto show seems about as remote as having a crowd of 100,000 at University of Michigan stadium ( aka “ the Big House ” ) for a football game , the auto industry is still kicking and screaming with new product intros galore and the need to show them off .
It ’s no secret , however , that auto shows have been on the endangered species list for a while now .
Auto companies decried the cost involved , even though they brought it on themselves with their bigger and more elaborate displays designed to one - up the competition .
So , naturally , they started to get picky about when and where they would show up , or they abandoned auto shows all together in favor of targeted , singular media events where they did n’t have to fight for attention with the hordes of other manufacturers .
As the manufacturers pursued this path , they discovered that they were getting more bang for their buck by eliminating the cost of staging auto shows multiple times per year , which was really bad news for auto shows in general .
And as various shows around the world started to endure cancellations from auto manufacturers , the Detroit Auto Show seemed to be called out more than others for various transgressions , both real and imagined .
The Motor City ’s annual rite was deemed a “ homie ” show , favoring what was left of the Big Two plus One over the import manufacturers .
( I will not dispute this ; it has been that , for the most part . )
And , to make matters worse , having the Detroit show in January when the weather here is , shall we say , approaching inhospitable did n’t exactly endear the show to the masses in the media expected to attend either .
After years of hearing the negatives about its show , the Detroit Auto Show organizers decided to finally take one major negative about their show out of the equation , and that was to move it to a new date in June 2020 .
It was going to be a “ spectacular spectacular ” with a combination of indoor and outdoor displays , and assorted happenings to make everyone fall in love – or at least heavy like – with the automobile all over again .
In order to pull this new date off , the Detroit Auto Show did n’t have a January show in 2019 but would wait for the new “ big bang ” show in June 2020 .
And it was all good , until the COVID - 19 pandemic hit and planning for the brand - new , high - concept Detroit Auto Show was shelved until 2021 .
Meanwhile , the two other major auto shows in New York and Los Angeles had their own challenges .
( Chicago is a big show , too , but it is known as a “ retail ” show within the industry , with the emphasis on showing – and selling – production vehicles rather than on unveiling concepts and future vehicles .
New York announced the cancellation of its show – which is traditionally right before Easter – until 2021 , which was totally understandable .
Then , like a bolt out of the blue , the organizers of the Los Angles Auto Show – which usually happens right before Thanksgiving each year – not only cancelled the show for 2020 due to the pandemic but also announced that they were moving the date to May 2021 .
As you might imagine , this decision was met with a resounding thud from all quarters .
The auto manufacturers hated it because it meant three major auto shows in North America in three months – April , May and the new June date for the reimagined Detroit show .
How would they apportion product debuts so closely together ?
Not to mention the expense and the logistical nightmares associated with slamming together three major shows back - to - back - to back .
And the New York and Detroit auto show organizers were apoplectic for similar reasons , with the added headaches of scrambling for plum debuts for their particular shows seemingly an instantly insurmountable problem .
The L.A. Auto
Show organizers figured that their move was the masterstroke , thinking that placing their show right in the middle of the two other major North American shows would pay off handsomely .
We could hear the high - fiving all the way back here .
Big mistake .
While the collective hand - wringing in the industry was growing to a cacophony of grumbling and bad words over the L.A. Auto
Show ’s blatant move for glory , the real masterstroke was unleashed by the Detroit Auto Show organizers just three weeks later .
This week , Detroit Auto Show organizers announced that they would abandon their previously announced June date on the calendar and instead will step into the prime fall spot on the calendar left open by L.A. ’s defection to May .
Now , the Detroit Auto Show will take place September 24 - October 9 , 2021 , during two of the most beautiful months around here ( the most beautiful months , as far as we ’re concerned .
- WG ) .
This is a huge coup and it automatically establishes the Detroit Auto Show as – bang – the auto show in North America once again .
Will this automatically revive the auto show ’s role in this industry ?
Not necessarily , but the calendar makes more sense now than it ever has , and if the show organizers in Detroit keep their promises , we ’re looking forward to a spectacular show .
Sometimes things work out for a reason , and this is definitely one of those times as far as the Detroit Auto Show organizers are concerned .
Nicely done , ladies and gentlemen .
Oh , and memo to the L.A. Auto Show organizers : Boo-Frickin' - Hoo .
And that ’s the High - Octane Truth for this week .
A federal judge has stopped Mayor Bloomberg ‘s attempt to clean up the air in New York City by using fuel - efficient hybrid taxis .
[ social_buttons ]
The judge , Paul A. Crotty , of Federal District Court in Manhattan , issued a 26 - page ruling ( PDF ) to stop the city from enforcing the rule because , he said in a written order , the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in a key legal argument — that only the federal government has the right to set fuel efficiency standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 , which bars state and local governments from setting their own , competing standards .
The hybrid - cab requirement was the centerpiece of Mayor Bloomberg ’s PlaNYC 2030 package of environmental initiatives .
It required all new taxicabs to be fuel - efficient hybrids and that all yellow cabs would be green by 2012 .
The initiative which would have started on Nov 1 , specifically required a new cab coming in to service to get 25 miles per gallon , and the following year the standard would be 30 miles per gallon .
The standard yellow cab gets about 14 miles per gallon .
Considering there are about 13,000 cabs in NYC and only about one - thousand of them are hybrids , this could ’ve had a large positive effect on the city ’s pollution .
Bloomberg said he was “ very disappointed ” and blasted the ruling for relying on “ archaic Washington regulations ” that keep New York and other cities “ from choosing to create cleaner air . ”
He said the city was exploring options to appeal .
The Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade — they represent about a quarter of they city ’s taxis — sued to block the enforcement .
They argued only federal government could impose such restrictions , not the city ’s Taxicab & Limousine Commission .
They also noted that Hybrid ’s are n’t safe enough to use as cabs .
“ Millions of people who ride taxicabs and the thousands of drivers , owners and other participants in the New York City taxi industry can breathe a sigh of relief today , ” Trade association president Ron Sherman said in approval of the decision ..
“ Greening the taxi fleet is a major priority , and we are going to use every mechanism at our disposal to make New York a cleaner , healthier city , ” Bloomberg vowed .
Hopefully Yahoo does n’t mind donating a few more of those green cabs …

With the help of clever marketing consultants , political parties can sometimes mislead the public .
In the last federal election , the NDP pretended that Jack Layton had a chance of becoming prime minister in order to boost the party ’s chance of taking seats from the Liberals .
The Conservatives put Stephen Harper in front of children on numerous occasions to show he cared about families , even though his party had eliminated daycare agreements with the provinces .
And the federal Liberals presented themselves as a united team behind Stéphane Dion when , privately , some MPs were deeply disenchanted with their leader .
We ’ve seen a similar spinning in advance of the Saturday ( November 15 ) Vancouver municipal election .
Vision Vancouver presents itself as the caring alternative to the Non-Partisan Association , even though Vision wants to invest far more new money in beefing up the police force than in local libraries or new community centres for youth .
Vision is also calling for more transparency regarding the city ’s financial dealings over the billion - dollar Olympic Village .
But four Vision councillors attended an in - camera meeting last month that , we ’ve been told , authorized a $ 100 - million loan with zero transparency .
Meanwhile , the Non-Partisan Association is presenting itself as the party for addressing street disorder in Vancouver .
But no NPA candidate , as far as we can tell , has uttered a peep about the provincial government ’s punitive social - welfare and taxation policies , which are at the root of rampant homelessness .
No NPA candidate , as far as we can tell , has voiced any concerns about the provincial government ’s refusal to do anything for urban aboriginal youth in Vancouver , who are sometimes the most at risk of becoming drug addicts .
It ’s tempting to recommend a pox on both major parties and urge the public to vote for a slate of independents .
But that would n’t result in the best city council for Vancouver , because the independents have no experience .
That ’s why we favour a balanced slate that mixes experience with idealism .
Keep in mind that there are some significant differences between Vision and the NPA .
Vision is supported by many unions , so it should n’t surprise voters when its mayoral candidate , Gregor Robertson , promises not to contract out civic services .
NPA mayoral candidate Peter Ladner has said he is open to the idea of contracting out services if this provides a better deal for taxpayers .
The NPA has already supported an $ 800,000 expansion of the Downtown Ambassadors program ; this is , in effect , contracting out security to business - improvement associations .
Many property owners on the boards of these associations are also contributors to the NPA .
During council ’s last term , Vision , and not the NPA , was the loudest proponent for increasing the number of police officers in Vancouver .
The police union is a contributor to Vision , which opposes expanding the Downtown Ambassadors program .
If you think Vancouver has too many police already — another 96 officers and 22 civilians were slated this year and next — then you probably should n’t vote for either Robertson or Ladner for mayor .
At a November 9 candidates meeting , independent mayoral candidate Marc Emery advocated freezing the police budget forever and taking away officers ’
Tasers if he becomes chair of the Vancouver police board .
You wo n’t hear that from Robertson or Ladner .
Vision and the NPA also have distinctly different positions regarding the six - lane Burrard Bridge .
Vision and its ally , the Coalition of Progressive Electors , favour a trial converting one lane of traffic for cyclists , a half - lane each in either direction .
During the trial , there would be signals installed that would change the direction of the car lanes ( similar to the signals on the Lions Gate Bridge ) so there would always be three lanes open for rush - hour vehicles .
The other two car lanes would always travel in the opposite direction .
The NPA now opposes its earlier plan to widen the bridge , which would have cost up to $ 63 million .
During the recent campaign , Ladner proposed that a barrier be installed separating cyclists and pedestrians and traffic .
According to the NPA , this would cost $ 33 million and retain all six lanes for motorized vehicles .
The pesky left - wing gnat in this election , the Work Less Party , supports dedicated bike - lane corridors linking all parts of the city , as well as dedicated bike and bus lanes on all roads and bridges .
The Work Less Party , whose mayoral candidate is antilogging activist Betty Krawczyk , also favours reducing reliance on private cars by introducing road tolls .
COPE has called for a free bus loop between the downtown core and the Broadway corridor and will push for a single transit fare for the whole region .
On development issues , Vision and the NPA have voted in favour of freezing the rate of change in certain neighbourhoods , which has slowed the number of evictions .
As a result , it ’s harder for developers to convert rental buildings into strata - title condominiums .
Vision has defended the interests of renters more vigorously , criticizing the provincial government for allowing landlords to evict tenants for “ improvements ” and then jack up the rent after the repairs are done .
The NPA has not criticized this loophole in the Residential Tenancy Act , preferring to work cooperatively with the provincial government .
The NPA claims that this constructive approach led the province to buy 600 single - room - occupancy units to preserve housing for low - income residents .
NPA campaign literature also points out that the province will have added 2,461 new units of nonmarket and supportive housing between 2005 and 2010 .
Vision has pledged to end street homelessness by 2015 .
Part of its plan is to ensure there are enough shelter beds to meet the demand — an idea that has been criticized by NPA candidate and development consultant Michael Geller .
Last year , there were 36,000 people turned away from shelters within a nine - month period .
Vision has also promised to strengthen and enforce property - standards bylaws to prevent landlords from allowing their buildings to deteriorate , resulting in the loss of rental - housing units .
“ The NPA has protected slum landlords by failing to enforce these basic standards , ” Vision charges in its platform .
In addition , Vision has pledged to encourage property owners and strata councils to “ unlock vacant condo units as rental properties ” .
There is no mention in the platform of any tax being imposed to encourage this .
However , Vision has proposed tax incentives to encourage the development of market rental housing .
At its June nominating meeting , Vision members voted against putting lawyer David Eby on the party ’s council slate .
Eby has been one of the city ’s strongest advocates for low - income tenants and victims of police brutality .
The presence of Eby on the Vision slate could have deprived the party of donations from major developers and the police union , which might explain why he failed to make the grade .
Regardless , the reluctance of Vision to nominate Eby shows a decidedly less progressive bent than the party often presents to the public .
COPE has called for one unit of affordable housing to be built for every condo unit constructed on the Downtown Eastside .
COPE has also proposed freezing the conversion of rental units to strata title and requiring developers to include 20 percent low - income or affordable housing in new developments .
In addition , COPE opposes the initial and the revised EcoDensity charters .
The NPA claims that it has kept property - tax increases to 3.2 percent per year over the past three years .
And it says it provides the highest per capita arts funding of any city in Canada .
Vision , on the other hand , has advocated creating an arm ’s-length Vancouver Arts Council , modelled on that of Edmonton , that would take the politics out of arts grants .
Instead of these grants going to council for approval , people with expertise in the arts would make the decisions .
Vision and COPE will also push for more car - free festivals in neighbourhoods .
Vision and COPE have created separate platforms for the park board , unlike the NPA .
COPE has proposed increasing access to wireless Internet as well as to childcare and preschool programs in community centres .
COPE has also pledged to keep the Mount Pleasant pool open until there are funds found to rebuild it .
Vision stated in its platform that it wants to review plans to dismantle the Mount Pleasant pool and community centre with a view to keeping them open .
Both parties have proposed more BMX bike parks .
COPE will “ explore ” introducing a referendum on keeping cetaceans in captivity in Stanley Park , whereas Vision ’s platform remains silent on this issue .
Many Vision and COPE candidates have stated publicly that they support the NDP at the provincial level , whereas many NPA candidates have professed their support for the B.C. Liberals .
Oddly , Vision ’s mayoral candidate , Robertson , has publicly stated that there is no provincial party whose views resemble his , even though he sat in the NDP caucus from 2005 to 2008 as the MLA for Vancouver - Fairview .
Ladner , on the other hand , has stated frankly that his views coincide more closely with those of the B.C. Liberals than with any other provincial party’s .
As a result of a deal made with Vision , COPE is only running two candidates for council , two candidates for park board , and nobody for mayor , making the party appear pretty minor on the civic stage .
There is only one Green candidate , and he ’s seeking a seat on the park board .
The Work Less Party is fielding four council candidates and one park board candidate in addition to Krawczyk for mayor .
Four bright lights : Vision ’s Kerry Jang and Heather Deal , Geri Tramutola of the Work Less Party , and the NPA ’s Michael Geller .
Four bright lights : Vision ’s Kerry Jang and Heather Deal , Geri Tramutola of the Work Less Party , and the NPA ’s Michael Geller .
There are lots of independents as well , including marijuana activist and libertarian Emery .
He seems to be the only mayoral candidate making a big deal about the likelihood of municipal revenues shrinking severely at a time when the biggest budget driver , the police force , is growing rapidly .
Emery has also blown the whistle on the Vancouver Police Department ’s increasing eagerness in recent years to bust people for marijuana possession .
Vision ’s Robertson is one of the few candidates who favour the creation of a regional police force — an idea that has been endorsed by West Vancouver police Chief Kash Heed and Vancouver police Chief Jim Chu , not to mention criminologists and other independent analysts .
COPE ’s David Cadman , Vision ’s Raymond Louie , and the NPA ’s Kim Capri are the only incumbents on council who favour the creation of a regional police force .
Emery and Work Less Party council candidate Chris Shaw have called upon the province to end its contract with the RCMP and replace it with a provincial police force , which existed in the 1930s and 1940s .
Few civic candidates are talking about a regional police force at a time when the province is considering whether or not to renew its contract with the RCMP .
This suggests that a lot of civic candidates have n’t done their homework in this area — which is a shame , because policing gobbles up the biggest portion of municipal budgets .
In recent elections , the Georgia Straight has offered recommendations to assist readers who want to do their civic duty but who do n’t have the time or inclination to deconstruct wily marketing messages .
The political junkies already know who they ’re going to support .
These recommendations are designed for those who might not have been paying a lot of attention to the news in the weeks leading up to the election .
In the past , these choices have been referred to as “ endorsements ” , which they are n’t .
We ’re not telling you who to vote for , just providing some guidance on the eve of an election .
They ’re designed as counterweights to the Canwest newspapers , which in recent years have invariably supported right - wing parties under Stephen Harper , Stockwell Day , and Gordon Campbell .
By the time you read this , the Canwest papers will probably have endorsed the NPA ’s Ladner for mayor .
For the establishment paper to do anything but endorse the establishment candidate would be a monumental shocker .
Vancouver mayor
Gregor Robertson ( Vision )
Robertson does n’t have experience in civic politics , but , on balance , he comes across as more compassionate and empathetic than his main rival , Peter Ladner .
With growing homelessness and the threat to civil liberties posed by the 2010 Games , this is a time when the city could benefit from having a mayor with a heart .
Robertson demonstrated leadership in bringing unity to a divided party and then managed to stickhandle a deal with COPE and the Greens .
If he ’s this adept in dealing with senior levels of government , Vancouver could enjoy some tangible benefits in a period of economic uncertainty .
Robertson is n’t stained by the secret $ 100 - million loan to bail out the Olympic Village , unlike Ladner , who chairs the finance committee .
Hiding behind the Vancouver Charter , Ladner thought it was a good idea to make this arrangement in private and not reveal it to the taxpayers .
COPE ’s Ellen Woodsworth , Chris Shaw of the Work Less Party , and Vision ’s Andrea Reimer all opposed the Olympics .
COPE ’s Ellen Woodsworth , Chris Shaw of the Work Less Party , and Vision ’s Andrea Reimer all opposed the Olympics .
Robertson ’s biggest liability is his party ’s willingness to go along with the wishes of organized labour even when the B.C. Federation of Labour is pushing bad public policies — like expensive transit plans that do n’t substantially increase the percentage of people using transit to go to and from work .
He could also become a captive of his caucus if Raymond Louie and his supporters — George Chow , Geoff Meggs , Kashmir Dhaliwal , and Kerry Jang — all get elected .
Robertson should have done more to ensure that the Pivot Legal Society ’s David Eby got a Vision nomination as a counterweight to more conservative forces within this civic party .
Ladner is n’t a disastrous mayoral candidate .
He might provide some fiscal sanity in hard economic times and stand up to the demands of the public - sector unions .
He ’s intelligent and , at times , he has questioned shovelling tons of money at the police department .
He also has some good ideas to create more market rental housing in Vancouver .
However , as the establishment candidate , Ladner is far too inclined to toe the line of the bigwigs at the Vancouver Board of Trade .
That was demonstrated in his first term when he voted against slot machines at the Plaza of Nations , where few people live .
Then he turned around to vote in favour of putting slot machines in Hastings Park , where a lot more people live , after the board wrote a letter to councillors promoting the idea .
Ladner ’s tough - on - crime line ( which Robertson echoes ) comes across to us like a shameless attempt to pander to first - generation immigrant voters .
Everyone knows the crime rate has fallen sharply ; even the NPA brags about this .
Both Ladner and Robertson are copying Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s approach in the federal election .
Ladner also has n’t demonstrated any interest in building more homeless shelters despite the obvious magnitude of the homeless crisis .
Vancouver council : strongly recommended
David Cadman ( COPE )
Cadman , a two - term councillor , can usually be counted on to ask the most intelligent questions of staff .
He has helped the city prepare for global warming and is probably the most knowledgeable councillor when it comes to peak oil , effective transit policies , and regional issues .
He ’s one of the few council candidates who recognize that creating a regional police force is good public policy .
And he is likely to stand up for people ’s civil liberties if the army and the police get out of hand during the 2010 Olympics .
Cadman also did his very best to try to maintain unity on the left during the disruptive period in 2004 and 2005 when former mayor Larry Campbell was intent on leaving COPE .
Kerry Jang ( Vision )
Jang , a UBC professor of psychiatry , skewered the Project Civil City initiative after it was launched by Mayor Sam Sullivan .
When Jang was president of Collingwood Neighbourhood House , it developed inclusive multicultural programs that brought new Canadians from different countries together .
The neighbourhood house also provided a refuge for the homeless .
Jang is an internationally recognized authority on personality disorders .
He also has a good sense of humour and he ’s a good listener .
Not only that , but he has a keen understanding of the science of addiction , which is probably the most pressing issue facing the city .
Vancouver will be lucky if he gets elected to council .
Chris Shaw ( Work Less Party )
Shaw has been a fearless critic of the Olympics , predicting cost overruns and problems with the Olympic Village many years before these issues exploded into the media .
Shaw , a neuroscientist and professor at UBC , is exceptionally intelligent and can communicate in ways that the average person can understand .
He will be a good watchdog over the Olympics and the International Olympic Committee when Vancouver hosts the Games .
And you can be sure that he wo n’t go in - camera to approve $ 100 - million expenditures and then not disclose this to the public .
Like Cadman ,
Shaw understands the big global issues , such as peak oil and global warming , and how they might transform Vancouver .
He ’s not a fan of big unions , big developers , or big business , and he has in the past raised concerns about Chinese government espionage in Canada .
If you ’re not concerned about Chinese espionage and you like big unions , big business , big developers , and the Olympics , then Shaw definitely is n’t your man .
But if you think it ’s insane to spend more than $ 800 million on the expansion of a waterfront convention centre and you want a councillor to raise hell about it , you might want to save one vote for Shaw .
Vancouver council : recommended
Suzanne Anton ( NPA )
Of all the NPA incumbents , Anton is the most interested in the environment , housing , and transportation , which are the three most pressing issues facing voters if this recent credit contraction does n’t end up causing a depression .
A former prosecutor , she ’s sometimes a bit too right - wing for us when it comes to supporting the Project Civil City crackdown on the poor and the homeless in advance of the Olympics .
But she understands that climate change is elevating the risk of a huge number of migrants coming to this region in the coming years and that the future could be considerably different than the past .
She recognizes that the U.S. sunbelt is going to be terribly short of water as precipitation levels fall sharply , which could lead to a lot of Americans coming here .
She has also examined the implications of peak oil , which sets her apart from most candidates for municipal office in the region .
If anyone wants to know why she has been a bit of a zealot about EcoDensity , it stems from her examination of climate change and peak oil .
Those who suggest it ’s only because she wants to favour developers are taking cheap shots .
She reads reports and often asks sharp questions of staff .
She deserves to be reelected and would be a good opposition councillor if Vision and COPE formed a majority .
Burnaby mayor Derek Corrigan and independent park - board candidate Jamie Lee Hamilton have no difficulty challenging conventional wisdom .
Burnaby mayor Derek Corrigan and independent park - board candidate Jamie Lee Hamilton have no difficulty challenging conventional wisdom .
Heather Deal ( Vision )
Deal , a biologist , is probably the greenest Vision councillor , having worked at the David Suzuki Foundation .
She has also been one of the most vigorous and knowledgeable supporters of the arts on council .
She ’s intelligent and articulate , and if she ’s reelected , perhaps she will become a bolder politician as she ages .
We ’ve seen signs of that happening in the past year .
She asks intelligent questions of staff and delegations , and she understands the crisis that we all face as a result of climate change .
She played a constructive role during the EcoDensity debate , successfully pushing staff to emphasize more affordable housing as part of the mix .
Her party ’s policies are somewhat conservative in some areas , and the plan to allow the cycling trial on the Burrard Bridge strikes some of us as a cop-out .
But if there are going to be economic and environmental crises in the future , it would be helpful to have intelligent members on council like Deal , who can wrap their minds around complicated issues .
Michael Geller ( NPA )
Geller , a development consultant , has lots of ideas for addressing the city ’s housing crisis , thanks to his travels around the world .
He thinks the city should allow secondary suites in multifamily projects , including high - rises .
This would require reducing the minimum suite size , which is n’t such a terrible idea , given the cost of housing in the city .
He knows how much the city can extract from developers in tough economic times .
He can disagree with people without being disagreeable .
When he worked for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. in the 1970s , he played a major role in the development of the south shore of False Creek , which is an outstanding example of a mixed - income neighbourhood .
He was also the first NPA candidate to publicly question the $ 63 - million widening of the Burrard Bridge .
Geller needs to brush up on policing and peak oil , and we ’re not impressed that he ’s opposed to creating more homeless shelters in Vancouver during the current homeless crisis .
But he would n’t be a bad addition to council , given his vast knowledge of land - use issues .
Keep in mind that about half of what council does involves land , so it ’s important to have people elected who are interested in and knowledgeable about this area .
Raymond Louie ( Vision )
Louie has always been hard - working and intelligent , but he did n’t get a recommendation in 2005 because we considered his voting record to be too right - wing .
He has changed his tune somewhat in his recent term on council , though he remains a strong supporter of increasing the police force even after the crime rate has fallen sharply .
On the upside , he played an instrumental role in Vancouver ’s developing an ethical purchasing policy during his first term on council .
In his bid for a Vision mayoral nomination , he advanced democracy in Vancouver by reaching out to a broad cross-section of the city , creating a rainbow coalition of support and getting a lot more people involved in civic politics .
He voted for the $ 100 - million loan for the Olympic Village in secret , but at least he had the guts to try to open up the process after this information leaked out this month .
Louie is informed about housing issues , and he argued for a more equitable mix on the southeast shore of False Creek .
He has stood up for retaining single - room - occupancy hotels on the Downtown Eastside .
He understands regional issues , and he is perhaps the strongest Vision member on budgetary issues .
If he ’s reelected and Vision wins a majority , he ’ll likely become the chair of the city services and budgets committee .
Andrea Reimer ( Vision )
Reimer can be a bit Machiavellian , which was demonstrated by her decision to join a slate with Geoff Meggs , Jang , and Kashmir Dhaliwal to secure a Vision council nomination .
Reimer , a proponent of more women serving in politics , ensured that there would only be two women on the Vision council slate as a result of this arrangement .
On the upside , she has helped save a lot of old - growth forests in B.C. as the executive director of the Wilderness Committee , which is one of B.C. ’s leading environmental organizations .
She ’s intelligent and she was a very good school trustee from 2002 to 2005 as a member of the Green party .
Reimer has a great deal of knowledge about climate change , having learned how to present Al Gore ’s famous slide show .
She ’s 36 years old , younger than most people who will serve on council , and she brings a young person ’s values into the political arena .
She ’ll probably be a decent city councillor if she maintains her integrity and avoids making too many backroom deals with the union leaders and the developers , who have a significant influence on her party .
Geri Tramutola ( Work Less Party )
Tramutola brings a new , articulate voice to civic politics , espousing food security , a better deal for transit users , and strong support for the local arts scene .
She ’s knowledgeable about civic issues and won the “ Last Candidate Standing ” event on November 7 , which was hosted by Simon Fraser University ’s City Program and the Vancouver Public Space Network .
Tramutola is thoughtful and progressive , and if she won enough votes to get elected , she would be a terrific addition to city council .
Her party ’s platform is far more left - wing than either Vision or COPE , espousing such things as grants for local entrepreneurs who sell and distribute biodegradable takeout containers and diapers , and implementing educational programs to teach consumers to leave excess packaging at the stores where they buy their products .
She ’s also a member of the Gateway Sucks coalition .
The Work Less Party is founded on the principle that if people work less and consume less , they ’ll have more time to dedicate themselves to improving the community .
Tramutola lives up to that philosophy , which is something we might all want to aspire to if we want to avoid an environmental Armageddon .
Tramutola is also a member of the Vancouver Peak Oil Executive .
Ellen Woodsworth ( COPE )
We did n’t recommend Woodsworth in 2005 when she was running for reelection , despite her good voting record .
It was because she failed to treat COPE councillor Fred Bass with what we felt was an appropriate level of respect after Bass criticized then - mayor Larry Campbell for straying too far from COPE policies .
Woodsworth has spent three years in the penalty box and is now back seeking a second term on council .
Like her COPE colleague Cadman , Woodsworth is no friend of developers , arguing in favour of them setting aside 20 percent of units for low - income or affordable housing .
She will probably vote in favour of more homeless shelters .
If she ’s elected , Woodsworth will speak up for women ’s equality , lower transit fares , gay and lesbian rights , and a free bus service in parts of Vancouver .
She has worked hard on civic issues over the past three years , attending numerous forums .
She ’s knowledgeable about the Living in Community initiative , which is trying to bring sex - trade workers into the mainstream and turn the Pickton legacy into something positive .
If the authorities treat poor people in a shabby way as we move closer to hosting the Olympics , Woodsworth will probably be among the first on council to speak up in their defence .
She has also called for guidelines for the use of the city ’s Property Endowment Fund , which seems like a sensible idea following the controversy over the $ 100 - million loan for the Olympic Village .
Vancouver council : worth considering
Sean Bickerton ( NPA )
Bickerton , a former vice president of a major record label , is a big supporter of the arts and of equality for gays and lesbians .
If you want to vote for a candidate who will stand up for the entertainment industry , Bickerton is your man .
He ’s smart and well - intentioned , and the NPA was fortunate to lure him as a candidate .
George Chow ( Vision )
Chow is a big supporter of increasing the police force , so he might be too conservative for some .
But he is one of the most honest politicians on council .
Ask him a question and he gives you a straight answer .
He ’s also well - informed about a range of issues , including housing , and he speaks Cantonese , which will give the huge number of Cantonese speakers in Vancouver an opportunity to communicate with a city councillor in their native language .
Ian Gregson ( Work Less Party )
Gregson , a former Paralympian , is one of the city ’s biggest critics of the Olympics .
He ’s a former Green party candidate who created the 2010 watch.com Web site .
He is an East Side community activist , musician , environmentalist , and volunteer with several groups .
If you like more radical thinkers , you can vote for Gregson and be assured that you ’re getting someone who is knowledgeable about the issues .
Lea Johnson ( Independent )
Johnson , an educator and member of the Vancouver Board of Trade sustainability committee , has given a lot of thought to addressing chronic homelessness .
He says Vancouver can choose to provide the chronically homeless with a clean and secure place to sleep , access to legal services , and a place to take care of their physical and mental - health needs .
If you want to vote for someone who has n’t destroyed your trust by favouring a $ 100 - million loan in secret for the Olympic Village , you could vote for Johnson and be assured sure that you ’re not casting a ballot for a nut .
Steve Wansleeben ( Independent )
Wansleeben is extremely well - informed on a range of issues , including the Olympic Village controversy and increasing citizen involvement .
At a November 9 candidates debate , he came across as reasonable , pragmatic , and compassionate .
He ’s another candidate who is worth supporting if you ’re disgusted by the incumbents ’ handling of the Olympic Village issue .
Vancouver park board
The Vancouver park board needs members who will stand up to the staff .
Even if the public objects , park - board staff will figure out ways to justify the elimination of trees in Queen Elizabeth Park , the addition of restaurants on the beach , and the relentless expansion of the Vancouver Aquarium in Stanley Park .
The best candidate to stand up to the staff and act in the public interest is independent Jamie Lee Hamilton , who has a history of advocating for marginalized Vancouverites .
Other good choices include COPE ’s Loretta Woodcock , the NPA ’s Christopher Richardson , and Vision ’s Sarah Blyth , Aaron Jasper , Raj Hundal , and Constance Barnes , daughter of former NDP MLA Emery Barnes .
NPA incumbents should be bounced for taking away the public ’s right to vote in a referendum before any expansion of the aquarium ’s footprint in Stanley Park and for voting to cancel a plebiscite in the 2008 election on keeping cetaceans in captivity .
If you ’re of a more radical bent , you might want to vote for the Work Less Party ’s Ivan Doumenc , an articulate critic of consumerism .
The Green party has put only one candidate on the ballot : Stuart Mackinnon for park board .
He ’s a critic of privatization .
Vancouver school board
School boards do n’t have a lot of power these days .
The curriculum , school taxes , teachers ’ contracts , and the major portion of the operating grant are determined at the provincial level .
The B.C. Liberal government has a tendency to impose contracts on support staff .
That leaves school trustees in charge of hiring senior staff , shuffling money around to deal with the fallout of provincial policies , liaising with parent advisory committees , coping with demand for English - as - a - second - language programs , and pushing for seismic upgrades to keep children safe .
In our opinion , the best suited to do this in Vancouver are COPE ’s Bill Bargeman , Jane Bouey , Allan Wong , Alvin Singh , and Al Blakey ; Vision ’s Patti Bacchus , Ken Clement ( the first aboriginal candidate who might be elected in Vancouver ) , and Mike Lombardi ; and the NPA ’s Ken Denike .
Incumbent Vision trustee Sharon Gregson sets a bad example for kids by promoting gun ownership .
But if you want someone knowledgeable about all - day kindergarten , special - needs programs , and who can also relate to freaky and marginalized parents , you might want to save a vote for her .
Recommendations for suburban municipalities
Burnaby
The Burnaby Citizens Association has been in power for 21 years , probably making it the longest - serving government in B.C. history .
In an article on Straight.com , Burnaby Mayor Derek Corrigan offered a few reasons why his party has remained at the helm for so long .
There are more jobs than residents , thanks to the municipality ’s knack for luring businesses from other parts of the region .
Burnaby also puts on outstanding concerts in Deer Lake Park , something that is usually forbidden in Vancouver parks .
The Shadbolt Centre for the Arts has emerged as a leading cultural facility .
There is more .
Burnaby is debt - free , has low tax rates , and the staff produce some of the best reports in the region on important issues such as the twinning of the Port Mann Bridge and the risks posed by peak oil .
Mayor Corrigan deserves to be reelected for lots of reasons , but mostly because he remains one of the sharpest politicians in the Lower Mainland .
We need him on the board of Metro Vancouver because of his keen understanding of how the pieces of the region fit together .
Team Burnaby mayoral candidate Andrew Chisholm has tried to capitalize on what he calls “ Computergate ” — a $ 19 - million cost overrun on a municipal computer system .
At $ 19 million , according to Chisholm , it ’s way smaller than the liabilities that Vancouverites could end up facing in connection with hosting the Olympics .
Chisholm has chastised the BCA for opposing the twinning of the Port Mann Bridge .
To us , it ’s a reflection of the BCA ’s sound approach to environmental issues .
Chisholm has also claimed that Burnaby needs 100 more police in the next three years .
In the Burnaby Now , Corrigan retorted that the city approved 25 new officers in June , and another 23 were hired this year , they might reconsider their position .
BCA councillors Nick Volkow , Dan Johnston , Pietro Calendino , Sav Dhaliwal , and Colleen Jordan deserve to be reelected .
Fairchild TV host Richard Chang , special - education teacher Anne Kang , and retired Vancouver deputy fire chief Paul McDonell round out the BCA slate .
Team Burnaby councillor Lee Rankin keeps getting reelected to keep the BCA on its toes .
Rankin , a councillor for 22 years , used to be an outstanding director of Metro Vancouverd , focusing a great deal of attention on air quality and climate change .
New Westminster
To bring some sanity to the development - approval process , we ’re recommending Voice New Westminster mayoral candidate , Blair Armitage , who has managed golf and country clubs .
He has focused attention on the municipality ’s relatively high taxes , and might have more influence than Mayor Wayne Wright on regional transportation decisions .
For council , we ’re also recommending Voice candidate Steve McClurg , past president of the New Westminster Downtown Residents ’
Association and a former federal NDP candidate , as well as heritage advocate Jaimie McEvoy .
We also support incumbents Bob Osterman , Jonathan X. Cote , Bill Harper , and Lorrie Williams .
Harper has tackled the pesticide issue ; Osterman and Williams are supporters of the arts ; and Cote has strong environmental awareness and brings a young person ’s perspective to the council chamber .
North Vancouver District
Richard Walton has been acclaimed as the mayor .
For council , we ’re recommending Roger Bassam , executive assistant to defeated Liberal MP Don Bell , because of Bassam ’s knowledge of the issues .
Incumbents Lisa Muri and Robin Hicks are hardworking councillors , and they are n’t too right - wing .
John Fair is a passionate advocate for cycling and smart transportation policies .
Anyone who has cycled the streets in the district knows there ’s room for improvement in this area .
We ’re also recommending David McKee , who is an outdoor - recreation enthusiast and a strong environmentalist .
North Vancouver City
Mayor Darrell Mussatto has been acclaimed .
Bookstore owner Mary Trentadue and physical therapist Cheryl Leia would be terrific additions to council .
We ’re also recommending incumbents Craig Keating , Sam Schechter , and Pam Bookham .
They ’re all progressive politicians who support renters and community - based planning .
Incumbent councillor Bob Fearnley has made noises about running for the B.C. Liberals in North Vancouver–Lonsdale , so if you do n’t like Premier Gordon Campbell , do n’t vote for Fearnley .
West Vancouver
We ’re recommending the incumbent mayor , Pamela Goldsmith - Jones , over two challengers on council , Vivian Vaughan and John Clark .
Goldsmith - Jones recognizes that West Vancouver needs to pilot new forms of housing .
She has also consistently supported the arts .
As chair of the police board , Goldsmith - Jones can take credit for the hiring of new police Chief Kash Heed , one of the region ’s most progressive cops .
Vaughan has a strong environmental bent , but it sometimes seems like she wants to freeze West Vancouver in the past .
Clark is more conservative than Goldsmith - Jones .
For council , we like Caroleanne Reynolds , who has a history of fighting corruption .
Nora Gambioli and Trish Panz are two smart new candidates who also deserve spots on council .
Surrey
The biggest stain on Surrey politics is the lack of a ward system .
The at - large system deprives racial minorities of more representation on council , and rewards politicians with lots of money or high name recognition .
The new Surrey Civic Coalition , which includes veteran councillor Bob Bose , wants a referendum on a ward system .
This issue is so important that we ’re recommending that people vote for the entire SCC slate : Bose , Rina Gill , Jim McMurtry , Grant Rice , and Stephanie Ryan .
When Bose proposed that a ward system be put on the ballot this year , every other member of council voted against the idea .
For taking such an antidemocratic stand , we think all other incumbents , including Mayor Dianne Watts , should be defeated .
We recommend mayoral candidate Murray Weisenberger , who strongly supports a ward system .
Richmond
We think Malcom Brodie should be defeated as mayor because we were n’t impressed by his voting record on the TransLink board , which includes raising fares .
He also has n’t been a strong protector of farmland .
We ’re recommending mayoral candidate Ivan Gerlach , a bakery owner who is unhappy with the level of taxation .
For council , we strongly recommend incumbents Harold Steves , Linda Barnes , Evalina Halsey - Brandt , and newcomer Michael Wolfe , who have fought for the preservation of farmland .
In addition , we think it would be wise to elect former mayor and former MLA Greg Halsey - Brandt , who is seeking a council seat after three years out of politics .
The council could benefit from his knowledge as a professional planner .
His ex-wife , Sue Halsey - Brandt , is an advocate of sensible land - use policies , which is why she should be reelected .
Delta
Metro Vancouver chair Lois Jackson deserves to be reelected as Delta ’s mayor .
She has been a passionate defender of farmland .
Jackson has helped arrest the right - wing drift of the regional district by installing Burnaby mayor Derek Corrigan as chair of the land - use and transportation committee , and Richmond councillor Harold Steves as chair of a new agriculture committee .
Jackson ’s chief opponent , Delta councillor Krista Engelland , has made a strong case that the bureaucrats are running the municipality because Jackson is distracted by regional concerns .
Engelland thinks more could be done on the power - line issue , and there needs to be an even stronger focus on preserving agricultural land and reducing truck traffic .
Perhaps she ’s right , but the region is better off with Jackson as the Metro Vancouver chair .
Port Moody
Mayor Joe Trasolini supported the Canada Line a few years ago based on a promise that his city would get rapid transit .
It still has n’t happened .
Trasolini has also supported real - estate developments over the objections of local residents , which suggests he ’s showing signs of forgetting who elected him .
His most serious opponent is Shane Kennedy , who posted a credible seven - point plan .
We are cautiously recommending Kennedy , even though he supports the federal Conservatives .
Councillors Bob Elliott , Karen Rockwell , and Megan Lahti are all progressive voices who would offset any rightward tilt on the slim chance that Kennedy defeats Trasolini .
Coquitlam
Councillor and former Liberal MLA Richard Stewart is trying to defeat incumbent Maxine Wilson .
We think Mayor Wilson deserves another term for focusing more attention than previous mayors on environmental issues , suburban sprawl , and sensible regional policies .
Her opponent , Coun. Richard Stewart , was once a director of the New Home Warranty Program , which failed to protect owners of leaky condos .
Since then , the former Liberal MLA has morphed into a populist , promoting cycling and opposing visits by door - to - door salespeople .
For council , it ’s important to reelect Fin Donnelly , a champion of the environment and aboriginal rights .
Councillor Barrie Lynch is another intelligent politician who deserves to be reelected .
Port Coquitlam
Two councillors , Mike Bowen and Greg Moore , are seeking Scott Young ’s job .
We favour Bowen over Moore , a former B.C. Liberal candidate .
Bowen has been on council since 2001 and has served on several committees .
Bowen is also on the Tri-Cities Homelessness Task Force .
Pitt Meadows
We ’re recommending Mayor Don MacLean because he ’s smart and relatively humble .
He was an effective TransLink director in the past , standing up for taxpayers with his opposition to the Canada Line .
Maple Ridge
The preservation of farmland is a huge issue in Maple Ridge , where NDP MLA Michael Sather is running for mayor against populist incumbent Gordy Robson and right - wing councillor Ernie Daykin .
The mercurial Robson promised to serve one term , but now wants to be reelected .
We think Sather is a better choice .
Langley
In the City of Langley , mayoral candidate Ron Abgrall has far more progressive views than incumbent Peter Fassbender .
Abgrall , a political neophyte , opposes the twinning of the Port Mann Bridge , supports the preservation of farmland , and advocates a humane approach to dealing with the homeless and drug- addicted .
In Langley Township , we ’re making no recommendation for mayor because incumbent Kurt Alberts and challenger Rick Green do not support drug - harm - reduction measures .
For those looking to feed their idle photo printers , one of the most magnificent photo archives of the past century is now available on Google .
It ’s the Life magazine collection , some 10 million images altogether , from Marilyn Monroe and J.F.K. to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .
After the deal between Google and the keepers of the Life archive , a vast chunk is now at Google Image Search .
“ Only a small percentage of these images have ever been published , ” Google said in a statement .
“ The rest have been sitting in dusty archives in the form of negatives , slides , glass plates , etchings and prints . ”
A spokeswoman for Time Inc. said that the archives in their entirety would be available in the first quarter of next year .
The collection includes the entire works of the Life photographers Alfred Eisenstaedt , Gjon Mili and Nina Leen .
Also available are : the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination ; Dahlstrom glass plates of New York from the 1880s ; and Hugo Jaeger on Nazi-era Germany .
Cruising through the catalog is an amazing journey , even if you ’re just browsing .
Check out Audrey Hepburn at the Oscars in 1954 , Carl Mydans photographing the slums of Washington , D.C. , in the ’30s , and incredible portfolios of both world wars , including about 200 of Robert Capa ’s stunning images .
Raw video , Texas , November 12/08 : A police chase through Texas ' northwest Harris County ended when the fleeing driver went the wrong - way on a freeway and collided with an SUV Wednesday .
The chase started in Jersey Village shortly before 2 p.m.
Police blocked off parts of the freeway to protect other drivers and prevent the fleeing driver from exiting the freeway .
The driver drove eastbound in the westbound lanes until he bumped into a vehicle traveling the correct direction , lost control and was hit by an oncoming SUV .
The fleeing driver 's vehicle spun across the roadway and came to a stop for a moment .
The driver continued for a short while before he lost control again and ended up in a muddy ditch .
Police pulled the man out of the vehicle and took him into custody .
Investigators said the chase reached speeds of about 100 mph .
Detectives said they began chasing the man because he was allegedly breaking windows at a car dealership .

Rick Astley has been named the Best Act Ever by MTV .
Yes , you read that right .
The online Rickrolling phenomenon – whereby the 80s popster 's hit Never Gonna Give You Up has been hidden behind a variety of fake links – reached its terrifying apex at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Liverpool last night ( November 6 ) .
In what has already been a momentous week for democracy , Astley 's loyal army of supporters successfully led to him victory in the publicly - voted category , beating U2 , Green Day , Britney Spears and Tokio Hotel to the hyperbolic honour .
In April this year , SurveyUSA estimated that 18 m American adults had been Rickrolled .
Astley himself did not turn up for the ceremony .
Instead , the award was collected on his behalf by US gossip blogger Perez Hilton .
Britney Spears was able to console herself with the rather less historic award of Best Act of 2008 and Best Album for last year 's Blackout , an astonishing turnaround from her disastrous performance of Gimme More at last year 's Video Music Awards .
Other winners included Pink , whose smash hit So What was named Most Addictive Track , the Rock Out award went to Jared Leto's 30 Seconds to Mars and Kanye West was named Ultimate Urban act .
Live performers at the Liverpool Echo Arena included the Killers , Pink , Take That and Duffy .
The ceremony was hosted by Katy Perry , who won Best New Act .
As reported yesterday , Sir Paul McCartney was named Ultimate Legend – though it is n't clear whether this is a higher honour than the one bestowed upon Astley .
The finding supports scientific evidence accumulating over the past decade that sexual orientation may be innately programmed into the brains of men and women .
Equally intriguing , the researchers say , is the possibility that a number of behaviors -- hitting back when feeling threatened , fleeing when scared or laughing when amused -- may also be programmed into human brains , a product of genetic heritage .
" This is a first -- a superb demonstration that a single gene can serve as a switch for complex behaviors , " said Dr. Gero Miesenboeck , a professor of cell biology at Yale .
Dr. Dickson , the lead author , said he ran into the laboratory when an assistant called him on a Sunday night with the results .
" This really makes you think about how much of our behavior , perhaps especially sexual behaviors , has a strong genetic component , " he said .
All the researchers cautioned that any of these wired behaviors set by master genes will probably be modified by experience .
Though male fruit flies are programmed to pursue females , Dr. Dickson said , those that are frequently rejected over time become less aggressive in their mating behavior .
When a normal male fruit fly is introduced to a virgin female , they almost immediately begin foreplay and then copulate for 20 minutes .
In fact , Dr. Dickson and his co-author , Dr. Ebru Demir of the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology , specifically chose to look for the genetic basis of fly sexual behavior precisely because it seemed so strong and instinctive and , therefore , predictable .
Scientists have known for several years that the master sexual gene , known as fru , was central to mating , coordinating a network of neurons that were involved in the male fly 's courtship ritual .
Last year , Dr. Bruce Baker of Stanford University discovered that the mating circuit controlled by the gene involved 60 nerve cells and that if any of these were damaged or destroyed by the scientists , the animal could not mate properly .
Both male and female flies have the same genetic material as well as the neural circuitry required for the mating ritual , but different parts of the genes are turned on in the two sexes .
But no one dreamed that simply activating the normally dormant male portion of the gene in a female fly could cause a genetic female to display the whole elaborate panoply of male fruit fly foreplay .
Memo to Sci-Fi Movie Development Dept.Re : Plant People ConceptHere are the specifics for the aliens in our next movie , VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF THE PLANT PEOPLE .
The people there are vegetarians , eating salads , seaweed drinks , etc .
They are green , because when they digest their meals , their bodies move some of the plant matter to their skin .
They use it to capture energy from the sun through photosynthesis .
So the aliens sit outside in the sun a lot , getting lots of energy and growing to huge sizes , which is why they 're so hard to kill when Earthlings show up .
I see the people from Blue Man Group -- just add some yellow and we 're set .
Or maybe William Dafoe ?
Behold , Hollywood , the sea slug Elysia chlorotica .
This emerald green slug grazes on algae .
As it breaks down the algae , it preserves their photosynthetic structures , called plastids .
The plastids are shipped to the surface of its body , where they can continue to photosynthesize .
The slug thus makes a living as plants do .
And it turns a beautiful shade of green along the way .
Recently , some scientists discovered that the sea slug is even more plantlike than previously thought thought .
They wondered if some genes from the algae the slug ate had become incorporated into their own DNA .
This movement of genes is called horizontal gene transfer .
It 's common among bacteria , which swap genes for antibiotic resistance and such .
It 's not as common among multicellular creatures , but it has happened a number of times .
For example , our ancestors swallowed up bacteria that eventually became our mitochondria , the structures in our cells that use oxygen to generate energy .
Mitochondria still have some of their own bacterial genes , and other bacterial genes have moved into our own DNA .
The ancestors of green algae and plants swallowed up photosynthetic bacteria and harnessed their ability to photosynthesize .
Those bacteria became plastids .
The p of the genes from the plastids are now part of the DNA of plants .
Mary Rumpho of the University of Maine and her colleagues suspected that something like this had happened to the sea slugs .
They were struck by the fact that the plastids continue to function in the slugs for months after they 've been extracted from algae .
But plastids normally can't function on their own .
They need help from proteins encoded by genes that are now carried in the algae 's DNA .
It was possible that the slugs were making the proteins for their plastids .
So Rumpho 's group gathered up some sea slugs off the coast of Martha 's Vineyard and took a look at their DNA .
They also took a look at the DNA of the one species of algae that the slugs put in their skin .
As they suspected , the plasmids do n't have all the genes necessary for photosynthesis .
The scientists discovered a crucial photosynthesis gene , called psbO , in the DNA of the slug .
In fact , the sequence of the slug 's psbO gene is identical to the one in the species of algae that supplies them with their plastids .
Now that scientists can peer into genomes without too much difficulty , they 're probably going to find a lot of these gene transfers , and some of them are going to turn out to be big leaps -- like the jump from the plant kingdom to the animal kingdom .
What I want to know is how a photosynthesis gene from the nucleus of algae got integrated into the DNA of the slug that eats it .
I also want to know why other plant - eating animals did n't merge with their food as well .
Why are n't sheep green ?
And finally , when will Voyage to the Planet of the Plant People wrap up ?
Until then , you can enjoy Rumpho 's great web site dedicated to this symbiosis -- complete with slug videos .
When McCain said he was confident that he would win with a surge in the wee hours of November 5th during the final counting was there more truth in this statement than he was letting on ?
Two weeks ago , former Bush operative Karl Rove was confidently saying that John McCain could win ten battleground states to become President .
Monday , the day before the election , Republican IT specialist Mike Connell , a Karl Rove protégé , was forced to testify in front of a Cleveland federal judge about a number of serious allegations with regards to hijacking vote results in Ohio during the 2004 presidential election .
Interestingly , Karl Rove changed his tune after the testimony and said on the eve of the election that Barack Obama would win in a landslide .
Could cyber-attacks and manipulation of transmitted vote tallies still have occurred in Minnesota - like what was described during Mike Connell 's testimony the day before - altering vote tallies in the Presidential and Senate elections as they were tabulated throughout the early morning hours of November 5th ?
Of course the Presidential election turned out to be a landslide and so attempts at fraud would have been overwhelmed by the lopsided victory for Barack Obama .
However , the Senate race between Republican incumbent Norm Coleman and Democratic challenger Al Franken was always expected to be very close .
And these expectations did not disappoint .
A neck and neck running vote tally occurred throughout the night with numerous lead changes and by Wednesday morning Norm Coleman had a slight lead of 762 votes in the uncertified results .
This lead was however well within the guidelines of Minnesota election law dictating a recount by hand of the paper ballots if the final difference between candidates is within 0.5 % of the total votes cast .
In this case a 762 vote difference out of 2.9 million votes cast was a difference of only 0.01 % , well within the designated 0.5 % that would trigger an automatic recount .
Since Wednesday morning , a number of clerical errors and final vote tallies have created adjustments in the vote totals for both candidates and has made the race even tighter .
Currently an unofficial tally of 221 votes separates Republican Norm Coleman and DFLer Al Franken .
Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said that adjustments in the days following the election are a normal part of the canvassing process .
Counties must certify their results today , then send their results to the state by Friday .
The state of Minnesota has until November 18th to certify the election .
After this , the election recount will start and is expected to take a few weeks .
In the meantime the two competing campaigns have begun firing accusations at each other .
One of the more serious accusations involves a Norm Coleman staffer that acted as a Somali translator on election day and at one point a GOP challenger and was accused of trying to illegally influence Somali voters at the polling place to cast votes for Norm Coleman .
A very serious allegation if proven true .

Bug -eyed warriors : Troops will see out of the corner of their eyes with revolutionary new night sight
British frontline troops will soon be able to see better in the dark using a revolutionary night sight modelled on the eyes of a tiny parasite .
The digital device , worn over one eye and attached to a helmet , will allow soldiers to spot an enemy out of the corner of their eyes without even moving their head .
The device has been developed from studies into the 50 raspberry - like eyes of the Xenos peckii insect – a tiny bug that lives inside the bodies of paper wasps .
British troops will soon be using digital night goggles which will allow them to spot an enemy out of the corner of their eyes ( file picture )
The insect ’s visual system – which is not found in any other living creature – creates an image from a mosaic of pixels similar to those on a digital camera , to give a wide field of vision .
And the new kit , which has nine lenses , will provide troops with 60 degrees of peripheral vision , twice the level of their current night - vision goggles .
Lesley Laycock , executive scientist with BAE Systems , which is working on the project with the Ministry of Defence , said : ‘ There ’s a requirement to reduce the size and weight of night - vision goggles and to get a wider field of view .
‘ Soldiers fight a lot at night but at the moment night - vision goggles get only a tunnel 30 to 40 - degree field of view .
The key is to get their sight wider and to be as natural as possible . ’
The new ‘ bug - eye ’ lenses may be used later to improve the field of vision for CCTV cameras .
And they will give infantry soldiers and helicopters fitted with the technology a huge boost on the battlefield .
They are due to come into use within three years .
As well as having the potential to save lives , the device ’s images will be linked through secure military networks to commanders who can watch and record their soldiers at work on a video screen .
The Xenos peckii parasite lives a short and secretive life .
Females are sightless and never leave the wasp host whose body they inhabit .
But the males , once mature , must leave to find a mate and they have just hours to complete the task before they die .
The males are guided to the general area of the females by sex pheremones and then to their specific location by their amazing eyesight .
An MoD spokesman said last night : ‘ Troops acknowledge they now have better equipment on the front line than ever before .
‘ We have a duty of care to our Armed Forces and we welcome developments to personal equipment such as body armour , helmets and goggles that improve the safety and effectiveness of our troops . ’
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) -
The Internet is not just changing the way people live but altering the way our brains work with a neuroscientist arguing this is an evolutionary change which will put the tech - savvy at the top of the new social order .
A functional MRI brain scans show how searching the Internet dramatically engages brain neural networks ( in red ) .
The image on the left displays brain activity while reading a book ; the image on the right displays activity while engaging in an Internet search .
REUTERS / UCLA / Handout
Gary Small , a neuroscientist at UCLA in California who specializes in brain function , has found through studies that Internet searching and text messaging has made brains more adept at filtering information and making snap decisions .
But while technology can accelerate learning and boost creativity it can have drawbacks as it can create Internet addicts whose only friends are virtual and has sparked a dramatic rise in Attention Deficit Disorder diagnoses .
Small , however , argues that the people who will come out on top in the next generation will be those with a mixture of technological and social skills .
“ We ’re seeing an evolutionary change .
The people in the next generation who are really going to have the edge are the ones who master the technological skills and also face - to - face skills , ” Small told Reuters in a telephone interview .
“ They will know when the best response to an email or Instant Message is to talk rather than sit and continue to email . ”
In his newly released fourth book “ iBrain : Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind , ” Small looks at how technology has altered the way young minds develop , function and interpret information .
Small , the director of the Memory & Aging Research Center at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior and the Center on Aging at UCLA , said the brain was very sensitive to the changes in the environment such as those brought by technology .
He said a study of 24 adults as they used the Web found that experienced Internet users showed double the activity in areas of the brain that control decision - making and complex reasoning as Internet beginners .
“ The brain is very specialized in its circuitry and if you repeat mental tasks over and over it will strengthen certain neural circuits and ignore others , ” said Small .
“ We are changing the environment .
The average young person now spends nine hours a day exposing their brain to technology .
Evolution is an advancement from moment to moment and what we are seeing is technology affecting our evolution . ”
Small said this multi-tasking could cause problems .
He said the tech - savvy generation , whom he calls “ digital natives , ” are always scanning for the next bit of new information which can create stress and even damage neural networks .
“ There is also the big problem of neglecting human contact skills and losing the ability to read emotional expressions and body language , ” he said .
“ But you can take steps to address this .
It means taking time to cut back on technology , like having a family dinner , to find a balance .
It is important to understand how technology is affecting our lives and our brains and take control of it . ”
An Open World Half - Life 3 : Who Are Still Betting on It in 2018 ?
It has been a rumor that never went out of sight and mind among Half - Life enthusiasts .
And they are hoping for this open world concept to be featured in Half - Life 3 .
What does an open - world Half - Life 3 look like for fans ?
Project Borealis
Amidst rumors and speculations , certain fans have decided to develop a game out of a former Valve ( creator of the Half - Life franchise ) writer ’s synopsis for Half - Life 3 .
Now , this is n’t an official synopsis but that did not stop those modders from creating a project that they felt belong to the Half - Life universe and could very well be Half - Life 3 .
Enter Project Borealis .
The project dropped a teaser on what the unofficial sequel would look like in terms of animation , weaponry , and movement .
Open -World Half - Life 3
Open world gameplay allows players to roam freely in a virtual environment .
Half - Life , on the other hand , hinges on a linear gameplay with an objective amid hallways , walls , etc .
While some fans reasoned why Half - Life should not venture into that path , other enthusiasts still hope for the game to be open - ended with ideas on how to go about it .
For instance , u/ therealsoret posted on Half - Life ’s subreddit saying that there must be a sequel with World War II as a backdrop , that is before the incident at Black Mesa Research Facility .
It will be set in Italy with the players fighting against Nazis or anything .
Some who responded to the thread felt that the WWII setting would make it any other video games with such concept , like Wolfenstein , Day of Defeat , Day of Infamy , and Medal of Honor .
A Redditor intimated that the Half - Life world pre-Black Mesa Incident is no different from this world to which the original poster responded that Projekt Kaskade , which offers an alternative perspective to the Half - Life saga , could have been a good sequel .
One Redditor did suggest that the infancy days of Black Mesa in the 70s as a basis for a prequel .
How is Half - Life 3 shaping up for you ?

Barack Obama 's unique campaign infomercial was watched by more than one out of every five of American households watching TV last night , giving the programme a healthy audience share , according to preliminary ratings released today .
The 30 - minute show – subtitled American Stories , American Solutions – won 21.7 % of viewers in the top local markets monitored by Nielsen , the compiler of US TV ratings .
The advert appeared on every major US TV network save ABC , as well as several cable channels .
With sweeping cinematography and soothing music reminiscent of Ronald Reagan 's Morning in America commercials in the 1980s , the programme featured Obama meeting voters who face financial troubles and closed with a live speech by the Democrat .
At a price tag of more than $ 4 m , the infomercial was hardly geared as a risky move , and most reactions to the advert praised its painstaking choreography .
" Every single line during that 30 minutes was something that the campaign knows works and appeals to those undecided voters , " ABC analyst George Stephanopoulos , a veteran of the Clinton White House , wrote on his blog .
" What you saw here was a highly competent , professional , virtuoso performance . "
Howard Wolfson , a longtime strategist for Hillary Clinton , praised Obama for mingling details with emotion .
The programme " effectively interspersed geographically and ethnically diverse tales of middle - class hardship … with specific policy details , " he wrote .
Many pundits pointed to the Reagan - esque nature of the advert , which was produced by Davis Guggenheim , the director of Al Gore 's climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth .
Like the Morning in America commercials - credited with helping Reagan win re-election in 1984 - Obama 's programme was " designed to give the audience a sense of security and satisfaction ; things are going to be all right , " Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales wrote today .
The homage to Reagan 's techniques did not sit well with every critic .
Alan Schroeder , a journalism professor at Northeastern University in Massachusetts , described the Obama infomercial as a retread of the political advertising motifs grown outdated .
" In the world of campaign commercials , it has been ' morning in America ' [ a Reagan slogan ] since the 1980s , and the shtick is getting tired , " Schroeder wrote in an online reaction to Politico.com .
" As a ' change ' candidate , Barack Obama would have been better served by production values that demonstrate a break from the past rather than the same old sun-kissed amber waves of grain . "
But Schroeder conceded the spot 's likely success : " On the plus side , the infomercial wisely kept its focus on the voters instead of the candidate - in that sense it was probably effective . "
The tabloid newspapers of New York City added a sarcastic touch to their coverage of the programme , depicting Obama as a late - night pitchman hawking the " Obama - matic " and household products labelled " HOPE ! " .
One crop of decidedly unimpressed viewers last night resided at John McCain 's campaign headquarters , exemplified by the reaction statement from Republican spokesman Tucker Bounds .
" As anyone who has bought anything from an infomercial knows , the sales - job is always better than the product , " Bounds said .
" Buyer beware . "
The young and minority voters who swept Democrats to triumph call this the start of a new day .
The many not - young whites who also backed Barack Obama might frame it a bit differently .
To them , it 's a hopeful return to an older day .
Do not dismiss these older Caucasians .
Without their considerable support in swing states , Obama would not have won .
This amazing election is being called a liberal landslide , but it does n't feel liberal .
It 's at bottom a reaction against the radical philosophy that called itself conservative but ran up deficits , blustered on the world stage , denigrated science , served the rich and ignored the working class .
To many older voters , the middle - class paradise of their youth had turned into an economic purgatory in which workers dodge the falling shards of free markets running amok .
They remember when America , if not always loved , was respected for its economic as well as military might .
They now see other countries taking care of business as America drains its
Treasury to fight two wars , one of which it did n't have to get into .

The overthrow of 2008 was a cry for old - fashioned order .
This election has been likened to Democrats ' devastating losses in 1968 and 1972 presidential races .
While the losing party back then was liberal and the one in 2008 allegedly conservative , the reason for their defeats is similar .
The parties in power did n't keep order .
As Rick Pearlstein asserts in his book " Nixonland " Richard Nixon 's victories were n't a backlash to Democrat Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society .
Those social programs were popular , and rather than rein them in , Nixon added on .
What prompted voters to send Democrats home were the race riots and the agony of the Vietnam War .
Pearlstein describes what made Americans crazy back then :
" Turn on the TV : burning huts in Vietnam .
Turn on the TV : burning buildings in Watts .
Turn on the TV : one set of young people were comparing another set of young people to Nazis , and Da Nang was equated with Nagasaki . "
Turn on the TV in the Bush administration , and what do you see ?
American soldiers bogged down in a complicated Mideast country , their reason for being there exposed as a lie .
A government paralyzed by incompetence days after a category 4 hurricane engulfed a major American city .
Factories closing , house values swooning and stock prices collapsing .
In a stroke of brilliance , Obama balanced his liberal voting record and exotic background with a conservative manner .
His middle - American cadences and controlled rhetoric spoke of a balanced politics and comforted many older doubters .
And he had help from the left , which managed to not scare the public .
In 2008 , there were no high - profile Democrats like Robert F. Kennedy , who in 1964 excused the deadly racial rioting as follows : " There 's no point in telling Negroes to obey the law .
To many Negroes , the law is the enemy . "
In this election , the right had to resort to fringe figures for inflammatory leftist remarks .
Or it dredged up a formerly violent ' 60s radical , Bill Ayers , now an educator in Chicago .
The pendulum does n't care whether it's on the left or right .
When it spends too much time on one side , it returns to the other .
Only a few years ago , then - Bush mastermind Karl Rove predicted a " permanent Republican majority . "
No majority is everlasting , and Democrats must know that .
But if they use their time in the sun carefully , they 'll have a good run .
Obama 's every other word was " change . "
Good luck in effecting it , but remember this :
The change a lot of voters wanted was a change back to what they had .

It is generally thought that skilled behavior in human beings results from a functional hierarchy of the motor control system , within which reusable motor primitives are flexibly integrated into various sensori - motor sequence patterns .
The underlying neural mechanisms governing the way in which continuous sensori - motor flows are segmented into primitives and the way in which series of primitives are integrated into various behavior sequences have , however , not yet been clarified .
In earlier studies , this functional hierarchy has been realized through the use of explicit hierarchical structure , with local modules representing motor primitives in the lower level and a higher module representing sequences of primitives switched via additional mechanisms such as gate - selecting .
When sequences contain similarities and overlap , however , a conflict arises in such earlier models between generalization and segmentation , induced by this separated modular structure .
To address this issue , we propose a different type of neural network model .
The current model neither makes use of separate local modules to represent primitives nor introduces explicit hierarchical structure .
Rather than forcing architectural hierarchy onto the system , functional hierarchy emerges through a form of self - organization that is based on two distinct types of neurons , each with different time properties ( “ multiple timescales ” ) .
Through the introduction of multiple timescales , continuous sequences of behavior are segmented into reusable primitives , and the primitives , in turn , are flexibly integrated into novel sequences .
In experiments , the proposed network model , coordinating the physical body of a humanoid robot through high - dimensional sensori- motor control , also successfully situated itself within a physical environment .
Our results suggest that it is not only the spatial connections between neurons but also the timescales of neural activity that act as important mechanisms leading to functional hierarchy in neural systems .
Functional hierarchy in neural systems , defined as the principle that complex entities may be segmented into simpler elements and that simple elements may be integrated into a complex entity , is a challenging area of study in neuroscience .
Such a functional hierarchy may be thought of intuitively in two ways : as hierarchy in space , and as hierarchy in time .
An example of hierarchy in space is visual information processing , where elemental information in narrow receptive fields is integrated into complex features of a visual image in a larger space .
Hierarchy in time is exemplified by auditory information processing , where syllable - level information within a short time window is integrated into word - level information over a longer time window .
Although extensive investigations have illuminated the neural mechanisms of spatial hierarchy , those governing temporal hierarchy are less clear .
In the current study , we demonstrate that functional hierarchy can self - organize through multiple timescales in neural activity , without explicit spatial hierarchical structure .
Our results suggest that multiple timescales are an essential factor leading to the emergence of functional hierarchy in neural systems .
This work could contribute to providing clues regarding the puzzling observation of such hierarchy in the absence of spatial hierarchical structure .
Introduction
Functional hierarchy , defined broadly as the principle that complex entities may be segmented into simpler elements and that simple elements may be integrated into a complex entity , is a ubiquitous feature of information processing in biological neural systems [ 1 ] – [ 4 ] .
For example , in primary sensory areas such as VI and SI , the receptive field of neurons is relatively small , and these neurons respond to features of the stimulus that are simpler than those responded to by higher associative areas .
Determining how these functional hierarchies are implemented in neural systems is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience .
The human motor control system is a representative example of a system with functional hierarchy .
Humans acquire a number of skilled behaviors through the experience of repeatedly carrying out the same movements .
Certain components of such movements , through repetitive experiences , are segmented into reusable elements referred to as “ primitives ” .
In adapting to various situations , series of motor primitives are in turn also integrated into diverse sequential behavior .
The idea underlying this basic process was proposed by Arbib in terms of “ schema theory ” [ 5 ] , and has since been used as the basis for many studies ( e.g . [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ) .
The action of drinking a cup of coffee , for example , may be broken down into a combination of motor primitives such as the motion of reaching for a cup on the table , and the motion of grasping the cup and bringing it to one 's mouth .
Ideally , these motor primitives should be represented in generalized manner , in the sense that the representation should be adaptive for differences in locations and in shapes of the cup .
Primitives must also be flexible with respect to changes in the sequence of actions ; for example , after grasping a cup , one sometimes brings the cup to one 's mouth to drink , but one also sometimes takes the cup off the table to wash up .
It is this adaptability ( intra - primitive level ) and flexibility ( inter - primitive level ) of primitives that allow humans to generate countless patterns of sequential behavior .
A number of biological observations suggest the existence of motor primitives .
At the behavioral level , Thoroughman [ 8 ] for example showed that humans learn the dynamics of reaching motions through a flexible combination of movement elements .
Sakai showed that , in visuomotor sequential learning , human subjects spontaneously segmented motor sequences into elementary movements [ 9 ] .
At the level of animal muscle movement , Giszter [ 10 ] , through observations of muscle movement in the frog 's leg , found that there are a finite number of linearly combinable modules , organized in terms of muscle synergies on limbs .
At the brain level , meanwhile , it has been shown that electrical stimulation in the primary motor and premotor cortex of the monkey brain evokes coordinated movements , such as reaching and grasping [ 11 ] .
These observations strongly suggest that the diversity of behavior sequences in animals is made up of flexible combinations of reusable movement elements , i.e. motor primitives .
What is not yet clear , however , is what underlying neural mechanisms govern the segmentation of continuous sensori - motor flows into primitives , and how series of primitives are combined into a variety of different behavior sequences .
To address this issue , we propose a neural network model for describing the neural mechanisms of segmentation and integration in continuous sensori - motor flows .
This work can , as such , be seen as one possible neural implementation of schema theory .
In experiments , the proposed network model was tested through the interaction of a humanoid robot with a physical environment , the robot requiring high - dimensional sensori - motor control .
The robotics experiment is important when one considers the idea of the embodied mind by Varela [ 12 ] , who explained that cognitive functions of neural systems emerge not only in the brain , but also in dynamic interactions between the physical body and the environment ( see also a recent review [ 13 ] ) .
This idea is also related to the so - called “ synthetic approach ” to neuroscience ( or “ robotic neuroscience ” ) , an approach which has as its aim to extract essential mechanisms of neural systems using a variety of neuro - cognitive robotics experiments [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
There exist earlier studies on the computational modeling of functional hierarchy in sequences of motor primitives , representative examples being the “ mixture of expert ” model [ 16 ] and the “ MOSAIC ” model [ 17 ] .
In these studies , functional hierarchy is realized through the use of explicit hierarchical structure , with local modules representing motor primitives in the lower level , and a higher module representing the order of motor primitives switched via additional mechanisms such as gate - selection ( Figure 1A ) .
We refer to this type of model as the “ local representation ” model .

( A ) Curves colored red , blue , and green represent sensori- motor sequences corresponding to motor primitives .
Output of the system consists of behavior sequences made up of combinations of these primitives .
In the local representation model , functional hierarchy is realized through the use of explicit hierarchical structure , with local modules representing motor primitives in the lower level , and a higher module representing the order of motor primitives switched via additional mechanisms such as gate - selection .
( B ) In the multiple timescale model , primitives are represented by fast context units whose activity changes quickly , whereas sequences of primitives are represented by slow context units whose activity changes slowly .

There are a number of possible advantages to the local representation .
First , the learning of one module would seem not to affect other modules .
Second , based on this independence in the learning process , it would seem that increasing the number of local modules would lead to an increase in the number of acquirable primitives .
An earlier study using multiple sensori - motor sequences , however , demonstrated that difficult problems arise in the local representation model as a result of its local nature [ 18 ] .
Similarities in learned sensori - motor sequences create competition in the learning process between corresponding modules .
Generalization requires similar patterns to be represented in the same module as the same primitive , even subtle differences exist in the treatment of sets of between such patterns .
On the other hand , for the purposes of achieving “ crisp ” segmentation of sensory - motor flow , different patterns must be represented as separate primitives in distinct modules .
This conflict between generalization and segmentation poses serious problems in the treatment of set of multiple sensori - motor sequences within which there are similarities and overlap .
Due to the difficulty of this problem , it is not possible to increase the number of acquirable primitives simply by increasing the number of local modules [ 18 ] .
In addition , due to the explicit hierarchical structure of the local representation , learning of the lower module ( primitives ) and learning of the higher module ( sequences of primitives ) have to be explicitly separated through subgoals arbitrarily set by the experimenter [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
In order to overcome difficulties associated with the local representation model , we introduce in the current study a different type of representation for functional hierarchy .
The representation we use neither makes use of separate local modules to represent primitives , nor introduces explicit hierarchical structure to manipulate these primitives .
Instead of setting up an explicit hierarchy , we attempt to realize the self - organization of a functional hierarchy by means of neural activity with multiple timescales .
This functional hierarchy is made possible through the use of two distinct types of neurons , each with different temporal properties .
The first type of neuron is the “ fast ” unit , whose activity changes quickly over the short term .
The second type of neuron is the “ slow ” unit , whose activity changes over the long term ( Figure 1B ) .
The idea that multiple timescales may carry advantages for neural systems in interacting with complex environments is intuitively understandable .
Indeed , the importance of multiple timescales in neural systems has been emphasized in a number of earlier studies from various different fields .
For example , at the level of behavior , it has been shown that the process of acquiring motor skills develops through multiple timescales [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
Biological observations on motor adaptation , such as for example saccade adaptation and force field adaptation , likewise suggest that these processes involve distinct subsystems with differing timescales [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
At the level of neural synchrony , meanwhile , it is thought that differing timescales in neural synchrony are involved at different levels of information processing , such as for example in local and global interactions of brain regions [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
These previous studies strongly suggest the possibility that multiple timescales may be essential for the emergence of functional hierarchy in neural systems .
At the neuron level , the use of timescale variation has also been proposed as a means of representing different levels of functionality .
In a study of auditory perception , for example , Poeppel [ 25 ] hypothesized that different temporal integration windows in neural activities correspond to a perceptual hierarchy between formant transition level and syllable level .
In a study of an evolutional neural network model using a mobile robot , Nolfi [ 26 ] showed that a model with differing temporal integration windows is superior to the normal model in cases in which the robot is required to achieve two different tasks : collision avoidance , which requires short - term sensori - motor control , and self - localization , which requires long - term sensory integration .
Furthermore , Paine [ 27 ] showed that , using a similar evolutional neural network model with a mobile robot , it was possible to achieve hierarchical functionality of motor primitives ( wall avoidance ) and execution of a given sequence of primitives ( global goals ) through a particular constraint on neural connectivity .
In this model , one part of the network evolved so as to be responsible for primitives with fast dynamics , whereas another part of the network evolved so as to be responsible for sequences of primitives with slower dynamics .
Paine 's study is similar to the current study in that , in the functional hierarchy between motor primitives and behavior sequences , no separate local modules are used to represent primitives , and neither is any explicit hierarchical structure used to manipulate these primitives .
In the current study , however , our focus is on studying the impact to neural activity of multiple timescales .
Unlike the earlier study by Paine , in which multiple timescales evolved as a result of an explicit requirement for different levels of functionality , in the current study we investigate whether functional hierarchy can self - organize through the imposition of constraints on timescales of the network .
The proposed model will show that , through repetitive execution of skilled behavioral tasks , continuous sensori- motor flows are segmented into reusable motor primitives ( adaptable to differences in location ) , and segmented primitives are flexibly integrated into new behavior sequences .
The model does this without setting up an explicit sub - goal or functions such as gate - selection for manipulating primitives in the lower module , deriving this functional hierarchy instead through the use of distinct types of neurons , each with different temporal properties .
The main focus of the current study is on the question of how temporal behavior sequences can arise from neural dynamics .
Thus we chose a dynamical systems approach [ 28 ] using a neural network model rather than a statistical model , the latter of which is often used as a powerful tool for studying mechanisms of neural systems [ 29 ] – [ 31 ] .
Among dynamical systems models , the use of physiologically detailed models with spiking neurons has become popular in explaining accumulated neurophysiological findings [ 32 ] – [ 34 ] .
It is nonetheless still difficult to reproduce diverse sequential behavior in robots starting at the level of models with spiking neurons .
In the current study , in order to mediate between the conceptual level of schema theory and the physiologically detailed level of models using spiking neurons , we propose a macro - level neural dynamics model .
The main component of the current model is a continuous time recurrent neural network ( RNN ) .
Thanks to its capacity to preserve the internal state , which enables it to reproduce complex dynamics , the RNN is often used for modeling temporal sequence learning [ 35 ] – [ 37 ] .
The continuous time RNN ( CTRNN ) is a type of RNN which implements a feature of biological neurons , namely that the activities of neurons are determined not only by current synaptic inputs but also by the past history of neural states .
Due to this characteristic , according to which activation changes continuously , the CTRNN is superior to discrete time RNN models in modeling mechanisms for producing continuous sensori- motor sequences [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
The model of neurons is a conventional firing rate model , in which each unit 's activity represents the average firing rate over a group of neurons .
Spatio - temporal patterns of behavior arise from dynamics of neural activities through neural connectivity .
The CTRNN is as such considered to emulate characteristic features of actual neural systems , and the current model is considered consistent at the level of the macro - level mechanisms of biological neural systems .
For this reason , consistency in physiological details , such as features of neural activity at the level of individual neurons and characteristics of individual synapses , are not considered in detail .
It is not our intention in the current study to map directly between model components and actual brain structures .
Possible implications to biology of the current results were discussed only at an abstract level , in terms of the model employed in the current study .
A few years back , when I was a full - time political journalist , I had a chat with a colleague who had just become a government information officer .
It was one of those periods when Fleet Street was taking pot shots at Tony Blair , and I asked my friend how it felt to be embattled .
He laughed , saying he had been shocked to find out how little reporters - let alone the public - knew what was going on in Whitehall .
" I reckon on any given day you 'll be lucky to find out 1 % . "
As the bizarre arrest of Damian Green is reduced to political squabbling , the bigger picture is being missed .
Governments , of whatever hue , are subject to alarmingly little scrutiny .
From time to time parliament rises to the occasion , but more often than not has no idea what affairs of state are circumventing it .
British journalism is dangerously weak .
It veers between hysteria ( the " I 'm so angry because " school of commentary ) and stenography .
What is the point of the media if it does not see its primary task as gathering information to hold power to account ?
Investigative journalism takes time and money .
One can count on the fingers of perhaps two hands the serious practitioners , many of whom rely on whistleblowers .
When I was editor of the New Statesman , we ran several stories that rattled the government 's cage .
My two criteria in deciding to publish were whether a story was entirely accurate , and whether it threatened national security .
The most notable case was that of Derek Pasquill , a Foreign Office official .
He leaked to Martin Bright , the magazine 's excellent political editor , information about the government 's approach to militant Islam .
I did n't necessarily agree with Pasquill , but I was convinced that his concerns were in the public interest .
Pasquill was harassed , interrogated and charged under the Official Secrets Act .
This was a malicious political prosecution designed to save the skins of mandarins and ex-ministers , and we decided to defend him to the hilt - pointing out that ministers had already changed policy to address those points raised by Pasquill , and therefore he had no case to answer .
Throughout the case I had the impression that the government had become so arrogant and vengeful against anyone trying to coax out the truth that ministers would invoke all arms of the law to do their bidding .
Faced with bullying , we tried a spot of it ourselves .
I went for a one - to - one meeting with a senior minister .
I warned him that when the trial began , we would bring forward evidence that would embarrass senior figures in and around government .
On the first day of the trial , at the Old Bailey last January , the case was abandoned .
Job done , I resigned a month later .
I believe that just as the decision to prosecute Pasquill was political , the decision to drop charges was equally so .
There may be more to the case of Damian Green and his Home Office whistleblower , but I doubt it .
This too seems an act of brute force .
New Labour has a terrible record in this regard , and I believe that the Conservatives would act with as much disdain for the democratic process .
Their record under Thatcher and Major suggests little else .
The threat to robust inquiry is perhaps greater now than ever before in our system .
Much of British journalism has become supine in the face of intimidation from state organs and from libel laws that encourage the crooked around the world to sue in UK courts to prevent legitimate inquiry .
For some time reporters have complained that editors and proprietors are shying away from difficult stories for fear of " getting into trouble " .
The fear with the Green case is that civil servants and politicians will now do so as well .

I was channel surfing on Monday , following the stock market ’s nearly 800 - point collapse , when a commentator on CNBC caught my attention .
He was being asked to give advice to viewers as to what were the best positions to be in to ride out the market storm .
Without missing a beat , he answered : “ Cash and fetal . ”
I ’m in both  because I know an unprecedented moment when I see one .
I ’ve been frightened for my country only a few times in my life :
In 1962 , when , even as a boy of 9 , I followed the tension of the Cuban missile crisis ; in 1963 , with the assassination of J.F.K. ; on Sept. 11 , 2001 ; and on Monday , when the House Republicans brought down the bipartisan rescue package .
But this moment is the scariest of all for me because the previous three were all driven by real or potential attacks on the U.S. system by outsiders .
This time , we are doing it to ourselves .
This time , it ’s our own failure to regulate our own financial system and to legislate the proper remedy that is doing us in .
I ’ve always believed that America ’s government was a unique political system  one designed by geniuses so that it could be run by idiots .
I was wrong .
No system can be smart enough to survive this level of incompetence and recklessness by the people charged to run it .
I love the careful wording on Adobe ’s Alchemy site :
The purpose of this preview is to assess the level of community interest in reusing existing C and C++ libraries in Web applications that run on Adobe® Flash ® Player and Adobe AIR ® .
It needs to be put cautiously , because Alchemy – unlike Google Web Toolkit , which handles Java to Javascript – is not intended to become a general - purpose alternative to ActionScript .
Rather , the idea is to enable existing C/C++ libraries to work within Flash applications .
Examples given include transcoders , cryptographic algorithms , and XML parsers .
Performance is said to be 2 - 10 x slower than native code .
Alchemy was demoed today at Adobe ’s MAX conference .
Possibly a Java to ActionScript compiler would be more useful to most of us ; though for new code ActionScript 3.0 is close enough to Java that it should not be difficult for most developers to learn .

Below are 15 useful project management applications , almost all of which are targeted directly at web developers , designers ( both web and graphic ) and other creative types .
The last one is not geared specifically at creative types , but is the most unique project management application I ’ve found , and was included on that basis as well as its potential usefulness for designers and developers .
There is a huge variety of project management applications out there .
Most are general purpose apps , not aimed at any one industry .
But there is a growing number of project management apps aimed specifically at one industry or another .
Applications geared to creative types are becoming more readily available , and some of the offerings are really quite good .
Many of these project management apps have built - in code repositories and subversion browsers ( or are built around them ) .
A few have built - in bug and issue tracking .
Others include more than just basic project management .
All of them can help you keep track of activities and team members .
There are both free and paid options .
Some have very slick interfaces , and some are modeled more after desktop applications .
All are relatively easy to use and easy to set up .
You may want to take a look at the following related posts :
Below are 13 useful project management applications , almost all of which are targeted directly at Web developers , designers ( both Web and print ) and other creative types .
The last one is not geared specifically to creative types but is the most unique project management application I ’ve found and is included on that basis as well as because of its potential usefulness for designers and developers .
1. Basic Project Management Apps
These applications are marketed specifically for project management .
Most include things like task - , team - , and goal - management features .
Some include additional features such as time tracking and invoicing .
Lighthouse
Lighthouse is a bug - and issue - tracking app that tracks timelines and milestones , integrates with your email client and more .
You can update tickets through your inbox , manage your beta testing ( by making tickets and milestones public ) , integrate it with subversion and manage and prioritize your tickets .
Project creation is simple ; only a project title and description is required .
Once a project is created , tickets , messages and milestones can be entered .
Ticket creation can be done by email ( the email address to send tickets to is displayed on the “ Tickets ” page ) .
You can show tickets based on a variety of criteria , including date , state ( open or closed ) and who is responsible for them .
Message creation is easier than email , and you can attach files up to 50 MB in size .
When you create a milestone you simply enter the title , the date it ’s due and the goals or focus for that particular milestone .
It does n’t get much simpler than that .
Permissions are easy to set , and you can invite users by email .
One of the best features of Lighthouse is its Beacon and API integration .
With the API , you can customize tickets , projects , changesets , milestones , messages and more .
Integrate it with other services ( such as Google Calendar ) , or make desktop applications that use Lighthouse .
The APIs make Lighthouse infinitely more useful , because you can really customize it to fit your current workflow .
Lighthouse is great for Web development teams ( or individuals ) and has a very easy - to - use interface .
They have paid and free plans , all of which include unlimited open - source projects .
The free plan lets you manage one private project with up to two people on the account .
The paid plans range from $ 10 per month for the Personal plan ( with up to 3 projects , 10 users and 100 MB of file upload storage space ) to $ 120 per month for the Platinum plan ( with unlimited projects , up to 50 public projects , unlimited users and 30 GB of file upload space ) .
When combined with a subversion app , Lighthouse provides a pretty complete project management app for developers .
Subversion integration is pretty straightforward , and the help file provided gives complete step - by - step instructions for setup .
Springloops
Springloops is another subversion browser that integrates project management .
It counts a unique AJAX code browser and Basecamp integration as among its features .
The Springloops interface is very intuitive and easy to use .
Tabbed navigation provides access to the log , source and deployment information .
Adding users is done via email , along with the ability to create usernames and passwords ( making it easier and faster for them to get on board with a project ) .
Creating new projects is simple , with a few different templates available ( including a starter template ) .
You can migrate an existing repository into Springloops as well ( including plain text dumps ) .
For added project management ability , Springloops can be integrated with Basecamp .
Springloops has a number of plans available , both paid and free .
The free plan includes 25 MB of space , 3 projects , 3 deployments per day ( using FTP or SFTP connections ) , roll - back capabilities , Basecamp integration , subversion and an unlimited number of users .
The paid plans range from the “ Flowerpot ” plan at $ 9 per month ( including 1 GB of space and 10 projects ) to the “ Forest ” plan at $ 96 per month ( including 18 GB of storage , unlimited projects , automatic deployment and secure SSL encryption ) .
All of the paid plans include a free 30 - day trial .
Jumpchart
Jumpchart is a website planning application that allows you to plan the navigation of your website by creating , dragging and dropping pages into the plan .
You can also add text and formatting to pages and then export your CSS files and site map when you ’re finished .
This is a great planning app for Web designers , though it ’s not strictly a project management application .
You can add comments to each page , which could serve to keep track of tasks related to specific pages .
More traditional project management functions could be kept track of in the text of each mockup page or through the comments .
The mockup and planning capabilities of Jumpchart make it worth using , even if hacks are needed to make it more conducive to full project management .
The free Jumpchart plan offers 1 project with 1 MB of storage and a maximum of 10 pages and 2 users .
The paid plans range from the Simple plan at $ 5 per month ( including up to 5 projects , with 25 pages and 5 users per project , and 100 MB of storage ) to the Deluxe plan at $ 50 per month ( including up to 30 projects with unlimited pages and users and 5000 MB of storage ) .
Basecamp
Basecamp is often considered to be the best project management and collaboration platform out there .
Its features are impressive : to - do lists , file sharing , message boards , milestones , time tracking , project overviews and commenting .
The user interface is definitely one of the best out there , and because of its popularity , tons of other companies are making products that integrate with Basecamp , extending its capabilities .
Pricing is reasonable , though it ’s definitely not the cheapest solution out there .
The Basic plan is only $ 24 per month and includes up to 15 active projects , 3 GB of file storage and unlimited clients and users .
The Max plan is a hefty $ 149 per month , but includes unlimited projects , 50 GB of file storage , time tracking , SSL security and a free Campfire Premium account .
2. Wiki-Based Project Management
Wikis are another option for project management , whether you use one instead of a basic project management application or in addition to one .
One of the solutions below is geared to complete project management and includes additional features , while the other is just a wiki and is suitable for project management and other uses .
Trac Project
Trac Project is a project management app that is based on wiki functionality .
It also includes a subversion browser , a timeline , ticket tracking , a road map ( showing milestones and the number of current open and closed tickets ) and builds status tracking .
One of Trac ’s best features is the range of plug-ins available for it .
There are plug-ins for Web administration , authentication , code documentation , file management , ticketing , testing , user management and version control .
Another big advantage : Trac is free and licensed under a modified BSD license .
PBwiki
PBwiki is one of the easiest free wikis out there to use .
You can share files with other users , set access controls for individual pages and folders , add other users to your wiki , monitor and track version changes and more .
Setup is quick and easy and can be done in less than a minute .
The PBwiki interface is very intuitive , and there is virtually no learning curve .
Creating folders and pages is straightforward , as is editing existing pages .
You can also comment on each page , and get a printable version with a single click .
There are multiple themes you can choose from for the design , as well as templates for individual page content ( or you can start from scratch ) .
There are a few different plans available , both paid and free .
The free plan allows from 1 to 3 users .
Paid plans range from $ 4 per month per user ( if you have more than 10,000 users ) to $ 8 per month per user ( for 4 to 999 users ) .
3. Bug and Ticket Tracking
Any time you work on a Web application or website , there are going to be bugs and issues that crop up .
While some basic project management applications have built - in ticket tracking , others do n’t , and sometimes the built - in solution does n’t quite meet your needs ( either because it ’s too robust or is missing key features ) .
16bugs
16 bugs is a very simple bug - tracking system .
Its main advantage is the color - coding system used for different types of information ( like updates , comments and closed tickets ) .
Setup is quick and easy .
The user interface is easy to figure out .
Creating bugs is easy , and the color - coded labels on the activity tab make it easy to see what ’s going on at a glance .
There are a variety of account types available .
The free account allows 1 project , 1 MB of storage and Basecamp imports .
Starting at $ 8 per month , paid plans include more projects ( 3 with the Basic plan ) , 150 MB to 10 GB of storage , RSS and email notifications , Campfire notifications and SSL ( starting with the $ 15 - per- month Big plan ) .
JIRA

All nuclear - capable B - 52 bombers will be moved to the new command The US Air Force ( USAF ) is planning to set up a new Global Strike Command for its nuclear weapons as part of a re-organisation after recent mishaps .
The move follows the discovery that six nuclear weapons were mistakenly flown across the US , and that nuclear missile fuses were sent unknowingly to Taiwan .
The blunders resulted in the sacking of two of USAF 's most senior officials .
A three - star general will head the new command , part of a project aimed at shaking up USAF 's nuclear mission .
" This is a critical milestone for us .
It 's a new starting point for reinvigoration of this enterprise , " said Air Force Secretary Michael Donley .
" It is an extremely important mission for the United States Air Force . " ' Embarrassing '
In June , Gen T Michael Moseley , USAF chief of staff , and Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne were both asked to resign by Defence Secretary Robert Gates after a report revealed that the security of US nuclear weapons and parts had been in question .
The report cited two embarrassing incidents .
The first occurred in 2006 when electrical fuses for ballistic missiles were mistakenly sent from a US base in Wyoming to Taiwan in place of helicopter batteries .
The Chinese government , which vehemently opposes US arms sales to Taiwan and has threatened to attack the island if it declares independence , was informed by the US about the error .
The other embarrassing incident occurred last year when a B - 52 bomber mistakenly armed with six nuclear - tipped cruise missiles flew across the country , without anyone realising the weapons were on board .
The new Global Strike Command will be established by September 2009 , said officials .
Control of all nuclear - capable B - 52 and B - 2 bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles will be shifted to the new command .
Officials did not disclose the location of the new command or how much the re-organisation would cost .

Chancellor Alistair Darling has cut VAT but taken borrowing to record levels in moves he says are needed to save the UK from a deep and long - lasting recession .
Top earners also face more tax and all National Insurance contributions will rise , he said in his pre-Budget report .
Mr Darling said " exceptional measures " were needed with the economy set to shrink next year - but the Tories said he had " mortgaged " Britain 's future .
Alcohol , tobacco and petrol duty rises to offset the 17.5 % to 15 % VAT cut .
KEY POINTS VAT cut by 2.5 percentage points 45 % tax rate on earnings over £ 150,000 from 2011 All National Insurance to go up by 0.5 % from 2011 Economy to shrink by up to 1.25 % next year Borrowing to hit record £ 118bn Public spending growth cut to 1.2 %
Phased increase in vehicle excise duty £ 60 Christmas gift for pensioners
At -a- glance : Pre-Budget report Analysis : A political budget Shadow chancellor George Osborne , for the Conservatives , accused Mr Darling of " bringing this country to the verge of bankruptcy " by doubling the national debt , which is set to reach £ 118 bn next year .
Mr Osborne accused the government of creating " a huge unexploded tax bombshell timed to go off at the time of the next economic recovery " .
He said Mr Darling had offered " temporary tax giveaways paid for by a lifetime of tax rises on the British people " and he said the country 's future had been " mortgaged to bail out the mistakes of the past " .
Lib Dem treasury spokesman Vince Cable said VAT cuts would not be enough to boost consumer spending and " it would be much more sensible to put money directly in the pockets of low paid workers by cutting their income tax " .
See how government deficit will evolve
In his Commons statement , Mr Darling slashed economic growth forecasts for next year from 2.75 % to between minus 0.75 % and minus 1.25 % - the biggest downward revision on record .
But he said the government would inject an extra £ 20bn into the economy , or 1 % of GDP , in a bid to get it moving again funded in part by an extra £ 5 bn in efficiency savings and a big increase in government borrowing .
In these extraordinary circumstances allowing borrowing to rise is the right choice for the country

There would also be a dramatic cutback in government spending - with it being projected to rise by just 1.2 % a year , less than the normal growth rate of the economy and down from the already tightened plans for 1.8 % spending increases .
The most expensive stimulus measure is a temporary cut in VAT from 17.5 % to 15 % aimed at getting consumers spending again .
Mr Darling says the cut - which comes into effect on Monday in time for the peak Christmas shopping period - will put £ 12.5 bn into the pockets of consumers over the course of the 13 months it will last .
Pensioners will also be given a one - off payment of £ 60 - £ 120 for couples - in January on top of their £ 10 Christmas bonus .
But the rise in duty on alcohol , tobacco and petrol , to ensure they do not benefit from the cuts in VAT , will be permanent .
HOW VAT CUT AFFECTS PRICES
Mars bar - down 1p JVC LCD television - down £ 12.77 Levi's jeans - down £ 1.49 Next suit jacket - down £ 3 Ford Focus - down £ 322
In quotes : PBR reaction
And in measures aimed at clawing back the VAT cut and other measures , top rate tax will increase to 45 % from 2011 , for people earning more than £ 150,000 a year and from April 2011 all rates of National Insurance ( NI ) contributions will be raised by 0.5 % for employees and employers .
The starting point for NI will be brought into line with that of income tax so that no - one earning under £ 20,000 would pay any more contributions as a result , the chancellor said .
On borrowing , Mr Darling said it would be " perverse and damaging " to stick to government rules in the current crisis so they would be temporarily suspended .
' Extraordinary circumstances '
Government borrowing would more than double to £ 78bn this year and £ 118bn next year , before starting to come down , with the books not to be balanced again until 2015 / 16 .
" If we did nothing we would have a deeper and longer recession that would cost the country more in the long term , " Mr Darling told MPs .
WHAT TAX CHANGES MEAN People earning £ 20,000 or less will not be worse off People earning over £ 40,000 to pay £ 156 a year extra People earning between £ 100,000 and £ 140,000 to pay £ 1,114 extra People earning between 140.000 and 200,000 to pay £ 3,172 extra " In these extraordinary circumstances allowing borrowing to rise is the right choice for the country . "
He added : " Taken together these steps will ensure that there is extra money flowing into the economy when it is needed most , but we can reduce borrowing when growth returns . "
In other measures , Mr Darling speeded up the introduction of planned rises in child benefit and measures aimed at helping small businesses hit by the credit crunch .
And he softened the blow for drivers by announcing a more gradual introduction of new vehicle excise duty , with rates only going up £ 5 per vehicle in 2009 .
Work to upgrade motorways , refurbish schools and repair council houses is also to be speeded by bringing forward £ 3bn of state spending .

And there will be more help for home owners , with the scheme which covers mortgage interest payments for those who have lost their jobs doubled to cover mortgages of up to £ 200,000 .
This year 's increase in the income tax personal allowance of £ 120 a year for basic rate taxpayers will be made permanent and increased to £ 145 in April , helping 22 million basic rate taxpayers - another 500,000 households not just this year but for good .
The 45 % top rate will not come into effect until after the next general election , meaning Labour will not break its 2005 manifesto commitment on not raising income tax .
Mr Darling 's Commons statement heralds the biggest shake - up of Labour 's economic policy since it came to power in 1997 .
Giving his reaction to the Pre-Budget report , the SNP's Treasury spokesman , Stewart Hosie , said : " We welcome the VAT cut , the vehicle excise duty changes but question why on earth he wants to put petrol up at this point . "
Plaid Cymru's Adam Price said Mr Darling 's stimulus package did not go far enough and did not offer " the kind of economic leadership we were hoping for " .
The FTSE 100 Index of leading shares rose by a record 9.8 % or 372.1 points at 4153 , although market watchers said this was largely down to the rescue of banking giant Citigroup which helped ease some of the uncertainty seen the previous week .

Sarah Palin with her husband , Todd , and son Trig , who has Down syndrome .
Barone : Media wanted Palin abortion
A roomful of academics erupted in angry boos Tuesday morning after political analyst Michael Barone said journalists trashed Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republicans ' vice presidential nominee , because " she did not abort her Down syndrome baby . "
Barone said in an e-mail that he " was attempting to be humorous and ... went over the line . "

Barone was speaking at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago , to the 121st annual meeting of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges , which calls itself the nation ’s oldest higher - education association .
“ The liberal media attacked Sarah Palin because she did not abort her Down syndrome baby , " Barone said , according to accounts by attendees .
" They wanted her to kill that child .
... I 'm talking about my media colleagues with whom I 've worked for 35 years . ”
Barone , a popular speaker on the paid lecture circuit , is a senior writer for U.S. News & World Report and principal coauthor of “ The Almanac of American Politics . "
About 500 people were in the room , and some walked out .
Barone did not dispute the accounts of his remarks .
Asked about the comments , Barone said in an e-mail that he " was attempting to be humorous and , as many in public do , went over the line . "
" Sorry for that , " Barone said .
" I was trying to focus on press hostility to Palin .
I agree with [ Washington Post media reporter and CNN ' Reliable Sources ' host ]
Howard Kurtz that the press was much more interested in tracking down negative information on Palin than Obama . "
Palin ’s youngest child , her son Trig , was born in April .
Televised shots of him during her convention speech helped endear her to conservatives .
During the campaign , she said she would use the vice presidency to help families with special - needs children .
Barone was speaking at a general session of a conference titled " National Implications of the 2008 Presidential Election . ”
At the start of his talk , Barone also did an informal , show - of - hands poll about cable news preferences .
Attendees said the results were roughly MSNBC , 35 percent ; CNN , 55 percent ; and Fox News , 10 percent .
" I often do that , " Barone explained by e-mail .
" It 's fun . "
The education group 's vice president of public affairs , Paul F. Hassen , confirmed the gist of the remarks .
Barone said the quotes , which were from notes and not from a tape , were " not too far off . "
The Road to HTML 5 : getElementsByClassName ( )
Welcome back to my semi- regular column , " The Road to HTML 5 , " where I 'll try to explain some of the new elements , attributes , and other features in the upcoming HTML 5 specification .
The feature of the day is getElements ByClassName ( ) .
Long desired by web developers and implemented in Javascript libraries like Prototype , this function does exactly what it says on the tin : it returns a list of elements in the DOM that define one or more classnames in the class attribute .
getElementsByClassName( ) exists as a method of the document object ( for searching the entire DOM ) , as well as on each HTMLElement object ( for searching the children of an element ) .
The HTML 5 specification defines getElementsByClassName ( ) :
The getElementsByClassName ( classNames ) method takes a string that contains an unordered set of unique space - separated tokens representing classes .
When called , the method must return a live NodeList object containing all the elements in the document , in tree order , that have all the classes specified in that argument , having obtained the classes by splitting a string on spaces .
If there are no tokens specified in the argument , then the method must return an empty NodeList .
If the document is in quirks mode , then the comparisons for the classes must be done in an ASCII case - insensitive manner , otherwise , the comparisons must be done in a case - sensitive manner .
A Brief History of getElementsByClassName ()
Can We Use It ?
Yes We Can !
As you can tell from the timeline , getElementsByClassName ( ) is supported natively in Firefox 3 , Opera 9.5 , Safari 3.1 , and all versions of Google Chrome .
It is not available in any version of Microsoft Internet Explorer .
( IE 8 beta 2 is the latest version as of this writing . )
To use it in browsers that do not support it natively , you will need a wrapper script .
There are many such scripts ; I myself am partial to Robert Nyman 's Ultimate GetElementsByClassName .
It uses the native getElements ByClassName ( ) method in modern browsers that support it , then falls back to the little - known document.evaluate ( ) method , which is supported by older versions of Firefox ( since at least 1.5 ) and Opera ( since at least 9.27 ) .
If all else fails , Robert 's script falls back to recursively traversing the DOM and collecting elements that match the given classnames .
And in conclusion
I am campaigning for greater acceptance of part - time software developers in the corporate world .
I aim to pave a path for other developers who want to balance their career with other life commitments .
A Wal - Mart worker is dead and a pregnant woman recovering from injuries following a Black Friday shopper stampede .
Employee Trampled
Police say the employee was trampled as shoppers pushed to get into the Long Island Wal - Mart location just after 5:00 a.m. Friday .
The 34 - year - old man was “ knock[ed ] to the ground ” as a “ throng of shoppers … physically broke down the doors , ” a police statement says .
The man had been hired for the holidays via a temp agency .
He was declared dead within the hour .
Miscarriage Caused
As for the pregnant woman , witnesses say she was knocked out and found on the ground in the same area .
She was rushed to the hospital , where reports indicate she suffered a miscarriage as a result of the trauma .
At least three other customers were also hurt .
Wal - Mart Death Investigation
The store was closed shortly after the stampede .
Wal - Mart says it is working with Nassau County Police to review surveillance video and fully investigate the incident .
Cell phone video from the scene is below , along with a news report from moments after the trampling .
More Wal - Mart stampede video follows beneath that .
Please be advised that some of the images may be disturbing .
Past Wal - Mart Stampede Video
Some attorneys say they have handled numerous lawsuits involving injuries from Wal - Mart stampedes on Black Friday .
Some speculate there are thousands such cases across the country every year .
Most , they indicate , end with confidential settlements with the retailer .
This video , from another Wal - Mart location on a Black Friday morning , shows just how intense and chaotic major retailers ’ opening moments can become as eager shoppers rush into the opening doors .
Wal - Mart ’s official statement on the Long Island Black Friday death calls it a “ tragic situation . ”
“ The safety and security of our customers and associates is our top priority , ” the company says .

one of the latest projects by OFIS architects repurposed a historical complex in ljubljana , slovenia .
the building used to be a butcher factory complete with water tower and butcher hall .
ofis was commissioned to remake the old factory into a contemporary shopping centre , while preserving the existing historical structure .
to make things even more tricky , the building had an extremely limited budget which had to stretch quite far .
the interior was going to be completed in the store ’s established standard finishings .
however , ofis needed to find a way to turn the façade into something more spectacular .
they devised a cut metal pattern , which was to be placed on the façade .
these perforated metal cut-outs are place all over the wall and the pieces removed from the perforation were repurposed and also place on the façade .
overtime , climbing greenery will be added to the façade .

It 's like a geek soap opera .
Just last week , Cray bragged that their updated Jaguar XT supercomputer was the world 's fastest .
Now this week , IBM responds to the trash talk with a number one ranking of their Roadrunner system on the newly published Top500 supercomputing list .
Both the IBM and Cray systems break the petaflop processing barrier according to Top500 measurements ( 1.45 petaflops vs 1.38 petaflops , respectively ) .
Heck , even IBM admitted to us that the two computers " run neck and neck . "
But there 's a huge difference between them .
The Roadrunner uses roughly half the power of the Jaguar XT .
It assembles 12,960 IBM PowerXCell 8i Cell Broadband Engine processors and an additional 6,948 AMD Opteron Dual - Core processors .
The AMD equipment handles " basic " functions while the IBM chips handle the intense number crunching .
( Read all about the Roadrunner here . )
Seeing as the Cray XT5 uses 45,000 quad - core AMD Opteron processors to get the same job done , you 've gotta be at least a little impressed .

AT&T 's bandwidth caps for its high speed internet customers are here .
They 're conducting a " market trial " in Reno that started on Nov. 1 , where users get between 20GB and 150 GB a month , depending on their speed tier .
Unlike Time Warner 's trial in Beamont , where caps were only applied to new customers , existing customers will also be capped , though they 'll get the roomier 150 GB cap .
If you bust the cap , AT&T will charge an extra dollar per gigabyte .
Surveying the broadband landscape in this country , It 's either caps or slowdowns or filters .
( Unless you 're on Comcast , then it 's a two - for - one . )
Caps seem like the lesser of the three evils , if only because they 're fairly transparent — filtering and slowdowns are more insidious , since you might not be immediately aware it 's happening .
They 're essentially legitimized forms of sabotage .
Verizon is the only major ISP leaving traffic totally unfettered , but I wonder how long that will last .
AT&T is conducting a market trial in Reno , Nevada to evaluate a usage - based model that could potentially help address today 's trend of explosive bandwidth usage .
The trial may be extended to one other market by the end of the year .
Beginning Nov. 1 , 2008 , new AT&T High Speed Internet customers in Reno will receive a bandwidth usage amount ranging from between 20 Gigabytes ( GB ) and 150 GB , depending on their broadband speed tier .
Later this year , existing AT&T High Speed Internet customers in Reno will become a part of this trial if their monthly usage exceeds 150 GB in one month .
These customers will receive a usage amount of 150 GB per month .
Once they 're a part of the trial , customers will receive a one month grace period the first time usage is exceeded .
Thereafter , customers will be charged $ 1 for every GB over their determined usage amount .
All customers in the trial will receive a bandwidth measuring tool so they can track their usage .
We will let all impacted customers know about the trial specifics at least 60 - days ahead of any overage charges .
We 'll also proactively let customers know each time they reach 80 percent of their usage amount .
We will not terminate service due to customer usage .
We have previously stated that some type of usage based model , for those customers who have abnormally high usage patterns , seems inevitable .
A small group of customers are using the majority of bandwidth on our network .
In fact , almost 50 percent of total bandwidth is used by just five percent of customers – customers , for example , who are uploading and downloading the equivalent of more than 40,000 YouTube videos or 40 million e-mails a month .
This kind of heavy usage has an impact on all of our customers .
This trial will help us evaluate ways of dealing with surging usage trends while continuing to meet customer needs for a high quality broadband experience at an affordable price .

GM , FORD SEEN AS BENEFICIARIES OF OBAMA AGENDA
Auto makers may be experiencing the worst sales environment since the closing days of World War II , but having a patron in high places might be enough to allow them to limp through to a recovery .
Shares of General Motors ( GM ) have risen as much as 6 % Wednesday , while Ford Motor ( F ) added 2 % amid expectations that a Barack Obama administration will make saving the auto industry one of its priorities .
Auto makers appeared to be well - positioned to savor the incoming president 's capital largesse .
As one of the more conspicuously organized work forces , auto workers would stand well with Obama 's focus on fostering unionization .
And as one of the lynchpins of the move to convert to cleaner sources of energy , they also fit snugly within the fabric of his alternative - fuel agenda .
The president - elect already suggested he would double Washington 's recent commitment to help fund the conversion to fuel - efficient automobiles , saying he would lavish $ 50 billion on the initiative .
The bailout could n't come at a more auspicioius occasion in the car makers ' history .
GMAC , the auto finance arm of General Motors , reported its fifth consecutive quarterly losses amid what the company described as the worst sales environment since 1945 .
Borrowers have fallen behind in their payments to the auto - finance concern , even as it has scaled back its own lending operations , curtailing loans to prospective customers with anything but the highest - quality credit ratings .
GMAC , majority owned by the private - equity firm Cerberus Capital , also said that its home - lending unit , known as ResCap , may not survive the current plight of the housing market .
As recently as two years ago , GMAC had one of the largest portfolios of subprime mortgages in the housing - finance business .
GMAC already received government permission to tap into the Federal Reserve 's commercial - paper purchase program , and has been exploring additional means of accessing government funds .
Congratulations , GOP , for the tackiest , bloodiest bit of propaganda devised in recent memory .
Using footage of everything from the Marine barracks bombing to 9/11 in service to a vile , crass , ham - handed , historically botched propaganda piece for your convention .
And their little " film " did n't even make a bit of logical or historical sense .
It was just the worst Republican masturbatory fantasies about how the world works , said in a grave voice while they showed pictures of people dead and dying .
On their watch .
What trash these people are .
Piss off , cretins .

Reports : Emanuel accepts Chief of Staff job RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday November 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Rep. Rahm Emanuel will be chief of staff in President - elect Barack Obama 's White House , Politico reports .
The Associated Press , ABC News , CNN and others confirmed the report .
The Illinois lawmaker , and notoriously hard - edged political operator is said to have accepted an offer from Obama , becoming the most - high profile appointee of the next president 's administration so far .
Politico's report was based on anonymous Democratic officials .
As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , Emanuel engineered the party 's takeover of Congress in 2006 and rose to a position in the House leadership .
A former aide to President Clinton , Emanuel also engineered passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
Emanuel was weighing his commitment to his family against his commitment to public service in considering a position as Senator Obama 's future chief of staff , he told ABC News on Wednesday .
The 48 - year - old White House veteran , previously a senior advisor in the Clinton administration , was offered the position hours after Obama became President - elect on Tuesday .
" I have obviously two great opportunities , as you know , before me , " he said .
" I have to make a decision about my family .
Ive been in the White House .
I used to joke in the White House that on Fridays , I would say : its two more workdays till Monday .
When I was in the White House , I didnt have children .
I do know something about the White House , and I do have children now .
I have a family . "
" I got a lot to weigh : my commitment to my country , my commitment to public service and why I got into this , as well as what I want to do as a parent , " he added .
" I 'm honored .
And I appreciate this .
I have a lot to weigh : the basis of public service , which Ive given my life to , a career choice .
And most importantly , what I want to do as a parent .
And I know something about the White House .
That I assume is one of the reasons that President - elect Obama would like me to serve .
But I also know something about what it means to a family . "
" Just so you know , " Emanuel said , " when I chose to run for Congress , I took months to think about it .
This is being asked in a few days . "
Rep. Emanuel retained his seat in the House of Representatives on Tuesday .
He represents Illinois ' fifth district .
After 18 days 7,000 prisoners in greece stop their hunger strike after the ministry of justice concedes to a series of their demands , promising to release half the country 's prison population by April 2009 .
On Thursday the 20th of November more than 7,000 hunger strikers in greek prisons demanding a comprehensive 45 - point program of prison reform have decided to stop their hunger strike , already on its 18th day , after the Ministry of Justice responded to their struggle and to the widening solidarity movement which in the last weeks has held several mass protest marches in the greek cities by declaring that by next April the number of prisoners in greek jails will be reduced to 6.815 from the present 12.315 , thus effectively releasing half of the country 's prison population .
The Ministry 's declaration in detail states that :
1 ) All persons convicted to a sentence up to five years for any offense including drug related crimes can tranform their sentence into a monetary penalty .
This will not be allowed in the case the jury decides that the payment is not enough to deter the convict from commiting punishable acts in the future .
2 ) The minimum sum for tranforming one day of prison sentence to monetary penanlty is reduced from 10 euros to 3 , with the provision of being reduced to 1 euro by decision of the jury .
3 ) All people who have served 1/5 of their prison sentence for 2 year sentences and 1/3 for sentences longer than 2 years are to be released , with no exceptions .
4 ) The minimum limit of served sentence is reduced to 3/5 for conditional release and for convicts for drug related crimes .
Those condemned under conditions of law Ν. 3459/2006 ( articles 23 και 23Α ) are excepmpted .
5 ) The maximum limit of pre-trial impironment is reduced from 18 to 12 months , with the excemption of crimes puniched by liife or 20 year sentence .
6 ) The annual time of days - off prison is increased by one day .
Tougher conditions for days - off are limited for those convicted for drug related crimes under Ν. 3459/2006 .
7 ) Disciplinary penalties are to be integrated .
8 ) Integration after 4 years into national law of the European Council decision of drug trafficking ( 2004/757 ) .
9 ) Expansion of implementation of conditional release of convicts suffering from AIDS , kidney failure , persistent TB , and tetraplegics .
What the Ministry failed to answer with regard to the prisoners ' demands include :
1 ) Monetary exchange of prison sentences longer than 5 years , especially for 6.700 prisoners presently convicted for non-criminal offenses .
2 ) Abolition of juvenile prisons
3 ) Abolition of accumulative disciplinary penalties
4 ) Abolition of 18 months pre-trial imprisonment for a large number of offenses .
5 ) Satisfactory expansion of days off , despite the fact that the application of present liberties has been tested as succesfull during the last 18 years .
6 ) Immediate improvement of relocation conditions of convicts
7 ) Holding a meeting between the minister of justice and the prisoners ' committee
Thus in a press release , the Prisoners ' Commitee announced that :
" The amendment submitted to the Parliament by the Ministry of Justice tackles but a few of our demands .
The minister ought to materialize his promises for the immediate release of the suggested number of prisoners announced , and at the same time implement concrete measures regarding the totality of our demands .
We the prisoners treat this amendment as a first step , a result of our struggle and of the solidarity shown by society .
Yet it fails to covers us , it fails to solve our problems .
With our struggle , we have first of all fought for our dignity .
And this dignity we cannot offer as a present to no minister , to no screw .
We shall tolerate no arbitrary acts , no vengeful relocation , no terrorizing disciplinary act .
We are standing and we shall stay standing .
We demand form the Parliament to move towards a complete abolition of the limit of 4/5 of served sentence , the abolition of accumulated time for disciplinary penalties , and the expansion of beneficial arrangements regarding days - off , and conditional releases for all categories of prisoners .
Moreover , we demand the immediate legislation on the presently vague promises of the minister of justice regarding the improvement of prison conditions ( abolition of juvenile prisons , foundation of therapeutic centers for drug dependents , implementation of social labour in exchange for prison sentence , upgrading of hospital care of prisoners , incorporation of european legislation favorable to the prisoners in the greek law etc. ) .
Finally , we offer our thanks to the solidarity movement , to every component , party , medium , and militant who stood by us with all and any means of his or her choice , and we declare that our struggle against these human refuse dumps and for the victory of all our demands continues " .

This week saw the 20th anniversary of the release of the first issue of The Sandman , Neil Gaiman 's now - classic fantasy series that rewrote the rules of mainstream comics more than once in its ' 75 - issue run .
Without Sandman , we may never have seen comics like Fables , Y : The Last Man or The Invisibles ... but on the other hand , we probably would n't have had to suffer through the CGI Beowulf movie , either .
To celebrate Morpheus ' 20th birthday , we look at five ways in which entertainment is different because of comics ' favorite dream god .
It may sound like hyperbole to say that The Sandman changed the face of entertainment , and it is , to an extent - but there 's no denying that Sandman changed the face of the comic book industry , and that comics are one of the more dominant forces in pop culture these days ( Do n't believe me ?
My friends Iron Man and The Dark Knight may be able to convince you ) .
The series also made a star out of writer Neil Gaiman , allowing him to step into the roles of screenwriter and New York Times - bestselling novelist , and also inspired careers for people as disparate as Tori Amos and writer G. Willow Wilson .
But I 'm getting ahead of myself .
Here 're the five ways in which I think that Sandman changed the worlds we watch , read about and imagine today : It Brought Mainstream Comics Into The Mainstream Culture .
By 1988 , American comics were gaining a measure of critical acceptance thanks to the now - near - mythical trifecta of Frank Miller 's The Dark Knight Returns , Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ' Watchmen and Art Spiegelman 's Maus - but it took Gaiman and Sandman to bring together the populism of the former two and the gravity of the latter to create a series that Norman Mailer called " comic strip for intellectuals . "
Gaiman 's creation of a comic that had the pop-cultural cache of coming from the same publishers as Superman and Batman , yet relied more on highbrow myth than knowledge of the history of Krypton , and asked more of its readers than just the ability to tell men in tights apart , unknowingly capitalized on a trend for baby - boomers to look for more depth in the medium of their youth .
By following his own interests and obsessions , Gaiman accidentally created a comic that was familiar in format ( 32 pages , color , monthly ) , but unfamiliar in the most thrilling way to readers who wanted something more .
It Was n't About Superheroes .
Primarily amongst the ways in which the series was unfamiliar was its lack of superheroes as we'd come to know them .
Yes , superheroes appeared in the series on occasion , but the series abandoned the tropes and cliches of what most people considered mainstream comics to be ( while , in turn , bringing in and building on a lot of influences from long - forgotten or indie comics ) , proving to publisher DC Comics that a comic aimed at an adult audience , without a superhero lead , could not only sell , but gain critical acceptance akin to Watchmen or Dark Knight .
Without Sandman , there would have been no Vertigo imprint at DC , and series like We3 , The Invisibles , 100 Bullets , Y The Last Man , Preacher , Transmetropolitan , User and many , many more would never have seen print .
( There 's a side argument to made for the success of Sandman being responsible for American publishers continuing to bring British writers like Mark Millar and Warren Ellis into the industry , and those writers ' influence on superheroes being directly responsible for the success of movies like Iron Man and X - Men , but I 'm not sure that 's one I 'm willing to make here .
However , it 's definitely there if you want it ... )

It Took Urban Fantasy Out Of The Genre Ghetto .
With his liberal use of sources , Gaiman may not have been breaking all - new ground with his mix of magical realism and myth and the world we know ( I am still surprised that Jonathan Carroll never pointed out that the fifth " book " of Sandman , " A Game Of You , " is pretty much his own novel Bones Of The Moon with some minor additions ) , but the high profile nature of the series - especially as it continued , and started garnering praise from Mailer , Stephen King and many others - exposed people to a use of fantasy tropes that avoided elves and goblins - Well , except when it did n't - and integrated it into their lives before television shows like Buffy and The X Files did so on an ever larger scale .
It Reintroduced The Auteur Comicbook Theory .
For the first time in mainstream history , when the series creator left a successful ongoing regular book , the book left with him ; even Alan Moore 's groundbreaking run on Swamp
Thing had been followed , the next month , by a new writer .
This was , in part , because DC had learned from the mistakes that had driven Moore from the company , and was eager to keep Gaiman around for future projects - and , to that end , had actually granted him a certain amount of say over where and when the characters could be used again in future projects .
The lack of a second writer to ruin the series ' good name - or , possibly , outshine Gaiman 's run on the character - has given the series two particular qualities :
Firstly , a definitive ending , and secondly , the knowledge that this story was firmly and distinctively Gaiman's .
( To that end , the new Sandman : The Dream Hunters miniseries that commemorates the series ' birthday feels " wrong , " in a way , because it 's only adapted from a Gaiman story , as opposed to being 100 % written by him . )
It Looked Nothing Like Other Comics .
Outside of its groundbreaking qualities in terms of stories , it 's impossible to ignore what cover artist and designer Dave McKean brought to the series .
His covers , whether they were paintings , constructions , early experiments in the use of Photoshop or whatever were as important to the series as Gaiman 's writing - and each one changed the perception of what a comic cover could look like even more .
Taking influence from fine art and contemporary design , McKean threw out the conventions of what makes a comic book cover ( The title character must always be on the cover , the logo must always be in the same place ) to create beautiful pieces on a regular basis ... and confuse people who thought they knew what comics were supposed to look like .

It ’s a map of those areas where Hillary Clinton did exceptionally well , and a map of where Republican voting in 2008 exceeded that of 2004 .

But it ’s worth remembering .

Three police officers in Houston , Texas , have been temporarily transferred from patrol duty to desk jobs after claims of assault against the father of Green Bay Packers wide receiver Donald Driver , authorities said Friday .
Marvin Driver has been in the hospital since Monday , when he was allegedly beaten during an arrest .
The fates of police officers Bacilio Guzman , Gilberto Cruz and Matthew Marin will be decided based on the findings of the department 's internal affairs division , Police Chief Harold Hurtt said in a statement .
Marvin Driver Jr. was said to have been beaten early Monday as police were arresting him for outstanding traffic warrants .
His relatives had asked that the officers accused in the incident be suspended or placed on administrative leave .
" Investigators are awaiting medical reports on Mr. Driver to determine what injuries he sustained , " Hurtt said .
" We take allegations such as these very seriously and will conduct a thorough investigation into the matter and be transparent in our findings , whatever the conclusion . "
Driver was in good condition Friday at Memorial Hermann - Texas Medical Center , a spokeswoman said .
" Chief Harold Hurtt took a positive step in the right direction today by removing those officers from the streets , " community activist Quanell Evans , who identifies himself as Quanell X , said Friday afternoon .
" We believe it's in the best interest of this community until the conclusion of this IAD investigation that these officers not be allowed to patrol this area . "
Evans did not mention the officers by name but placed more blame for the incident on the first two officers who arrived at the scene .
The third man , he said , " was extremely concerned about the well - being of Mr. Driver . "
" He wanted nothing to do with what had happened to him , but he wanted to make sure that he received medical treatment , " Evans said .
" And that is the officer that we believe has already spoken up , that resulted in these officers being removed from the street today . "
Evans said Driver has been able to describe his experience in detail to investigators and his family .
Evans said doctors were still assessing Marvin Driver 's condition , which the family described as blunt - force trauma .
" Right now , he 's still in a lot of pain , " Driver 's sister , Mary Ann , said Friday .
One of Driver 's sons , Michael , has said he thinks his father was beaten because he is black .
According to family members , the officers stopped Driver in front of his mother 's home , where an argument took place between relatives and police .
The officers explained to the family that Driver was being taken to jail for the outstanding warrants , relatives said .
Evans said paramedics told him that when they picked up Driver at the jail , he was injured , semiconscious and unresponsive .

The toolbag lost by spacewalkers this past week is being tracked by satellite observers and one veteran observer actually captured the toolbag whizzing by on video !
Kevin Fetter from Brockville , Ontario video - recorded the backpack - sized toolbag last night , Nov. 22 from his backyard .
“ It was easily 8th magnitude or brighter as it passed by the 4th magnitude star eta Pisces , ” Fetter said .
Check out the video here .
What these “ amateurs ” ca n’t do these days !
If you ’d like to try to see the toolbag yourself , here ’s the link to Space Weather ’s Satellite Tracker , so you can find out when it will be traveling over your backyard .
This site provides satellite observations times for residents of the US and Canada .
The expensive toolbag floated away from Endeavour astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn - Piper during the STS - 126 mission ’s first spacewalk on Nov. 18th .
Whoever said the toolbag was lost never to be seen again !
And just why does that toolbag cost $ 100,000 ?
“ The cost included the EVA crew lock bag itself , four retractable tethers , two adjustable equipment tethers , a grease gun with a straight nozzle , two wire ties , a grease gun with a J - hook nozzle , an EVA wipe caddy , six EVA wipes ( two wet , four dry ) , a scraper debris container , a SARJ scraper and a large trash bag , ” NASA spokesman Mike Curie .
Most of that equipment and the bag are not just something you can pick up at your local hardware store .
They are specialized hardware that had to be specifically created and certified for the harsh environment of space , able to work properly in a vacuum and withstand temperature swings from plus 200 degrees F ( 93 C ) and minus 200 degrees F ( - 128 C ) .
And if you want to complain about astronauts losing things in space , then you go put on a pair of bulky , stiff gloves and a spacesuit ( and a diaper ) and try to do some very intricate , demanding work in zero gravity for about seven hours !

Economists say recession is here , and will last Two surveys project that U.S. downturn may be longer than average
The global economy has plunged into a deep recession that may be longer than the average downturn , according to two surveys of U.S. economists that echo similar declarations from authorities in Europe and Japan .
Observers say this global slowdown will start to wallop the Bay Area as the United States enters a spell of shrinking output and surging unemployment that will last through the middle of 2009 .
The gloomy picture began to emerge Monday as the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its quarterly survey of 51 economic forecasters had turned up the unanimous conclusion that the United States is in a recession .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" It 's very , very rare to get unanimity on any question , " said Tom Stark , the economist behind the Philadelphia Fed report .
The consensus among economists surveyed by the Fed is that the country entered the recession in April , that it will last 14 months and would drive the U.S. unemployment rate , now 6.6 percent , to 7.6 percent by the third quarter of 2009 .
That finding was echoed by a separate and also nearly unanimous survey issued Monday by the National Association for Business Economics .
Though the two surveys have great weight , U.S. recessions are only officially designated in retrospect by a seven - person committee affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research .
This scholarly group has characterized 10 recessions , averaging 10 months each , since World War II , the most recent being the dip from March to November in 2001 .
The bureau has not yet called a recession because it uses a more complex definition than authorities in Europe and Japan , said Nariman Behravesh , senior economist with IHS Global Insight in Boston .
They pronounced their economies in retreat after two quarters of declining gross national product .
On Friday , the European Union said the 15 nations that use the euro as their currency were in recession as Germany and Italy joined Ireland in posting back - to - back output declines .
The last big downturn in Europe was in 1993 .
Japanese authorities also declared their nation in recession Monday as the housing - inspired woes of the United States and Europe weaken demand for cars and electronics from Japan .
The only bright spot in the two nearly unanimous surveys is that the downturn has calmed inflation , most notably gas prices , giving consumers extra purchasing power , Behravesh said .
" The recent $ 2 - per - gallon drop in gas prices is the equivalent of a $ 240 billion tax cut , " said Behravesh , who called for the United States to enact a " big and quick " fiscal stimulus package .
Any such package would further strain the federal budget , already burdened by the $ 700 billion financial bailout , and contribute to a record trillion - dollar federal budget deficit in fiscal 2009 .
From a Bay Area view , the global slowdown threatens tech exports and tourism , which have so far cushioned San Francisco and the Silicon Valley from the housing bust that has already clobbered the East Bay , said regional expert Stephen Levy of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto .
" The world economy has turned down , and they are big customers of ours , " said Levy , who fears bigger job losses ahead .
Senior Wells Fargo economist Scott Anderson , who was among those surveyed by the Philadelphia Fed , said conditions have been deteriorating so rapidly that his own forecast has worsened .
He now thinks unemployment could hit 8.5 percent by the end of 2009 .
Forecaster Joel Naroff , a Pennsylvania economist who also responded to the Fed survey , said policymakers in Washington must craft a large and quick stimulus package to inject money into the economy to prevent the recession from becoming longer and deeper .
Thirty - five of the 51 economists surveyed by the Fed said their forecasts assumed that Congress would pass a $ 211 billion stimulus plan .
Behravesh said a combination of quick - acting tax rebates and longer - term infrastructure programs would provide the most bang for the buck .
Maya MacGuineas , president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , has calculated that new spending related to the financial crisis coupled with revenue losses due to the recession could lead to a $ 1 trillion federal deficit in the coming fiscal year , with revenue of $ 2.4 trillion to offset $ 3.4 trillion of spending .
" We must do whatever the economy needs , " she said , while warning that such a high level of federal borrowing could have the perverse effect of driving up the interest rates that the Fed is attempting to keep low .
" We are walking a tightrope , " MacGuineas said .
SPIEGEL Interview with George Soros ' The Economy Fell off the Cliff '
George Soros , 78 , has made billions as a hedge - fund manager and investor .
SPIEGEL spoke with him about the current financial crisis , how he expects President - elect Barack Obama to respond to the economic disaster and the responsibilities borne by speculators .
The police said they sent detectives to the man ’s home but were unable to speak with him .
The man ’s wife said , “ You can not talk to my husband ” and “ you ca n’t come in , ” according to the police .
The club reopened Saturday shortly before midnight .
The police said that they were still trying to speak to someone in the club who had witnessed the incident , and they added that they had the names of at least two other Giants players who were believed to be at the club , though they did not disclose their names .
Pierce is apparently one of those players .
Investigators said the incident took place in a small alcove between the foot of the stairs , which lead down from the entrance on Lexington Avenue , and the VIP room , which is near an elevator bank .
The VIP room is roughly 30 feet by 12 feet , with a glass wall that separates it from the rest of the club , which is a horseshoe - shaped room with a bar .
Metal detectors were situated near the foot of the stairs .
It was unclear what led to the gun ’s discharge .
There were no reports of any fights inside the club before the shooting .
The police did not say whether any charges would be filed , but they noted that felony charges were possible if a person possessed a loaded , unlicensed handgun in a place other than his residence or business .
It was not known if he had a permit to carry a concealed weapon .
Under the league ’s personal - conduct policy , violations of local gun laws can result in a player ’s suspension .
Burress did not practice for the 10 - 1 Giants last week because of the hamstring injury , sustained in a game against Baltimore on Nov. 16 .
He aggravated the injury last Sunday at Arizona .
It is the latest controversy involving Burress , who signed a five - year , $ 35 million contract with the Giants just before the season opener .
He was suspended for 12 days , including a victory over Seattle , because he missed meetings without explanation .
Against San Francisco on Oct. 19 , Burress shouted at Coach Tom Coughlin on the sideline after drawing an unsportsmanlike - conduct penalty .
The N.F.L. fined Burress $ 45,000 for verbally abusing the officials .
Coughlin held him out of the first quarter of the Oct. 26 game against the Steelers because he missed treatment on a neck and shoulder injury the day before .

From the about page :
Nice !
Except today , a good bit after the fact , I learned of a peculiar lawsuit that information and news giant Thomson Reuters Inc. filed last month against the makers of Zotero .
From the website of The Chronicle of Higher Education , October 3 , 2008 , by Jeffrey R. Young ( links added ) :
Thomson Reuters Inc. sued George Mason University in a Virginia court this month , arguing that a free software tool made by the university makes improper use of the company ’s EndNote citation software ....
Thomson Reuters argues that the latest release of George Mason ’s software , which can import files created by EndNote and turn them into files that can be used and shared online using Zotero , “ is willfully and intentionally destroying Thomson ’s customer base for the EndNote software . ”
The company seeks $ 10 - million in damages for each year the university has offered the software and to stop the university from distributing versions of Zotero that can convert EndNote files .
One person who commented on the lawsuit is Michael Feldstein , who writes a blog about online learning .
He posted the following on October 5 :
Apparently , the Zotero team did create their own style format and is crowd - sourcing the creation of import styles .
As you can see from this Zotero developer discussion thread , the developers considered and explicitly rejected supporting the redistribution of Thomson - supplied EndNote conversion files .
In fact , while Zotero can read EndNote style files , it specifically does not convert them into Zotero ’s own format , in large part to discourage the redistribution ( deliberately or accidentally ) of Thomson - created files .
What the import feature does facilitate is ( a ) users who have already licensed EndNote and want to migrate to Zotero can use the EndNote styles that they have already paid for , and ( b ) Zotero users can take advantage of the EndNote import styles that individual journal publishers ( as opposed to Thomson itself ) make available for the convenience of their subscribers .
These uses strike me as totally within bounds .
( More is available from the Disruptive Library Technology Jester blog . )
Given my biases this lawsuit seems like an anachronistic , hamfisted attempt to block competition .
While as a programmer I love being able to adapt open - source software to my particular needs , I use a mix of closed - source and open - source software without many qualms .
That said , non-standard , closed - source document formats are awful stuff that block competition between software vendors and , worse , waste god-awful amounts of my time .
If you wish to dispute me on this then come to my office tomorrow to help me , over the course of several hours , yank a magazine 's - worth of text out of Quark XPress , using a mix of applications and balky emacs macros .
( Imagine if you could take back all the time spent wrangling closed , proprietary document formats .
You could finish Perl 6 ; you could probably write it in Arc. )
I 'm not an Endnote user and I do n't like to borrow trouble ( which is why I 've been avoiding this blog ; blogging is a great way to borrow trouble ) .
But not only does this lawsuit invoke the dread specter of legally - enforced proprietary data formats , it raises questions about Thomson Reuters 's legal attitude towards the data produced by its other software offerings — including , in this case , a piece of software called OpenCalais .
OpenCalais is a web - based application that consumes text and returns special Semantic Web - style metadata that you can use to do interesting , Semantic Web - style things , like : create topic pages , improve search , or enhance local taxonomies .
It has a Facebook group and its website features both video of straight - talking bearded coders and a creatively borrowed terms of service statement :
We based these Terms of Service under those released by Automattic under a Creative Commons Sharealike license .
Thanks to Automattic and WordPress.com for sharing .
I have a quarter - million - page corpus at work and I 'm looking for simple , inexpensive ways to enhance it , so I 've followed the development of their platform for some time — joining the FaceBook group , signing up for an account , and using their free endpoint for testing ( go ahead and give it a spin ) .
My grand , entirely unrealized plan was to include a direct hook to OpenCalais in our content management system .
The OpenCalais team seem trustworthy , progressive , and smart , and committed to openness .
But , at least for now , the lawsuit against Zotero has scared me off using the product .
This despite , as pointed out by the Panlibus blog at Talis , in a post on OpenCalais as it relates to the Zotero lawsuit , the following statement from the OpenCalais folk :
We want to make all the world ’s content more accessible , interoperable and valuable .
Some call it Web 2.0 , Web 3.0 , the Semantic Web or the Giant Global Graph — we call our piece of it Calais .
So why am I overreacting ?
Well , that “ our piece of it ” bit is a little tricky , but I think I get what they mean , and the Endnote people and the OpenCalais people are in different parts of a very large organization and working on different projects with different goals .
But the parent company is the same , and , professionally I feel required to overreact , because in every situation — as editor , coder , designer , and so forth — I to my great regret must always concern myself with liability .
I hate that part of my job .
From worrying about copyright and fair use , to questioning whether we can reuse art or prose from our own archives , to sending out cease and desists — it all fills me with gloom and despair , the sense of being a culpable cog in a lumbering legal machine .
It 's the opposite of creative , interesting work , but if you get something wrong the consequences can be dire , so worrying about getting sued is something that has to be done , every day , even on the subway .
I 'm worried about getting sued right now , sitting here , typing this .
If you 've had someone threaten you with a lawsuit , you know the sort of fear and second - guessing it engenders .
Even if I am certain that I have followed every ethical and legal guideline , it 's an instant panic attack to see the words “ contacting a lawyer ” or “ liable for damages ” in an email ; it leads to second - guessing , and I know there will be phone calls , meetings , and several months of followups to comply with the needs of insurers .
If I can see the shadow of a lawsuit anywhere I am obligated to shine a light upon it and freak out at least a little ; otherwise I 'm not doing my job .
And that 's what 's going on here .
This recent lawsuit against George Mason / Zotero immediately brought to to mind a scenario : Thomson Reuters maintains control over the taxonomy , the thesaurus , of terms used in OpenCalais , and they do the indexing of content to associate that content with terms .
The use pattern I was considering was as follows :
Create text within a content management system ;
Send that text to OpenCalais ; Store the metadata it returns ;
Over time , use aggregated metadata , integrated with our existing ~ 80,000 subjects , to create a local taxonomy for faceted search and automatically - compiled topic pages , along with other interesting interfaces .
Share as much of the taxonomy as possible as downloadable RDF ;
Make sure to provide links back to OpenCalais wherever possible , on their terms , as defined in their Terms of Service ( TOS ) document .
That 's probably not a big deal .
I doubt anyone would even notice .
But ... is it at all possible , conceivable , even a tiny bit that at some point in the future Thomson Reuters could claim that we were misusing their data in step ( 4 ) , above ?
From the TOS :
If you syndicate , publish or otherwise transmit any content containing , enhanced by or derived from Calais - generated metadata you will use your best efforts to incorporate the correct Calais - provided Globally Unique Identifier [ GUID ] in that content .
It seems straightforward , but that “ best efforts .... ”
The truth is , I do n't really know exactly what they mean there .
Also from the TOS :
You will not use any metadata or GUIDs produced by Calais to create a metadata retrieval service similar to Calais .
And could they claim that we were somehow creating a derivative work without permission and distributing it in step ( 5 ) ?
I would say , based on my far - from - authoritative reading of the TOS , and given the suit against George Mason University , there is now a precedent ; that is , it is within the realm of possibility that if I passed thousands of web pages through OpenCalais and decided to adapt the resultant format for my own use in a way that Thomson Reuters disliked , I could get a fat letter from some lawyer someday demanding damages , accusing me of creating a derivative work based on their proprietary taxonomy , in violation of their terms .
I 'm not saying it 's likely ; I 'm not saying I 'm right ; I 'm not even saying that Thomson Reuters would be legally or ethically wrong to sue for damages .
I would bet $ 10,000 right now against my fears coming to pass .
But IANAL , which is exactly my problem here .
And this is not a call to boycott anything , nor an attempt to get personalized service out of OpenCalais , where the developers are doing some very fine Semantic Web - bootstrapping work .
I know Thomson Reuters could give a damn about me , and in that they are justified — I 'm just another API key hash in their database , and even if I upgraded to their for - pay service I 'd never represent more than a balance - sheet rounding error .
My only purpose in writing today is to point out how a lawsuit can have unintended chilling effects , at least for me .
We 're in a remarkable downturn , and people are being told to “ get real or go home . ”
One way corporations get “ real ” is to sue the living shit out of everything that blinks .
It 's probably a good time to review the terms of service for all of your critical software to make sure you 're in compliance ; I wonder if a lot of Web 2.0 mashup decentralized goodwill is going to go to good - faith heaven as companies under financial strain start to look closely at their patent portfolios and vendor agreements , and decide that printing out lawsuits is even cheaper than deploying to EC2 .
And now that the “ Semantic Web , ” or “ Web 3.0 , ” or the “ Linked Data Web , ” or the “ Web of Really , That 's How to Query Over an rdf : Bag ? ” or whatever they 're calling it , is viable enough that you can't shrug off legal worries — now that the Semantic Web is no longer just a research project , if someone owns the taxonomy you 're using and changes it up on you , what rights do you have in the matter ?
Who owns the GUIDs ?
Your honor , I just wanted to build a hierarchy of topic pages .
I never meant to hurt nobody .
And so forth .
To summarize : working in web publishing , I have a healthy fear of lawsuits bordering on the insanely paranoid ; and I wish it were not so , but that is now part of the job , as the web of ideas has given way to the web of pricks ; and finally , actions speak louder than Creative Commons - licensed terms of service .
You can still get handed a subpoena while you 're riding the Cluetrain .
Now that I got the fear , do I want to go to the effort to ( 1 ) educate a few people in management , none of whom would have great interest in the subject except as a soporific , about the far - fetched risks of using externally - generated taxonomies to organize our content ; and do I ( 2 ) want to spend a number of hours in the near future educating myself over the completely nebulous rights issues connected to taxonomies , linking , and file formats , thus taking even more time away from code and prose to give it to the law ; and do I possibly even ( 3 ) want to allocate the budget to work with a lawyer on taxonomy - related issues ?
All the while knowing that I 'm overreacting and that this is probably pointless ?
Not really .
I 'd rather let other people do that and read the judges ' opinions .
Let deeper pockets set the precedent ; what I do want to do is to port the CMS to Django , an open - sourced CMS published by a foundation , get the search into Solr , also published by a foundation , and introduce hierarchy to the 80,000 subjects we already have indexed .
I 'm just going to put OpenCalais away for a while and start looking at DBpedia again , then see how that whole Zotero suit works out over the next few months or decades .
In one way , this is all great because I love the Semantic Web to the point of stupidity — to the point of building a custom content management system entirely based on alpha - level technology using RDF for storage , creating a framework even slower than Rails .
So I 'm grateful to Zotero for taking the brunt of the lawsuit , because it gave me reason to take off my rose - tinted Linked Data goggles , and made me aware that all of my planned Semantic Web taxonomy - sharing fun could come crashing down if I do n't carefully track the provenance of every one of my triples , erring always on the side of raving terror .
Know what else is great ?
Now , finally , ten years on , I know that the Semantic Web is real and viable , because I 'm afraid I 'll get sued for using it .
That 's the true measure of a maturing technology — eat it , Gartner hype cycle .
I believe , as in do n't - get - him - started , that taxonomy - driven interactive editorial is essential to the future of the web , and thus to storytelling and narrative in general .
Clearly a great deal of money is being spent by major companies in pursuit of the golden triple :
It appears the AP is working on taxonomy tools , and Rupert Murdoch 's Dow Jones has Synaptica and publishes a cute taxonomy cookbook .
A number of other companies are out there , building massive thesauri and indexing tools , hacking parsers and coding semantic disambiguators like mad , banging their heads against pronouns .
There will be many , many competitors seeking to add their own structure our increasingly Web - content - driven reality , and we will , if we use their services , find ourselves beholden to their methods of indexing , with all manner of legal compliance and copyright issues as of yet untested in courts .
Creating good , broad , world - describing taxonomies is extraordinarily expensive , because reality is large , and these companies will need to strike a balance between sharing their work and protecting it , so I imagine this will be a subject I 'll revisit , professionally , many times over the next few decades ( barring complete societal breakdown , or a personal spiritual awakening that allows me to stop thinking about this sort of thing ) .
Such questions could keep a librarian up at night , staring at the wall , petting his or her sleek gray cat Otlet and wondering what , for instance , a political campaign looks like when all of the news and columns are automatically classified before being published .
Competition , he or she might conclude , must be encouraged between these platforms ; there must be a free , and yet somehow regulated ( perhaps by the W3C , or preferably by an organization with a more attractive website ) , market of taxonomies — you can't have people claiming to own concepts conjoined to unique identifiers , can you ?
Can you ?
You probably can ?
Oh .
But there 's likely no reason to worry ; and I am just borrowing trouble ; and maybe the Semantic Web wo n't matter that much after all .
Even if taxonomies do become increasingly important in our web of linked data , thank God we live in a society with an enlightened understanding of intellectual property , and that we can trust the tiny handful of organizations that control the world 's supply of news , as they become software providers as well as content providers , to do the right thing when it comes to serving the needs of a wider populace , in a culture that would rather foster dialogue , discussion , and mutually beneficial resolutions than use the ugly , blunt tool of potentially profitable lawsuits .
I 'm sure — really , I am — that mine is an overreaction .
And onward , to progress .

Australia versus New Zealand Convicts versus do gooders Australia and New Zealand share three main commonalities .
Firstly , the urban societies of both countries were created by the British in the last three centuries and built on the invasion of a population that did n't live in cities .
Secondly , around 20 per cent of the population of both countries are migrants .
Thirdly , both countries are in the same part of the world .
Although both countries share some commonalities , they have been subjected to differing historical and environmental influences that have resulted in significant cultural differences .
Specifically , Australia was founded to be a penal colony while New Zealand was founded to be a religious colony .
Furthermore , Australia is a harsh land of droughts , snakes and desert while New Zealand is a heavenly land of lakes , glaciers and fertile soil .
Economies New Zealand Australia Population 4,474,549 ( July 2016 est. ) 22,992,654 ( July 2016 est. ) GDP per capita ( $ US ) $ 37,100 ( 2016 est. ) $ 48,800 ( 2016 est. ) GDP - composition by sector : agriculture : 4.2 % industry : 26.5 % services : 69.2 % ( 2016 est. ) agriculture : 3.6 % industry : 28.2 % services : 68.2 % ( 2016 est. ) Racial groups European 71.2 % , Maori 14.1 % , Asian 11.3 % , Pacific peoples 7.6 % , Middle Eastern , Latin American , African 1.1 % , other 1.6 % , not stated or unidentified 5.4 % English 25.9 % , Australian 25.4 % , Irish 7.5 % , Scottish 6.4 % , Italian 3.3 % , German 3.2 % , Chinese 3.1 % , Indian 1.4 % , Greek 1.4 % , Dutch 1.2 % , other 15.8 % ( includes Australian aboriginal .5 % ) , unspecified 5.4 % Export partners China 17.6 % , Australia 16.9 % , US 11.8 % , Japan 6 % ( 2015 ) China 32.2 % , Japan 15.9 % , South Korea 7.1 % , US 5.4 % , India 4.2 % ( 2015 ) From CIA World Fact Book History Prior to the arrival of the English , New Zealand was discovered by the Maori , who were believed to have arrived in New Zealand from easter n Polynesia sometime before 1300 .
There may or may not have been people in New Zealand before the Maori .
New Zealand was discovered by Europeans in the 17th century .
Some time in the 18th century , a trickle of escaped Convicts from Australia made it to New Zealand and built a community based on whaling and sealing .
These escaped Convicts also formed relationships with the Maori .
Because the nature of these relationships offended English religious figures , in 1814 a religious mission led by Samuel Marsden set out to convert the Maori to Christianity and so protect them from the corruptive influence of whalers and sealers .
As reward for accepting the gospel , the Maori were often given guns .
More free migrants followed and it was not long before guns had escalated conflicts between different Maori tribes , and between Maori tribes and colonists .
To calm the war , in 1840 , Britain formerly took possession of New Zealand and signed the Treaty of Waitangi with local chiefs .
The treaty granted England absolute sovereignty , stipulated that Maori would retain possession of their land but could only sell to the crown and the Maori would have equal rights as British subjects .
Although there was division between Maori and colonists , New Zealand never had the division between different groups of colonists that led to anything like the Eureka rebellion , or Ned Kelly 's last stand .
Nor did New Zealand ever develop a bushranging tradition or mythology .
Today , the influence of history is best illustrated in Australians knowing less of their colonial history than New Zealanders know of theirs .
Because Australia 's urban history is based on 80 years of criminality , most Australians do n't want to learn about it .
On the other hand , because New Zealand 's urban history is based on good Christians , New Zealanders do want to learn about it .
A good example of the respective ideologies can be seen in regards to Samuel Marsden .
Before going to New Zealand , Marsden lived in Australia and had to deal with Convicts .
He was known as a cruel man that took delight in the witness of human misery .
Today , few Australians have heard of his name .
In New Zealand ; however , Marsden never had to deal with Convicts .
Consequently , he devoted his energies towards converting the Maori and became widely respected .
Almost all New Zealanders have heard of his name .
The different histories between Australia and New Zealand are also reflected in the identities of the respective indigenous populations .
The Maori have a warrior - style identity but feel that their treaty with the British was never honoured by the other side .
On the other hand , the Aborigines have more of a victim identity .
They feel that they were wronged by Christian missionaries and that their peaceful life was shattered by English soldiers .
Attitude to England With its Convict foundations , Australia has always had a strain of people defined by their hostility towards England .
For example , Henry Lawson , a poet writing at the turn of the 20th century , wrote : " Why on earth do we want closer connection with England ?
We have little in common with English people except our language .
We are fast becoming an entirely different people .
We are more liberal , and , considering our age , more progressive than England is .
The majority of English people know nothing of Australia , and even the higher classes understand neither us nor our country .
The latter entertain a sort of good - natured contempt for us which is only the outcome of their contact with our own shoddy aristocracy , which is several degrees more contemptible than that of England .
The loyal talk of Patriotism , Old England , Mother Land , etc. Patriotism ?
after Egypt , Burmah , Soudan , etc. Bah ! it sickens one .
Go and read His Natural Life , and other natural lives , by Marcus Clarke , and then talk of the dear old Mother Land that gave us birth . " ( 2 ) Reflecting the attitudes expressed by Lawson , when the Australian Labor Party was established in the 1890s , it took the American spelling of Labor to associate itself with the progressive ideals of the USA rather than the conservative ideals of England .
Because it lacks a Convict heritage , New Zealand has been far more united in praise towards England than has Australia .
This was especially evident in the 1982 Falklands War.
New Zealand joined Britain in the war against Argentina and broke off diplomatic relations against its South American enemy .
Then prime minister Robert Muldoon said : " With the Falkland Islanders it is family … Don't forget .
In New Zealand , we are still a member of the same family . "
God Save the Queen is still an official anthem of New Zealand , and their national sport is typically associated with the private schools of England .
Such is their loyalty to Britain , Australians have referred to New Zealanders as " South Sea Poms . "
Jokes Australian and New Zealanders both like to insult each other with jokes .
Traditionally , when Australians joked about New Zealanders , they would have some kind of lewd twist on the New Zealander 's affection for sheep or refer to them as South Pacific Poms ( English ) .
When New Zealanders joked about Australia , they would have some kind of twist on Australians being stupid .
For example , when former New Zealand prime minister Robert Muldoon was questioned about increased levels of emigration from New Zealand to Australia , he responded that these migrants " raised the average IQ of both countries . "
The lewdness in Australian jokes can be seen as a penal legacy .
The Australians - are - stupid tradition in New Zealand humour is the same tradition used by the English when insulting Australians .
In other words , the New Zealanders lack the imagination to create traditions of their own .
Australian jokes about New Zealanders Indigenous population Maori culture is far more prominent in New Zealand society than Aboriginal cultures are in Australian society .
For example , Maori is an official language of New Zealand .
It is taught in schools , used in government departments and broadcast on television .
New Zealand also has a Maori monarch and a Maori war dance is performed before rugby games .
One reason why Maori culture is more prominent in New Zealand than Aboriginal cultures are in Australia is that the Maori population was relatively monocultural in comparison to the multicultural Aboriginal populations of Australia .
It is not possible to make Aboriginal an official language of Australia because there is no Aboriginal language .
Instead , there are around 250 languages .
Likewise , there are so many cultural differences between Aboriginal tribes that it is not possible to speak of an Aboriginal monarch or Aboriginal customs .
Due to the lack of cultural unity , in 1971 an Aborigine named Harold Thomas designed a red , yellow and black flag .
This flag greatly distinguishes the modern Aboriginal identity from the modern Maori identity .
Whereas the modern Aborigines affirm their Aboriginal identity by waving the flag , the Maori affirm their identity by speaking the Maori language , getting tattoos , and following traditional practices .
The Maori had a flag officially recognised in 2010 .
Race relations New Zealand is more racially conscious than Australia , and is less friendly to Asia .
Most Asians who have experienced both nations say that Australia is inclusive while New Zealand is very racist .
The racism to Asians probably stems from the way that contemporary identities of New Zealanders of European and Maori are a function of their ancestry .
Specifically , the morality of the identities usually revolves around the past relationships between Pakeha ( European ) and Maori , which leaves Asians as passive onlookers .
Many Pakeha have a sovereign power identity that can be traced back to the Treaty of Waitangi .
Although they may talk about the victimisation that the Maori have suffered , they do so because it positions Pakeha as the race holding power .
The Maori are proud of their race , history and culture .
Like many group - before - individual cultures , a strong identification with the group and the exclusion of others provides individual Maori with self esteem .
It perhaps also emboldens the Maori to confidently express some racist views .
Asians are somewhat of a nuisance in the respective identities .
For Pakeha , there is a reluctance to include Asians in the soverign power identity .
At best , they are expected to adopt some kind of victim identity or just stay silent .
The views of Winston Peters , the ex-New Zealand foreign minister , illustrate the manner that New Zealand 's history and culture is used in a way to exclude the descendants of " late comers " .
Peters is a mix of Maori and Pakeha ancestry and has appealed to anti-Asian sentiment in New Zealand .
According to Peters : " We say when there are projections from Statistics New Zealand showing Asians outnumbering Maori in around 20 years time because of immigration that something should be done about it . "
" We are being dragged into the status of an Asian colony and it is time that New Zealanders were placed first in their own country . "
" We have now reached the point where you can wander down Queen Street in Auckland and wonder if you are still in New Zealand or some other country . "
( 3 ) In 2007 , Winston Peters was running second in polls showing New Zealand 's preferred Prime Minister .
In 2017 , Peters appeared a likely kingmaker in the run up to the federal election .
Outback store in Australia - 1980 Chinese migrant identity In New Zealand , people of Chinese origin tend to maintain an ethnic Chinese identity .
In Australia , they are more likely to consider themselves to be Australian .
The difference in identities has in turn been reflected in political representation .
The National Party 's Pansy Wong is New Zealand 's only politician of Chinese ancestry .
The low representation is somewhat surprising considering that New Zealand 's political system encourages minority representation .
With a strong ethnic identity , Chinese in New Zealand have focussed their political energies on gaining an apology and compensation for their past mistreatment .
In 2002 , successful lobbying led to New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark formerly apologising to the Chinese over their treatment from the 1880s to the 1950 .
In 2004 , Helen Clarke formerly announced a compensation package for present generation Chinese who were still suffering the hurt inflicted on previous generations .
In Australia , Chinese have been more likely to give up their ethnic identity , which has in turn allowed Australian politicians of Chinese extraction to build a connection with a wider block of voters .
These politicians include John So , Henry Tsang , Bill O'Chee , Peter Wong , Alfred Huang , and Penny Wong .
Outside of politics , other Australians of Chinese extraction with a high profile include Bing Lee , Cindy Pan , Victor Chang , L.J Hooker , Kylie Kwong , Jeff Fatt and major general Darryl Low Choy .
Unlike people of Chinese heritage in New Zealand , people of Chinese heritage in Australia are unlikely to have a victim identity and there has never been a campaign to ask for a government apology for events of the past .
The victim identity of the New Zealand Chinese can be explained as stemming from the desire of the Pakeha to identify as a sovereign power .
Specifically , the Pakeha like non-whites identifying as victims because it positions the white race in a position of empowerment .
Paying the Chinese to identify as victims was therefore an empowering act for the Pakeha in that it affirmed their sovereign power identity .
Admittedly , it is also possible that the New Zealand Chinese embraced the victim identity because relative to contemporary Chinese in Australia , they were more likely to experience oppression .
Nevertheless , Pakeha have a stronger racial identity in New Zealand than people of European ancestry have in Australia and those who identify as Pakeha perhaps have a stronger sovereign power identity than those who identify as Australian .
In New Zealand , national myths make it easy for people of European ancestry to identify as sovereign powers that position non-whites as disempowered victims .
In Australia , Convict heritage makes identities linking of race and power much more complicated .
Sport
In regards to sport , the main difference between New Zealand and Australia is that New Zealand never invented its own team sports like Australia .
In New Zealand , rugby union is the most popular of these sports .
Australians have also embraced foreign sports but they have also invented some of their own .
These sports include polocrosse , indoor cricket , touch football , surf life saving , and Australian football .
Rugby union is a popular sport in the private schools of two of Australia ’s six states .
Historically , its popularity in the private schools stemmed from its image as an English sport .
Despite the success of Australia 's rugby union team , it probably resides in popularity behind the other football codes of Australia football , rugby league and soccer .
Although it is not as popular as rugby union , New Zealanders also like cricket .
Unfortunately , the New Zealanders are n't very good at it .
It took them a world record of 27 years to win their first test match .
Needless to say , New Zealand has never won any cricket World Cups and has never struck fear into other cricketing nations around the world .
A 19th century cartoon that mocks the mayor of Melbourne for using a visit by an English rugby union as an excuse to pour scorn on the Australian game .
In the southern states of Victoria , Tasmania , South Australia and Western Australia , Australian football eventually won the battle over union .
In the northern states of NSW and Queensland , the battle kept Australian football weak .
Rugby league then positioned itself as a compromise code .
Rugby league 's working class image helped it gain mainstream popularity in NSW and Queensland while union retreated to the private schools of the two states .
Environment New Zealand is an environmental heaven .
It receives high rainfall , has huge rivers fed by melting glaciers , and has nutrient rich soils .
It is great for skiing , fishing , farming , bush walking and mountaineering .
On the other hand , Australia 's deserts , droughts and leached soils are more of an acquired beauty .
For farmers they can be hell .
The snakes of Australia generally stay out of harms way but they can be intimidating for foreigners .
Because they have always lived in an environmental paradise , New Zealanders do n't have the same battler mythology of Australians , who have always had to deal with drought and scorched earth .
Admittedly , New Zealand winters can be tough and it suffers earthquakes , but in terms of making a living off the land , New Zealand is a superior country to Australia .
In short , the land is more productive and rainfall is reliable .
Aborigines stand over failed inland expansion .
Maori ready their guns for war .
Political system Australia and New Zealand have had different kinds of social disputes over the last two centuries .
As a result , their political systems have been designed to address those disputes .
In Australia , voting is compulsory .
In New Zealand , it is not .
Australia uses preferential voting in which candidates are ranked in order of preference .
New Zealand does not .
Australia uses a first - past - the - post system that gives the seat to the candidate that gets the most votes or preferences .
This results in two major parties dominating .
New Zealand uses a proportional voting system .
This results in some major parties , but also representation from minority nationalist groups , business lobbies , environmentalists and parties aligned with specific races .
Australia has a senate .
New Zealand does not .
Australia does not have seats reserved for any racial group .
New Zealand has special seats reserved for Maori .
The major parties of Australia are the Australian Labor Party ( which uses American spelling ) and the Liberal Party of Australia .
The major parties of New Zealand are the New Zealand Labour Party ( which uses British spelling ) and the New Zealand National Party .
The Queen of England is the head of state of both countries .
National anthems The Australian national anthem is Advance Australia Fair .
It has plenty of critics in Australia .
It sings about ' wealth for toil ' , and being ' gurt by sea . '
New Zealand has two national anthems of equal status - God Defend New Zealand and God Save the Queen .
God Defend New Zealand sings about loving peace .
God Save the Queen is the national anthem of Britain .
Economy New Zealand 's economy underperforms .
In 2004 , per capita GDP was $ US23,200 , which was only about 60 per cent of American per capita GDP and even lower than Spanish GDP .
Considering the country 's environmental and mineral resources , the low GDP has been a cause of concern .
It seems that a lot of New Zealanders do n't want to develop manufacturing industries , nor do they want to exploit their abundant resources of gas and coal , or even some of their farming resources .
Instead , they want a tourism - based economy like Fiji , the Solomon Islands or the Philippines .
New Zealand 's major trading partners are Australia , the United States and Japan .
Arguably , the Australian economy also underperforms , although not to the same extent as New Zealand .
In 2004 , Australian per capita GDP was $ US32,900 , which was equal to the four largest west European economies , but lower than America .
Put simply , Australians are nearly a third more productive than New Zealanders .
Mining is a profitable industry in Australia , and contributed 5.6 per cent to GDP in 2003 .
Services are the largest sector of the Australian economy .
Australia has significantly more trade with Asia than New Zealand has .
China is Australia 's largest trading partner , followed by Japan , South Korea , and the United States .
Some of Australia 's flagship brands are BHP Billiton , the world 's largest mining company , News Ltd , the world 's largest media company , Orlando Wines , producer of the biggest selling Australian wine label in the world , and Cochlear Limited , designers and manufacturers of the cochlear implant .
Diaspora Both Australians and New Zealanders have a fondness for living in other people 's countries .
Out of Australia 's population of 20 million , about five per cent ( 1,000,000 ) are living in foreign countries .
Out of New Zealand 's population of 4.7 million , around 17.5 per cent ( 800,000 ) live in foreign countries .
The New Zealand diaspora is particularly high due to the 1973 Trans - Tasman Travel Arrangement , which allows Australian and New Zealand citizens to enter each other 's country to live and work , without the need to apply for authority to enter the other country .
Even though New Zealand has superb natural beauty , the flow of people between the two countries has been very much a one - way street .
In 2005 , an estimated 449,000 New Zealand citizens were living in Australia .
Many of the New Zealanders are economic refugees trying to improve their employment prospects .
Others are Asian social refugees trying to escape the racism that flows from the Maori / Pakeha social dynamic .
Inventions Most English speaking nations have a long history of invention and New Zealand is no exception .
New Zealand 's record seems to show a distinct trend towards recreation .
These include Zorbing , high speed amphibian car , Jet pack , referee whistle , jet - boat , artificial reef for surfing , eggbeaters , hairpins , sheeb ( cycling monorail ) , and bungy jumping .
Australian inventions include the Jindalee radar system that transformed the $ 16 billion American " stealth " bomber into nothing more than an unusual looking aircraft .
Other inventions include the cochlear implant , the winged keel , the electric drill , the refrigerator , black box flight recorder , nuclear fusion , differential gears , orbital combustion engine , penicillin , ultrasound , gene shears and the scram jet .
For some silly reason , an ugly clothes line known as the Hills Hoist is promoted as a symbol of Australian ingeuinity over the alternative inventions .
In regards to research , in total , New Zealand has produced three Nobel Prize winners .
This is not a bad achievement considering that high - tech countries such as Japan have only won 13 , and China has not won any .
The most notable of these was Ernest Rutherford , who split the atom in 1919 .
In comparison to New Zealand , Australia has produced ten Nobel Prize winners .
Nine of the Australian winners were for science or medicine and one was for literature .
Another eight people with links to Australia have won Nobel Prizes .
Attitudes Former All Blacks captain David Kirk , now CEO of Fairfax Media , said , " Australians are assertive , more confident , possibly more optimistic , and probably more demanding , and tend to get what they want out of a deal . "
( 1 ) Film Industries Both New Zealand and Australia have underperforming film industries but have still managed to produce actors and directors that have had great success in Hollywood .
Once Were Warriors ( 1994 ) is New Zealand 's highest grossing film .
It took $ 1.3 million at the American box office and around $ 6 million world wide .
The movie is about a dysfunctional Maori family in which the westernised father beats up his wife and fails to protect his children .
The movie blames cultural breakdown for the domestic violence and advocates a rediscovery of traditional Maori culture to remedy the problem .
The Piano ( 1993 ) is New Zealand 's most critically acclaimed film , winning four Academy Awards .
It is about a mute pianist and her daughter , set during the mid-19th century New Zealand .
Peter Jackson ( Lord of the Rings , King Kong ) is New Zealand 's most renowned director .
Jane Campion ( Piano ) is another successful director .
New Zealand has produced a couple of successful actors .
The most notable is Sam Neill .
( Omen III , Hunt for Red October , Jurassic Park I and III ) .
Other semi-famous actors include Anna Paquin ( Piano , X - Men ) and Keisha Castle - Hughes ( Whale Rider . ) Russel Crowe ( Romper Stomper , Beautiful Mind , Gladiator ) is sometimes referred to as a New Zealander .
He was born in New Zealand , moved to Australia when he was 4 , moved back to New Zealand when he was 16 , and then moved back to Australia when he was 21 .
He was a product of the Australian film system , owns an Australian rugby league team and speaks with an Australian accent .
He wants Australian citizenship sohe can vote in Australian elections but does n't have it .
In New Zealand , he is on the Maori electoral role and is the cousin of New Zealand cricketers Martin and Jeff Crowe .
Perhaps both countries can claim influence over his socialisation .
Crocodile Dundee I ( 1986 ) and II are Australia 's highest grossing films ; earning $ 328,000,000 and $ 239,600,000 worldwide respectively .
The films use a Seinfield style humour to point out the absurdities of modern life .
Different individuals are put in different cultural contexts to cause a reflection upon themselves and the culture .
It is this reflection where the humour originates from .
Australia has produced many successful actors including Hugo Weaving ( Matrix ) Paul Hogan ( Crocodile Dundee ) Mel Gibson ( Mad Max , Gallipoli , Lethal Weapon , Braveheart ) Cate Blanchett ( Elizabeth , Lord of the Rings ) Nicole Kidman ( Batman , Moulin Rouge ) Hugh Jackman ( X - men , The Prestige ) Errol Flynn ( Captain Blood ) Heath Ledger ( Brokeback Mountain ) Eric Bana ( Hulk , Troy , Chopper ) Geoffrey Rush ( Pirates of the Caribbean ) Naomi Watts ( King Kong ) , Guy Pearce ( LA confidential ) and Russel Crowe ( Romper Stomper , Beautiful Mind , Gladiator ) .
Successful directors include Peter Weir ( Picnic at Hanging Rock , Gallipoli , Truman Show ) , Bruce Beresford ( Breaker Morant , Puberty Blues ) , George Miller ( Mad Max ) , Baz Luhrmann ( Strictly Ballroom , Romeo and Juliet , Moulin Rouge ) , Phillip Noyce ( Bone Collector , Clear and Present Danger ) Frederick Alan Schepisi ( Russia House , Empire Falls ) , Yahoo Serious ( Young Einstein ) .
Language New Zealand and Australia have different versions of English .
One difference is that New Zealanders have difficulty pronouncing ' I ' sounds correctly .
For example , instead of saying " fish and chips " New Zealanders say " fush and chups . "
Another difference is that New Zealand English lacks the difference in male and female pronunciation that is a feature of Australian English .
In New Zealand , men and women pronounce their diagnostic vowels in the same fashion .
On the other hand , the male Australian accent is significantly different from the female accent .
About ten per cent of Australian men speak like Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin , with what is known as a broad accent .
Around 80 per cent speak like Nicole Kidman , with what is known as a British received accent .
A final ten per cent speak with a cultivated accent , which sounds like someone educated at Oxford University in England .
These speakers are chiefly women .
( Australia is the only English speaking country with a gender difference in pronunciation . )
A final difference between Australia and New Zealand English is creativity in language use .
New Zealanders do not use rhyming slang , idiomatic expressions , humorous expressions or profanity to the same extent as Australians .
International relations
When it comes to international pressure , New Zealanders have consistently shown that they are more than willing to ignore what others suggest they do .
The different approaches towards the international community between Australia and New Zealand were expressed in sporting tours to South Africa in the Apartheid era , the breakdown of the ANZUS treaty and the joint - bid by both countries to co-host the 2003 rugby union World Cup .
In the 1970s , the international community imposed boycotts on South Africa in protest against its apartheid system .
While most countries , including Australia , joined the boycotts , New Zealand continued to send the All Blacks on rugby tours and continued to receive Springbok tours to New Zealand .
In protest against New Zealand 's actions , twenty - five African nations boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal .
Another difference between Australia and New Zealand can be seen in regards to the ANZUS Treaty .
The ANZUS Treaty is a military alliance which binds Australia and New Zealand and , separately , Australia and the United States , to cooperate on defence matters in the Pacific Ocean .
It used to bind New Zealand and the United States as well , but in 1986 New Zealand banned US nuclear powered war ships from entering New Zealand waters .
In response , the United States suspended its obligations to New Zealand ; saying that the country was ' a friend but not an ally . "
Whether New Zealand was principled or pig- headed really depends on perspectives .
The banning of the war ships provided no benefit to New Zealanders aside from making them feel better about themselves .
The cost of banning them ; however , was a lack of defence cooperation with the most powerful military in the world and a free trade agreement with the largest market in the world .
Aside from maintaining sporting relations with white South Africa and devaluing the ANZUS treaty , the nature of New Zealand 's international relations can be inferred from their bid for the 2003 rugby World Cup .
Initially , both Australia and New Zealand were awarded the right to co-host the cup .
Despite agreeing to certain commercial stipulations governing sponsorship , advertising and ticketing when making the bid , New Zealand backtracked once the right to host the cup had been awarded .
The International Rugby Board warned New Zealand to conform to the pre-agreed commercial stipulations but New Zealand remained steadfast that it could n't or would n't .
The International Rugby Board then stripped New Zealand of its right to co-host the cup and Australia held it on its own .
When stripping New Zealand of its right , the IRB issued a statement declaring : Generous accommodations made by RWCL to meet the needs and problems of the NZRU were repaid with consistent failures and wholly inappropriate behaviour .
Despite this , the Council determined to give full and fair hearing to New Zealand 's position and to its most recent submissions .
However , the outstanding Australian proposal held an attraction , a professionalism and a logic which were irresistible . " ( 4 ) Anzac Day Anzac Day is the day for both Australia and New Zealanders to remember fallen soldiers .
It is celebrated on the 25th April , which marks the anniversary of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ' ( ANZAC ) first landing on the Gallipoli peninsula in 1915 .
While it is a day for both countries , the remembrance of Anzac day , as well as the traditions associated with it , were Australian led .
On the 25th of April 1923 at Albany in Western Australia , the Reverend White led a party of friends in what was the first ever observance of an ANZAC Day dawn service .
It was n't until 1927 that the first official service was held at the Sydney Cenotaph .
After being embraced Australia wide , the tradition spread to New Zealand .
New Zealanders sometimes feel that Australia has hijacked the Anzac legend , and ignored the achievements of fallen New Zealand soldiers .

( 4 ) Statement issued by The Council of the International Rugby Board
It all started as a way to prove solidarity with Barack Obama and take a stand against people who associated the presidential candidate with terrorists because of his middle name , Hussein .
Hundreds of supporters on Facebook added " Hussein " as their middle name on the site and joined groups such as " Take The Middle Name ' Hussein ' for Barack Obama . "
There were thousands of them .
There was Marc Hussein Andreessen .
Clay Hussein Shirky .
Kate Hussein Wetherhead .
Peter Hussein Honeyman .
James Hussein Shaw .
Patricia Hussein Washburn .
But Facebook , like other communities , hosts people of many different political persuasions .
They also had something to say about Hussein as a middle name .
So they started their own Facebook groups .
Now , there are more than 100 groups on the social networking site concerning the issue of adopting Hussein as a middle name .
They include the likes of ( you may need to be a Facebook member to view them ) :
Support Obama – Add Hussein as your middle name to protest misconceptions
Anyone with the middle name " Hussein " should not be president of the U.S .
Saying Barack 's middle name is " Hussein " does n't make you a racist
Enough already with the " I changed my middle name to ' Hussein ' on Facebook "
The groups and the discussion among them have made some participants marvel at the way Facebook allows them to engage in political discourse with people they did n’t previously know .
Still others make fun of them for talking politics on a social network that also houses pictures of people drinking beer .
Alex Freeman , a music professor at Carleton College , started his 5,134 - member group , I 'm changing my Facebook name to Hussein , a few weeks ago .
" In a small way , I thought I could defuse the bigotry , or at least the fear , " he said .
Supporters he did n’t know posted compliments on the group 's homepage , including one whose actual middle name was Hussain .
Dissidents also posted , telling him his idea was stupid .
While Freeman was sleeping , one Turkish group posted dozens of pictures of genocide on the site as sabotage .
Still , Freeman thought the group was effective .
" One guy wrote and said , ' This is retarded , you ’re not doing anything , ' " Freeman said .
" I explained it to him , and he said he saw my point and joined . "
Same with Casey Godwin , a 16 - year old from Dunn , N.C. , who started the group His Middle Name is Hussein , for Pete 's Sake , which featured a photo saying " Beware Obama and bin Laden . "
Godwin , an Obama supporter , says she started the group ...

This talk was delivered at the Mises Institute ’s Supporters Summit , November 1 , 2008 , Auburn , Alabama .
I originally conceived of this talk — a case for abolishing the central bank — as an applied update to my 1995 lecture at the Heritage Foundation on “ Why Austrian Economics Matters . ”
That ’s because so many of the policy ideas suggested within the Austrian framework can be subsumed under the need to abolish the central bank .
The Austrian school has been battling the central bank since 1913 and before .
Right now , the writings of our tradition are more prominent than ever before , thanks to our great predecessors , our faculty , our students , our donors , our publishing programs , our electronic media , and the desperate search on the part of people all over the world for an explanation of the current crisis , and a new way out .
Never have the ideas of the Austrian tradition reached such heights as in recent weeks .
I ’m pleased to report that the Mises Institute , after 26 years of preparation , was ready in every way .
We have economists , historians , philosophers , and many others working at the university level all over the country and the world who have been trained in our programs , such as the Mises University , the Rothbard Graduate Seminar , and the Summer Graduate Fellowships .
They were ready to provide answers in a classroom setting and for the media .
The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics and the Journal of Libertarian Studies have helped build the foundation , as have our Austrian Scholars Conference .
Books such as Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression and The Panic of 1819 , Hayek ’s Prices and Production , and Mises ’s Causes of the Economic Crisis , among 300 other titles , have been flying out of our warehouse .
We ’ve issued new books on this topic , including de Soto ’s Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles .
Hlsmann ’s Ethics of Money Production could n’t have come out at a better time .
Nor could our new edition of Rothbard ’s Mystery of Banking .
Our online bookstore has been the world ’s source for information for scholars and citizens , just as our website as been the source for news , data , and analysis , with thousands of hours of video and audio that address the topic at hand .
Our offices have stayed constantly busy .
I would say that we have all been taxed as never before , but I think we should reserve that word for involuntary labor , not work we glory in .
And the world press has taken notice as never before .
Today ’s events are similar to the crash of 1929 , but there is a difference this time : the ideas of our tradition are in circulation .
The Mises Institute has been consistently pushing this message since our founding in 1982 .
Our first conference in 1983 was on the gold standard .
A book on the topic soon followed .
It has not been a fashionable subject , and we endured many years of criticism and even attacks because we kept focusing on the dangers of the Fed and fiat money .
Even as far back as the late 1980s , we have been editorializing against the federal priority of giving all living things a home to own .
There is an economic and moral difference between legitimate ownership that comes from deferred consumption , and premature ownership that is subsidized by the monetary system .
I report on this not so that we can say “ We told you so , ” but rather to underscore the need to stick to principle , depart from the crowd , avoid the fashion , and adhere to the truth no matter what .
This is what Mises taught us , and if he had done nothing more than be his era ’s most tough - minded resister to collectivism of all types , it would be enough to earn him an institute founded in his name .
In some ways , it ’s tragic that it takes a crisis on this scale to cause this level of focus on our work .
We all wish that that the drive for truth alone would turn attention to what we do .
But the scarcity of time dictates that people tend to learn on a need - to - know basis .
For that reason , Google trends records a massive increase in searches for Austrian economics , with the leading city for most such searches being Washington , DC , but extending to all areas of the world .
The Google news archives on searches for Mises show more mentions this year than any year since records have been kept .
Of course , the Austrian school has so much more to offer than a theory of the boom - bust cycle .
It has value theory , property theory , price theory , a compelling logic for understanding the entire microeconomic foundation of the science , a methodological case to make for deductive theory , production and capital theory , a case for the origin and function of interest , as well as contributions to trade theory , industrial organization and antitrust , a vast historiography that turns the mainstream on its head , a huge and innovative critique of war and of interventionist and socialistic states — as well as a passion for liberty as the foundation of social development .
As I said in the earlier speech on why Austrian economic matters , we are not merely talking about a school that has contributed one or two ideas , but an entirely different way of thinking about the meaning and applications of economics and a wholly different conception of the social order .
Had progress in economic thought not been interrupted by Keynesian theory and the rise of positivism in the social sciences , we would not even be speaking of the Austrian school .
Misesian theory would be economics proper .
For this reason , we can hope that if people get interested in the Austrian theory of the business cycle , this will eventually turn to deeper study and intellectual transformation .
What starts as a narrow interest changes to a broad interest .
We know that this happens often , and it is the stuff of which intellectual revolutions are made .
For now , what interests people is the Austrian account of the bust .
And the Austrian account is the only compelling one in circulation .
In fact , as compared with the past , parts of the Misesian - Rothbardian view of the cycle have fully entered the mainstream , with just about everyone agreeing that the current bust originated in a bubble fueled by easy money .
That is a message that our forbearers never entirely made stick .
In the 1930s , they struggled for a hearing in ways that we do not .
I ’m almost in a shock to say it , but these days , the idea that the Fed should be abolished is no longer greeted with catcalls .
No longer is the Fed seen as the savior of mankind .
Indeed , we can sum up the case for abolishing the central bank rather quickly .
Abolishing the Fed would put a huge brake on the planning state .
Without the ability to expand the money supply at will , the federal government would become about as threatening as state or local government .
That is to say , the federal government would still be an intolerable imposition on life , liberty , and property .
But we would n’t be worrying about hyperinflation , large scale bubbles in specific sectors , crazy business cycles , trillion - dollar bailouts , controls that reach into every nook and cranny of our lives , a cradle to grave welfare state , or a global empire that invades any and every country at will , and makes America the enemy to whole regions of the world .
That ’s only the beginning of what the end of the Fed would mean .
It would dramatically change the political culture in this country .
Bureaucracies would tumble .
Trade would stabilize .
The investment - risk calculus would accord with the free market .
The left could no longer live out its pipe dreams of socialist utopia at our expense .
The right would have to give up its wacky notion of a world police state .
The power ambitions of whole sectors of society would be scaled back .
The state is always and everywhere a danger , even when it has no monopoly on money and no printing press that can create money tickets at will .
But a state with the ability to make its own money is a grave and relentless threat to prosperity and freedom .
It leaves the future entirely to the discretion of the money managers .
Every day we live under the threat that the US could be the next Weimar Republic or even another Zimbabwe .
All that stands between us and that day is the wisdom and prudence of the Fed .
And we ’ve seen in recent days just how much those character traits matter when the crisis hits .
We ’ve learned that nothing counts to these people but the short - term well - being of themselves and their friends .
They will gladly give up our future for their immediate satisfaction .
We ’ve learned that Congress — with the sole and heroic exception of Ron Paul — is no help .
It too was bought off by newly printed money — just as if the local counterfeiter agreed to cut the city council in on the deal .
Many of us have wondered whether or not the government and its central bank were capable of repeating such historic calamities as wage and price controls or total monetary destruction .
But now we see that there are no institutionalized limits to the level of depredations they are willing to commit .
But what is lacking today as versus the past is a theoretical rationale .
Time was when the inflationists could rely on the promises of Keynesianism to turn stones into bread .
Few today believe that is possible .
You can detect the absence of sound theory in the terms used to debate the policy response .
On the one hand , everyone seems to agree that reckless lending is the source of the problem .
On the other hand , they are proposing more reckless lending as the solution to the problem .
It is as Hayek said : proposing to cure a poisoning with more poison .
Does anyone really believe that bailing out the system is the answer ?
Perhaps a few weeks ago , there were still some policymakers who believed that .
But when the billions and trillions have failed to do anything but prop up zombie companies , it becomes clear that these bailouts will not have and cannot have any positive macroeconomic effects .
Governments can pretend to be effective in a host of ways .
They can ban products for " our own good . "
They can march around overseas and claim to be killing bad guys .
They can say they are protecting you from poverty at both ends of life .
But one thing that government cannot do , and very obviously cannot do , is stop prices that want to fall from falling , all else remaining equal .
A government that wages war on the price system is a government itching to lose a fight .
Stabilization policy is a war on human volition .
Think of the recent efforts to inflate the money supply .
The Fed is building up reserves as never before .
They are making these available to banks at unprecedented levels .
Meanwhile , the banks are playing it safe and waiting to see what is and is not profitable .
This is roughly what happened in 1930 as well .
The central bank tried to inflate through the credit markets , but ultimately it bumped up against the unwillingness of people to undertake the risk .
So it is today .
The critical mechanism that makes it possible for the Fed to do what it wants to do is missing .
Short of actually putting everyone in a FEMA camp and forcing them to borrow , lend , and spend , there is very little that the Fed can do to overcome this problem .
When you speak to people about this issue , it is best to use a simple analogy .
Choose any good you can think of .
Let ’s say it is the price of milk that takes a sudden tumble and milk producers do n’t like this state of affairs .
Government swears that it will raise the price of milk and does so by fiat .
Milk is declared to cost $ 6 per gallon .
What will happen ?
It will sit on the shelves as consumers move to substitutes .
Then the stores themselves will have surpluses and might even demand compensation .
They certainly wo n’t buy anymore from producers .
Then the producers will complain .
At this point government can bail out the producers , or buy the milk themselves .
Perhaps they will ultimately require everyone to buy milk and drink it .
But ultimately , short of turning all citizens into tin soldiers , there is nothing that government can do to change the underlying reality .
A war on prices is a war on human choice and , ultimately , a war on unchangeable aspects of reality .
To confront this truth is to come face - to - face with economic law .
Economic law is something that surrounds us constantly as a fact of life and a driving force of the material world .
To deny economic law is akin to denying gravity or the change of seasons .
But its principles remain abstract enough to require careful thought in order to discern them and comprehend their meaning .
Bad times are good times for introducing economic ideas to people who otherwise would be content to be blissfully unaware .
More absurdly , the ignorant and the propagandists will continue to claim that the economic meltdown is a result of laissez - faire or too little regulation or a lack of much - needed nationalization and socialization .
A small introduction to the reality of economic law can change everything .
But let us return now to the realities of the present situation .
There is indeed a risk of further meltdown , depending on how far government is willing to go in its war on reality .
On the other hand , there are ways to prevent calamity .
We will soon hear reports of much higher unemployment .
There is an urgent need to cut employment taxes , to end the minimum wage , to reduce mandates on business , to repeal union privileges , to cut FICA , to scrap employment discrimination law — to restore a free market in labor .
There is also a chance for dramatic monetary reform .
A gold - coin standard would be ideal .
Absent that solution , a repeal on the restrictions on private money production and banking would be a huge and important step .
We still have time to disable the power of central banking , ruining it before it ruins us .
And here we get to the positive theory of money and banking from an Austrian perspective .
You understand nearly all of it if you absorb the following insight .
Money is a commodity like any other commodity .
It should be produced and managed under competitive market conditions , the same as shoes , eggs , or computers .
Banking too is a market service that should be managed by the market order , with no government involvement , and so subjected to the discipline of market forces , including the restrictions against fraud .
Establishing a market system of money and banking requires nothing other than having the government step entirely away .
This might seem unlikely , but so did the unraveling of the Soviet Union in 1989 .
Socialist ideology was bankrupt in the same way that Russia was bankrupt .
So it is in our time .
Major players in the banking system are bankrupt in the same way that stabilization policy is intellectually bankrupt .
We cannot rule out the impact of intellectual bankruptcy on real economic history .
There is a certain poetic justice that alarm at the central bank would be the driving force behind the new interest in the Austrian school .
Austrian economics was born with Carl Menger ’s reflections and innovations on the nature and function of money .
It matured under Mises ’s own contributions and warnings about the dangers of central banking .
Hayek joined Mises in the 1920s and 1930s to focus on the business cycle and the dangers of using the money and banking system as a stabilization tool .
This led to further reflections on macroeconomic principles .
Mises and Hayek lived in a world that had fallen for Keynesianism , so their advice was rejected on grounds that it was outmoded .
Today , that belief is gone and people are looking for new answers .
It is time that the world return to the one school of economic thought that predicted this current crisis , explains its origins and source , and offers the only plausible way out .
It does n’t matter that some of their writings date back more than 100 years , or , in the case of our predecessors , even up to 800 years .
Economic science teaches timeless truths .
Sound money is an immutable need always and everywhere .
I ’m pleased to say that I ’m under no burden today to explain to you why Austrian economics matters .
We know that it does .
We know that it is the one theoretical apparatus that fully accounts for the seeming chaos that surrounds us today .
But the Austrian school does more than merely explain why we find ourselves in the worst monetary meltdown in generations .
It shows the way out , providing an achievable vision of Mises ’s free and prosperous commonwealth .
I am also pleased to tell you that , just as for the last 26 years , you can always count on the Mises Institute to show the way .

Journalist ’s tell - all on mobster tied to JFK might have gotten her killed by Susan Edelman
More than a month after its landing in the Martian arctic , Nasa 's Phoenix probe has discovered that asparagus , green beans and turnips should grow nicely in the Martian soil under the right conditions , but that strawberries might not .
The findings come via a so - called wet - chemistry laboratory , part of Phoenix 's Meca ( Microscopy , Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer ) instrument .
This added water carried from Earth to some soil scooped from just beneath the surface .
Tests show the resulting mud to have a slightly alkaline pH level of between 8 and 9 , comparable to sea water and favouring asparagus and the like ( but , sadly for Martian tennis fans , not strawberries ) .
The soil also contains several life - supporting nutrients including sodium , potassium , magnesium and chloride .
Nitrogen , carbon and oxygen are absent , as are a few other trace minerals that any aspiring Martian horticulturist would need to supply .
It is reassuring that nothing toxic has been found , and nothing that rules out the possibility of alien microbes surviving , if not thriving , deeper down where they would be shielded from harmful ultraviolet radiation .
Of still greater importance for future travellers is Phoenix 's confirmation that water exists all around in the form of sub - surface ice .
White chunks exposed by the craft 's robotic arm , sublimate and vanish over a few days - too slowly to be frozen carbon dioxide , dry ice , which was probably the leading alternative .

Amazon deforestation and fires are being aggravated by US farm subsidies , claims STRIâ€™s staff scientist William Laurance .
According to Laurance , whose findings are reported this week in Science ( December 14 ) , a recent spike in Amazonian fires is being promoted by massive US subsidies that promote American corn production for ethanol .
The ethanol is being blended with gasoline as an automobile fuel .
" American taxpayers are spending $ 11 billion a year to subsidize corn producersâ€ ” and this is having some surprising global consequences , " said Laurance .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The US is the world 's leading producer of soy , but many American soy farmers are shifting to corn to qualify for the government subsidies .
Since 2006 , US corn production rose 19 % while soy farming fell by 15 % .
The drop - off in US soy has helped to drive a major increase in global soy prices , which have nearly doubled in the last 14 months .
In Brazil , the world 's second - largest soy producer , high soy prices are having a serious impact on the Amazon rainforest and tropical savannas .
" Amazon fires and forest destruction have spiked over the last several months , especially in the main soy- producing states in Brazil , " said Laurance .
" Just about everyone there attributes this to rising soy and beef prices . "
High soy prices affect the Amazon in several ways .
Some forests are cleared for soy farms .
Farmers also buy and convert many cattle ranches into soy farms , effectively pushing the ranchers further into the Amazonian frontier .
Finally , wealthy soy farmers are lobbying for major new Amazon highways to transport their soybeans to market , and this is increasing access to forests for loggers and land speculators .
Laurance emphasized that he was not the first person to suggest that US corn subsidies could indirectly harm the Amazon .
" But now we 're seeing that these predictions - first made last summer - are being borne out .
The evidence of a corn connection to the Amazon is circumstantial , but it 's about as close as you ever get to a smoking gun . "
Rather than being hapless eccentrics , the majority of stalkers suffer from serious psychotic illnesses , finds a study of people who stalk members of the British royal family .
The findings , which have been know for nearly two years , but were first made public at a forensic science meeting on Tuesday in Melbourne , Australia , have been instrumental in developing a new approach to reducing risks of attack on the royal family , and UK and European politicians .
The approach is to direct “ VIP ” or star stalkers into psychiatric care .
“ We did n’t expect such high rates of psychosis .
It was very surprising to us , ” says Paul Mullen , a forensic psychiatrist at Monash University and the Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health .
Mullen led the study , which was sponsored by the UK Home Office , with David James , a consultant forensic psychiatrist at the North London Forensic Service .
Advertisement
Mullen and his colleagues scrutinised over 20,000 incidences of stalking members of the royal family , such as repeated and threatening letter writing , and repeated attempted approaches and attacks , from 1988 to 2003 .
The data was contained in files on 8000 people kept by the Metropolitan Police .
“ Just under half were people writing letters repeatedly that were usually threatening or inappropriately amorous , ” says Mullen .
Over the 15 - year period , 600 people managed to get close to a member of the royal family , and there were 17 attacks on staff , protection service personal or property , he says .
Drunks and pranksters
Around 3000 of the files covered incidences that were judged to be pranks , or committed by people accidentally or while they were drunk .
The Mullen team examined in detail the files of 250 of the remaining 5000 people judged to be true stalkers .
About 80 % had a serious psychotic illness , including schizophrenia , delusions and hallucinations , they found .
The finding contrasts sharply with people who stalk non-famous people .
“ Typically a fifth of stalkers have some sort of serious or severe psychotic disorder , ” says forensic psychologist Rosemary Purcell of the University of Melbourne , who has co-published a book about stalkers with Mullen .
The largest group of non-VIP stalkers are rejected lovers , who may be depressed and socially inept , but do n’t usually suffer psychosis .
VIP stalkers , on the other hand , appear most like a subset of stalkers called “ intimacy seekers ” , says Mullen .
These people strive to initiate a relationship with their victims , and frequently suffer a psychotic disorder .
“ Some [ intimacy seekers ] have erotomania , a full - blown delusional disorder , where they believe that the victim is in love with them , ” says Purcell .
Therapy works
In a separate study published earlier this year , James , Mullen and their colleagues found that psychotic illness is also common among people who attack members of the royal family .
The team ’s findings were vital in the development of a new strategy to combat VIP stalking .
As a result , the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre , a joint police and mental - health unit , was quietly set up in London by the Home Office , Metropolitan Police , and the Department of Health , two years ago on a pilot basis .
James is the centre ’s clinical director .
Previously , stalkers of British royalty or senior politicians were removed from the scene if they were causing a nuisance , but were not offered treatment .
Now FTAC psychiatrists assess the stalkers , referring them on to mental health services if they are in need of treatment .
That strategy pays off , according to James .
“ After two years , our experience is that most people do not engage in stalking again – in the past it was characteristic that the behaviour was repeated , ” he says .
Terrorist risk
Reducing VIP stalking is important for protecting individuals and for counterterrorism , says James .
Few stalkers go on to launch attacks , but stalkers are responsible for roughly half of attacks against VIPs , including the most serious attacks .
Mullen , James and their colleagues are currently investigating ways to identify which stalkers are likely to pose a threat .
“ [ Stalkers ] who are fixated on a cause , and have a highly personalised quest for ‘ justice ’ , often delusional in nature , are the ones most likely to breach security , and to be carrying weapons , ” says James .
Mullen says that star stalkers are an unusual group , with their characteristics determined to some extent by the nature of the prominent person .
“ People who stalk royalty may show a strange mixture of affection , and the belief that they are a relative or friend or even the rightful heir .
People who stalk the president of the United States are more likely to have persecutory ideas . ”

" Is Barack Obama Black or Biracial ? " a recent CNN.com headline asks .
The question of whether Obama should be considered black or multiracial has been a concern of the media throughout the campaign .
Should such racial characterizations of people like Obama -- who have one black parent and one white parent -- really matter ?
According to a new Northwestern University study , they do matter .
The findings suggest that the immediate response of non-black study participants is to categorize a racially ambiguous person as black when it was known that one of the person 's parents was black and one was white .
In other words , when study participants knew of the person 's black - white ancestry , in comparison to not knowing of the parentage , they quickly adhered to the simplistic characterization of biracial people as black , said Northwestern 's Destiny Peery .
Social psychological research demonstrates a relationship between social categorizations and subsequent behavior .
" It is possible that once multiracial individuals are categorized as black , for example , they may subsequently encounter stereotyping and prejudice consistent with this categorization , " she said .
Peery , a graduate student in psychology and Galen V. Bodenhausen , professor of psychology and marketing at Northwestern , are co-investigators of " Black +
White = Black : Hypodescent in Reflexive Categorization of Racially Ambiguous Faces . "
The article appeared in the October issue of the journal Psychological Science .
To address how black - white biracial people are commonly categorized , non - black study participants were asked to view a series of profiles of college students , with photos that depicted each one as black , white or racially ambiguous .
Some of the racially ambiguous photos were accompanied with profiles indicating that one of the student 's parents is black and the other is white .
Later when participants completed spontaneous or immediate racial categorization tasks , they were more likely to consider the racially ambiguous faces to be black when the person was known to have mixed - race ancestry , compared to not having that knowledge .
Upon more thoughtful reflection , however , study participants were more likely to categorize the same ambiguous faces with the known mixed - race parentage as " multiracial . "
" Ironically , when judgments about the ambiguous faces were based on the first , immediate reaction , the explicit information about biracial ancestry increased black categorizations , whereas when the judgments were more deliberate , this same information increased multiracial categorizations , " Peery said .
The study highlights the legacy of hypodescent in racial categorization in the U.S.
According to hypodescent , a child of mixed - race ancestry is assigned to the race of what society considers the socially subordinate parent .
Historically , mixed - race children in slave societies were most commonly assigned to the race of their non-Caucasian parent .
In the most extreme manifestation of hypodescent in the United States , the one - drop rule holds that if a person has one drop of black blood , he or she is considered to be black .
" Progress in recognizing complex racial identities has been slow in coming , " Peery noted .
It was not until 2000 that people were allowed to identify with more than one race on U.S. Census forms .
Given the increased attention to multiracial people today and efforts to allow them to identify with all parts of their racial identity , many believe that hypodescent is an outdated rule in racial categorization .
" The question of how ordinary people categorize multiracial people remains a complicated and timely question , " said Peery .
" Our study suggests that knowledge of mixed - race ancestry may still serve , at a reflexive or automatic level , to highlight only one aspect of a multiracial person 's identity -- the minority aspect . "
Right or wrong , the automatic relegating of multiracial people to one racial category is very much a part of American history , Peery said .
" The good news , " she says , " is that we can look to the increased awareness of a multiracial population in the U.S. as a sign of possible changes to come in racial categorization . "

Queers are calling for a boycott of the California Musical Theatre -- at least according to the -- after discovering that its artistic director , Scott Eckern , donated $ 1,000 to Prop .
8 . Eckern has been with CMT for over 25 years .
Richard Lewis , the organization 's executive producer , released this statement regarding the controversy : " Any political action or the opinion of Scott Eckern is not shared by California Musical Theatre .
We have a long history of appreciation for the LGBT community and are truly grateful for their longstanding support . "
The California Musical Theatre , Sacramento's oldest theate group , recently produced a production of " Forever Plaid " .
If do n't plan on boycotting the theater because of Eckern 's discrimination donation against people in his own office , then do so because " Forever Plaid " is just an awful musical .
Update : Eckern has resigned .
UPDATE : It 's now posted in the first comment .
Starbucks employees say in the open thread below that a laptop with 97,000 employees ' social security numbers , names and addresses was stolen , and that a message about this theft was sent to the partners .
Somebody please post THE FULL TEXT OF THE MESSAGE in the comments below to verify this .
When Walter Andre Sharpe Jr. signed for a certified letter from Dauphin County Domestic Relations in 2001 , he did n't know he was signing on for a seven - year nightmare .
Since then , the Philadelphia man has been thrown in jail four times , lost his job , become estranged from his four children and spent more than $ 12,000 to support the child of another man .
It finally stopped in May 2007 when a judge reversed a finding that he was the father .
But the same judge has since ruled that Sharpe is not entitled to any compensation , not even the money he was forced to pay to support the child .
Sharpe 's attorney , Tabetha Tanner , said the county Domestic Relations office " stole " Sharpe 's identity by exchanging his date of birth , address and Social Security number for that of the father .
The agency fought Sharpe 's attempts to have DNA testing and said it determined he was the father " after reasonable investigation . "
Yet it took The Patriot - News less than an hour to track down the real father , Andre Sharpe , who said the girl that Walter Sharpe has been paying support for has been living with him for the last four years .
But in court papers , Domestic Relations blamed Walter Sharpe , a former trash collector , for not filing the proper motions in court to " disestablish paternity . "
" What type of investigation were they doing if you can track this guy down in less than eight hours ? "
Walter Sharpe asked .
" It just pisses me off .
I tried my best to clear myself of this case , and it fell on deaf ears .
It 's like I 'm guilty until proven innocent .
I 'm just another man crying , ' I do n't know this person .
I do n't have their kid . '
It 's a routine they 're just used to . "

Hello there !
Mike C. :
Hey there , Bruce .
This is Mike from ICONS OF FRIGHT.com and also on the line is Robg. , my partner on this fine on - line publication .
Robg . :
That ’s me right here , Bruce .
How are you ?
Good , how are you ?
Robg . : Good !
Well , first and foremost , thanks so much for taking out the time to talk with us .
We ’re obviously big fans …
Well , ya gotta get the word out , ya know ?
Robg. : ( Laughs ) Yeah .
Funny thing , we know you live in Oregon and we ’re friendly with one of your neighbors , the lovely Adrienne King !
Oh yeah !
Robg . :
Whom I believe has already seen MY NAME IS BRUCE ?
Yeah , she saw it at a little sneak preview we did in town .
She ’s just up the road , as we say .
Robg . :
Yes , yes , and she spoke very highly of you when we found out you two were neighbors .
Well , she is an actress .
( Laughs )
Robg . :
Let ’s talk about the beginnings of MY NAME IS BRUCE .
You had written the book MAKE LOVE THE BRUCE CAMPBELL WAY , and now you ’ve got the film MY NAME IS BRUCE , both of which have a sort of satirical look at yourself .
For the movie , was this an idea that was brought to you ?
Was it something you came up with ?
Or maybe a bit of both ?
Mark Verheiden , who wrote it , pitched it to me with his partner and friend Mike Richardson who ’s with Dark Horse Comics .
And those guys are old pals from the old days .
Kind of like me and Sam Raimi in the Detroit area , those guys were old pals back in Portland .
And so , I ’d worked with Mark a couple of times through comics .
Mark Verheiden wrote the EVIL DEAD comic that Dark Horse produced , so there were a lot of tie-ins for us .
And we liked each other .
So they pitched this idea , where Mark explains it ’s kind of based on this old comic book from the 40’s where Alan Ladd , the movie star Alan Ladd was kidnapped to fight pirates .
Because they thought he was a swashbuckler and he could take care of this .
So , he thought it ’d be fun to do the same type of deal , only upgrade it to a B - movie actor who ’s known for fighting monsters or whatever , and have him kidnapped to fight a real monster in a small town .
Of course , it turns out to be a terrible idea .
( Laughs )
Because the Bruce Campbell in the movie is a jerk , moron , idiot and he ca n’t do anything .
It ’s a big learning curve of how a movie hero learns to be a real hero .
Or attempts to anyways .
Robg. :
Was it a given that you would direct this project ?
Because I figure acting in it , directing it would be a lot of hats to wear .
My producer knows the lower the budget , the more I want to do .
If I ’m going to make a low , low budget movie , then I really want to have control over it , and not have all these assholes involved .
I do n’t want a lot of “ chefs ” involved .
So basically , it was me and Mike Richardson who were the only guys to make any decisions on the whole thing .
And that was great .
It was really nice to be able to have one partner , and we just hashed stuff out , and the movie is what it is .
Not the product of a committee .
Robg . :
I ’ve seen you at dozens of conventions , Q & A’s , book signings , etc. over the years , and I know that you often have funny encounters with fans at these events .
Did you cull any real life convention experiences and inject them into MY NAME IS BRUCE ?
How much were you able to put in with writer Mark Verheiden ?
There ’s one sequence in the film where everything I got was almost verbatim from fans .
Every word out of their mouth is almost things that I ’ve heard verbatim .
And my responses in the movie are more like how I would want to respond .
( Laughs )
But in real life , you have a little bit more tact or you ’re going to be filling up blogs the next day .
Ya know ?
“ Bruce Campbell is an asshole ! ”
So , this movie was my protection shield .
I can hide behind the character .
The Bruce Campbell in this movie is the actor I would ’ve become if I had stayed in LA for 10 more years .
Robg. : Wow .
And that ’s not the first time I ’ve heard something like that .
Yeah .
I bailed to Oregon and it saved my life .
So this is more of a satirical look of what could have been .
Mike C. :
So what are some of the differences between Bruce Campbell the actor , and Bruce Campbell the character in this movie ?
The real Bruce Campbell does not drink whisky .
Uh , I do not feed my dog whisky .
I do not live in a broken ramshackled trailer in the dessert and leave my dog for months at a time alone .
Um , what else ?
( Laughs )
Just about every other non-comparison you can make .
…
But , it ’s because I ’m serving the story .
Obviously .
The story is , even if you remove me , my name from the equation , it ’s still a story of a guy known for playing XY & Z , but in real life is not anywhere near it .
It ’s the story of how he attempts to potentially redeem himself .
Robg . :
You joke in the trailer about having shot a movie in Bulgaria , a few actually , but this one you got to shoot in your home state of Oregon .
I shot some of it on my property .
Robg . :
What were some of the biggest differences for you in directing this film as opposed to THE MAN WITH THE SCREAMING BRAIN ?
Home field advantage ?
Home field advantage is everything , because everything is normal .
I know where everything is .
I know where the hardware stores are , I know who I can get to play all these different parts and because it ’s not Bulgaria , I can bring them up to my property and use ‘em and shoot ‘ em .
I can capitalize on all the local things that are available .
Anywhere from cheap building products to open land to build a town on .
I could create it exactly how I wanted it .
It was having that control .
Whereas in Bulgaria , anything can change at any day .
You could get kicked out of a location at any time .
Because of greed or corruption .
It ’s a weird society there .
The people are great , but they ’re in horrible transitional period in their lives .
They break in capitalism , but the roads are n’t fixed and shit ’s all bombed out and there ’s packs of wild dogs .
It ’s just kind of a crazy , a little - bit lawless place .
It ’s a great place .
I ’d go there to hang out , maybe .
But I do n’t know that I ’d make another movie there .
Because , I need stability !
When you make a movie , you need control over stuff .
We wound up getting control in Bulgaria – we wound up taking over an old Soviet military compound , and clearing trees away that had grown up since communism fell , but we made it into a studio , a backlot .
So that Bulgaria itself could n’t invade .
So in Oregon , I just wanted to have as much control as possible .
It was great .
It was a huge difference .
Everybody spoke English .
Robg . : In… Bulgaria ?
No , in Oregon .
Well , at least most people .
Robg . :
I read that your DP on this was Kurt Rauf , who worked as a PA on the original EVIL DEAD !
So you ’ve known him since way , way back …
A long time .
A lot of the people in the movie are people that I ’ve known for a long time , or people that I ’ve acted with for a long time .
And they ’re either people that I ’ve never acted with , or people that are old cronies .
( Laughs )
So it was fun .
We really cast a lot of locals .
The lead actress Grace Thorsen ( Kelly Graham ) is from Medford , Oregon and the lead kid is local .
They ’re all right there , they ’re all locals .
So it ’s fun .
We ’re going to have a hometown premiere in December .
( 2008 )
Robg . :
What I think is really cool – and you did this with MAN WITH THE SCREAMING BRAIN , is that you ’re doing a tour with the film .
Rather then it opening everywhere at once , you ’re going from town to town to show it .
How ’s the touring experience for you ?
Getting that immediate reaction ?
Yeah , it ’s just a good old fashioned tour .
You know , whenever a band has a CD to sell , they have to tour .
And as guy who wrote a couple of books , guess what ?
You want to sell books , you better tour !
And so , that ’s really the long and short of it , you gotta tour .
But also , I enjoy it .
I love car trips .
We ’re doing it all by car .
It ’s just a great way to get out there .
‘ Cause look , I ’ve been in Miami during the dead of summer for the last 6 months .
I ’m ready to see a mountain .
( Laughs )
Maybe I ’ll change my tune going over the Rockies , but … I do like it .
I like seeing these towns again .
And frankly , it lets you know if anyone ’s out there paying attention .
Robg . :
Are you surprised by the ever - growing fan - base for you ?
Obviously a lot of people know you from your genre work , but every time I see you at something like a book signing , I ’m surprised by the variety of fans .
It ’s either young kids , or older fans .
What ’s that like for you ?
Well , it ’s nice .
I ’ve actually been around long enough that I get the 2nd generation now .
I ’ve had a lot of father ’s come up and go , “ Hey , I want you to meet my son Ash .
He ’s now a big fan of the EVIL DEAD movies . ”
And so they ’ve passed it along , so now it ’s a generational thing .
But also , weird stuff happens now …
We just got picked up for a 3rd season of BURN NOTICE on USA , and so , I ’m finally getting , “ Hey , are n’t you the BURN NOTICE guy ? ”
And I ’m like “ Oh , OK ! ” Robg . : I ’d seen EVIL DEAD : THE MUSICAL here in New York and I know you came out for the first couple of shows .
I love the show .
I was always hesitant of the idea of anyone other then you portraying the character of Ash , but that actor Ryan Ward is fantastic as Ash !
He ’s a really , really good actor …
He ’s terrific , and that kid has worked harder then I ever did on the original movies !
( Laughs )
Because he ’s got to go through the whole experience every freakin’ night .
And sometimes even matinees !?
Robg. :
For years now !
He ’s got the thousand yard stare , because he ’s got the hardest gig in show business !
I agree though , he ’s done a really , really good job and he ’s a sweet kid , and I hope he goes far .
Now the gag is in his life .
People will go up to him and be like , “ Oh , you played Ash ! ” ( Laughs ) Robg. : ( Laughs )
Well , the thing that I realized seeing him portray that character is that we ’re at the point where Ash goes beyond Bruce Campbell .
He ’s a horror pop culture icon .
The Van Helsing of the 21st Century .
I mean , girls dress as Ash at horror conventions now !
( Laughs )
Robg . :
Obviously , you could n’t have possibly imagined that would happen when you made the first film , so how do you feel about the fact that this character you created has spawned a life of its own ?
It feels good !
Because as an artist or an actor or a filmmaker , you never want to bomb .
We were blessed that the very first thing that I ever did really caught on .
Overseas first !
It was n’t really huge here .
It took a while to grow .
Ultimately it led to a 2nd one and then a 3rd one .
We really never had – You can never really have any idea .
But what our goal was , we wanted to get our investors their money back .
Part of doing EVIL DEAD 2 was to get some claim .
EVIL DEAD 2 finally broke them even and got them into a little bit of profit after 6 - 7 years .
Now , they ’ve made a bagful of dough , so now we ’re fine .
But we were just …
Here ’s what it was .
We wanted to be able to go into out local multiplex where we had seen THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and actually be able to see our own movie there .
And that was great .
We did that !
We got some popcorn and just sat in there .
It was like a Saturday matinee .
There were n’t that many people there and we just watched the movie , only it was our movie .
That was the biggest deal for us .
I felt like we succeeded right there .
It was like the ROCKY thing .
We just wanted to go the distance .
We wanted to raise money , actually shoot a movie and actually get it into a theatre .
That was huge .
Right then and there .
So , today ’s expectations , people are trying to make a certain amount of money every weekend !
We were happy to get into a theatre .
Robg . :
I wish I could go back then and tell you that you ’d have multiple action figures based on your likeness many years later .
( Laughs ) Yeah , and there will be a new one for MY NAME IS BRUCE coming out .
Robg . : Really ?
That ’s cool !
Yeah , it ’s a full sized one , like the Ash from ARMY OF DARKNESS only it ’s from this movie .
You can either put a whisky bottle in his hand , or his dog ’s bowl , because his dog ’s name is Sam & Rob , or IF CHINS COULD KILL , the book .
He can hold the book as well .
Robg . :
Is that a Dark Horse related thing ?
Yeah , it ’ll be most likely Dark Horse , because they have a whole merchandising deal .
It ’s a very logical place to use them .
Robg . : Dark
Horse is mainly known for comic books , but they ’ve in recent years branched out into movies .
What was it like working with a company that was somewhat new when it came to making films ?
Well , Mike Richardson has actually produced a fair share of movies , so he ’s been around .
But I think he wanted to just have fun on a low - budget scale , because I do n’t think Mike likes all “ the chefs ” .
Same as me .
We just want to be our own bosses .
And so Mike was able to find a deal out there that financed our movie when basically it was only Mike and I that had any control .
To me , I do n’t care what the budget is , that ’s awesome .
That ’s what I ’m looking for is that control .
It ’s all about creative control .
And so that situation worked out really well .
Mike is a great partner , and also , very tall .
Mike ’s very tall .
Robg. : ( Laughs )
Well , let ’s talk about Ted Raimi because he plays 2 roles in this movie !
3 !
Robg . :
Oh , 3 roles !
Mike C. : Were Ted Raimi ’s roles written for him ?
Or did you cast him afterwards ?
We knew we needed these characters in the movie .
The movie was just written first .
And then I went , “ Oh yeah , Ted could play that guy .
Oh yeah , Ted could play that guy !
Oh yeah , he can play that guy . ”
We got more bang for our buck that way .
We brought him into town , that way he did n’t charge any more perdium for more roles .
( Laughs )
And Ted – Ted and I are old pals .
With Ted , we can dick around a lot .
When you ’re shooting things quickly , he gets it , he ’s from television too .
He knows the pace of things , and we like to be able to fool around with things and make shit up , so it allows us to do that .
This movie is a weird combination of old cronies of mine versus people I ’ve never worked with before that were local in Oregon .
So it was a foreign combination .
My leading lady had never been in a movie before .
She ’s a babe , by the way , so keep your eyes on her .
( Laughs )
They always find these starlets in the small towns !
Mike C. :
You mentioned television .
Was the pace accelerated on this film when you were shooting it ?
Was it like a television production , schedule - wise ?
Pretty much .
We shot it in 23 days , so we had to sort of get at it and get it done .
But fortunately because a lot of my pals have worked in TV , the hardest thing was getting all the local crew to figure that out .
Because it really is a certain pace that you have to hit .
And it ’s a maintain pace .
There ’s really no relief of “ Oh that scene is done , let ’s take a 15 minute break ! ”
There was never that .
“ Oh ok , that scene ’s done .
We ’re setting up over here .
Bring that dolly over here . ”
Not run and gun , because I feel in order to get something of value in 23 days , you ’ve got to be planned .
You have to plan out how you want to shoot it and how you ’re all going to make it work .
Mike C. :
And the local crew , were they green ?
Or were they ready to go and experienced ?
They were mixed .
Like my soundguy was an Oregon guy who was absolutely fabulous .
I ’d use him again in a second .
Just salt of the earth , right there , ready to go , pleasant demeanour and delivered good sound .
We used mostly production sound , because I ’m a big fan of using the sound on the set , if you can .
Because it ’s the original performance .
There ’s nothing like it .
And then other people , we brought some people down from Portland , and they actually copped a little bit of a big city attitude and I said , “ Wait a minute .
Let me get this right .
You ’re from Portland , right ?
I used to shoot in Los Angeles , so … what ’s your problem ? ” ( Laughs )
So , it ’s weird , we had a little bit of weirdness going on , but all in all we had a great crew , and I brought in a cameraman that I ’ve known since the EVIL DEAD days , Kurt Rauf .
So you have to fill it out with people that you must have and then try to invite some newcomers and have some fun .
Mike C. :
What about directing yourself … as yourself ?
That ’s some sort of crazy meta experience .
It has to be .
That was definitely weird .
That ’s the weirdest thing of all .
But , it becomes unweird though , because in my head , as an actor I ’m still playing a role .
I ’m playing the part of “ Bruce Campbell ” .
So , in my head it ’s actually not Bruce Campbell , because I know who that Bruce Campbell is .
So it actually was n’t that hard to play , because I ’m not playing myself .
I ’m playing “ Bruce Campbell ” - A horrible , warped , distorted version of myself .
So it was n’t really hard , because I still had to figure out how he wanted to play a scene or how he would act with his fans , and it was n’t how I would .
Its how this character would .
Mike C. :
Was there anytime you found yourself slipping into Bruce Campbell , yourself too much ?
Or was the script just so far removed from that .
It ’s pretty far removed .
There ’s not a lot where I would go , “ Wow , I just felt like myself in that scene ! ” ( Laughs ) Because , he ’s such a moron in the movie that I hope I did n’t feel like myself !
Robg. : ( Laughs )
And you also have Ellen Sandweiss , your EVIL DEAD co-star playing your ex-wife in the movie !
Exactly !
I wanted all of them .
I wanted the other 2 ladies .
And the other 2 ladies were going to play other parts , but they were concerned about union issues , because we made this non-union .
And so , they did n’t want to be tortured by that .
I tried to get them all , but I ’ll get them back in the next one .
( Laughs ) I ’m going to try to get Freddy and Jason for the next one too .
Robg . : Nice , nice .
But I think you ’d kick their asses though .
No !
But I ’d cast them as a farmer and a rancher or something .
You know what I mean ?
It would be completely not them .
Robg . : Oh , you mean Robert Englund and Kane Hodder ?
I ’d get Robert Englund , and he ’d play the guy who pumps your gas at the gas station , ya know ?
And Kane Hodder , I ’d make him a pharmacist .
( Laughs ) ( Laughs )
You know what I mean ?
Then I think we got something !
Robg . :
Well , is it too early to start talking about what you ’re doing next ?
Another film ?
Another book ?
Television ?
I know MY NAME IS BRUCE is not even out yet , but there ’s already rumblings of a sequel ?
Is it even feasible to think about that at this point ?
Here ’s a quick run down of all the EVIL DEAD stuff , because I know it keeps coming back .
Like a bad check , ya know ?
Robg . :
Just note that we did not mention EVIL DEAD 4 once !
Oh no , no , no !
I appreciate that , and I know it ’s a pre-requisite .
It ’s important because people do ask about it , so you do have to let them eventually know to what extent we even know about them .
And the bottom line is this .
Um , I think when Sam is ready to do it , we ’ll all just check our schedules .
He got involved in this massive ( SPIDER - MAN ) franchise and it seems like its still continuing .
So who knows ?
Who knows when the hell anyone will be able to get into another EVIL DEAD .
But I think we both desire to do it .
It ’s just really scheduling more then anything .
Because I ’m under contract now for 5 years for USA to do this show , and they just picked up a 3rd season .
So we ’re just all busy .
And … as far as a remake goes , there ’s nothing for me in the remake , so I would n’t really be involved other then being a producer , because … what am I ?
The old guy at the bait shop ?
“ Hey kids !
You be careful !
That place is haunted ! ”
“ Oh shut up , old man ! ” Ya know ?
And they drive off into the woods .
Robg . :
Well , we were just talking about EVIL DEAD with our buddy John Torrani last night and he would like to see a sequel with your daughter “ Ashley ” taking up your mantle , since girls now dress as Ash at the horror conventions !
It could even start with a close up shot on your face and you saying “ Give me some sugar , baby . ”
And then it pans back and you realize it ’s you in the kitchen asking your daughter to bring you some sugar …
Hey , that ’s as valid as any idea .
Valid as any .
Truth be told – I think if all of us really , really felt we had to jump on those movies immediately , they would ’ve been made .
So , it ’s a combination of timing and drive .
Robg. :
What about the EVIL DEAD : MUSICAL movie ?
The producers of that show recently announced a desire to make a movie version .
Did n’t you originally help those guys get the rights to do the musical version of EVIL DEAD ?
Yes .
Well , we did n’t discourage it .
They were pursuing to do that …
I think it ’s an issue of ...
Look , if there was already a play of it , as long as you just kind of document it and you could show that in movie theatres as a midnight thing , then it ’s its own beast .
Because it ’s already so different .
I do n’t think there will be any issues , but we ’ll see what happens .
We ’ll see what happens .
Look , when we made the first EVIL DEAD movie , it ’s now 1979 when we made it , we ’re coming up on 30 years .
We never really thought of this stuff .
So you ca n’t always plan for it .
So sometimes people go , “ Why is EVIL DEAD a musical ?
A movie ?
What ? ”
They ’re always confused .
Because everyone thinks there should be sequels and remakes .
But , I do n’t know ?
Should there always be ?
We never planned it when we did the first EVIL DEAD .
We really only did the sequel because our 2nd movie CRIMEWAVE bombed , so we were like “ Crap .
Let ’s make a sequel . ” ( Laughs ) Robg . :
And by the way , EVIL DEAD 2 is my all time favorite horror movie .
Yeah , it ’s a cool little movie .
There ’s no question about it .
But… ( Laughs ) I do n’t remember where we were going with that …
Robg . : I was asking what was next ?
If you were going back to television or another book ?
I ’m going to go back to television in March to do the 3rd season of BURN NOTICE , because we are the number 1 show on cable , baby .
Robg . : Congrats , buddy !
Congrats .
We ’re up 25 percent over last season , so we ’re growing like a weed .
So , I ’ll do that and hopefully I ’ll make another movie in the Fall of 09 .
That ’s as much as I can plan .
And I ’ll tour all this Fall .
I ’m going to 22 cities .
Robg . :
We ’re going to try to catch you in New York .
Yeah , I really want to be in New York City , Halloween at the Midnight show of MY NAME IS BRUCE .
That ’s going to be interesting .
Robg . : I saw BUBBA HO - TEP when it premiered in Chicago , which I believe was the first screening of it .
And it ’s one of those films where everything just works .
It ’s got one of your best performances , an incredible score by Brian Tyler , Ossie Davis , Don Coscarelli .
Because it ’s so rare that that happens on a movie , was that the main reason that the sequel just never came together ?
A matter of “ Well , we got it right the first time .
Why mess with it again ? ”
Obviously , Lansdale never wrote a sequel in short story form , so you would ’ve been treading new waters there had you done it …
Yeah , and that may have been the problem .
If you do n’t stick with the original pieces , it ’s hard to get something that ’s going to be like the first one .
So , here ’s the real long and short of it .
Don and I could not agree on an approach and on the story .
And the elements I disliked the most , he actually liked the most .
So we realized that was a pretty big divide .
And we did n’t want to jeopardize a friendship over this .
Because , ya know …
I do n’t want to play that game of keeping him from making it .
He can certainly make it .
It ’s his to do .
If he wants to make 10 of these , go baby , go .
But for me , I have to know why I ’m on that set , and I have to know why I ’m there .
And I have to enjoy being there .
Robg. :
Well , you nailed it with BUBBA HO - TEP , so I ’m not heartbroken that there wo n’t be a sequel , when we have a really great first movie .
Yeah , it ’s ok .
I ’m ok that there is n’t a series .
Some things happen , and that was a glitchy one that just came to a halt .
We had to just let it go .
Robg . :
My friend Kristina ( Klebe ) recently became a huge fan of your work , and I ended up lending her one of my favorite films you ’ve done which has since been long out of print – RUNNING TIME , with Josh Becker .
Mike C. : Yeah , we love that movie .
Robg . :
It ’s one of my favorites of yours !
How do you hold that film & experience in your filmography ?
Oh , I think it ’s a very groovy little movie .
I would recommend that movie to everybody .
I think it ’s a tight little thriller that ’s got a great cinematic twist to it , and it ’s more energetic .
The fact that it ’s planned as one shot is pretty bold shit for a movie that cost $ 110,000 .
Robg. :
Have you spoken to Josh Becker about putting it out again , because I believe it ’s been out of print for a while ?
Um , I have not .
I do n’t know what his deal is with Anchor Bay , but I think they still have it ?
I just got it on Amazon .
Robg . : Really ?
Ok .
(* Note : It is still available on Amazon .
The link is below ! )
It had a legitimate release through Anchor Bay and they tend to keep things alive and in visibility .
But maybe it is harder to get .
But yeah , that one I totally endorse .
Mike C. :
Do you have any particular favorite version of the EVIL DEAD DVD ?
Robg . :
Yeah , because we own every freakin’ one of them !
Mike C. :
We own every one !
Is there any one that you recommend ?
You know …
I get a little wearisome over these DVD extras .
Because now as a filmmaker I feel burdened to entertain people even more .
Like MY NAME IS BRUCE when it comes out on DVD , it ’ll be out in Blu - Ray in February and it ’s going to be gorgeous .
But because we also have a beautiful hour long making - of doc about making that damned thing , I feel pressured as a filmmaker now to do as much for the DVD extras as I do for the movie !
And so , personally ?
I prefer to just take the disc .
Pop it in .
Play the movie .
Turn it off .
I ’m that kind of guy .
I ’m not a bells and whistles kind of guy .
Because to me it ’s about the movie , it ’s not about the extras .
That ’s just me .
Robg. :
Bruce , thanks so much for your time , we really appreciate it .
Alright guys , hope to see you in New York .
Take care !
Special thanks to RJ Millard & ToddZeller !

Greenpeace said today it had decided not to harass Japanese whalers in the Antarctic this year so it can focus on clearing two activists being held for allegedly stealing whale meat it says was bound for the black market .
The group said it would plough its resources into building an anti-whaling coalition in Japan and defending Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki against the theft charges .
If convicted , they could be sent to prison for 10 years .
" Our actions have taken the plight of the whales to the top of the political agenda , " Jun Hoshikawa , Greenpeace Japan 's executive director , said in a statement .
" But if we are to bring this hunt to an end , we have to bring change in Tokyo . "
Greenpeace denied it had bowed to pressure from the Japanese authorities .
" The key country we need to influence is Japan , and we want to do that inside Japan , " Greenpeace spokesman Dave Walsh told the Guardian .
" We do have an international impact , but there 's not a lot of point in preaching to the converted .
" We have saved whales every year we 've been in the Antarctic , but we want to end whaling for good and we can't do that if all our resources and energy are focused on the Southern Ocean . "
However , the whaling fleet , which is due to leave for the Southern Ocean later this month , will not be able to carry out its cull unhampered .
Sea Shepherd , a marine conservation group that advocates direct action , has vowed to disrupt the fleet 's attempts to slaughter whales as part of Japan 's controversial scientific whaling programme .
" We intend to be more aggressive and even more relentless , " Peter Hammarstedt , a Sea Shepherd activist , said in a statement .
" We intend to make sure no whales are caught on our watch . "
Last year Japan 's whalers had planned to catch 850 minke whales but returned this spring with 551 after being frustrated by Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd activists .
Although commercial whaling was banned in 1986 , Japan is permitted to catch whales for " lethal research " into the mammals ' migratory and other habits in anticipation of a return to sustainable commercial culls .
Sato and Suzuki were arrested in June after intercepting 23kg of whale meat they claimed had been pilfered by crew from the factory ship the Nisshin Maru and sold on Japan 's lucrative black market .
They will go on trial early next year .
" Junichi and Toru 's trial is politically motivated , " said Sara Holden , Greenpeace 's whale campaign coordinator .
" If the Japanese government wants to make political prisoners out of people who oppose whaling , then they are going to have to take a lot more prisoners . "
The group said 250,000 people had emailed the Japanese prime minister , Taro Aso , demanding that the charges be dropped .
Microsoft 's chief executive said the software giant is not interested in renewing its bid for struggling search engine company Yahoo .
Steve Ballmer told a business lunch in Sydney that Microsoft had moved on after Yahoo rejected its takeover bid earlier this year , but did suggest a partnership in the search engine market is possible .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" We made an offer , we made another offer , and it was clear that Yahoo did n't want to sell the business to us and we moved on , " Ballmer said .
" We are not interested in going back and re-looking at an acquisition .
I do n't know why they would be either , frankly .
They turned us down at $ 33 a share . "
Yahoo shares last traded at $ 13.96 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Yahoo chief executive Jerry Yang said Wednesday that Microsoft should make another bid for his company , which runs the world 's No. 2 search engine .
His appeal came after top search engine Google backed out of an internet advertising partnership to avoid a challenge from the US Justice Department , which said it would sue to block the Yahoo deal to preserve competition in internet advertising .
Yahoo had been counting on the Google deal to boost its finances and placate shareholders still incensed by management 's decision to reject the $ 47.5 billion takeover bid from Microsoft six months ago .
" I 'm sure there are still some opportunities for some kind of partnership around search , but I think acquisition is a thing of the past , " Ballmer said .
" Everybody needs a good competitor , and we just want the other guys in this business to have a good competitor that they have to think about every day , " he said .
He also told the audience that Microsoft saw an opportunity to reinvent the online search process .
" If anybody thinks the future of search is going to look like the present search , that 's crazy , " Ballmer said .
" The user interface on search has n't changed for six years .
You still get the same dull , boring ten blue links for God 's sake .
Ca n't we do any better than that ? "

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says President - elect Barack Obama will be great for the country , but that he's not going to serve with him , at least not right away .
The Republican governor congratulated Obama , a Democrat , for his historic win and urged Americans of all political stripes to get behind him Wednesday .
Schwarzenegger says California will do everything it can to help the new administration .
But he dashed any talk that he would be a part of it , at least during the early years .
He says he plans to stay in California until his term is up in 2010 .
Schwarzenegger endorsed GOP nominee John McCain but had said either man would be a welcome change .
The governor spoke Wednesday in Los Angeles during a news conference for Proposition 11 .
Voters were about evenly split on the redistricting measure , with 95 percent of precincts reporting .

EL PASO , Ill. , Nov. 6 ( UPI ) -- A 22 - year - old man from El Paso , Ill. , made five holes - in - one at an area golf course in a six - day period , witnesses say .
Unidentified witnesses said Curt Hocker was able to place his first golf shot directly in the hole at the El Paso Golf Club on five occasions in less than a week 's time , the Peoria ( Ill . ) Journal Star said Thursday .

Hocker said he is still in shock from his successful six - day golfing span , which began on Oct. 29 and ended Tuesday .
" If somebody told me they made five holes - in - one in a week , even on a par - 3 course , I 'd say ' No way , ' " the former Illinois State University student said .
" It 's unbelievable .
I 'm just stunned . "
Francis Scheid , a retired Boston University math department chairman , said the chance a golfer with a low handicap would make a hole - in - one on a routine par - 3 hole is 5,000 - to - 1 .
Scheid said those odds increase dramatically when considering holes with a higher par count and greater length such as those Hocker apparently conquered , the newspaper reported .

A bane of Big Oil ’s offshore rigs could become a boon for renewable energy .
By tapping the natural motion of slow - moving water , a new hydrokinetic generator could open vast new swaths of the ocean for energy production .
When ocean currents flow over any kind of cylinder , like the long cables that hold drilling platforms in place , small vortices are created .
They eventually spin away , or shed , causing vibrations that over time can destroy an oil rig ’s moorings .
Now , a University of Michigan engineer who long worked on suppressing this phenomenon , has developed a prototype energy - harvester that can capture the mechanical energy it creates .
" About four years ago , it dawned on me that we should enhance the vibrations and try to harness the energy , " said ocean engineer Michael Bernitsas , who has founded Vortex Hydro Energy to commercialize his idea .
" No one has ever thought of patenting this idea , even though vortex induced vibrations were first observed in 1504 by Leonardo da Vinci . "
Energy experts consider the movement of water in oceans a vast untapped source of clean energy that could provide up to 10 percent of U.S. demand ( pdf ) .
A variety of schemes have been proposed to capture this mechanical energy , usually involving turbines to capture fast - moving water generated by tides or a strong current .
But few projects have progressed beyond the science project stage .
The most advanced is a Pelamis Wave Power project off the coast of Portugal , which provides a mere 2 megawatts of power .
One major problem is that most underwater turbines require the water to be moving very fast .
One study suggested that hydrokinetic projects only made economic sense in currents moving at over six knots , which are highly rare .
It ’s all the ocean ’s other currents , which are generally under 3 knots , that Bernitsas sees as his technology ’s main advantage .
" There is a huge amount of hydrokinetic energy in currents but a lot of that we cannot harness with the present technology and that ’s where my device comes in , to extract energy at speeds down to 1 knot , " said
Michael Bernitsas , who has founded Vortex Hydro Energy to commercialize his idea .
" It taps into a new energy source . "
That idea has attracted some name - brand backers .
The National Science Foundation , the U.S. Navy , and the Department of Energy have together contributed about $ 2 million to Vortex to further develop the concept .
Prototypes of the device — known as Vortex Induced Vibrations Aquatic Clean Energy — are essentially round cylinders a few inches across suspended in water on a spring .
The vortices generated by water flow move the cylinder up and down .
The VIVACE system converts that mechanical energy into electricity via rotary or linear generators .
In the future , Bernitsas wants to create modular 50 kilowatt units , like the artist ’s rendering seen above .
They could be strung together for larger applications into power plants producing as much as a gigawatt of power .
The engineers are working on making the basic system components more efficient , too .
The cylinders of the early designs have sprouted tails , which allow them to use more of the energy in the vortices .
It ’s an idea that the engineer has borrowed from whales , fish , tadpoles and other creatures that move in liquid , which he says all have a bluff , or not slender , body followed by a tail .
" The muscle power the fish have is not enough to support the speed at which they are going , " he said .
" So , if you study more carefully , there are lots of things going on .
A fish will curve its body , collect a vortex , shed it , and collect one on the other side and shed that , alternating on the two sides of its body . "
The design of the system allows it to take much more energy out of the water than turbine - based systems .
In technical terms , the energy density of the system is higher .
For example , in a three - knot current , the VIVACE gets 50 watts per cubic meter of water , while the Pelamis system , considered the world leader in ocean energy , gets 21 .
The innovative nature of the idea , however , is no guarantee of commercial success .
" I think that it ’s at a very , very early stage of development , " said Roger Bedard , an analyst at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto , California , and world expert on ocean energy .
And Bernitsas ’ system would be subject to the United States ’
regulatory process , which was designed with large hydroelectric dam projects in mind , and that has hampered all hydrokinetic energy technology development .
" You have to go through 20 to 25 different regulatory agencies in this country , " Bedard said .
Governmental risk frightens potential investors .
Erik Straser of the
Silicon Valley - based venture capital firm Mohr Davidow Ventures , sees potential regulatory and technical issues , too .
" This seems like it would be have some issues with permitting , "
Straser wrote in an e-mail to Wired.com .
" I think that and reliability will be the key issues to deployment and efficacy . "
Bernitsas believes that his technology is much more environmentally friendly than other marine projects , so he ’s looking forward to working with regulators .
Still , the tide could be turning , no pun intended , for marine and hydrokinetic projects .
The recent Wall Street bailout bill included tax credits for these projects , which could stir investor interest .
For now , Bernitsas is n’t focused on large - scale production just yet .
The first ready - to - use prototype , slated for splash down in the Detroit River , will be ready in about a year .
" We ’re where cars were 100 years ago , " Bernitsas said .
" Hopefully it wo n’t take us 100 years to get where we need to be . "

If you want to glimpse the handiwork of one of your body ’s unsung sensory heroes , try this little experiment .
Hold your index finger a few inches in front of your face and sweep it back and forth at a rate of maybe once or twice a second .
What do you see ?
A blurry finger .
Now hold your finger steady and instead shake your head back and forth at the same half - second pace .
This time , no blur , no Marcel Duchamp ’s “ Nude Descending a Staircase ” effect .
The finger stays in focus even as your head vigorously pantomimes its denial .
And it ’s a good thing , too .
If the brain could n’t distinguish between movements of the viewer and movements of the view , if every time you turned around or walked across the room the scenery appeared to smear or the walls to lurch your way , you soon might cease to move at all , uncertain of external threats , unaided by any internal compass marked You .
Essential to a fully embodied sense of self is the vestibular system , a paired set of tiny sensory organs tucked deep into the temporal bone on either side of the head , right near the cochlea of the inner ear .
The vestibular system is n’t a high - profile , elitist sense like the famed five of vision , hearing , touch , taste and smell .
It ’s more of a Joe Sixth - Sense , laboring in anonymity and frequently misunderstood .
Even its name is a blooper encapsulated , the result of early anatomists thinking the organ merely served as an entrance , or vestibule , to the inner ear .
Despite its humble reputation , the vestibular system has lately won fans among neuroscientists , who marvel at its sophistication and sensitivity , and how it tells us where we are and what we ’re doing and why we should never again embarrass ourselves by going roller skating .
They praise the machine - tool precision of its parts , the way the vestibular system discovered the laws of Newtonian mechanics some 400 million years before Newton and then put those principles to use to provision the head with little organic gyroscopes and linear accelerometers .
We already knew that Id Software co-founder John Carmack was on board with the iPhone to some extent , but at the now - happening QuakeCon 2008 in Dallas he 's revealed just how impressed with the device he really is .
According to Apple Insider , while Carmack admits that graphics memory could be a limiting factor , he describes the phone 's hardware as equivalent to a Dreamcast and almost on par with a PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox .
He also sees it as far superior , at least in terms of raw specs , than the two big dedicated handheld consoles out there , saying that is " more powerful than a Nintendo DS and PSP combined . "
Unfortunately , he did n't have any actual games to show off , but he did at least confirm that Id has two " tentative titles " in the works , including a " conventional mobile game , " and one that pushes the iPhone 's graphics capabilities .
I recently released my first iPhone app , Favorites - you can read more about it here , or go straight to it on the App Store ( iTunes link ) .
I wanted to write a bit about some of my UI design decisions , and some lessons I learned during the development process with regard to creating software interfaces for the iPhone .
So here goes .
This post contains plenty of screenshots and a few brief movies too ; screenshots are bordered in white , and movies are bordered in blue ( with a Quicktime controller immediately below each one ) .
You might not see the movies if you ’re reading this via the feed instead of on the web .
Starting with what 's familiar
As I described in my previous post , my concept for Favorites was a speed - dial utility that uses your contacts ’ photos , and behaves a lot like the iPhone ’s Home screen .
I liked the visual metrics of the 4x4 layout ( excluding the dock at the bottom ) , and the fact that every single iPhone owner has looked at that screen about a thousand times .
I took the basic
Home screen layout and moved it downwards to leave room for a titlebar at the top .
I also wanted some basic editing controls ( a button to toggle Edit Mode , and a + button to add a new favorite ) , so I initially mocked those up in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen :
( Note : the above is a cut - up of screenshots of my Home screen , so do n’t be alarmed at the duplicate app-icons . )
I also wanted to include some kind of dynamic help , though , and with the buttons at the bottom of the screen the entire titlebar ( actually a navigation bar ) along the top was a waste of space .
I had a play with my iPhone and noted that add / edit controls tend to be along the top of the screen , so I moved the buttons into the titlebar and everything fell into place .
The basic UI of Favorites was born :
Favorites can of course also display the photos without labels , which I personally prefer .
I ’ve noticed that some of the other visual speed - dial apps on the store have a similar display but clearly do n’t proportionately scale the images ; they just draw them straight into the non-square area , resulting in a squashed appearance .
I ported my NSImage cropping category to iPhone to make this easy ; I ’ll no doubt release it when possible .
In any case , the basic idea is that you can interact with each favorite in two ways : tap or double - tap .
One of those performs your chosen default action ( call , SMS or email - initially set to call ) , and the other shows the Overlay .
Initially , a single tap performs the default action and a double - tap shows the Overlay .
I toyed with the idea of using tap - hold for the secondary action instead of double - tap , but I decided it would be potentially confusing for two main reasons :
People are used to tap - hold meaning " enter edit mode " on the Home screen , so I 'd be overloading a familiar interaction ( in a familiar - looking environment , indeed ) with a new meaning .
That struck me as a bad idea .
Tap - hold takes longer than double - tap ( on average ) , and is an interaction which requires more effort .
This is fine for a rare operation like rearranging your apps on the Home screen , but it 's not ok for showing the Overlay , which is potentially a much more frequent action .
So , I went with tap and double - tap .
This opened up the problem of double - tap being a more difficult interaction than a single tap ( due to the twin constraints of having to tap twice in the same general area , and having to do so within a time - limit , before the second tap would simply register as a new single - tap ) .
I did some informal testing here and decided on a nominal double - tap interval of 0.4 seconds , and added a setting to allow any value between 0.2 and 1.0 seconds .
Most people should find the default setting just fine , but it ’s important to consider those who may have difficulty with rapid , precise movements .
Obviously , the longer you wait to see if a second tap is going to occur ( and thus be considered a double - tap action ) , the longer you have to wait before the app can decide that you ’ve only single - tapped .
Thus , the less strict you are about the two taps of a double - tap happening in quick succession , the longer you need to wait after single - tapping before the single - tap action is triggered .
So it ’s a trade - off , and one that I felt was individual enough to actually warrant a setting ( settings to be avoided in general , if at all possible - but basic accessibility allowances are a very good exception ) .
That brings us to the actual drag - rearranging which again mimics the Home screen .
This uses Core Animation to make the other favorites slide around to make room as you drag one ; they move when the center - point of the dragged favorite enters the bounds of another ; this gives a smooth and unsurprising behaviour which does n’t feel unstable .
I initially tried moving the other favorites when any part of the dragged favorite overlapped another , but the result was a sense of the layout being too fluid and too eager to rearrange itself .
There ’s one more subtlety to the drag - rearranging code which you may never notice , but which I took some extra time on .
When your favorites are laid out , they all occupy a different depth - level , such that the later ( further to the bottom - right ) ones are “ higher ” ( closer to the user ) than the earlier ones .
I decided on this model because the favorites are added from top - left to bottom - right as with apps on the Home screen , and it thus provides an unsurprising appearance when they ’re rearranging themselves ( with later ones flowing over the top of earlier ones ) .
This presented a problem when dragging , however .
Dragging a favorite to a position further to the right and / or bottom than its current position would result in it being “ behind ” the favorite whose position it was about to occupy , and thus the dragged favorite would be temporarily partially obscured as the others reflowed .
This was unintuitive , since we often think of a dragged object as not just dragged but sort of picked up out of its place , moved around and then put back down .
I addressed this by temporarily promoting the dragged favorite to be topmost during the drag , then when it ’s released it will remain topmost as it animates into its final grid- aligned position before finally ( and invisibly to the user ) being restored to its proper new depth - order .
This presents a sensible interaction model to the user , who will ideally never even notice what actually occurs .
One final point I wanted to note is that , during initial development of the favorites - adding code , I felt uncomfortable about how empty the screen was when you only had one or two favorites .
Each favorite looked very tiny against the vast expanse of black , which was unpleasant .
The solution was obvious : resize the favorites as you add and remove them , to best fill the available space .
Your favorites will display in a 2x2 , 3x3 or 4x4 grid as appropriate , resizing and rearranging themselves as the layout changes .
There was also briefly a 1x1 display , but it was quite alarming as one of the first things the new user sees after adding their first favorite , so I made 2x2 the minimum grid - size ( with the largest possible size for each favorite ) .
Also , the photos in the user ’s Contacts database do n’t fare well when resized up to fill most of the iPhone ’s screen , so it was n’t a big loss .
I tested the variable - sized grid layout and decided it worked well , even though it detracted somewhat from the idea of being like the Home screen .
The one thing which still was n’t quite right was the way that deleted favorites just winked out of existence ; the feature needed some animation to provide visual confirmation and reassurance to the user that the deletion had gone as planned and nothing unexpected had occurred .
Thus , when you delete a favorite , it will temporarily drop to the lowest depth - level ( this does n’t affect its position on screen ) , and then drop away downwards behind the others , fading out of existence after a brief distance .
It sounds elaborate but it occurs asynchronously and very quickly , and I think it ’s a good visual cue .
Hopefully you ’ll agree .
Overthinking the Overlay
The next major part of Favorites is the Overlay , where you may spend a fair bit of time if you often alternate between calling , texting and emailing your favorite contacts .
I did n’t have much of an idea how to approach the visual design of the Overlay until I happened to glance at the phone during a call - the Phone app presents an overlay which provides an ideal control layout .
You can compare the two overlays below .
Reasonably similar , but with a few deliberate differences .
Favorites darkens its overlay 's background , since the grid of favorites provides a higher level of visual noise than the presumably more uniform wallpaper shown behind the call overlay .
I did n't want the background to be solid black , but I did want to significantly push it into the background , to focus attention solely on the overlay 's controls .
The buttons at the bottom of my overlay are taller than the End Call button .
I felt that this was appropriate since there are two buttons to interact with in the same vertical space , distinguished only by their horizontal positions .
Also , given the usually almost vertical orientation of your finger when interacting with the device , and the potential for your finger slipping downwards during a touch operation , I decided that an enlarged vertical hit - area would never be unwelcome .
There are also a couple of other usability enhancements I ’ve added to help the user interact with the overlay as easily as possible , which you can see in the next screenshot .
The actual number or email address ( and the label for that number / email ) are shown when you tap on one of the three large action - buttons .
This gives an extra memory - aid as to which actual values you assigned to those actions for this favorite .
They 're shown above the buttons , since displaying them below would cause them to be hidden by your hand .
Each of the action - buttons highlights in a different colour , and tries to be as faithful to the standard iPhone colour - scheme as possible .
The call button highlights in green since the Phone app icon is green .
The email button highlights in blue .
The SMS button presented an issue since that app's icon is the same green as the Phone app , and I thought that it would look awkward to have only the email button being a " different " colour , so I chose a third and somewhat intermediate lilac / purple colour for SMS .
The Overlay is a very simple piece of UI , but rest assured that plenty of thought and time has gone into it .
Buttons may ( and should ) be larger than they appear
Take a look again at the X - buttons ( the delete buttons ) attached to each favorite in the screenshot of Edit Mode a few paragraphs above .
Go on , I ’ll wait .
They ’re enormous , are n’t they ?
Huge , hulking great black circles with a white X inside , just like in the Dashboard on Mac OS X .
An easy target to hit , no matter how drunk you are .
Except they ’re not huge at all .
The iPhone screen is much smaller in real life than in screenshots of the simulator , and believe me - those buttons are tiny .
In fact , they ’re about one - sixth the size of the nail on my pinky finger , and I have pretty slender fingers .
Think about that for a moment ( the buttons , not my girl - hands ) .
I initially implemented those buttons just as you see them ; they were as big as the actual icon they contained , and no more .
And they were impossible to hit with any accuracy ; I had to jab several times to actually trigger them .
Completely unacceptable .
If you play with the apps on the Home screen , you ’ll find it quite easy to hit the delete buttons , and yet they use exactly the same icon .
The reason is that the virtual hit - area of the button is larger than it appears , and this is crucial in iPhone development .
It ’s why you have n’t really tested your UI until you ’ve tested it on an actual device .
Accordingly , I enlarged the actual hit - area of my delete buttons , and voila - I could trigger them every time , without reducing the user ’s ability to drag the favorites around .
Behind the scenes , the actual active area of those buttons in Favorites looks like this :
Much better , and again invisible to the user - it just “ works properly ” .
I ’ll revisit this idea a little later .
It ’s interesting to note that this idea of active areas differing from visible areas is found throughout the iPhone UI - specifically in most of the buttons .
The standard button object has an interesting behaviour in the situation where you tap and hold , and then drag your finger off the button .
On the desktop , when this happens the button would un - highlight as soon as your cursor left its visible boundary , and would highlight again if you moved the cursor back inside it again .
Not quite so on iPhone .
The interesting thing is that the area in which you can tap to initially trigger the button is different from the area you must drag out of in order to cancel the operation - the latter is bigger !
This applies to a large majority of all the buttons on the device .
Here ’s an illustration :
The yellow area is the area you can tap to trigger the button .
If you tap and hold within that rectangle , the button will highlight .
But if you drag your finger ( still not having released the tap ) out of the yellow area , the button will stay highlighted , and will still trigger if you then let go .
It ’s only when you drag outside of the green area that the button will return to its normal appearance , and no longer be triggered when you lift your finger .
My presumption is that Apple did some research and realised that slipping of the finger during a tap on a touchscreen device happens far more than slipping of the mouse - pointer during a click , and did the most logical thing they could : expand the active area once you ’ve already tapped .
Your own apps get this behaviour for free with standard button objects .
Small touches
Pun definitely intended , but I mean touches in the sense of tweaks and finishing touches here , rather than the interaction .
These were things which occurred to me during testing , and which are once again mostly invisible to the user , but which I wanted to mention here .
They all concern how Favorites determines which available display - names , phone numbers and email addresses to show , and how it behaves when you ’ve just created a new favorite or changed the actual contact associated with a favorite .
When you select a new contact for a fave , Favorites will use the contact 's nickname as the default label , since it seems logical that you might have specified a nickname for someone you 'd describe as a " favorite " contact .
If there 's no nickname ( you can specify one in the Contacts app on iPhone or in Address Book on your Mac , you know ) , Favorites will use the contact 's first name ( or company 's name ) .
Since your iPhone is a mobile phone , Favorites will pre-select a phone number whose label is " mobile " , regardless of case ( or a localised variant thereof ) , as the call and SMS number for a favorite .
On the presumption that people you regularly email will commonly tend to be work colleagues or business contacts , Favorites will pre-select an email address whose label is " work " as the email address for a Favorite .
Favorites gets all its numbers etc from your Contacts database , so it 's possible you 'll choose a certain number for a favorite , then subsequently delete that number from the contact 's card in Contacts .
In this situation , Favorites will preserve the number you chose until you explicitly change it , since there is n't a completely predictable way to pick another number in that situation , and I felt that consistency would be a better choice .
This applies similarly to labels for favorites .
These are tiny things , but when all put together they tend to increase the likelihood that Favorites will have done the Right Thing for the average user in a given situation , letting them get on with something more important than adding and configuring a list of favorite contacts .
An intensely textual experience
Favorites displays text all over its UI , and it ’s always tempting to just accept the default behaviour of the standard non-editable text - fields on iPhone .
However , I decided to put a little thought into the kinds of values which would be displayed in each location , and adopt different alignment , resizing and truncation behaviours as appropriate .
The majority of the static text in Favorites is shown in the favorite - editing UI , as shown below .
In order to mimic how Contacts and Address Book show such values , I split the numbers and email addresses into two actual fields : the label and the value .
The labels are right - aligned , and the values are left - aligned , like a form .
Everything is set to resize - to - fit ( down to a legible minimum size ) .
The issue of long values is important too ; how do you do line - breaking ?
My decision was that labels would truncate using an ellipsis at the end , but that numbers and email addresses would use an ellipsis in the middle - because the end of a number or email address is often just as important as the start ( “ is that the number ending in 55 ? ” , or “ is that his Gmail or Yahoo address ? ” ) .
When fields have scaled their text down to fit , they ’re set to align the text - baseline ( rather than center - line ) with adjacent fields , in order to avoid an odd appearance of text floating upwards as it gets smaller .
Definitely sweating the small stuff , but it does make a difference to the overall experience .
Pick a cell , any cell
A significant percentage of the total development time on Favorites was spent on the custom lists ( grouped tables ) you can see in the last few screenshots .
The entire thing is actually a reusable , customisable table view called MGOptionList , which goes to great lengths to make it very easy to let the user choose from a set of options , each with a name , optional extra label , represented value , optional icon , and optional editability .
A lot of the inspiration for these lists was how the option - lists in the Settings application behave .
Which spawns this list :
These lists introduce a concept which I wanted to make use of : the idea that colour indicates what is a value and what is a label .
The values in the above screenshots are in a soft blue colour , whereas the labels ( or unselected options ) are black .
I adapted this to create the blue / grey - on - black scheme seen in previous screenshots .
I had to create custom table - cell backgrounds for this , to allow the use of the rounded “ sections ” with a custom colour - scheme .
I also had to reimplement the standard checkmark and right - arrow accessories in order to be able to specify their colours , but the end result was well worth it .
I also added the important ( and explicitly Apple - recommended ) visual cue of briefly highlighting and then immediately unhighlighting ( with animation ) a row after it ’s tapped , as added confirmation to the user that their tap was received .
This meant creating some extra image resources , but gives a better user experience .
Regarding colour - schemes once again , my decision was that blue would mean “ value ” and that grey would mean “ label ” .
This becomes particularly important when you consider that the following situation will often arise :
In the above screenshot ,
The contact has numbers available , but the user has chosen not to apply any number to the SMS function .
Hence , " None " is shown in blue , with an arrow beside it to indicate that this is only one of several options , and can be changed .
The contact however has no email addresses at all , thus " None " is shown in grey and without any arrow , to indicate that there 's nothing to choose from .
You ’ll find this model in place throughout Favorites .
For example , the topmost part of the favorite - editing UI ( where the actual contact associated with a favorite is chosen ) shows the contact ’s full name in blue and their photo with a blue border , since the contact is the actual “ value ” of that field .
Making it editable
This brings me to editability of options ; i.e. not just picking an option from a list , but editing the actual option itself .
This was important for allowing the user to enter a custom display - name ( label ) for a favorite .
I did some mockups in Photoshop , and decided on this appearance :
The topmost option ( which happens to be currently selected ) is editable , as indicated by the arrow set apart from the rest of that row .
Tapping anywhere on the row except the boxed arrow just selects that option as normal , adding a checkmark to it and making it blue .
Tapping the boxed arrow area slides in an editing UI , shown below .
There are a few things to note about this :
I decided to mimic the appearance of the option - cells for the actual editing field , to reinforce the idea that you 're editing one of those options .
I added a custom dark gradient behind the keyboard , instead of the default bright grey .
I made use of the fact that the keyboard can be asked to display itself with a translucent black background , behind which a custom view can be shown .
Both of the Done buttons ( at the top - right , and in the keyboard ) have the same function of accepting the current value and returning to the list .
I kept the Done button in the top - right since it 's consistent with the previous lists the user will have seen , and I did n't want to suddenly remove it just because the keyboard has one too .
The clear button within the field was n’t there in my initial betas , but I quickly found that it was annoying to have to repeatedly tap the keyboard ’s delete button to remove the default custom label ( “ Custom ” ) .
So , I added a clear button and immediately ran into the same issue as with the delete - buttons on favorites in Edit Mode - it was too small to hit !
It looks big enough in the screenshot , but take a look at the size of just the top section of my index finger ( from the last joint to the tip ) superimposed on that screen :
As I said before , I do not have huge mutant fingers ; they ’re actually kind of small - which makes the clear button ultra small .
So , as before , the clear button ’s active area is now considerably larger than its visual bounds , like so :
Lastly , the clear button and both Done buttons are suitably enabled and disabled as the user edits the text in the field ; you can only clear the field or accept the value if some text actually exists .
The Cancel button , however , is always enabled .
Because I care about this stuff , and I really care about how easy - to - use you find Favorites to be .
Providing help from the start
During development you ’re often working with sample data from an early stage , and so it can actually be quite some time before you consider how your app will behave for a brand new user , upon first launch with no data at all .
My feeling was that offering help immediately , in the form of a tutorial , would be a good idea .
Very few third - party apps on the iPhone offer built - in help , and it struck me that whilst Favorites is a simple concept , it could n’t hurt to at least make the user immediately aware of where help could be found .
Accordingly , upon first launch you ’ll see the screen below .
A bit plain , perhaps , but clear and no-nonsense .
Of course , many people will just skip the tutorial and start exploring - and of course be confronted with a blank screen , utterly devoid of any favorites .
I had initially planned to have an “ import assistant ” , allowing you to automatically make a set of favorites from your most - called or most - texted contacts , but iPhone firmware 2.1 blocked access to the relevant databases on the device so I had to abandon that idea .
To avoid just showing a blank screen , though , I added an additional visual cue which shows only if you have absolutely no favorites at all :
The help text at the bottom of the screen always show relevant help , of course , but I felt the blue call - out was appropriate in this situation , to help people get started - and it ’s much more noticeable than the smaller dynamic help below .
The dynamic help is useful as a quick reminder of what you can do , or what will happen , in a given situation .
For example , as you tap ( and then perhaps tap again , for a double - tap ) on a favorite , the help updates during the tap .
Here ’s what happens when I ’ve tapped once on a favorite with my current settings :
and then when I immediately tap again :
You ’ll also notice that the dynamic help is replicated in the titlebar during taps , since it ’s more readily visible when your hand is over the screen .
Also , note how the border of the favorite ( including the badge - border , if a badge is shown ) is visually highlighted during taps .
Upon triggering an action , that border becomes blue .
Another place that help is available is in the About screen , accessible from the “ i ” button at the lower right of the main screen .
The about screen looks like this :
There are two things to note here :
There 's a prominent " Tutorial " button , to trigger the tutorial at any time .
The Favorites version - number is shown in a place which is very easy for the user to find if they need to report an issue - it 's right under the star .
The version number is of course dynamically determined from the app bundle , so it 's always accurate .
The user can also force the tutorial to immediately be displayed the next time they launch Favorites by enabling that option in the Settings application .
So , help is never far away - which hopefully means that the user feels more confident and more capable using the software , which in turn hopefully means a happy customer .
Conclusion
This all seems like a heck of a lot of work for what ’s essentially a simple speed - dial utility with some custom widgets , and that ’s true - it is a lot of work .
But it ’s all worth it , because taken together all these minor points ( some obvious , some not so obvious ) contribute to a polished user experience , and a conscious or even subsconscious sense on the user ’s part that the software just “ gets ” what thay want it to do .
That ’s what user experience is about , and why it ’s hard - because your software engineering or computing science degree is only a means to an end when solving the problem of how people want to interact with your software .
The ability to apply Human - Computer Interaction design principles to every stage of software development is a huge advantage in this age ( and on these dual platforms - OS X and iPhone ) of a beautiful and truly usable UI being expected rather than just “ nice to have ” .
I relish that situation as a chance to improve my understanding of how people interact with computers , particularly this new touch - screen mobile platform we ’re all so enthusiastic about .
I ’ve enjoyed sharing my thoughts and my development process on Favorites with you , and I ’d love to continue doing so in the future .
If Favorites sounds like something you ’d like to try out , head over to Instinctive Code to read more about it , or you can also go straight to Favorites on the App Store .
The fact of the matter is that interaction design considerations are completely interwoven through all of your code , and whilst it ’s good practice to separate your Models , Views and Controllers , it is not good practice to design them in isolation from one another .
It ’s no longer enough ( if it ever has been ) to be just a developer first and foremost .
These days , try to be a software engineer and a UI designer as you create your applications - and get help with whichever aspect you feel less confident about .
Your software will be an order of magnitude better for it .
Thanks for reading .
For years I greatly admired Senator John McCain .
He had a reputation for being a political maverick and seemed to vote with his conscience instead of with his party .
When it came down to choosing between what was right and what the GOP wanted , John McCain more - often - than - not chose what was right .
Then he set his sights on the White House .
During the past year I ’ve watched McCain ’s positions on things like tax breaks for the rich , a woman ’s right to choose and keeping social security strong , morph and change .
He went from calling Jerry Falwell an “ agent of intolerance ” to speaking at his university ’s graduation address .
Most disturbingly he created a moral exception in his own mind that it was okay for the CIA to torture U.S. detainees , even after years of working tirelessly to end all forms of U.S. held torture .
As a way to vocalize the ways John McCain has lost much of the respect progressives like myself paid him , I ’ve compiled a list of 100 reason why I do n’t think he ’ll ever become President .
The most ironic part about compiling it was that so many of the items were first mentioned on conservative websites .
McCain was never a friend of Republicans , that is until he became their nominee .
I sincerely hope McCain makes an effort to rediscover himself , his values and his voice once the election is complete .
If this list is any indication , his influence will still be felt for years to come , just not from Pennsylvania Avenue .

I will hate them as long as I live . ”
The term “ gooks ” is a racial epithet that has historically been used to demean all Asians .
24 . McCain consistently has a problem remembering the difference between Shia and Sunni .
23 . During his 1986 run for Senate , John McCain used an assumed name to make over $ 225,000 in renovations to a house owned by his father - in - law James Hensley , presumably to avoid perceptions that he was carpetbagger .
22 . McCain used an unauthorized image of General Petraeus to help promote his fundrasing material which was done without Petraeus ’ knowledge or approval .

He has a long , problematic history with fits of anger .
12 . McCain admitted in his memoir “ Faith of My Fathers ” that he was unfaithful to his first wife Carol , who had been disfigured in a near - fatal car accident on Christmas Eve , 1969 .
McCain recounts the events leading up to his divorce and says it was “ my own selfishness and immaturity . …
I can not escape blame by pointing a finger at the [ stress of ] war .
The blame was entirely mine . ”
In return for giving him a divorce , McCain agreed to pay for his ex-wife ’s medical care for the rest of her life .
11 . McCain has implied that the Iraq war was fought over oil .

9 . He does n’t know how to use a computer .
8 . In May of 2008 John McCain said : “ I believe that it ’s not an accident that our hostages came home from Iran when President Reagan was president of the United States .
He did n’t sit down in a negotiation with the religious extremists in Iran , he made it very clear that those hostages were coming home . ’’
But the fact of the matter is that Reagan did negotiate with Iran , albeit unknowingly , through Oliver North .
Acting under the Reagan administration , North traded arms for hostages as Reagan later admitted .
McCain is either lying or he is ignorant of the historical facts of the Iranian hostage incident .

The Top Five
5. Corruption : John McCain was part of the Keating Five scandal accused of corruption in 1989 in conjunction with the larger Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980 ’s and early 1990’s .
4 . Age : Although age should n’t be a factor for determining the next President of the United States , in the eyes of voters , it is .
If he were to win the Presidency , McCain would be inaugurated at the age of 72 , making him the oldest person ever elected .
POTUS is the most stressful , demanding job on the planet and McCain has a history of health problems including multiple treatments for skin cancer .
McCain has already outlived both his father , who died at the age of 70 , and his grandfather , who died at 61 .
In addition , McCain has made numerous gaffes while on the campaign trail , more than can be explained as mere accidents .
He ’s had trouble with geography ( Somalia for Sudan , Iraq ’s borders , etc ) , he ’s re-written history , and made several of these mistakes on several separate occasions .
Critics are starting to notice the mistakes are piling up .
Finally , while he claims to be fit enough to “ hike the Grand Canyon ” , he also sees nothing wrong with collecting tax payer funds in the form of a POW “ disability pension ” ( see # 70 ) .
Despite claims to the contrary , McCain ’s age has become a legitimate campaign issue .
3. Torture : Himself being a former POW , he believes that prisoners of the United States should n’t be subjected to various forms of torture including water boarding .
That is unless they are being held by the CIA , in which case , they can be .
His decision to flip - flop on this key issue , one with which he has fought long and hard against , has cost him dearly with independents , moderate Democrats and even some Republicans who see the shift as hypocritical .
2. Money : McCain has had an extraordinarily hard time raising funds for his campaign .
In March , McCain raised a mere $ 15 million dollars to Obama ’s $ 40 million .
For every dollar McCain raises , Obama raises 3 .
Such a massive financial advantage will allow Obama to compete in more states than McCain and force him to defend states that should rightfully be Republican wins .
Although the Republican National Committee helps make up for McCain ’s fundraising shortfalls , it none - the - less ca n’t keep pace with the Democrats and Obama .
Diverting cash from the GOP coffers to McCain ’s fight for the White House will have detrimental effects on other , smaller GOP races .
Obama has more than 1.5 million donors while McCain has just a few hundred thousand .
1. Bush :
By any metric chosen , clues point to voters favoring Democrats in the House of Representatives , the Senate and the White House this fall .
President Bush ’s approval records are at an all - time low , hovering around 28 % .
Democratic voter registration is 2 - 3 times higher across the country than their GOP counterparts .
And for the first time in 3 election cycles , Democrats are raising more money than their right - leaning counterparts .
In addition , wedge issues which were so effective against John Kerry in 2004 such as gay marriage have taken a back seat to topics like Iraq , the economy and energy .
John McCain has attempted to distance himself from the Bush administration , while at the same time aligning himself with the majority of his critical policies .
From Iraq and his tax proposals , to his flip - flop on women ’s choice and the types of judges McCain would appoint , there is virtually no difference between the candidate and Bush .
Obama easily fills entire stadiums with voters hungry for change , but McCain must be content with relatively small gatherings of loyal , core followers .
McCain may make a go of the election through the use of fear , misinformation and doubt , but in the end , signs point to an Obama victory , due in part by Bush weary voters .
November 18 , 2008
President - elect Obama has committed himself to stepping up the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan .
It is not an overstatement to say that he will risk his whole presidency , and perhaps even unwittingly put nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists who might use them to attack the United States , if he leaps too far into neighboring Pakistan in pursuit of elusive victory .
The rub , as the Vietnam and Iraq wars showed us all , is unintended consequences .
Our military leaders can , and almost certainly will , make a strong case to Obama that there is no way to defeat the Taliban and their allied tribes in Afghanistan without cleaning out their sanctuaries just over the Afghan border in Pakistan .
I can hear frustrated U.S. commanders on the ground in Afghanistan making the same kind of argument to Obama�s team tomorrow that I heard yesterday in Vietnam when I was a combat correspondent there .
I could empathize with this lament , for example , that I heard in 1968 from a 9th Division infantry battalion commander , whose mission was to rid his area � South Vietnam�s rice bowl , the Delta � of the stealthy Viet Cong guerrillas :
" I can have my kids chase the Viet Cong all day and all night .
But whenever they catch up to a good number of them , they just run over the border into Cambodia where we can�t go .
All I�m really doing down here is buying time with my kids� lives for the diplomats to settle this thing . "
His was among the impressive military arguments I heard for either invading Cambodian border sanctuaries or getting the United States out of the otherwise unwinnable Vietnam War .
President Lyndon Johnson resisted invading Cambodia .
He had concluded that this would only widen the war , infuriating an already skeptical Congress .
Early on in Johnson�s presidency he confided to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , but not the public , that he saw the war as a no-win .
Secret tapes of Johnson�s conversations , since made public , document him saying this to McNamara on Feb. 26 , 1965 : " I don�t think anything is going to be as bad as losing , and I don�t see any way of winning . "
His successor , Richard Nixon , who took office in 1969 after the Vietnam War had ruined Johnson�s presidency , including his dream of building a Great Society , rushed into Cambodia where Johnson had feared to tread .
First , Nixon authorized , without telling the public , secret bombings of Cambodia , which had tried to stay neutral .
Then on April 30 , 1970 , Nixon announced he had ordered the invasion of Cambodia with U.S. and South Vietnamese troops to " clean out " the enemy�s border sanctuaries .
Now think " Pakistan " to hear the same ring .
Four days later � on May 4 , 1970 � National Guardsmen killed four student anti-war protesters on the campus of Kent State in Ohio .
Those two events , coming right on top of each other , mobilized anti-war lawmakers in Congress to curb the president�s war - making powers and to cut off the money the South Vietnamese army needed to continue fighting the war after U.S. troops left the field under Nixon�s Vietnamization strategy .
The military defeat Johnson had feared all along , without saying so publicly , came in 1975 when Communist North Vietnam conquered capitalist South Vietnam .
Nixon�s invasion of Cambodia , even though his announced purpose was just to clean out the border sanctuaries , contributed to Cambodia�s political turmoil .
The invaders also failed to achieve the military objective of finding and destroying the Communist headquarters in Cambodia known as COSVN for Central Office for South Vietnam .
The Communist Khmer Rouge in the aftermath of the invasion toppled the pro-American leader of the country , Lon Nol , and wiped out the upper classes in a bloodbath that some reports estimated murdered 2 million Cambodians .
Again , unintended consequences .
Fast forward to Pakistan today .
President Asif Ali Zardari , husband of Benazir Bhutto , a Muslim moderate who was assassinated in December while campaigning in parliamentary elections , is already complaining about U. S. military strikes against alleged al Qaida and Taliban targets in Pakistan�s border regions .
An American - led ground invasion of Pakistan under the same " clean out " rationale Nixon used could cause such political turmoil that the bad guys might get their hands on one or more of Pakistan�s nuclear weapons .
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates Pakistan has at least 60 nuclear weapons .
Imagine a worst case scenario of terrorists sneaking just one nuke into New York City and setting it off at lunch hour .
Thousands of people could be incinerated , skyscrapers toppled and the air poisoned for years .
The Bush administration , Congress and the media have been rightly faulted for not worst - casing the American invasion of Iraq before it was ordered in 2003 .
History warns that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it .
Obama needs to look long and hard at the worst unintended consequences of leaping into Pakistan .
While he�s at it , the new president should consider what would happen if U. S. forces captured or killed Osama bin Laden .
Osama�s deputies would feel compelled to retaliate against the United States in a spectacular way .
Does Obama want another 9/11 ?
Better to keep American fingerprints off the deed if it is done .

Spirit Mars rover is within camera - sight of summit .
The seeing from high up in the Columbia Hills is already picturesque .
Note the walls of Gusev crater in view off in the distance .
Image
At its Gusev crater exploration site , the Spirit Mars rover is wheeling to the summit of Husband Hill and likely to complete its climb this week .
" I think we 're going to make it , " said the Mars Exploration Rover program 's lead scientist , Steve Squyres of Cornell University .
New imagery from the robot shows a feature that is either the summit or something very close to it , he noted in a newly issued rover update on a Cornell University - based website .
Spirit has wrapped up work in what 's called the Voltaire region , including a thorough sweep of a rock called " Assemblee " using science gear attached to the rover 's robotic arm .
Assemblee has turned out to have " a crazy composition , " Squyres noted .
The rock has the highest levels of chromium that the Mars rover team has ever seen on Mars .
" A weird one , " he added .
Big event
Spirit's drive to the summit within the Columbia Hills is eagerly awaited by Mars rover scientists .
Not only should observations from the vantagepoint be impressive , rover team members hope to inspect a basin to the south and possibly layered terrain on the basin 's eastside .
Reaching the summit is a big event for Spirit , said Larry Crumpler , a member of the Mars rover science team .
He is also research curator in volcanology and space sciences at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque .
Crumpler told SPACE.com that unless the next drives of Spirit have troubles with terrain or the like , there is a " good probability " of being at or very close to the summit by the end of this week .
Spirit touched down on Mars at Gusev crater in early January 2004 .
Opportunity : puzzling features
Spirit 's robot companion -- the Opportunity rover -- touched down a few weeks after Spirit and is scouting out Meridiani Planum on the other side of Mars .
In his Cornell rover update , Squyres also spotlighted new findings by the Opportunity Mars rover .
A puzzler is further investigation of " blueberries " , the tiny gray spheres of hematite that provide evidence that water once infused the Meridiani Planum area .
" One of the things we 've been wondering about for awhile was whether the blueberries are the same everywhere , or whether they change from place to place if you travel far enough . "
The answer : the blueberries at Opportunity 's current locale are indeed different compared to those found earlier and several miles away .
" The berries are more numerous here , and some seem to be smaller than any we 've ever seen .
And interestingly , some do n't appear to be round .
We 're still debating what this means , but clearly the hematite is distributed a bit differently here than it has been in any other rocks we 've seen at Meridiani , " Squyres reported .
Cobbles and rinds
And there are a couple of other mysteries that Opportunity has encountered .
" One mystery we 've been dealing with for a long time is the origin of the little dark ' cobbles ' that we occasionally see out on the plains , " Squyres said .
There are two theories for these features :
One is that they are pieces of ejecta - stuff that has been tossed out of nearby craters by impacts .
The other theory is that they are meteorites .
" That 'd be interesting too , though [ it would ] tell us less about Mars than if they 're martian rocks , " Squyres said .
Yet another puzzle : mysterious " rinds " that are sometimes spotted on rocks at Meridiani , Squyres said .
" These look like hard outer shells on some parts of some outcrops , and they 're darker and a little redder than the rock that they encrust , " Squyres said .
Opportunity has wheeled up to such an outcrop that has some rinds on it , " among the best we 've ever seen , " Squyres added .
" So once we nail the cobble problem , we may go after the rinds next . "
