That pleases shareholders and helps to lower prices for consumers through increased supply - a goal BP considers a core part of its social responsibility .
Despite two years of major accidents - a pipeline spill in 2006 and a refinery explosion in 2005 - BP earned points for replacing several executives at those businesses .

Your favourite Cylon , Alberta - bred Tricia Helfer , slides on hot pants and thigh - high boots as Walk All Over Me 's dominatrix .
As much as her new movie , Walk All Over Me , makes a great case that she was born to wear PVC hot pants , Tricia Helfer was n't exactly convinced she was a sex bomb during her high - school years .
" I grew up a farm girl where I was into sports and into school , " the 33 - year - old former supermodel says , interviewed in Vancouver 's just - off–Main Street Argo Cafe .
" I was very tall and gangly , and you certainly do n't think that 's very pretty when you 're a kid . "
There 's no point pretending otherwise today : Helfer is hot .
You do n't have to be sitting across the table from her for confirmation of that .
She 's squeezed into a booth at the Argo , a retro-cool ' 40s diner where the tables are vintage green Arborite and the specials are scrawled on chalkboards .
Helfer , more La La Land than Lotusland , does n't look like she 's from around these parts , even though she splits her time between Vancouver , where she keeps a condo for work , and Los Angeles , where she lives with her lawyer husband and six cats .
She 's wearing a low - cut grey sweater , skinny - leg jeans , and black stiletto boots .
Her teeth are impossibly white , her hair off - blond , and her eyes Caribbean - ocean blue .
The first thing you notice about her is that she looks different in person : preternaturally beautiful and somehow less hypersexualized than what you might have seen in Maxim , Stuff , and the countless other men's magazines that regularly name her one of the most desirable women on the planet .
The world , of course , has seen plenty of Helfer over the years , whether it 's been as the elegant face of Chanel 's Cristalle perfume or the host of Canada 's Next Top Model .
But these days , her profile has never been higher .
Science - fiction aficionados who rarely leave their parents ' basements know her as the ass - kicking Cylon operative Number Six on the critically lauded Battlestar Galactica .
Those who buy Playboy for more than the articles were delighted to find a revealing shoot in the magazine 's February 2007 issue , which celebrated its coup by putting her on the cover .
And she 's evidently on the speed - dial of whoever 's job it is at Maxim to get hot women to pose in glorified dental floss .
On Friday ( December 7 ) she 'll hit local multiplexes in Canadian director Robert Cuffley 's Walk All Over Me , a comedy - thriller in which she plays a dominatrix who aspires to something more .
Even when she 's not wearing fishnets and thigh - high boots , Helfer is one of those lucky few who 's going to turn heads wherever she goes .
What 's refreshing about her , though , is that she does n't seem to understand what all the fuss is about .
" I certainly did n't think that I could ever be a model , " she says .
" And I had no ambition to be an actor .
I was petrified of being on - stage ; I was n't a singer and I was n't a dancer .
I was much more of a tomboy into basketball , volleyball , track and field , and soccer .
And , again , I worked on the farm : I drove tractors and fixed farm machinery . "
Today , Helfer is a world or two removed from her rural hometown of Donalda , Alberta , whose main claim to fame is that it's the home of the world 's biggest lamp .
But despite that , she clearly has n't forgotten her humble , stubble - jumper roots .
Reached at home in Calgary , Cuffley recalls Helfer arriving on the set of Walk All Over Me and promptly winning over the entire crew .
" The way she did that was by making herself accommodating , " he remembers .
" No ego , just , ' Can I do that again ?
What can I do to make this shot easier ?
Would it help you guys if I did this ? '
Those were all phrases that would come out of her mouth .
After a while , you'd be like , ' Wow , she 's not a prima donna Cylon from Galactica .
She 's a down - to - earth farm girl . ' "
In Walk All Over Me , Helfer 's Celene has hightailed it out of Buttnugget , Alberta , for Vancouver , where she pulls down big bucks humiliating sex slaves .
Although she finds herself saddled with a delinquent younger sister played by Leelee Sobieski , Celene has n't given up on Hollywood and an acting career .
Suggest to Helfer that Celene 's story somewhat mirrors her own–albeit without the whips and fetishwear–and she quickly shoots that down .
" From an outsider 's perspective , the movie looks like it maybe mirrors my own life , " Helfer says .
" Celene leaves this small town to go be an actress , and I left a small town to model and now act .
The difference is Celene did n't like where she grew up and could n't wait to leave .
I , on the other hand , had a great childhood and loved where I lived . "
Her journey out of Donalda started in a theatre lineup in 1991 .
Helfer was out for a night at the movies when she caught the eye of a modelling scout .
That was the start of a celebrated career that would take her to runways around the world and land her on the covers of Vogue and Cosmopolitan .
As much as the jump from small - town Canada to international 17 - year - old jet setter had its challenges , Helfer was ready for them .
" I worked on the farm for a wage and had to do budgets , so I knew how to take care of myself , " she recalls .
" A lot of people going out on their own do n't have a strong family base .
I knew that if I got into trouble , I could call my parents and they would be there for me .
Not everyone has that support .
That really helped me to be comfortable with taking risks . "
Taking a major risk was exactly what Helfer did a half - decade ago .
Realizing that –unless your name is Kate Moss–modelling is a profession with an early pull date , she decided some advance career planning was in order .
" I thought I 'd take an acting class , " Helfer says .
" I instantly fell in love with it .
Part of the reason that I have this passion for acting is that I like the idea of getting inside someone 's brain to study their characteristics –why it is that they do the things they do .
My focus was suddenly very clear on what I wanted to do after modelling . "
Assuming you 're not running for president of the Tricia Helfer fan club , things you might not know about her include the fact that had she not been " discovered " , she probably would have gone on to become an animal behaviourist .
Beyond that , she eats fish and the occasional turkey burger but consumes no red meat .
She 's concerned about the environment but is not holier - than - thou about it ; although she 's currently building a solar - powered " green " vacation home in rural Alberta , she guiltily admits to riding a Harley and driving a Porsche .
She 's never been a party girl , which explains why you wo n't find a single mention of her on PerezHilton.com .
She was raised without television but now loves " smart comedy " like South Park and Arrested Development .
She does n't have much use for fantasy fare like The Lord of the Rings , admitting she 's more drawn to darker , reality - based films like Requiem for a Dream .
She would love to work with Cate Blanchett , Quentin Tarantino , and Darren Aronofsky .
She excelled at sports in high school , but these days she 's focusing almost all her energy in one area : acting .
With major roles in two feature films this year , Helfer has given every indication that she is n't going to be another Cindy Crawford when it comes to leaving the catwalk for the screen .
Georgia Straight contributor and Vancouver native Mark Leiren - Young directed Helfer in his 2007 movie , The Green Chain , which looks at the issue of logging old - growth forests from various sides .
Helfer , who plays a celebrity jumping on the green bandwagon , blew his mind when she showed up for filming and proceeded to rattle off a 13 - minute monologue in one perfect take .
" I kept asking her , ' So , no theatre experience at all ? '
' No , ' " Leiren - Young tells the Straight by phone .
" I had trouble believing she was n't a theatre - trained actor .
She was just astonishing . "
Helfer 's first high - profile role found her playing –what else ?
–a model on a 2002 episode of CSI : Crime Scene Investigation .
She credits her big break , however , to Battlestar Galactica , where she landed in 2003 , a year after she quit modelling and left New York for L.A. to pursue acting full - time .
What started as a miniseries reimagining a sci- fi show that impressed no one in the late ' 70s has hit big with both audiences and critics .
Battlestar Galactica in now headed into its fourth season , with Helfer 's platinum - wig–sporting Number Six salivated over by Comic - Con obsessives who can tell you which ship Saul Tigh served on during the first Cylon war .
Helfer never saw the original Battlestar Galactica before signing on for the miniseries ; her main attraction to the project , she says , was that she'd be learning from the Oscar - nominated likes of Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell .
" As a new actor , I looked at it as a great opportunity to work with these people and maybe pick up a few things , " she says .
" In the grand scheme of things , I got really lucky .
I got Battlestar when I 'd been acting for a year .
To get a show that goes on to win Peabody and AFI [ American Film Institute ] awards is pretty lucky , I 'd say . "
Battlestar , filmed in Vancouver , has taken Helfer to a level of celebrity well beyond anything she experienced during her modelling days .
What makes her feel blessed is that she 's been able to maintain a degree of anonymity .
" On Battlestar , most of my characters–and I say characters because I 'm a robot–have white hair , which is a wig , so people almost never recognize me , " she says .
" When I 'm at the airport or on my own time , I do n't have makeup on ; I have my hair in a ponytail .
People only seem to recognize me if I 'm done up .
For me , it 's a blessing in disguise because you can really retain a normal life . "
Not that most people living normal lives end up fielding offers from Playboy .
Helfer says she thought long and hard before she agreed to do the shoot for the magazine .
" If I was going to be sitting there spread - eagled and smoking a cigarette , then it would have been a big deal , " she offers with a big laugh .
" But I had total control over the shots , and coming from a modelling background , I believe that photos are art . "
With Battlestar Galactica currently filming its final season , Helfer is now working on getting an amnesia - themed film titled Unforgettable off the ground on this side of the border , and thinking about pitching an HGTV –style series about building her green - themed house .
For the immediate future , Cuffley rightly figures Walk All Over
Me will end any arguments over whether or not she is just another genetically superior face .
" The bubble she is poised to burst , and I saw her burst it at the Toronto Film Festival , " Cuffley says , " is that people go in [ to Walk All Over Me ] saying , ' Jeez , I do n't know , this could be a sink - or - swim for Tricia Helfer because she 's the second lead in the film . '
I overheard some of this , saw some of it with my own eyes , and heard some of it secondhand .
Every single time , people came out going , ' Holy cow , she 's really good . ' "
Getting Helfer to admit that is , predictably , not easy .
" Obviously , after four seasons on Battlestar and a couple of films , I 'm getting more used to it than when I started , " she says .
" It 's a learning process , and I hope to never stop learning .
I do n't want to get to a place where I feel like I know it all . "
If those sound like the words of a down - to - earth kid from the sticks , that 's no accident .
Except you somehow get the feeling that by the time this unmistakably driven farm girl is finished , Donalda , Alberta , will be famous for more than being the home of the world 's largest lamp .
Maybe some of you have heard of The Web Bot Project , but for those of you who have not , it 's quite intriguing .
The web bot project , developed in the late 1990's , was created to assist in making stock market predictions .
The technology uses a system of spiders to crawl the Internet and search for keywords , much like a search engine does .
When a keyword is located , the web bot takes a snapshot of the text preceding and following the keyword .
This snapshot of text is sent to a central location where it is then filtered to define meaning .
The web bot project 's concept is aimed at tapping into the collective unconscious of the universe and it's inhabitants .
As well , there is an interesting time concept involved and an unusual concept of a " tipping point " regarding the past , current , and future times .
You see , this goes a bit deeper than simply viewing what those of us on the Internet are saying .
In 2001 , the web bot operators began to notice that stock market predictions were not the only matters being accurately predicted by the web bot and they began to take notice of the coincidence with occurrences and explored it further .
One of the first accurate predictions from the web bot took place in June of 2001 .
At that time , the web bot predicted that a life altering event would take place within the next 60 - 90 days .
An occurrence of such proportion that it 's effects would be felt worldwide .
The program based it 's prediction on its filtered web chatter content which , I guess you could say , ultimately represents the collective unconscious of society .
Regrettably , the program 's prediction proved accurate and the Twin Towers fell on 9/11/2001 .
This is where the web bot starts to become interesting .
The web bot program also predicts a worldwide calamity taking place in the year 2012 .
For those of you who study astrology , prophecies , and the like , you may already be familiar with this date .
The Mayans are Considered Great " Seers " by Many
In 2012 , it is Suggested That the Sun and the Earth Will be in Direct Alignment with the Black Hole

" Made in USA " internet messages can provide powerful and inexpensive ammunition for turning global citizens against our nation .
It 's a no-brainer that American security is linked with our ability to inspire allies .
In the web world of today , however , the click of a mouse can severely impact our image in other countries .
" Think before you click ' Forward ' ! " is rapidly becoming today 's version of " Loose lips sink ships ! "
Combat troops whose misbehaviors were uploaded onto the internet learned this lesson the hard way .
Meanwhile , everyday Americans still think nothing of the potential negative consequences of e-mails they presume are only going to friends .
These messages often portray the U.S. as a mean - spirited , hypocritical , misogynistic , warmongering , crusader country , just for starters .
For instance , a forwarded e-mail clip of a TV newscast called " Love it or leave it " featured an angry man cutting down the flags above a small Latino U.S. business because the Mexican flag was hoisted above " Old Glory . "
The man then faced the news camera , declared himself an American veteran , brandished a U.S. Army knife , and called for a fight .
It is disappointing anyone would consider such a display of unnecessary aggression as a source of pride .
What is completely overlooked , however , is the potential for harm to national interests .
While many Americans boastfully forward these so - called patriotic messages to their friends , others unfriendly to the USA can use these same communications to jeopardize international good will , threaten our security , and lose hearts and minds around the globe .
We ’ve heard about life being created in a puddle of primordial chemical soup , sparked by lightning strikes , or organic molecules falling to Earth from comets or planets , such as Mars .
But now , there is an alternative .
Early Earth was radioactive ; the Moon also had a lower orbit , generating strong tidal forces .
Due to the close proximity to abundant water , radioactive beaches may have possessed all the essential ingredients for organic compounds , and eventually life , to thrive .
Research by the University of Washington , Seattle , suggests that perhaps the highly radioactive environment of Earth some 4 billion years ago may have been the ideal time for life to form .
The orbit of the Moon also had a part to play in this offbeat theory .
Through strong tidal forces by a Moon that orbited far closer to the Earth than it does today , radioactive elements accumulated on the beaches could be gravitationally sorted .
The chemical energy in these beach hot spots was probably high enough to allow self - sustaining fission processes ( which occurs in natural concentrations of uranium ) .
The main product from fission is heat , therefore powering chemical processes and the generation of organic , life - giving compounds .
“ Amino acids , sugars and [ soluble ] phosphate can all be produced simultaneously in a radioactive beach environment . ” – Zachary Adam , an astrobiologist at the University of Washington Seattle .
This is a hard theory to understand , it is well known that radioactivity breaks down organic molecules and causes a whole host of problems for us carbon - based creatures .
But in the early Earth , devoid of plants and animals , radioactive processes may have provided energy for life to begin in the first place .
This theory also partially explains why life may be a very rare occurrence in the universe : there must be the correct concentration of radioactive elements , on the surface of a water - dominated developing planet , with tidal forces supplied by a closely orbiting stellar body .
The Earth may , after all , be unique .

A common response to my post showing that The Rich Pay for the Federal Government was that the rich also get more benefits from the federal government .
Let ’s go to the numbers .
Here ’s a chart showing federal spending categories for 2007 .
( Click to expand . )
Social Security , the biggest category , does n’t benefit the rich at all because net Social Security payments are heavily biased against the rich .
According to Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso of the liberal Urban Institute a two earner couple earning $ 230,000 a year ( thus putting them at the mean household income for the top 20 % ) and scheduled to retire in 2030 will pay $ 227,886 more in social security taxes than they receive in benefits ( in present value ) .
Defense is the next biggest category .
To me a lot of " defense " spending does n’t benefit anyone but let ’s be generous and say that the rich benefit from military spending in proportion to their income share which for the top 20 % means 55 % .
Thus $ 301b .
Medicare benefits the rich less than the poor since they are healthier ( plus they must pay higher premiums ) but let ’s say that Medicare benefits the rich in proportion to their population .
If we say the top 20 % are rich and assume that this is the same in the 65 and older category then 20 % of Medicare goes to the rich .
$ 78.8 b .
Medicaid does n’t benefit the rich .
The rich do use unemployment insurance but at far lower rates than the poor .
Does welfare benefit the rich ?
Not directly but maybe from the warm glow .
I do n’t think the benefits of charity are what most people mean when they say that the rich benefit from the federal government but who knows .
Let ’s again be generous and say that the warm glow goes just to the rich and that it is worth 20 % of the benefit to the poor .
$ 73.4 b
Everything else includes the example that people always seem to mention first , roads !
Alas , the entire transportation budget is just $ 77 billion , not much there even if a lot of it goes to the rich .
By my judgment a lot of " everything else " has low value but again let ’s be generous and say that the rich benefit from everything else in proportion to their income share ( .55 ) .
$ 233 b .
Excluding the national debt gives us a total of $ 687 billion out of $ 2597 billion going to the rich or 26 % .
If we assume that the division of the national debt is the same as for the government as a whole ( since this is just past expenditures ) the percentage is still 26 % .
Thus in a generous accounting the rich get 26 % of the benefits of federal spending and pay 68.7 % of the costs .
In percentage terms the rich get about 37 cents on the dollar .
Alternatively stated about 63 cents of every dollar in taxes paid by the rich is transferred down .
Given that the median voter is a taxeater not a taxpayer we should not be too surprised , although this is a smaller number than I would have guessed before I did the calculation .
From an efficiency point of view we should be happy that the rich do n’t get too much – transferring resources creates a lot of waste but transferring resources from the rich to the rich is especially wasteful .
The basic point is clear ;
In the United States , one can argue for taxing the rich on the ability to pay principle but not on the benefit principle .
Addendum :
Thanks to Ted Frank for catching a math slip - up on my part which I fixed raising the total to 26 % .

The obese are being treated as if they have a medical problem when often they simply eat too much and exercise too little , a leading doctor has said .
Dr Hamish Meldrum , head of the British Medical Association , argued that the " over- medicalisation " of weight gain meant that many individuals failed to take responsibility for their own health .
Doctors are being expected to dish out pills and carry out surgical interventions that have " limited benefits " , according to Dr Meldrum , a GP practising in Yorkshire .
He added : " We are tending to say , ' This patient has a hyper - appetite problem ' rather than maybe they are eating too much .
" People like to put fancy labels that suggest things are a medical problem , but obesity is not just a problem for GPs , it is societal .
Scroll down for more ...
" All of us , myself included , need to take some responsibility for our own health .
" Obesity is in danger of becoming overmedicalised .
" Patients may think that surgery and medication are the answer but these are measures that offer limited benefit , even to the grossly obese .
" They should be seen as a last resort and I believe prevention is much better than cure . "
Almost one in four adults and 11 - to - 15 - year - olds in Britain are obese .
NHS guidelines issued to doctors last year about dealing with the obesity epidemic recommend drugs and surgery .
Even under - 12s can be prescribed anti-obesity drugs - despite the medication only being licensed for adults - if the problem is bad enough .
More than a million anti-obesity prescriptions for drugs such as Xenical and Reductil were issued in England in the last financial year at a cost of £ 47 million .
Dr Meldrum said evidence for their effectiveness was " weak " and it was difficult for doctors to help people change sedentary lifestyles dominated by energy - dense foods if they were not committed to losing weight .
He added : " I 'm not saying we should not look at how we can medically treat people who are very obese .
" But obviously prevention is better than cure . "
He said the problem of " overmedicalising " also affected other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and dyslexia .
He said he did not dispute that ADHD or dyslexia existed and were debilitating , but they are being diagnosed inappropriately .
Dr Colin Waine , chairman of the National Obesity Forum , said although medical intervention such as pills and surgery did not dramatically reduce a patient 's weight , it was sufficient to cut the risk of illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes .
He said : " I think that neither approach excludes the other , but you need a medical approach for this problem as well as a social one .
" I think that there 's a tendency always to oversimplify these things .
" But if people are clinically obese they 've often got risk factors for major diseases , and this is where you need medical help to reduce these risks .
" If we do n't do something , by 2020 one fifth of the NHS budget will be spent on treating type two diabetes , which is associated with obesity , so I think that medical intervention is very important . "
Neville Rigby , director of policy and public affairs on the International National Obesity Taskforce , agreed with Dr Meldrum that individuals needed to take responsibility for their weight , but said society made it hard for people to make healthy choices .
He said : " If someone is surrounded by fatty food , and has little money , convenience food is very cheap and highly promoted .
It 's part of a social norm to eat fatty food .
Every hospital should have an operating theatre specially equipped for seriously overweight patients , says the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland .
Larger recovery beds , gowns , stockings , blood pressure cuffs and tourniquets must also be routinely provided , according to the association , which has issued safety guidance on treating " morbidly obese " patients - those whose weight exceeds 23 stones ( 150kg ) .
There has been a significant increase in the use of labels to describe conditions which some doctors claim are behavioural problems rather than medical disorders .
Here are some of the most common examples :
• Hyper-Appetite Problem : Otherwise known as overeating which can lead to obesity .
• Female Sexual Dysfunction : Also known as lack of libido .
It has been criticised as exaggerating women 's dissatisfaction with their sexual partners .
Drug company - backed researchers claim 43 per cent of women aged 18 to 59 suffer from it and treatments are being developed .
• ADHD , or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder :
Once considered to be naughty behaviour , this is now treated with Ritalin and similar drugs .
Symptoms are lack of concentration and disruptive behaviour .
It is estimated 400,000 youngsters between five and 19 are being treated each year .
• Total Allergy Syndrome :
This describes allergies to " modern life " including chemicals and artificial materials in the environment which cause multiple symptoms .

The Robert A. Taft Club , a group headed by a man with a network of racist connections , has announced that a U.S. congressman , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , will address the group this Thursday at a restaurant in Arlington , Va .
The Taft Club is led by Marcus Epstein ( right ) , who serves as the executive director of both white nationalist Pat Buchanan ’s The American Cause and the Team America PAC , which is run by Buchanan ’s sister , Bay Buchanan .
Epstein writes for the anti-immigrant hate site vdare.com and he advocates for white supremacist organizations .
He is especially fond of American Renaissance — a white supremacist journal that has suggested that blacks have “ psychopathic personalities ” — and attends the journal ’s biannual conferences .
In 2006 , Epstein invited the head of American Renaissance ’s parent organization , Jared Taylor , to speak to the Taft Club on the issue of “ Race and Conservatism . ”
Taylor is n’t the only extremist Epstein has invited to speak at the Taft Club ’s meetings .
Both Paul Gottfried , who has spoken at American Renaissance gatherings , and Robert Stacy McCain , a foe of interracial marriage who is an editor at The Washington Times , have spoken to the club .
( Epstein is listed as one of McCain ’s friends on McCain ’s Facebook Internet page ) .
This past February , Epstein invited two members of a racist and anti-immigrant Belgian party , Vlaams Belang , to speak to his group .
In 2004 , an earlier incarnation of the Vlaams Belang , Vlaams Blok , was banned on the grounds that it incited racial hatred .
It is unclear if Paul , who will be speaking about American foreign policy , is aware of Epstein ’s racist ties .
WASHINGTON - More than half of Americans visited a library in the past year with many of them drawn in by the computers rather than the books , according to a survey released today .
Of the 53 per cent of US adults who said they visited a library in 2007 , the biggest users were young adults aged 18 to 30 in the tech - loving group known as Generation Y , the survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project said .
" These findings turn our thinking about libraries upside down , " said Leigh Estabrook , a professor emerita at the University of Illinois and co-author of a report on the survey results .
Deep moment , cue montage of oceans , mountains and highway full of hybrids or something .
" What if every biillboard you drove by every day was actually a powerplant ? "
And then think that maybe , just for a moment , the world could be better .

Then snap back to reality .
You are at work where your potential is limited and nobody cares about anything .
Still , this San Franciscan Pacific Gas and Electric billboard actually draws its power from the grid , but sports 20 solar panels that gather enough energy to keep its energy deficit in the black ( since the panels produce more energy than the billboard uses ) .
That bottom line stays within reason with the help of our favorite dork technology , LEDs , which keep the billboard energy efficient even at night .
Ranging from 2.5-3.4 kilowatt hours of electricity produced during the day , with its peak production powering a household of four ( we 're guessing that example represents net after power usage is taken into account ) .
It 's one of those ideas that makes you think , " Why the hell are n't we doing this ? "
And then you remember that solar panels cost money and that people like money .

Kevin Drum thinks he has a killer analysis supporting government health care .
In a post he titles sarcastically " Best Healthcare In the World , Baby , " Drum shares this chart :
The implication is that the US has the worst healthcare system , because , according to this study , the US has the highest rates of " amenable mortality , " defined as deaths that are " potentially preventable with timely and effective health care . "
I get caught from time to time linking to studies that turn out to have crappy methodology .
However , I do try to do a little due diligence each time to at least look at their approach , particularly when the authors are claiming to measure something so non-objective as mortality that was " potentially preventable . "
So , when in doubt , let 's look at what the author 's have to say about their methodology .
The press release is here , which gets us nowhere .
From there , though , one can link to here and then download the article from Health Affairs via pdf ( the site is gated but I found that if you go through the press release site you can get in for free ) .
The wording of the study and the chart as quoted by Mr. Drum seem to imply that someone has gone through a sampling of medical histories to look at deaths to decide if they were preventable deaths .
Some studies like this have been conducted .
This is not one of them .
The authors do not look at any patient data .
Here is what they actually did :
They arbitrarily defined a handful of conditions as " amenable " to care .
These are :
Ischemic Heart Disease ( IHD )
Other circulatory diseases
Neoplasms ( some cancers )
Diabetes
Respiratory diseases
Surgical conditions and medical errors
Infectious Diseases .
Perinatal , congenital , and maternal conditions
Other ( very small )
All the study does is show how many people died in each country from this set of diseases and conditions .
Period .
It does n't determine if they got care or if they in particular could have been saved , but just that they died of one of the above list of conditions .
This study was not an effort to identify people who died when their particular condition should have been preventable or amenable to care ; all it measures is the number of people in each country who died from list of conditions .
If Joe is talking to me and in the next second flops over instantly dead of a massive heart attack , the author 's consider him to have died of a disease amenable to care .
We can learn something by looking at the breakdown of the data .
If you can't read the table below , click on it for a larger version
Let 's take the data for men .
The study makes a big point of saying that France is much better than the US , so we will use those two countries .
In 2003 , France has an " amenable disease " death rate 56 points lower than the US .
But we can see that almost this whole gap , or 42 points of it , comes from heart and circulatory diseases .
The incidence of these diseases are highly related to diet and lifestyle .
In fact , it is well established that the US has a comparatively high incidence rate of these diseases , much higher than France .
This makes it entirely possible that this mortality difference is entirely due to lifestyle differences and disease incidence rates rather than the relative merits of health care systems .
In fact , this study is close to meaningless .
If they really wanted to make a point about the quality of health care systems , they would compare them on relative mortality with a denominator of the disease incidence rate , not a denominator of total population .
But in their discussion , the study 's authors reveal themselves to be , if I am reading them right , complete idiots in terms of statistical methods .
The authors acknowledge that lifestyle differences may be a problem in their data .
This is how they say they solved this problem :
It is important to recognize that the development of any list of indicators of amenable mortality involves a degree of judgment , as a death from any cause is typically the final event in a complex chain of processes that include issues related to underlying social and economic factors , lifestyles , and preventive and curative health care .
As a consequence , interpretation of findings requires an understanding of the natural history and scope for prevention and treatment of the condition in question .
Thus , in the case of IHD , we find accumulating evidence that suggests that advances in health care have contributed to declining mortality from this condition in many countries , yet it is equally clear that large international differences in mortality predated the advent of effective health care , reflecting factors such as diet and rates of smoking and physical activity .
16
To account for this variation , we included only half of the mortality from IHD , although , based on the available evidence , figures between , say , 25 percent and 70 percent would be equally justifiable .
I have a very smart reader group , so my sense is that many of you already see the gaffe here .
The author 's posit that 50 % of heart disease may be due to lifestyle , though the number might be higher or lower .
So to correct for this , they reduce every country 's heart disease number ( IHD ) by a fixed amount of 50 % .
WTF ??
This corrects for NOTHING .
All this does is reduce the weighting of IHD in the total measure .
Look , if the problem is that lifestyle contribution to heart disease varies by country , then the percentage of IHD deaths that need to be removed because the deaths are lifestyle related will vary by country .
If the US has the " worst " lifestyle , and the number for lifestyle deaths is about 50 % there , it is going to be less than 50 % in every country .
The correction , if an accurate one could be created , needs to be applied to the variance between nations , not to the base numbers .
Careful multiple regressions might or might not have sorted the two sets of causes apart , but dividing by 50 % does n't do anything .
This mistake is not just wrong , it is LAUGHABLE , and calls into question the author 's qualification to say anything on this topic .
They may be fine doctors , but they do n't know squat about data analysis .
There may be nuggets of concern for the US lurking in this data .
I do n't know how they measure deaths from surgical conditions and medical errors , but its not good to be higher on this .
Though again , you have to be careful .
The US has far more surgeries than most other countries per capita , so we have more surgical deaths .
Also , medical error data is notoriously difficult to compare country to country because reporting standards and processes are so different .
In the US , when the government measures medical errors , it is a neutral third party to the error .
In Europe , the government , as healthcare provider , is often the source of the error , calling into question how aggressive these countries may be in defining " an error . "
Infant mortality data is a good example of such a trap .
The US often looks worse than European nations on infant mortality because it is defined as infant deaths as a percentage of live births .
But the US has the most advanced neo-natal capabilities in the world .
Many pregnancies that would result in a " born dead " in other countries result in a live birth in the US .
Since these rescued births are much more problematic , their death rate is much higher .
There is good news for the US in the study .
The item on this list most amenable to intensive medical intervention is cancer ( neoplasms in the study above ) .
In that category , despite a higher incidence rate than many of these countries , the US has one of the lowest mortality rates as a percentage of the total population , which implies that our cancer mortality in the US as a percentage of cancer incidence is much better than these countries .
This shows our much higher 5 - year cancer survival rates .
Update : I thought this was pretty clear , but some of the commenters are confused .
The halving of IHD numbers was applied to all countries , not just the US .
So the actual male US IHD number is about 100 before halving and the actual French number is about 40 .
Again , this halving only reduces the weighting of IHD in the total index ; it in no way corrects for differences in incidence rate .
The new strain can lead to blood poisoning A deadly strain of the superbug MRSA which can lead to a flesh - eating form of pneumonia has emerged .
Research suggests it may be more prevalent among the gay community - the gay San Francisco district of Castro appears to have been hardest hit .
So far only two cases of the new form of the USA300 strain of the bug have been recorded in the UK .
It is not usually contracted in hospitals , but in the community - often by casual contact .
We do know that the USA300 strain is extremely good at spreading between people through skin - to - skin contact
Professor Mark Enright
Imperial College
The new strain of MRSA - methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus - is resistant to treatment by many front - line antibiotics .
It causes large boils on the skin , and in severe cases can lead to fatal blood poisoning or necrotising pneumonia , which eats away at the lungs .
Researchers say the bug has so far been 13 times more prevalent in gay men in San Francisco than in other people .
In the Castro district - where more gay people live than anywhere else in the US - about one in 588 people are carrying the bug .
In the general San Francisco community the figure was around one in 3,800 .
Sex link Researcher Dr Binh Diep , from San Francisco General Hospital Medical Centre , said : " These multi - drug resistant infections often affect gay men at body sites in which skin - to - skin contact occurs during sexual activities .
MRSA EVOLUTION
The first MRSA strain , resistant to the penicillin substitute methicillin , was discovered in 1961 The USA300 strain was first isolated from a patient in 2001 - it is now the dominant form of Staphylococcus infection in the US
The latest variant of USA300 - FPR3757 - is resistant to six major kinds of antibiotics
Even the new variant is treatable with some antibiotics , most importantly vancomycin
However , doctors fear it is close to acquiring resistance to that drug as well " But because the bacteria can be spread by more casual contact , we are also very concerned about a potential spread of this strain into the general population . "
Dr Diep said the best way to avoid transmission was probably to wash thoroughly with soap and water , especially after sexual activities .
The study , reported in Annals of Internal Medicine , was based on a review of medical records from outpatient clinics and medical centres in San Francisco and Boston .
Professor Mark Enright , from Imperial College and St Mary 's Hospital , London , Britain 's leading authority on MRSA , said : " It 's quite surprising that the figures are so high .
" We do know that the USA300 strain is extremely good at spreading between people through skin - to - skin contact .
" The main reservoir for this infection is gay men , drug users , and those involved in contact sports , like wrestling .
Having lots of sexual partners and making skin contact with a large number of different people helps the infection to spread .
" In the US it is already moving into the wider community . "
Roger Pebody , of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " This is not the new HIV .
" What we are seeing is the emergence of an infection that can be passed on through close skin to skin contact , including sex .
" It is worrying that one in ten of the American cases are resistant to antibiotics , but most cases are treatable . "
Following media coverage of the story , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , which helped finance the study , issued a statement in which it stressed the gay men in which the new strain had been found were not representative of all gay men .
" Conclusions cannot be drawn about the prevalence of these strains among all men who have sex with men .
" The groups studied in this report may share other characteristics or behaviours that facilitate spread of MRSA , such as frequent skin - to - skin contact . "

What are these ?
A Democratic presidential campaign that has become increasingly acrimonious softened Saturday night as seven of the party ’s candidates took up issues considered important to African American and Latino voters .
The two - hour Brown & Black Forum was the second of two events on a wintry day in the Midwest that highlighted how close the major candidates are on many domestic policies , including immigration , poverty and healthcare .
But neither event appeared to open up any new ground for the presidential hopefuls in a state where Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina are locked in a virtual three - way tie with a month to go before the crucial Jan. 3 caucuses .
With the focus on domestic issues , the Iraq war -- which has dominated the campaign -- was barely mentioned in the debate that was broadcast over cable channel HDNet .
Advertisement
The war did n’t play a significant role until the second hour , when it provided the debate ’s only flash point .
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware brusquely dismissed a plan by Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio to replace U.S. troops in Iraq with an international peacekeeping force .
“ Who is going to possibly move in ?
This is ridiculous , ” Biden said .
Kucinich said it could be done by reaching out to the international community .
“ I have , ” Biden said .
Advertisement
“ No , you have n’t , ” Kucinich retorted as the two candidates talked over each other while one of the moderators , National Public Radio ’s Michele Norris , tried to interrupt .
Obama seemed to be the crowd favorite in the high school auditorium where the debate was held .
He elicited sustained cheers at several junctures , particularly after his closing comments that drew on the legacy of the civil rights movement .
“ I am standing here because somebody somewhere , at some point in time , stood up when it was risky , stood up when it was hard , stood up when it was n’t popular , ” Obama said .
“ We have to stand up on behalf of future generations , and if you . . . join me , I promise you we can change America . ”

The debate format allowed each candidate to pose one question to any of the other candidates .
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut sought to contrast Edwards ’ anti-poverty stance , a key part of his campaign , with his vote in the Senate for the 2001 Bankruptcy Reform Act that Dodd said “ drove a lot of working - class families into poverty . ”
“ I was wrong , and you were right , Chris , ” Edwards said , defusing what could have been a contentious exchange .
“ Any of us who voted for it were wrong . ”
Kucinich drew laughs when he asked himself a question : whether it was true that he was the only candidate at the forum proposing a universal , not - for - profit healthcare system to cover 46 million uninsured and 50 million under - insured Americans .
“ It is true , ” Kucinich said .
“ It ’s time that we see healthcare as a basic right in a democratic society , not a privilege based on ability to pay . ”

Clinton also drew laughs when she one - upped New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , the only governor running for the nomination , who asked her whether she thought a governor would make a good president -- a clear reference to her husband , former President Clinton , who remains a popular figure among African American voters .
“ Well , Bill , I think they also make good vice presidents , ” Clinton said , referring to speculation that Richardson , who is dragging in polls and fundraising , is angling to become the eventual nominee ’s running mate .
The Brown & Black Forum was the last scheduled televised debate here before the Iowa caucuses , and the seven major candidates were on hand despite a driving ice storm that closed the Des Moines airport until mid-afternoon after a plane skidded off a taxiway .
Biden , who drove in from Chicago , arrived about 45 minutes after the debate started .
The weather also delayed Clinton ’s arrival in Iowa by several hours , forcing her to phone in to the afternoon event , the Heartland Presidential Forum , where Obama , Edwards , Dodd and Kucinich all spoke in person .
Advertisement
Clinton was booed by some in the left - leaning audience -- the only candidate to get such a reception -- when she declined to pledge to push for immigration reform during her first 100 days in office , saying only that she would make it a “ high priority . ”
That was n’t good enough for Catherine Salgado of Chicago , a member of the Illinois Coalition for Immigration and Refugee Rights .
“ We need a commitment , ” Salgado said .
Jacqueline Herrera of Chicago , an immigration lawyer in the same group , said she believed Clinton had become less vocal about legalizing undocumented immigrants after the recent controversy over whether she supported granting illegal immigrants driver ’s licenses , a proposal she eventually came to oppose .
Advertisement
“ She ’s a chicken , ” Herrera said .
“ She ’s being very political about it .
She ’s not being straightforward . ”
The Heartland forum gave its warmest reception to Obama , who emphasized his post - college work as a Chicago community organizer .
“ This idea of community values is not just the cause of a campaign for me , ” Obama said .
“ It is the cause of my life . ”
Speaking to reporters after the forum , Dodd added his voice to earlier criticism by the Clinton campaign over Obama ’s plan to distribute 50,000 brochures urging students from Iowa who were away at college in nearby states to return home during the winter break to take part in the caucuses .
Advertisement
“ To recruit people here . . . does great damage to the process , ” Dodd said .
“ This is an Iowa process .
If it ’s going to be all of a sudden moving people all over the country to participate , you lose the credibility . ”
Obama spokesman Bill Burton dismissed the initial Clinton complaint , reported by Politico.com , as “ borne out of pure political frustration . ”
“ Iowans are determined to launch a winning candidate for the Democratic Party to bring real change for our country , ” Burton said .
“ They will not be deterred by efforts to dampen participation and 11th - hour attacks . ”
Edwards was the first to address the forum and pressed the anti-poverty theme central to his campaign by arguing that Americans ’ lack of healthcare , environmental destruction and other problems can be traced back to political domination by multinational corporations and special interests .
Advertisement
“ They have built a wall around Washington , and most of America is left outside that wall , ” Edwards said .
“ It is the reason the poor , the uninsured , the disabled , the disenfranchised voices are not being heard in Washington , D.C.
We ’re going to tear that wall down . ”

Times staff writer Aaron Zitner contributed to this report .
While retailers like Amazon and Wal - Mart are making slow and steady progress into the realm of DRM - free music sales and the MPAA has its sights set on filtering the web , the Songwriters Association of Canada ( SAC ) has proposed an entirely different plan for settling the war between consumers , pirates and big media studios .
Based on the observation that the thriving P2P market demonstrates consumers ' preference for sharing music instead of paying per-track or per-album , SAC proposes that each Internet - using Canadian citizen be charged a minimal $ 5 monthly fee directly by their ISPs .
This collective monthly license fee would then be split among artists and content owners , generating new revenues and allowing former pirates to sleep better at night now that they can legally trade music for a nominal fee .
At the core of SAC 's proposal is an amendment to Canada 's Copyright
Act that introduces a new right : The Right to Equitable Remuneration for Music File Sharing .
Since the proposal defines file - sharing as " the sharing of a copy of a copyrighted musical work without motive of financial gain , " this new right would exclude those who benefit from piracy , such as web site owners who show advertising in exchange for P2P links and torrent tracking .
The proposal also hopes to encompass all forms of not - for - profit sharing under the same legal umbrella , whether sharing is done via P2P , wireless networks , e-mail , CD trading , or exchanging hard drives .
The proposal excludes tracks obtained from music services like the iTunes Store and PureTracks , since these tracks are governed by their own licensing and value - added incentives .
This is by no means a new idea , in fact Canadian - based Barenaked Ladies has proposed a similar plan for some time .
This is perhaps the first time an organization as large as the Songwriters Association of Canada has gotten this serious about it , though .
In the US , the Register of Copyrights , Marybeth Peters , says industry executives are n't fond of the idea , claiming that a system like this would stifle innovation , but it might stand a chance in Canada .
The unveiling of Nokia 's Comes With Music plan casts doubt on Peters ' claims however , as it provides a one - year subscription to download unlimited music ( albeit with DRM ) from Universal Music Group ( and , if Nokia has its way , other labels ) for the estimated price of $ 5 per month .
For a marginally higher cost , this kind of subscription - like system applied at the ISP level for users who opt - in could motivate the other labels to hop on board , generating new revenues while simultaneously allowing consumers to obtain music via their preferred method .
Content filtering plans like the one proposed by MPAA head Dan Glickman could police consumers who opt out of the subscription model , keeping the system balanced .
If the Songwriters Association of Canada 's ISP subscription model gains any traction , though , the levies applied to blank media in Canada that pay Canadian artists might also need to be reexamined .
Whether $ 5 per month from a significant base of Canadian internet users would generate revenues to make all the labels happy and continue to fund creativity remains to be seen .
We contacted the Canadian Recording Industry Association for a response to the proposal , but did not immediately receive a reply .
70 % of the world ’s population live in oral cultures .
That means 5.7 billion people need to hear the Gospel in order to understand and accept it .
1 Billion still do not have access to God 's Word in a format that they can understand and engage with .
GREEN BAY , Wis. --
A boy who has n't stopped wearing his
Brett Favre jersey since Christmas four years ago has finally
attended his first Green Bay Packers game .
David Witthoft , 11 , of Ridgefield , Conn. , traveled with his
family to Lambeau Field to watch the Packers ' 34 - 13 victory over
the Detroit Lions on Sunday .
Witthoft admits he will probably soon have to hang up the
jersey , which he got for Christmas in 2003 .
" I thought I would keep wearing it as long as I could get it
over my head , " Witthoft told the Green Bay Press - Gazette after the
game .
" But I 'll probably take it off in the next year , certainly .
Then I 'll hang it up in a frame or maybe send it to the [ Packers ]
Hall of Fame . "
His mother , Carolyn , washes the jersey every two days and has
had to mend it .
House Speaker Pelosi just weighed in against US military action against Iran , but the PR push for a US attack on that country continues to gather steam ...
If I had bothered to label Freedom 's Watch an " extremist political group " that would have raised all sorts of problems , because that term might apply to an entire menagerie of organizations working to build up a PR climate conducive to a US military attack on Iran :
" Christians United Israel " , AIPAC , Focus On The Family , The Institute On Religion and Democracy , The Trinity Broadcasting Network , The DayStar Broadcasting Network , The Family Research Council ...
If I thought about it a bit , I 'm sure I could generate a list of dozens or more nationally known entities promoting the idea that the survival of both the United States and Israel depends on US military action against Iran .
But $ 200 million dollars [ note : that figure from NYT front page story on Freedom 's Watch referenced by Bill Berkowitz ] , the fund raising target of Freedom 's Watch , is nothing to sneeze at given the fact that that pot of money will be dedicated to promoting one goal :
A US attack on Iran or , to put it blackly , more - and better ( or worse , depending on one 's perspective ) - war in the Middle East .
Guess who is running the operation ?
Ari Fleischer , the man who helped sell the US invasion of Iraq .
***
Bill Berkowitz , one of my favorite journalists covering the religious - right , covers the genesis of Freedom 's Watch for Media Transparency , in a piece entitled Freedom 's Watch targeting Iran .
Here is Berkowitz 's lead in ( sans links ) :
If the U.S. undertakes military action against Iran , you can credit such longtime neoconservatives as Norman Podhoretz , William Kristol , Michael Ledeen and the swarm of ideologues buzzing about Washington 's right wing think tanks .
You can also credit Pastor John Hagee and his Christians United for Israel , a Christian Zionist outfit with unbending support for Israel .
And credit also the billionaire and multimillionaire founders of Freedom 's Watch for helping smooth the way ....
Later this month , Freedom 's Watch will sponsor a forum of some 20 experts on " radical Islam " that , according to a front page story in the New York Times , " is expected to make the case that Iran poses a direct threat to the security of the United States . "
The forum is being " organized with the American Enterprise Institute " [ note : link to new dKos post on AEI paper by Michael Ledeen claiming Iran was responsible for 9 - 11 ]
Berkowitz quotes PR Watch 's John Stauber on the new group 's top shelf PR managerial talent :
" It should be remembered that Freedom 's Watch is run by a White House PR flack [ Ari Fleischer ] who was key to selling that last war .
It is the same script , same images , same messages , and same players .
And it is likely to provoke the same response from the mainstream media . "
Freedom 's
Watch is no paper tiger .
The group already has run a $ 15 million dollar ad campaign to rally American public support for the Bush Administration 's ( now failed ) " Surge " in Iraq , and those ads features the same sort of shamelessly deceptive propagandistic TV ads that make a strong case for new legislation that would prevent nonprofit groups ( Freedom 's Watch is a 501 c ( 4 ) from promoting blatant lies ) ;
Freedom's Watch 's " pro-surge " TV ad showed a wounded American soldier who , commenting on a picture of one of the hijacked planes ready to strike on of the World Trade Center towers , states " They attacked us , and they will again .
They wo n't stop in Iraq . "
Berkowitz 's article also notes that Freedom 's Watch 's President , has likened Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad to Hitler .
First Came CUFI ....
We have previously seen , in the last year and a half , the advent of Pastor John Hagee 's " Christians United For Israel " , a 501 c ( 3 ) " non-lobbying " nonprofit that teaches its members to lobby their political representatives to support " pro-Israel " policies and also buses thousands of them each year , during the summer , to Washington DC for a conference , lobbying junket , and high profile " Night To Honor Israel " event .
CUFI has extensive high - level Washington connections ( see 1 , 2 , 3 .
Pastor John
Hagee blames the holocaust on Jews and CUFI board members have stated their expectation that another , perhaps even worse , immanent Holocaust will decimate the nation of Israel but John Hagee has built his career on noisy proclamations of love for Jews , and CUFI represents a strategic alliance between the Israeli and American Jewish hard right ( the sort who have founded Freedom 's Watch ) and American evangelicals who want to " force God 's hand " and provoke apocalyptic war in order to force the " Rapture " and Jesus ' Second Coming .
In theory , CUFI can politically mobilize tens of millions of American evangelical Christian zionists to lobby for war on Iran and , generally , policies to provoke expanded conflict in the Middle East ( one could also reasonably term CUFI a " Pro-Holocaust " lobby though the lobby would say the point is actually the " Rapture " ) .
Now , hot on the heels of CUFI , probably the first dedicated pro-war Christian political lobby in history , comes Freedom Watch , a propaganda powerhouse to whip up the proper magic pro-war support percentage among the American public ( 40 % , or whatever the Bush Administration deems to be the magic number ) that will allow American bombs and missiles to bring the miracle of American - style democracy to Tehran .
Senator John McCain , who could be found last April singing " Bomb Bomb Bomb , Bomb Bomb Iran " at a VFW hall appearance , stated about one year earlier , on " Meet The Press " , that a US attack on Iran could set off Armageddon .
This is one sad case study in the political and lobbying power of the Christian right and the apocalypse lobby - that a man such as John McCain who , in 2000 Presidential election GOP primary race , decried leaders of the Christian right as " agents of intolerance " , now openly associates with a group whose leaders have fantasized , in public , about the destruction of the Dome of Omar , 3rd holiest site in Islam .
We 'll never know what went through John McCain 's head as he went in roughly 6 years from slamming to embracing the Christian right , but it would be fair to say he thought his shift to be expedient
That 's a quick case study in the political heft of the Christian right , and now - augmenting the equation , we have a dedicated pro-war advertising ( propagandizing actually ) powerhouse that can dump money - quite a lot of it - into upcoming political races to unseat insufficiently pro-war politicians .
What CUFI seeks to do that via direct lobbying by its membership , Freedom 's Watch will seek to do with absurdly dishonest TV ads .
Given the group 's shameless disregard for facts , let 's hope history sees " Freedom Watch " flushed down the same hole as " Freedom Fries " .
As a postscript ;
Sometimes it can be quite hard to separate the apocalyptic Christian zionists associated with CUFI from the ' secular ' NeoConservative crowd .
Take Michael Ledeen , now with the American Enterprise Institute , who just published a paper alleging that Iran was responsible for the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks ( linked previously in this post ) .
" One can only hope that we turn the region [ the Middle East ] into a cauldron [ of war ] , and faster , please .
If ever there were a region that richly deserved being cauldronized , it is the Middle East today . "

" God willing , Judgment Day is coming to the Middle East . "

New laws for 2008 — inspired by some hot - button issues of 2007 — take effect this week , including an airline passenger bill of rights , mortgage restrictions , environmental safeguards , illegal - immigration constraints and bans on the risky uses of technology while driving .
The National Conference of State Legislatures says 31 states unveiled new laws Tuesday .
Among the most common decrees are hikes in the minimum wage in 14 states .
Among the more unusual changes : American flags sold in Minnesota must be made in the USA , shoes and sportswear fashioned from Kangaroo hides can be imported into California , and anyone selling a Texas home must disclose whether it was once a methamphetamine factory .
The nightmare of being trapped in a JetBlue aircraft for up to 10 hours spawned New York 's passenger bill of rights , which passed unanimously .
The law comes on the heels of a number of delays last winter at John F. Kennedy International Airport that left some passengers stranded on the tarmac for hours .
New York state Sen. Charles Fuschillo , a Long Island Republican who co-sponsored the bill , said Tuesday that other states are showing an interest in similar action .
" I hope this wakes up people two ways , " Fuschillo says .
" ( I hope it ) wakes up the airline industry that they have to treat customers better and wakes up Congress that this should be done on a national level . "
Under the law , airlines must provide fresh food , water , air and clean restrooms for passengers on any aircraft stuck on a tarmac for more than three hours .
Other issues and the laws they triggered : • The nation 's mortgage crisis means lenders in California and Colorado must now do a better job of evaluating a borrower 's ability to repay the loan .
Colorado is also giving delinquent borrowers several more months to get caught up .
New York is requiring a criminal background check for loan officers .
• Environmental and consumer concerns led Illinois to mandate energy - efficient light bulbs in buildings larger than 1,000 square feet and Minnesota to ban mercury in everything from new stoves and barometers to over - the - counter pharmaceuticals , cosmetics and toiletries .
Connecticut is expanding a tax break for fuel - efficient cars .
• Worries about illegal immigration spawned a tough Arizona law that strips a business of its license for knowingly hiring undocumented workers .
•
Same - sex unions are now extended to couples in New Hampshire , and Oregon has new domestic partnership procedures for same - sex couples .
More states are curbing smoking and limiting new technology .
Illinois is banning smoking in public areas , and California is making it illegal to smoke in a car if a minor is inside .
Drivers younger than 18 cannot use a cellphone in Oregon .
And in Washington , text messaging behind the wheel is now illegal .
" Any distraction is a bad distraction , but texting in particular , " says Bob Calkins , a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol .
" Nobody is that good a driver that they can have their eyes down looking at a PDA and not looking at the road . "

Can you hear me now , Justice Thomas ? »
Can hear me now , bitch ?
I mentioned this story in a Daily Memo last week , but it really deserves a full - blown entry .
So last Tuesday , Judge Robert Restaino was removed from the bench because of a bit of an outburst .
Back in 2005 , Judge Restaino was hearing a domestic violence case when someone ’s cell phone went off .
And the judge simply went off the rails :
Everyone is going to jail .
Every single person is going to jail in this courtroom unless I get that instrument now .
If anybody believes I ’m kidding , ask some of the folks that have been here for a while .
You are all going .
And sure enough , when nobody fessed up , the judge had all 46 people taken into custody and tossed into the city jail .
Most posted bail , but the fourteen who could n’t were shackled and bussed off to the county jail .
It did n’t take long for word of this story to get out , and after the press started calling later in the afternoon , Judge Restaino ordered everyone released .
So as I mentioned , he was removed from the bench last Tuesday , with the chairman of the New York Commission on Judicial Conduct writing that Restaino had “ engaged in what can only be described as two hours of inexplicable madness . ”
Unsurprisingly , Restaino is n’t taking this lightly , now saying that he ’s planning to appeal the decision to the state Court of Appeals .
His lawyer says that Restaino “ deeply regrets and sincerely apologizes ” for his little outburst .
He says that the snap was because of stress going on in his personal life and , apparently , that means all should be forgiven .
Sorry dude , I ai n’t buying it .
As the Commission said , your conduct brought irreparable harm to the public perception of the bench and the public ’s confidence in you .
“ Sorry — home life has been rough ” does n’t really cut it .
We ’ve all got problems .
We ’ve all got stress .
But you ’re the only asshat who threw 46 people in the clink for no good reason .
Please do us all a favor and bow out graciously .

Researchers from the [ California ] State Public Health Department found that the
autism rate in children rose continuously in the study period from 1995
to 2007 .
The preservative , thimerosal , has not been used in childhood
vaccines since 2001 , except for some flu shots .
Doctors
said that the latest study added to the evidence against a link between
thimerosal exposure and the risk of autism and that it should reassure
parents that vaccinations do not cause autism .
If there was a risk , the doctors said , autism rates should have dropped from 2004 to 2007 .

While it might look unusual , the frame pictured above weighs just 2.75 pounds and is as strong as any other frame on the market .
The IsoTruss technology actually uses a series of small pyramid shaped structures that are all connected together to form a tube .
The pyramids are made of hand woven strands of carbon fiber that are bundled together and wrapped in Kevlar .
All in all , each bike frame includes 1,672 feet of carbon fiber and takes about 300 hours to build .
As a result Delta 7 Sports only plans to produce about 200 of these frames in 2008 .
A complete Arantix mountain bike starts at $ 11,995 , but you can also order just the IsoTruss carbon composite frame for $ 6,995 .

Today , The Pirate Bay reached another milestone , as they broke the 1 million torrents and 10 million peers barrier .
The largest BitTorrent tracker just keeps growing and growing , and there is no sign that this will be put to a halt soon .
Last month we reported that The Pirate Bay had doubled the number of torrents and peers on their tracker in 2007 .
Brokep , one of the co-founders of the popular BitTorrent tracker told us at the time that he expected the tracker to hit 10 million peers during the next big holiday .
It turns out that they did n’t even need a holiday , because the number of peers jumped from 8 million to 10 million in little over a month .
The Bay now now tracks over a million torrents and 10 million peers at any given point in time .
Brokep told TorrentFreak that the statistics reported on the frontpage may fluctuate a bit because one of the trackers is too loaded to report its share .
However , he assured us that The Pirate Bay indeed tracks over 10 million peers , and more than a million torrents .
In order to keep up with the continuous growth , The Pirate Bay has been upgrading hardware over the past few months .
In addition , they moved from Anakata ’s Hypercube to the open source Opentracker software , to improve the performance of their trackers .
These certainly are exciting times for The Pirate Bay crew .
Next week , prosecutor HÃ¥kan Roswall will press charges against 5 people involved with The Pirate Bay , based on the 4000 pages of evidence the authorities have collected .
We will of course be watching this closely .
The Pirate Bay crew are convinced that they have n’t done anything wrong , and said that – no matter what the outcome will be – the site will stay up .

Eureka High Arctic Weather Station , Canada
The researchers had to work fast in case the weather closed in
The scientists at work
Some 16 km long and 5 km wide ( 10x3 miles ) , Ayles Ice Island broke away from the Canadian Arctic coast in 2005 , but has only recently been identified .
Researchers have now landed on the giant berg with a BBC team and planted a tracking beacon on its surface .
This will allow the island 's progress to be monitored as currents push it around the Arctic Ocean .
The team wants to know why this Ice Island formed
Tracking the island
Its current location is about 600 km ( 400 miles ) from the North Pole , in what is one of the fastest warming regions on Earth .
We approached the island in a small plane .
From the air , the vast expanse of white stood out as unusually smooth compared with the much rougher sea ice that forms and thaws with the changing seasons .
The island 's surface was judged safe enough to land on - our plane was fitted with skis - and after a bumpy touchdown we ground to a halt , the first expedition of its kind .
Soon the scientists were at work - time was limited with the risk of the weather changing .
Recent satellite images show the island free of the coast
More details
Then he and Dr Luke Copland , of the University of Ottawa , carried out a series of measurements using a ground - penetrating radar .
They found that the average of thickness of the ice was 42 - 45 m ( 138-148ft ) - the equivalent of the height of a 10 - storey building .
This was slightly thicker than expected .
One implication is that the island is may prove even more durable than predicted - the sheer weight of ice estimated at two billion tonnes may take longer to melt than initially thought .
From above , the island appears flat against the jagged sea ice
" This shows how climate change can trigger very sudden changes even on a massive scale - when the ice shelf broke away , the rupture registered with the force of a small earthquake , " he said .
The records show that this region of the Arctic - the northern coast of Ellesmere Island - has lost 90 % of its ice shelves in the past century .
Much of this occurred during the warmer period of the 1940s but then in the cooler decades that followed , some of the ice shelves showed signs of reforming .
According to Dr Mueller , " the difference now is that with the current rate of warming , those ice shelves are likely never to be reconstituted " .
The BBC team sets up on Ayles Ice Island

Before we left , the scientists planted a satellite tracking beacon - because if the island continues to drift to the west , it could threaten the oil and gas installations off Alaska .

So this is the Republican party .
Corrupt :
In 2002 Weller made his first official congressional trip to Nicaragua .
Before the year was over , he had bought his first lot and eventually began looking for land he could subdivide into parcels that would attract buyers looking for prime ocean - view property at a relatively low price .
It is an unusual investment for a member of Congress , and Weller 's foreign land holdings seem far more extensive than any other House member's .
His investment got a boost from the narrowly passed Central America Free Trade Agreement , which Weller pitched in 2005 as a tool to enable businesses in his hard - pressed district to sell tractors and food to Latin America .
CAFTA also includes additional legal protection for American investors , including those who have purchased lots from Weller .
What he did n't say was that , while he publicly pushed CAFTA , Weller privately was pursuing his land development , some 2,000 miles away .
The House approved the trade pact in July 2005 by only two votes , 217-215 .
Besides not mentioning his Nicaraguan investments during the CAFTA debate on the House floor , Weller did not give anywhere close to a complete accounting of them in his required 2005 financial disclosure statement .
House ethics rules require representatives to disclose all property they own except for their personal residences .
- Chicago Tribune
( And in hiding - Weller missed a week of votes during the period he was avoiding comment on the story . )
Corrupt and defiant :
California Rep. John Doolittle 's defiant pronouncement that he will seek re-election to the House in 2008 has to send shivers down the spines of savvy Republican strategists .
For months , political operatives have been acting as though Doolittle 's retirement is a foregone conclusion due to a series of ethics questions that continue to dog him .
( Oh , please , let him try to run again .
That would be such a gift for Charlie Brown , and by extension a gift for all of us . )
And divided :
The frustrated response from Simpson , a longtime ally of House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , also rekindles the embers of House - Senate tension that at times plagued Republicans during their time in the majority .
" If that ’s how they treat their own , " [ ID - 02 Republican Representative ]
Simpson said , referring to Senate GOP leaders ’ quick push for Craig to resign , " that tells me they ’re more interested in party than individuals , and the party is made up of individuals .
How you treat them says a lot about your party . "
Simpson pointed a finger at Craig ’s leaders for staying mum on the legal and personal jeopardy facing other GOP senators , including Alaskan Ted Stevens , now under federal investigations , and Louisianan David Vitter , who has admitted contacting an escort service .
" They have people over there [ in the Senate Republican Conference ] in far worse trouble that they have n’t said a thing about , " Simpson said .
Even Republicans are starting to realize that Republican leadership is comprised of not -very - nice people , and has a hypocrisy problem .
I wish the Democrats were holding stronger on Iraq , but it 's no small thing to have the Republicans falling apart .
What the Frontpage of Reddit Does To A New Blog In 24 Hours
I decided to add my post on not checking your email first or last thing to Reddit almost exactly 24 hours ago .
Since then , I ’ve had the honor of being on the Reddit frontpage for all but one of those blissful hours , and has just recently been knocked from the frontpage .
I have recieved huge amounts of traffic in a short period of time , as well as many subscribers to my feed .
This could be very interesting to a lot of people because my blog is so new .
That post was only my 4th on this blog , and I had almost no traffic whatsoever .
All of the visits I ’ve recieved in the past 24 hours are virtually all from Reddit .
So consider this a case study on how much traffic you can recieve if your blog is on the frontpage of Reddit for 24 hours .
Reddit Stats
The highest I ever saw the post ever get to was 7th .
It hung out in the top 10 for at least 7 - 8 hours .
( I ’m not sure on some of this because I had to get some sleep ) .
The article has gotten 171 points , and has had 21 comments .
I had a puny link karma of 2 before submitting this piece , and now that the smoke is clearing , it ’s up at 46 .
Although I ’m not entirely clear on what Karma does , I think it should help with posting new articles down the road .
Raw Traffic
I use Performancing Metrics to handle my blog analytics .
It ’s really robust and easy to set up , not to mention it ’s free .
I was able to break down my traffic statistics by the hour .
To this point I ’ve recieved at least 7,980 total visits from Reddit .
The highest point of the day was around 3 pm ( US Central Time ) , with almost 900 visits within the hour .
This was right around the time my post had climbed up into the top 10 .
Geography
The geographics of the users sent to me are pretty interesting too .
64 % of the users were from the US , 8 % from Canada , 7 % from the UK , 3 % from the Down Under and 2 % from Germany .
And I have no clue where 17 % of the visitors are from .
Browsers
I am all about Firefox , so it was refreshing to see that 58 % used it at Reddit .
16 % used IE , 6 % Safari and 19 % used something else .
Interestingly enough , hardly anyone used a resolution under 1024 ×768 .
Subscription Stats
Before Reddit I had no users signed up for LifeDev ’s feed .
I woke up this morning , and I kid you not , had 217 people subscribed to it .
And that was just in about an 13 hour time period .
I think I ’ll put one of those little ego buttons on my site that shows how many people are subscribed .
Look out TechCrunch !
As far as my email subscription goes , only 2 people signed up for my newsletter .
But who cares ?
I ’m still stoked about the feed subscription numbers ;)
Bookmarks , Technorati , etc .
I now have 18 people who favorited the story at Del.icio.us , and 7 more who favorited LifeDev.net .
Technorati tells me that I ’ve gotten 8 links from around the net , and it has sent my traffic rank down to 478,084 .
One of those links come from the infamous Jeremy Zawodny and his link blog .
Just for grins , at about 4 pm ( US Central time ) , I registered my blog at BlogTopSites.com , under the personal category .
Of about 8,000 blogs , mine shot up to 4th this morning .
Adsense and Amazon
Because I ca n’t give exact amounts of earnings due to Adsense ’s TOS , all I can tell you that I made well under $ 5 .
Interestingly enough , I sent 14 clicks out to the book I quoted at Amazon , and 2 people bought it .
That ’s some pretty good CTR .
Conclusions
Well , it ’s pretty obvious that the traffic from Reddit has done wonders for my readership , especially the feed readership .
Apparently Reddit users are n’t interested in ads , but will click and buy a recommended book .
Because the Reddit crowd is techy and informed , they probably have a little banner blindness .
That ’s ok .
Feed readership is most important to any blog that ’s just starting .
And mine certainly skyrocketed from a single front page posting at Reddit .
Do you have a great idea for a mobile app ?
That ’s great but how do you turn an idea into a profitable business ?
Mobile apps are a different beast compared to other commodities .
They ’re intangible and entirely digital services , whether you look at mobile games or business apps .
But do n’t fret , we ’ll guide you through the process .
We ’re going to show you how to make money from mobile apps .
First , let ’s dive into the big numbers and see how much other people make in this kind of business :
The Big Numbers
Take a look at the top 200 earning apps on the market .
They earn about $ 82,500 per day .
Even those far from the top still earn about $ 3,000 or more daily and gaming apps reign supreme .
Mobile apps are big money - makers and it ’s no surprise people want to jump on the bandwagon .
After all , most people are on their phones anyway .
That ’s where the market is so why not pour your attention there ?
That said , there ’s a lot of junk on Google Play and the Apple App Store too .
How can you separate your app from theirs ?
Can you master how to make money from mobile apps and stand out from the competition ?
How to Make Money From Mobile Apps ?
The answer to that question is a definitive yes .
There is a multitude of ways to earn and almost all of them involve free apps .
Yes , the biggest earners are the ones people do n’t have to outright buy .
Do n’t worry , we ’ll still tackle the traditional method of selling apps online .
However , the five other ways to make money assume you ’re giving these apps for free .
After all , most of the top - grossing apps in both stores are free to download .
Let ’s dive into how these free apps make so much :
1. In - App Purchases
The first method is through in - app purchases .
Sure , you can play a game for free but would n’t it be nice to unlock a cool costume or a nostalgic character people love ?
Sell those for small amounts , like $ 1.99 , and people will latch onto them and purchase them without a second thought .
Why does this work ?
Downloading for free already eliminates tons of stress from the user .
Offering something for a small amount will look like a good deal since they did n’t have to pay $ 9.99 or more for the actual app .
For you , the developer and publisher , all those little purchases add up .
Offer more of these and people can get addicted to these small transactions .
2. Advertising Premium
Another option is a little scummy but it does work .
You can monetize your app with ads .
These ads will pay you simply for giving them space to appear and play on your app .
This is primarily how content creators on YouTube earn .
They create content , upload it for free on YouTube , and then earn through the ads that play during their video .
Use this same strategy with mobile apps .
You can also offer a premium to remove ads entirely .
People can subscribe for a month , six months , or a year and never have to see these ads again .
3. Lootboxes
Who has n’t heard of Fortnite ?
It ’s one of the biggest games in the world and it ’s also available on mobile devices .
The biggest shock is the fact that it ’s 100 % free .
How does it earn billions of dollars per year then ?
It does so through loot boxes and digital currency .
The latter falls under the previously discussed category of in - app purchases .
You can use real - world cash to buy V - bucks , the in - game currency , and then use V - bucks to purchase costumes or other aesthetics .
Lootboxes , however , work a bit like slot machines .
People purchase them but the contents are always random .
Players can get the costume they want or an item they like or it might be something else .
There ’s a lot of controversy surrounding loot boxes nowadays .
Many companies , including the developers of Fortnite , are working around these legal issues by adjusting the rewards of their loot boxes .
Some apps show the content of a loot box before people purchase while others increase the percentage of nabbing a rare or very special item .
4. Freemium Model
Ever played Super Mario Run ?
It ’s one of Nintendo ’s first mobile apps .
The game allows people to play the first set of stages for free but the rest of the app remains locked until people make a one - time transaction to purchase the rest .
This freemium model can work for you too .
Allow people to download the app for free and try out the most basic features .
If you offer a document app , for example , let people use to create documents but only when online .
To fully enjoy all the document features offline , they ’ll need to pay .
5. Subscriptions
Do you have a Netflix account ?
How about an account on Hulu or Disney Plus ?
There are so many different streaming apps nowadays and they all have one thing in common : they ’re free to download but the content is n’t free to access .
You can download the apps and check out the shows without paying a cent .
However , to watch any of the shows on these apps , you need to pay a monthly subscription .
This model might work for your mobile apps too .
This is n’t restricted to streaming networks either !
Big online games , particularly MMORPGs like World of Warcraft , follow this model as well .
6. Paid Apps
Last , but certainly not least , is the route of selling apps for a one - time fee .
Offer the app on Google Play or the App Store for a fixed amount .
People wo n’t be able to download and use it until they pay .
This is the most traditional route but it still works for some companies .
Keep in mind , however , that a one - and - done paid app could become victim to piracy .
People who hack their phones and tablets could get a free installer of your app and use it without ever paying you .

Unfortunately the unflattering comparison between us and them does not end with different levels of excitement .
They outperform us in another , less likely area .
On Monday , Barack Obama called for a truce in what is fast becoming a Democratic civil war on America 's most radioactive topic : race .
He and Hillary Clinton have been slugging it out over a series of remarks that make clear that - for all the optimistic talk after Obama 's victory in Iowa - America 's racial divisions remain live and open .
It began with Hillary 's insistence in New Hampshire that deeds , not words matter .
Martin Luther
King made some fine speeches , she said , but there would have been no civil rights revolution had it not been for legislation driven by Lyndon Johnson .
" It took a president to get it done , " she said .
That offended plenty of African - Americans , who felt Hillary was downplaying the role of an American patron saint .
Some detected a nastier subtext , implying that while black folks might do rousing oratory , it 's the white boss who makes the rules .
To make matters worse , Bill Clinton launched a finger - wagging rant against Obama , culminating in a declaration that this is " the biggest fairytale I 've ever seen " .
This line was surely directed at Obama 's position on the Iraq war , but many saw it as a sweeping condemnation of the Obama candidacy , as if the very notion of a black president is fanciful .
Clinton 's assorted outriders have not helped matters .
New York attorney - general Andrew Cuomo ( Mario 's son ) said that the early primary contests were tough , because you had to face the voters directly : " You ca n't shuck and jive at a press conference . "
That " shuck and jive " dates back to the 1870s and , says the dictionary , was an " originally southern ' Negro ' expression for clowning , lying , pretence " .
There 's been further controversy about a line from my column last week quoting a senior Clinton adviser who told me that Obama appealed to those voters , especially the young , who wanted an " imaginary hip black friend " .
( I 've been bombarded by pro-Obama emailers demanding I reveal my source . )
Add to that the various Clinton surrogates who have brought up Obama 's past - and openly admitted - drug use , and the Obama camp 's charge that the Clintons are pandering to white voters , and you 've got yourself an old - fashioned American race row .
Last night , the candidates were due to meet in Las Vegas for a debate billed as a fight on " black and brown " issues .
None of this has been edifying , and many American commentators , coming down from their post - Iowa high , have lamented that race can still play such a toxic role in their politics .
Democrats are particularly worried that what should be a great moment for the party - choosing between a woman and an African - American - will turn instead into a feud so bitter that it tears the Democratic coalition apart , wounding the eventual winner perhaps mortally .
And yet , viewed from here , there is some consolation Americans can take .
Put simply : at least they care about this stuff .
We can not quite say the same .
The closest we Britons will get to a presidential contest will come in London 's mayoral election in May .
Up for grabs will be the largest individual mandate in western Europe outside the presidencies of France and Portugal .
Chasing it is a trio of standout personalities : the incumbent Ken Livingstone , Tory columnist Boris Johnson , and the former policeman Brian Paddick .
Now imagine , just for a second , that this battle was being fought in the US .
Then imagine that this weekend had brought confirmation , from one of the candidate 's own allies , that he had described black people as " piccaninnies " .
And not just once , in a published article , but in conversation .
In Africa .
In fact you do n't have to imagine it .
This week Boris pal Rod Liddle confirmed once more that Johnson , bored during a past trip to the Kenyan - Ugandan border , said to their Swedish Unicef hosts and their black driver : " Come on , let 's get out and see some piccaninnies . "
Johnson has also written of the " watermelon smiles " of African men and mourned that Nelson Mandela had merely replaced the minority tyranny of white rule with the " majority tyranny of black rule " .
In 2002 he wrote in the Spectator of that trip to Africa : " The problem is not that we were once in charge , but that we are not in charge any more ... the British planted coffee and cotton and tobacco , and they were broadly right ...
If left to their own devices , the natives would rely on nothing but the instant carbohydrate gratification of the plantain . "
Johnson has a variety of defences for this long - written record .
He usually falls back on that politicians ' standby , that his words were taken out of context ; but read the full articles and , if anything , they sound even worse .
Sometimes he mentions that he is one - eighth Turkish , as if that fragment of DNA inoculates him against all prejudice .
Or his allies harrumph that this is political correctness gone mad and that it 's Boris 's daring to offend that has made him such a compelling read .
I do n't argue with that last assertion : the trouble is , Boris Johnson is not competing for a trophy in the British Press Awards , but to lead the most diverse city on the planet .
The rules of this game are different .
Mainly , though , Boris does n't like answering these charges at all .
I have spoken to him once since he declared his candidacy , when he strode over to me at a party late last year , insisted that I stop spreading " poison " about his record , and told me I was " full of shit " .
Again , it 's worthwhile imagining how this would play in America .
What if Michael Bloomberg had spoken that way as he campaigned to be the mayor of New York ?
What if a white candidate for high office had spoken of " piccaninnies " and had lamented that whites were no longer ruling Africa ?
Do we think he would have survived for five minutes ?
In America we now know that even to compare a black candidate to Martin Luther King , done in the wrong way , can bring trouble .
Yet here a white politician can have casually dabbled in the ugliest stereotypes and not even face censure .
The black press and luminaries , including Lord Ouseley and Doreen Lawrence , have spoken out , but the bulk of the media ignore them completely .
( Channel 4 is soon to give an hour to a Dispatches critique of Livingstone , with no equal scrutiny of Johnson . )
The media prefers to indulge good old loveable Boris .
No one , I know , can seriously envy America 's discourse on race .
The question has crippled the country since its founding .
Its history is tortured .
And yet at least America takes note of the feelings of its non-white citizens .
Here in London , a place more diverse than Iowa , New Hampshire , or even the United States itself , most of us hardly seem to care .

The i-LIDS library is a UK government initiative to facilitate the development and evaluation of vision based detection systems ( VBDS ) which meet Government requirements .
The library is currently in development and is sceduled for release in 2006 .
Sample videos are available from the project on request ( Quicktime MJPEG format on DVD ) , while the final version will be available for purchase on 500 GB hard disks .
ILIDS is produced by the Home Office Scientific Development Branch ( HOSDB ) with Security Service funding and consists of real CCTV footage based initially on four different scenarios :
Parked vehicles Abandoned baggage Sterile Zone Doorway surveillance
Within each scenario , certain ‘ alarm events ’ are defined – for example , the presence of a parked vehicle in a defined zone for more than sixty seconds .
VBDS are required to report an alarm when any of these events occur in the footage , with minimal false alarm reports .
The footage from each scenario is split into three ‘ datasets ’ , two of which will be made available to VBDS manufacturers and academics to assist the development of suitable systems .
The remaining dataset will be retained by HOSDB and used to certify the detection and false - alarm performance of systems submitted to them for evaluation .
Systems will be selected for inclusion in a catalogue of security equipment used for procurement in the Government estate on the basis of regular trials .
Forget Sudoku , crossword puzzles and computer games .
If you really want to train your brain , then eat dark chocolate , have plenty of sex and follow the Scandinavian example of having cold meat for breakfast .
The growing numbers of people who are trying to strengthen their mental ability through ' brain training ' should also avoid cannabis , watching soap operas , hanging out with serial complainers or pursuing fat - free diets , according to a new book on getting ' brain - fit ' .
Many of the suggestions in Teach Yourself Training Your Brain are surprising , such as cuddling a baby , cheating at school , reading out loud and doing your university degree in business studies .
Co-authors Terry Horne and Simon Wootton say their recommendations are based on and backed by the latest research by leading experts around the world .
' For decades we have thought that the cognitive capacity of our brains is genetically determined , whereas it's now clear that it 's a lifestyle choice .
What we eat and drink , how we learn at school and what type of moods we have are all crucial , ' said Horne , a business lecturer at the University of Central Lancaster and an authority on thinking and learning .
' People can make lifestyle choices that will not only prevent what used to be seen as an inevitable decline in cognitive [ ability ] after the age of 17 - something that IQ tests seemed to bear out - but will constantly increase our cognitive capacity throughout our adult lives .
Our far - reaching suggestions will empower people to develop their cognitive capacity or just let it decline . '
The book details the most up - to - date thinking in science about how diet , the environment , stress and other aspects of modern life affect our mental capacity and distils them in the form of chunks of advice as well as exercises .
It also points out that of the seven different chemical reactions that the brain undergoes in the sexual process , from contemplating intercourse to achieving orgasm , four help the thinking process .
The ensuing increase in levels of the ' trust ' hormone , oxytocin , for example , increases readiness to think of novel or risky solutions .
Similarly , the post - coital rise in serotonin levels aids both creative thinking and calm , logical decision - making .
The authors praise the plethora of useful elements in dark chocolate , such as magnesium and antioxidant flavonols , which benefit everything from the supply of oxygen to the brain to the reduction of the chances of brain damage through a stroke .
The book comes as more and more Britons are spending increasing sums on a fast - expanding market in books , DVDs , subscription websites and computer games which claim to supercharge people 's memory to improve their performance at work , enhance their brain 's ability to store information and ward off the effects of dementia .
Nintendo's Brain
Age electronic brain training game , which includes memory , number and intelligence tests , has sold 10 million copies globally .
In the United States , some insurance companies have begun giving older clients computer software programmes featuring such exercises to encourage them to stay as mentally sharp as possible .
And some nursing homes there have set up ' brain gyms ' for the same purpose .
Horne believes that many Britons need to make dramatic changes to their lifestyles to increase their cognitive capacity because of the switch to a ' knowledge economy ' from one based on manual labour , and because of the fast - expanding number of over - 65 s .
Happiness , confidence and an optimistic nature help the brain , he added .
' So mix with people who make you laugh , have a good sense of humour or who share the same interests as you , and avoid people who whinge , whine and complain , as people who are negative will make you depressed , which means you wo n't achieve things , ' said Horne .
The book recommends that , instead of trying to find perfect happiness , people should instead seek a new concept the authors have called BLISS , which involves Body - based pleasure , Laughter , Involvement , Satisfaction and Sex , all of which enable the brain to think well .
Most people use only three to four per cent of their total supply of brain cells .
But research among undergraduates has shown that those following the book 's advice can experience a big enough increase in cognitive fitness to make the difference between getting a top job and a merely average one , said Horne .
Is this the recipe for a sharp mind ?
Cheating
Children should not do homework on their own .
Their minds will function better if they have help from parents or work with classmates .
Eating the right food
Have eggs , fish or cold meat at breakfast .
Stick to protein - based foods at lunchtime such as oily fish with dark green vegetables .
Avoid bread , pasta or pizza and drink tea , ideally green or herbal , not coffee .
Snack on nuts , not biscuits or other sweet things .
Ideally , eat carbohydrates in the evenings only .
Avoid caffeine , alcohol and red meat .
Speaking aloud
The old practice of getting pupils to speak in front of their class helps the brain because of the repetition involved .
Adults can boost their memory by counting aloud to 99 in threes as fast as they can .
Presidential candidates diverge on U.S. joining war crimes court U.S. 's global duty defined in presidential hopefuls ' opinions
The International Criminal Court is n't discussed much in the presidential campaign , but few issues are more revealing of a candidate 's perspective on the United States ' legal and political relations with the rest of the world .
The court was established in 2002 to deal with cases of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
Headquartered in the Dutch city of The Hague , it was conceived as a permanent successor to the Nuremberg tribunals formed to try Nazi leaders after World War II .
It now has 105 members , including virtually all current U.S. allies , but not the United States itself .
President Bush has attacked the court relentlessly , saying it could subject Americans to politically motivated prosecutions abroad .
He has renounced the 1998 treaty that created the court , pressed other nations to disregard it , and signed legislation - nicknamed the " Hague Invasion Act " by critics - authorizing military action to free any citizen of the United States or an allied nation held for trial by the court .
Republican presidential candidates generally share Bush 's view , while Democratic candidates largely reject it .
But there are differences among candidates within each party .
Unlike the rest of the Republican field , Sen . John McCain has said he would like to see the United States join the international court , although he would first require more protections for U.S. personnel .
Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama have taken similar wait - and - see positions , while most of the other Democratic hopefuls have called for full U.S. membership .
The presidential candidates also took differing positions in the only congressional vote on the issue , the 2002 legislation allowing military action to free prisoners at The Hague .
Clinton and McCain voted for the bill , as did then - Sen .
John Edwards - who now favors U.S. membership in the court - and Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter of Alpine ( San Diego County ) .
Three other Democrats , Rep. Dennis Kucinich and Sens. Joseph Biden and Chris Dodd , voted against the measure .
The other candidates were n't in Congress at the time .
Two international law scholars say the candidates ' positions are illuminating because the disagreements over the court represent some of the most critical foreign - policy questions in the post - Cold War world - U.S. autonomy and its limits , the role of international law and the multinational bodies that enforce it , and the balance between power and accountability .
" The court can be seen as a bellwether of their approach to the rule of law and international institutions , " said Michael Scharf , a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland .
As a State Department official during the administrations of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton , Scharf was responsible for issues related to the court as it was being created .
A second legal analyst , Jose Alvarez , said the candidates " are using ( the court ) to say something about where they think the U.S. should be in the future with respect to multilateral regimes , " and issues such as unratified treaties on land mines and global warming and relations with the United Nations .
Alvarez is a Columbia University law professor and president of the American Society of International Law .
Candidates who favor U.S. membership or increased cooperation with the court , he said , are saying " we think multilateral cooperation still matters , " while opponents regard such institutions as an " infringement on our national sovereignty . "
The court , with 18 judges from member nations , has the power to try individuals for war crimes , crimes against humanity or genocide committed by citizens of member nations , or by others - including Americans - within those nations ' borders .
Crimes committed elsewhere can also be prosecuted with the approval of the U.N. Security Council , where the United States has veto power .
The court is required to give a nation 's own legal system the first chance to investigate and prosecute a case and will step in only when it concludes the nation is not making a good - faith effort to hold anyone accountable .
So far , it has issued arrest warrants in only three cases , from Uganda , the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan .
Though the United States took part in negotiations that led to the 1998 treaty , President Clinton did not sign the treaty until the final days of his administration in 2000 and never submitted it to the Senate for a ratification vote on membership .
When the court came into being in 2002 , Bush ordered the treaty " unsigned " - an unprecedented action for any nation , according to Scharf - and worked to insulate the United States .
Threatening cutoffs of U.S. aid , the administration has obtained agreements from 100 nations not to send Americans to the court .
Bush also supported the 2002 law that , besides authorizing military action to free U.S. prisoners , forbids all U.S. cooperation with the court and , in selected cases , denies military aid to member nations who refuse to sign the agreements with the United States .
The administration has made one exception to its policy of opposing the court , the continuing slaughter of villagers in the Darfur region of Sudan , in which the advocates of U.S. intervention include Christian conservatives .
Bush declined to veto a 2005 Security Council resolution authorizing the international court to investigate and indict Sudanese officials , whom Sudan 's government has since refused to surrender .
Not all the presidential candidates have expressed opinions about the court .
But four of them - Clinton , Obama , Edwards and Kucinich - answered questionnaires on the subject from the American Society of International Law , and most of the others have commented on the court or related issues .
At one end of the spectrum is Mike Gravel , a former senator from Alaska and one of the Democrats who backs U.S. membership in the court .
In a recent San Francisco appearance , he said he considers himself a " globalist " and " a citizen of the human race , first and foremost .
Only secondly do I consider myself an American . "
At the other end is Ron Paul , a Republican congressman from Texas , who said in 2002 that both the court and the United Nations " are inherently incompatible with national sovereignty .
America must either remain a constitutional republic or submit to international law because it cannot do both . "
McCain , who has expressed more willingness than other Republicans to consider court membership , also has spoken up for international law in other contexts , notably the nation 's duty to follow the Geneva Conventions on the humane treatment of foreign prisoners .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has condemned the abuse of prisoners .
But he has not responded to The Chronicle 's inquiries about the international court and seems unlikely to support it , if his comment on another pending treaty is any indication :
He referred to the Law of the Sea Treaty , a less - controversial pact that Bush supports , as a " crazy " plan that would " give away our sovereignty . "
Other Republicans who have n't answered queries about the court are former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , who has criticized the United Nations ; former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who has suggested that the United States look for alternatives to the United Nations ; and Hunter , a congressman from San Diego , who has denounced " treaties that infringe on basic U.S. sovereignty . "
Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee opposes U.S. membership in the court .
Among Democrats , Edwards , Kucinich , Gravel , Dodd and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson support U.S. membership ; Clinton and Obama say they want more assurances of safeguards for Americans ; and Biden , in a 2003 statement referring to a number of unratified treaties , said the nation should try to negotiate compromises with its partners .
Regardless of the next president 's position , there 's little prospect of immediate U.S. participation in the court , which would require an extremely difficult two - thirds ratification vote in the Senate , said Scharf , the former State Department official .
But he said a supportive president could take other steps - financial aid to the court , legislation that would allow all such crimes to be prosecuted in the United States , backing for Security Council resolutions authorizing prosecutions for crimes in nonmember nations like Burma and Iraq , and repeal of the " Hague Invasion Act . "
" The U.S. is already exposed to the ICC , " Scharf said , using the initials for the court .
" It 's not like staying outside it protects us .
If a politician really wants to protect us from the ICC , being an influential insider might protect us more . "

Kristol : Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign a ' tragedy ' Nick Langewis and David Edwards

This " I 've been tested in crisis , I 'm ready to lead , and the time is now . "
- Rudy Giuliani , Saturday , in Florida Republican presidential contender and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has been leading in the polls , but one Florida poll shows him lagging behind two Republican opponents : former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee .
Pundit Brit Hume says that the " Huckabee surge " is essentially stealing Giuliani 's thunder , much like what he says happened to Romney .
Anchor Chris Wallace disagrees .
" It seems to me Giuliani 's got problems of his own , " says Wallace , turning to NPR 's Mara Liasson for comment .
" He definitely does , " Liasson agrees .
Giuliani runs the risk of slipping into the " second tier " as a result of no longer " controlling his fate . "
" What he needs now is for Huckabee to beat Romney in Iowa , " continues Liasson .
Citing the dim prospect of losing in early states and hoping to pick up in Florida , " he needs something bad to happen to Romney , because he can't do it himself . "
Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol cites two factors that he says the Giuliani campaign has run on :
The fact that Giuliani was the " very effective mayor " of New York City , and that he " really was a terrific mayor of New York " on September 11 , 2001 .
Kristol sees a promising candidate with no agenda to run on in Rudy Giuliani .
" I think he made it all about himself ; about his record ; but when you make it about yourself , it 's also about other aspects of your past . "
NPR 's Juan Williams disagrees with Kristol 's assessment of Giuliani as mayor , touting New York City 's Bloomberg .
Williams sees a shift from national security issues to social , lifestyle and economic issues , with GOP contender Mike Huckabee emerging as a the " social conservative " candidate who " speaks to faith and issues of character . "
" That looms larger for the American people at this moment , " says Williams .
The exchange , as broadcast on Fox 's Fox News Sunday on December 16 , 2007 , can be viewed below .
HARO , Spain ( CNN ) -- A Spanish businessman withdrew a controversial lawsuit Wednesday against the family of a teenage boy he struck and killed while driving a luxury car .
Tomas Delgado had filed a suit asking the dead boy 's parents to pay him € 20,000 ( $ 29,400 ) on the grounds that the collision that killed their teenage son also damaged his Audi A - 8 .
News of the case sparked outrage in Spain and generated deep sympathy for the parents of 17 - year - old Enaitz Iriondo Trinidad .
He was riding his bicycle home to a campground when Delgado 's car hit and killed him in August 2004 .
Hundreds of people descended on a courthouse in northern Spain in a show of support for the boy 's parents Wednesday .
They broke into applause when word came that Delgado had dropped the suit .
The businessman had insisted in a recent television interview that he was a victim , too .
He was not present for a court hearing Wednesday .
His lawyer told the court that Delgado felt that the extensive publicity amounted to a public lynching .
Outside the courthouse , the boy 's father -- Antonio Iriondo -- told CNN he was content with the decision .
Yet he also said his family will explore the possibility of criminal charges against the man .
" This is just the beginning , " the father said .
His son was killed as he cycled back from a nearby village to a campground where his family was vacationing .
Iriondo Trinidad 's father told CNN he heard the screeching of the car from the campgrounds .
The teen was struck from behind and dragged 106 meters ( 347 feet ) along the rural highway , the father said .
A traffic report said Delgado was traveling 113 km per hour ( 70 mph ) in an area where the speed limit is 90 km ( 55 mph ) .
An independent expert hired by Trinidad 's family said Delgado was going 173 km per hour ( 107 mph ) .
Shortly after the collision , a judge dismissed criminal charges against Delgado after concluding that he had committed no criminal infraction , the Spanish newspaper El Pais reported .
The teen 's mother , Rosa , told the newspaper that the family was given three days to appeal the judge 's ruling , but they were too distraught to pursue it .
She also told the newspaper that her family 's lawyer advised her and her husband not to pursue criminal charges .
After the collision , Delgado 's insurance company paid the family € 33,000 ( $ 48,500 ) .
Two years after the wreck , Delgado sued the family for damages to his car and for car rental costs .
The boy 's mother told CNN before the hearing that she was indignant that the driver would seek damages after killing her son .
A local prosecutor told reporters that he would take a second look at the case to see whether authorities can file fresh charges against Delgado .

By now , everyone is familiar with Google 's corporate motto , " Do n't be evil . "
In an effort to spread that message of not - being - evil , the search engine behemoth has announced a plan to develop sources of renewable energy that will be cheaper than coal .
The new initiative , RE< C , ( renewable energy is cheaper than coal ) will begin by focusing on solar power technology , and will also encompass geothermal energy production .
RE <C's plan , in conjunction with Google 's philanthropic Google.org , is to drive the development of cheaper alternative energy through the use of grants and investments .
According to Dr. Larry Brilliant , head of Google.org , the " hope is that by funding research on promising technologies , investing in promising new companies , and doing a lot of R&D ourselves , we may help spark a green electricity revolution that will deliver breakthrough technologies priced lower than coal . "
The company itself is also trying hard to reduce its drain on the environment .
Google is working to reduce the energy expenditure of its data centers across the world , all of which need power and cooling for the servers , and plans to be carbon neutral by the end of the current year .
It has also been developing an array of solar cells to power its California headquarters , the Googleplex , and is involved in an initiative to arrive at more energy - efficient computers .
With all signs pointing to an increased scarcity of resources in an world growing ever more crowded , philanthropic efforts such as this one by Google are very much needed .
Although energy produced by burning fossil fuels has a high social cost when climate change and pollution are taken into account , those costs are not borne upfront .
When short - term shareholder value and the need to maximize profit remains the number one priority for corporations , those businesses have no reason to not use the cheapest energy source they can , regardless of its effect on everyone else .
Presumably , the idea behind this move is as follows : if you can't persuade people that burning coal is a bad idea ecologically , providing them with a cheaper , cleaner alternative makes it more expensive to pollute than not , and even if shareholders do n't care about the trees , they 'll care about the bottom line .
At a time when report after report highlights the growing damage done to the planet through the use of fossil fuels , this move by Google to spur renewable energy uptake ought to be applauded .
VIENTIANE PROVINCE , Laos 
They call themselves America ’s forgotten soldiers .
Four decades after the Central Intelligence Agency hired thousands of jungle warriors to fight Communists on the western fringes of the Vietnam War , men who say they are veterans of that covert operation are isolated , hungry and periodically hunted by a Laotian Communist government still mistrustful of the men who sided with America .
“ If I surrender , I will be punished , ” said Xang Yang , a wiry 58 - year - old still capable of crawling nimbly through thick bamboo underbrush .
“ They will never forgive me .
I cannot live outside the jungle because I am a former American soldier . ”
In a small hillside clearing about nine miles east of the Mekong River , Mr. Yang and four other veterans scratch out a primitive existence with their wives and 50 children and grandchildren .
Their hidden jungle encampment is a 15 - hour walk up and down low - lying mountains from the nearest paved road , across streams that are knee - deep in the dry season but can become roaring torrents when the monsoon comes .
Mr. Yang said his group had been attacked by the Laotian Army twice this year .
In September , soldiers killed a 5 - year - old boy , whose grave is on the outskirts of the camp .
In May , a predawn raid killed a woman and her 2 - year - old child .
The group moves camp every few weeks to avoid attack , he said .
For years , those states have heard complaints that not enough of their lottery revenue is used for education .
Now , a New York Times examination of lottery documents , as well as interviews with lottery administrators and analysts , finds that lotteries accounted for less than 1 percent to 5 percent of the total revenue for K - 12 education last year in the states that use this money for schools .
In reality , most of the money raised by lotteries is used simply to sustain the games themselves , including marketing , prizes and vendor commissions .
And as lotteries compete for a small number of core players and try to persuade occasional customers to play more , nearly every state has increased , or is considering increasing , the size of its prizes — further shrinking the percentage of each dollar going to education and other programs .
In some states , lottery dollars have merely replaced money for education .
Also , states eager for more players are introducing games that emphasize instant gratification and more potentially addictive forms of gambling .
Of course , the question of how much lotteries contribute to education has been around for years .
But the debate is particularly timely now that at least 10 states and the District of Columbia are considering privatizing their lotteries , despite assurances decades ago that state involvement would blunt social problems that might emerge from an unregulated expansion of lotteries .
These trends fly in the face of marketing campaigns that often emphasize lotteries ’ educational benefits , like a South Carolina lottery slogan , “ Big Fun , Bright Futures , ” or an ad campaign in North Carolina featuring a thank - you note passed through schools and signed “ The Students . ”
The New York Lottery ’s Web site includes the tagline , “ Raising billions to educate millions . ”
Promotions like these have taken root .
Surveys and interviews indicate that many Americans in states with lotteries linked to education think their schools are largely supported by lottery funds — so much so that they even mention this when asked to vote for tax increases or bond authorizations to finance their schools .

Apparently , despite any protestation Rudy might give of feeling better , The Weekly Standard 's William " The Bloody " Kristol has decided that Giuliani 's presidential campaign is no more .
And the reason ?
That Rudy has been running solely on being the 9/11 guy .
Of course , with Kristol 's track record of being right -- somewhere well south of the Mendoza line -- I do n't know if Rudy needs to worry about packing up those lawn signs just yet ... but it is satisfying to see Rudy 's unofficial public relations firm -- FOX News -- decide that it 's over for " America 's Mayor . "
By now , I hope you ’ve had the opportunity to read Glenn Greenwald ’s overly patient evisceration of Joe Klein and Time magazine .
As often happens with Glenn , he is so thorough that he does n’t offer fellow bloggers much to add .
Joe Klein did a horrible piece of reporting and then followed up with one giant joke of a non-apology .
The subject ?
The House Democrats ’ passage of a bill to amend FISA so that the NSA can spy on foreigners without a warrant even if the communication is routed through the U.S. in some way .
Except , Joke Line did n’t report it that way .
Instead , in the print version of Time that is now in every doctor ’s and dentist ’s office in the country , Klein put it like this ( emphases mine ) :
The next day , I suffered through Rush Limbaugh lambasting the dopey Dems , who actually — can you believe this , friends ? — put the rights of terrorists above the nation ’s security !
That was ridiculous …
… That sort of clarity has been rare in the presidential campaign and almost totally nonexistent among the Democrats in Congress , who are being foolishly partisan on two key issues : continued funding for the war in Iraq and updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) …
… The Democratic strategy on the FISA legislation in the House is equally foolish .
There is broad , bipartisan agreement on how to legalize the surveillance of phone calls and emails of foreign intelligence targets .
The basic principle is this : if a suspicious pattern of calls from a terrorist suspect to a U.S. citizen is found , a FISA court warrant is necessary to monitor those communications .
But to safeguard against civil - liberty abuses , all records of clearly nontargeted Americans who receive emails or phone calls from foreign suspects would be , in effect , erased .
Unfortunately , Speaker Nancy Pelosi quashed the House Intelligence Committee ’s bipartisan effort and supported a Democratic bill that —
Limbaugh is salivating — would require the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target ’s calls to be approved by the FISA court , an institution founded to protect the rights of U.S. citizens only .
In the lethal shorthand of political advertising , it would give terrorists the same legal protections as Americans .
That is well beyond stupid .
If you are confused , you should be .
Joke Line actually reported something 180 degrees opposite of the truth .
The bill the House Democrats passed explicitly allows the government to do exactly what Klein claims it does not allow them to do .
From the bill :
Sec. 105A . ( a ) Foreign to Foreign Communications - ( 1 ) IN GENERAL – Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act , a court order is not required for electronic surveillance directed at the acquisition of the contents of any communication between persons that are not known to be United States persons and are reasonably believed to be located outside the United States for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence information , without respect to whether the communication passes through the United States or the surveillance device is located within the United States .
As Greenwald points out , Joe Klein did n’t read the bill , still has n’t read the bill , and makes a comically pathetic attempt to correct the record .
I may have made a mistake in my column this week about the FISA legislation passed by the House , although it ’s difficult to tell for sure given the technical nature of the bill ’s language and fierce disagreements between even moderate Republicans and Democrats on the Committee about what the bill actually does contain .
Democrats say that I was wrong to report that the bill includes a FISA court review of individual foreign terrorist targets who might communicate with U.S. persons , although it does include an annual “ basket ” review of procedures used by U.S. intelligence agencies to target foreign suspects .
The Republican Committee staff disagrees and says my reporting is correct .
It ’s straight forward .
The bill explicitly does the opposite of what Klein claimed it did .
If Klein is confused on this matter he can read the bill and settle it for himself .
You do n’t need to be a lawyer to understand it , and the pertinent language is n’t technical at all .
Is Klein confused by technical words like ‘ surveillance device ’ ?
Greenwald focuses on the process … why does Klein report on legislation he has n’t read ?
Why does he take the Republicans word at face value ?
Why do n’t his editors insist he do a better job…or , at least , issue corrections ?
But I have a different concern ?
Why is Joe Klein so indifferent to erosion of our civil liberties ?
Why does he see this controversy in completely political terms ?
Here ’s a sampling of Klein ’s take on the issue :
Another larger point I made is also true :
In the coming campaign , Republicans will try to misrepresent any partisan FISA Democratic bill as providing “ civil rights for terrorists . ”
There are those who say , So what ?
Democrats should stand for what they believe .
To which I say , it depends on the issue and the details and the principle …
… The current House legislation requires that every foreign terrorist target be passed through the FISA court because that target may potentially communicate with U.S. Citizens or resident aliens .
It thereby , as I reported , obliquely gives foreign terrorists the same procedures as American citizens , if not the same rights …
This will be very easily twisted by Republicans …
This is all a partisan waste of time , fodder for lawyers and civil liberties extremists .
Never mind that Joe Klein was wrong on the facts , why does he think those of us that are serious about our civil liberties are merely playing at partisan politics ?
Why does he call us extremists ?
He seems concerned that our extremism is going to be used , or twisted , into devastating campaign commercials .
There are many problems with Klein ’s take on this .
Let me take them one at a time .
1 ) Obviously , the biggest problem is that Klein was wrong on the facts .
In fact , he was 180 degrees away from the truth .
So , unsurprisingly , his logic is n’t valid because it is based on a faulty premise .
2 ) Whenever he expresses a political preference , Klein favors the Democrats .
His concern here is that the Democrats are damaging their electoral prospects .
At least ostensibly , Klein is slamming the Democrats out of concern .
He is trying to offer constructive advice .
So , why , once he realized he was wrong on the facts , did n’t he tell his readers that the Republicans had lied to him and to watch out for misleading and deceitful political advertisements in the upcoming election ?
Why did he instead say , ‘ The Republican Committee staff disagrees and says my reporting is correct ’ ?
The Republican Committee staff lied .
Klein knows that now .
And , now that he knows it , should n’t he warn his readers that they should expect to be lied to as well ?
Is n’t he even offended that he was lied to and that this resulted in him reporting something that is 180 degrees away from the truth ?
Does n’t his credibility mean anything to him ?
3 ) Why does Klein so blithely trade away our civil liberties ?
… Democratic concessions ( on immunity for telecoms who allowed access to information , after receiving a direct written request from the government , in a way that would be legal under the new law ) are a small price to pay for the larger principle of defining the 4th Amendment rights of US residents in the light of new technologies .
I have ridiculed Joe Klein many times in the past .
But I ask these questions with sincerity .
I actually want to know the answers to these questions .
And , in the interest of clarity , let me set out why I reject Klein ’s view on the both the politics and the principles .
While I acknowledge that technological changes have given individual terrorists more lethal means to create murder and mayhem and that this requires us to aggressively monitor suspicious communications , it is also true that technological changes have given the government a much greater ability to invade our privacy .
And it is n’t just my privacy that I am concerned about .
I am concerned about the privacy of the political campaign of the eventual Democratic nominee for president .
How can they use email and cell phones with any expectation of privacy if there is no FISA court overseeing wiretaps , if judges will grant warrants based on flimsy standards , and if the FBI can issue National Security Letters without judicial oversight ?
Am I going to take the word of George W. Bush ?
Bush ’s Department of Justice ?
Let me ask Klein this ?
In your experience , has the Bush administration been truthful ?
Do you not recall the Pentagon spying on anti-war Quaker groups ?
Do you not recall former Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge comments about the terror alerts of 2002 :
“ More often than not we were the least inclined to raise it , ” Ridge told reporters .
“ Sometimes we disagreed with the intelligence assessment .
Sometimes we thought even if the intelligence was good , you do n’t necessarily put the country on ( alert ) . …
There were times when some people were really aggressive about raising it , and we said , ‘ For that ? ' ”
Klein , do you remember when Jose Padilla was plotting to blow up a radiological bomb ?
Do you remember when the government dropped that accusation ?
Do you remember how many times Dick Cheney claimed that Mohammed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague ?
Did you ever read about how Zarqawi was largely a myth ?
THE US military is conducting a propaganda campaign to magnify the role of the leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq , according to internal military documents and officers familiar with the program .
For the past two years US military leaders have been using Iraqi media and other outlets in Baghdad to publicise Zarqawi ’s role in the insurgency .
The documents explicitly list the “ US home audience ” as a target of a broader propaganda campaign .
Even beyond the deplorable record of the Bush administration ’s relentless hype , distortion , fear - mongering , scapegoating , and false accusations , and even beyond their illegal warrantless wiretapping , unconstitutional use of National Security Letters , their violation of habeas corpus , their use of torture …we have the potential for political mischief .
Who are the real extremists in this situation , Joe ?
Are the civil libertarians extreme ?
Or , are the Republicans extreme ?
And what do we say about the good people that did nothing while their rights were violated and then taken away ?
We went through this before .
Remember the Nixon administration ?
Back then we knew how to deal with criminals in the White House .
Back then we had reporters that did not settle for misleading explanations from the Republicans .
Why is the media failing us now ?
If you ’re really honest with yourself , Joe , you ’ll realize that you are part of the problem .
It ’s not only your lousy reporting .
It ’s not only your weak advice .
It ’s your lack of concern .
You act as though the Bush administration is just business as usual .
We civil libertarians are desperately trying to make sure that the Bush administration does not become ‘ usual ’… that it is branded as criminal … and that no future administration can use this one as a precedent to justify similar criminality and executive power .
Why are you fighting us ?
THE WAYS in which the Bush war has degraded the structures and culture of Iraq are obvious .
Less so are its insidious effects on the United States , but President Bush is similarly destroying something essential to our own democracy .
A signal of that was sounded last week when The Washington Post reported that the Defense Intelligence Agency is transferring " core ... ( Full article : 767 words )

SAN DIEGO --
The two men stood 50 feet apart , each well aware the other was watching , each , in his own way , a sentinel .
All around them , the Witch fire raged Monday afternoon .
Winds gusted at 50 mph , sending lawn chairs cartwheeling down the once - tidy streets .
Smoke and sand and soot and embers whipped the air into a nasty stew .
Flames seemed to be everywhere .
Officer Jay Odom , a broad - shouldered , 27 - year veteran of the San Diego Police Department , parked his motorcycle at one of the entrances to a community called Westwood , on the western edge of Rancho Bernardo in northern San Diego .
He needed to get everyone out and then keep them out until the fire passed -- everyone , that is , except for the scores of firefighters trying to save the homes .
Inside the first house on the first block past Odom ’s checkpoint , Muhammed Ashtari , an earnest college student , aspiring pharmacist and , as of this spring , a first - time homeowner , paced back and forth in his living room .
On a flat - screen television , the news was on , and it was not good .
They spoke just once , when Ashtari , 21 , ventured briefly outside .
“ You ’d better get out , ” Odom told him .
“ I ’m going to be staying here , ” Ashtari replied .
What resulted , over the course of the day , was a standoff , just one hidden piece of the larger picture that played out when wildfires prompted the sudden evacuation of an estimated quarter - million households in San Diego County .
Odom and his partner had gone door to door in the early hours of the fire , telling people about the evacuation , making sure the residents were on their way out .
It was a chaotic race through the neighborhood .
“ We had fire over our heads , jumping from palm tree to palm tree , ” he said .
“ We could n’t see .
We could n’t breathe . ”
At one point , a flaming palm frond whacked his partner across the face .
“ Look , ” Odom said , pointing toward him .
“ You can see the mark on his mustache .
Caught him right in the kisser . ”
For the most part , the evacuation succeeded .
Schools emptied .
Strip malls and office parks shut down .
In front of houses in the Westwood community , children ’s bikes were abandoned on the sidewalk , their training wheels pointing toward the dark sky .
A fresh pair of skid marks led from one driveway toward the road out , suggesting that someone was very serious about leaving .
Periodically , residents pulled up to Odom ’s checkpoint at the corner of Rancho Bernardo Road and Olmeda Way , asking if they could quickly get back in for one reason or another .
One man wanted to rescue his collection of antique firearms .
One wanted to find his cat .
Another a bottle of cough medicine .
Each time , Odom said essentially the same thing : “ Ca n’t go in there .
Sorry . ”
Not everyone , though , had left .
Ashtari saw his four - bedroom house as an investment that could change his life .
With his girlfriend of five years , his sister and his brother - in - law , and some financial assistance from his mother , a registered nurse , they had scraped together a down payment .
They bought it out of foreclosure from a bank .
Price : $ 420,000 .
It is a work in progress .
New rose bushes line the front walkway , but the detritus of unfinished home - improvement projects clutters the yard .
A table and chairs on the back patio take in a nice view of Battle Mountain , but there is no dining table .
Still , it is theirs .
And no one , Ashtari figured , cared about it more than he did .
If it were to catch on fire , he said , who would be there to help ?
If every fire had to start with a single ember , he figured , could n’t he put that ember out himself ?
So Ashtari told his sister to leave , to go to their mother ’s place closer to downtown San Diego .
She did , her car packed with their photo albums , the loan papers for the house , a laptop computer .
Ashtari told his girlfriend , 20 - year - old Trang Pham , recently accepted into a nursing program at San Diego State , to go with his sister .
She declined .
They ’d started dating five years ago at Mount Carmel High School in Rancho Peñasquitos .
“ If he ’s going to stay , I ’m going to stay , ” Pham said .
She smiled politely , then walked back into the kitchen , where she began to wash the lunch dishes .
His mother , Ferechteh Nikrafter , called , worried about them .
She started the conversation in English : “ Why are you still there ? ”
Then she switched to their native Persian ; Ashtari was born in Iran and moved to the United States as a boy .
“ Dahaiti , ” she told him .
It ’s an expression , he said later , that essentially means “ Do n’t be foolish . ”
He did not feel foolish , he said .
Over the course of the day , he watched the news , freezing the screen with his remote control from time to time so he could study a map of the active fire zones .
He positioned a stepladder under the opening to the attic and poked his head up there every few minutes , using a flashlight to make sure no embers had worked their way inside .
He stared out the back window at the fires , as Battle Mountain faded in and out from behind a blanket of smoke .
Occasionally , a helicopter thundered overhead , carrying water or flame retardant to an active wall of fire just a few blocks away .
“ I do n’t want to be somewhere far away and find out that something has happened to the house , ” he said .
“ Here , I can do something .
I can keep an eye out . ”
Outside , Odom seethed .
“ I just do n’t understand the mentality , ” he said .
“ You do your darndest to help them .
And they do their darndest not to let you help . ”
Under a mandatory evacuation order , police could have theoretically removed Ashtari and the other holdouts by force , Odom said .
“ We just do n’t have the manpower , ” he said .
“ We do n’t have the bodies to drag them out kicking and screaming . ”
Firefighters say authorities cannot remove residents from a home but can bar them from returning if they do leave .
Odom said he and his colleagues would man the checkpoint until they were forced to leave to protect themselves .
“ If that happens , I ’ll go pound on the door to give them one last warning , ” Odom said .
“ Then I ’m gone . ”
Ashtari said he was ready .
“ If a captain wants to go down with his ship , ” he said , “ they let him . ”
With the sky choked with smoke , nightfall came early Monday .
The house was still standing .
The fire was still raging .

At first glance , this “ case mod ” , if you can call it that , looked like the box I carried my belongings off to college with .
Look a little deeper and you see that this box is actually a working computer .
The UbuntuBox has got to be the ugliest damn case mod of all time .
Is n’t there some sort of reward for this ?
The creator of this horrendous masterpiece says that the computer houses the parts from an old Pentium 3 tower , running Linux Ubuntu .

Whether you are a business - person , a sales executive , an improviser , or a social butterfly , telling a good engaging story is essential .
There are those who can impart information to others , and then there are those who can tell a great story .
This is sometimes enigmatic : how does one person draw you in to their story , and another person make you not care about what they ’re saying ?
Here ’s a formula that I learned that allowed me to tell an engaging story .
First of all , watch your interactions with people , specifically when you are retelling an event to someone , and notice when they react positively to that story .
If you get 2 - 3 + positive reactions , you have a story that you can retell , and it will hit well without much tweaking .
But if your story needs some retooling , and is n’t hitting the way you want it to , here ’s the formula that I learned from an exercise called “ String Of Pearls ” :
Break your story into 6 parts :
Who : Start with who is involved .
Was it you alone , with another person , or a group of people .
How are you related to those people ?
What : Communicate what the action was , such as being at a party or driving to a friend ’s house .
Where : Actively describe where you are , using senses .
If you are good at establishing the location , you can get the listener to start re-living the senses with you .
Conflict :
This is the bulk of the story .
What is the importance of this story ?
What happened , and what action did you take to try to resolve what was happening ?
Resolution :
How were you able to handle the task set up in “ conflict ” ?
Tag :
This one is a bit tricky , but it ’s the aftermath of the resolution , and usually is a joke , or the big finish of the story .
Here ’s a quick example without most of the flourish that you should use :
WHO : I
WHAT : was walking
WHERE : in the city
CONFLICT : and heard someone saying they did n’t like this city
RESOLUTION : so I told him to walk with me to the best coffee shop in town .
He liked the shop so much that
TAG : he bought me a cup !
See ?
Very simple when you know the breakdown .
Now , for the next level , try and link parts of the formula together .
This is n’t required , but adds a different level of depth to the story .
For this example , I will link :
Who – Tag
What – Resolution
Where – Conflict
Here are the links that I used ( same example ) :
WHO : I
WHAT : was walking
WHERE : in the city
CONFLICT : and heard someone saying they did n’t like this city
RESOLUTION : so I told him to walk with me to the best coffee shop in town .
He liked the shop so much that
TAG : he bought me a cup !
“ I ” goes with “ me ”
“ walking ” goes with “ walk ”
“ city ” goes with “ city ”
Now that is very basic , and you do n’t have to link with words .
Link concepts instead .
The freedom here is that you can link any one of the first three concepts with any of the last three concepts .
“ What ” can go with “ Tag ” , “ Who ” can go with “ Conflict ” .
Mix and match to your heart ’s content !
With this formula , you can make most stories have an interesting , effective arc !

Click to viewLess than two years after their beta release , Yahoo Mail has begun rolling out of beta after releasing an onslaught of innovative feature improvements along the way .
On the other hand , a whopping three years into their beta release , Gmail remains one of the most popular but stagnant web - based beta email apps around — and most of Gmail 's innovation since its release has come in the form of third - party hacks and extensions .
The short of it : Google makes a great beta , but with Gmail they 've been much too slow to actually take the application to the next level .
Let 's take a look at some of Yahoo Mail 's killer out - of - the - box features in comparison to what Gmail is offering .

What They 've Both Got
Advertisement
Autocomplete :
It 's a simple feature , but hell if we do n't rely on address auto - completion almost exclusively these days .
I do n't even know half of my contacts ' email addresses any more .
Chat : Gmail 's got Google Talk / Chat while Yahoo's integrated Yahoo Messenger .
Both work exclusively with users of those email services , which is a little annoying .
UPDATE : As many readers have pointed out , this is n't strictly true .
GChat users can also chat with other Jabber users , and you can even chat with other services with some added effort .
Additionally , it looks like Yahoo Messenger and MSN Messenger can talk with each other , too .
The more useful chat application depends entirely on which service more of your friends use for email , though Gmail does save chat transcripts , which edges out the built - in Yahoo client .
Keyboard Shortcuts : Both email apps have a fairly good set of default keyboard shortcuts , though both are very different .
I lean toward Gmail 's shortcuts , having always found them more intuitive .
One might be tempted to point out the third - party Gmail Macros , but keep in mind that those are n't actually integrated into Gmail .

Where Yahoo Mail Wins Out

Unlimited Storage : Yahoo thrilled all their users by announcing unlimited storage , meaning you no longer need to keep close watch on your account usage .
In contrast , Gmail 's once innovative 1GB of storage has progressed to just under 3GB .
It 's not that 3GB is bad , Gmail , but you 're still falling behind the curve .
Yahoo !
Mail unlimited storage kicks in Yahoo !'s releasing unlimited mail storage this week , which means the disk usage progress bar will …

Built - in RSS : It 's by no means as robust as Google Reader , but Yahoo has gone that extra mile and incorporated RSS directly into their email application .
And while Google Reader and Gmail share very similar layouts ( meaning one could easily imagine a tight integration ) , Gmail users have yet to see integrated RSS in any form other than third - party hacks .

Push Email for iPhone :
It certainly does n't affect as many users as many of the rest of the features , but Yahoo Mail 's support for push email on the iPhone is just another point indicative of their desire to innovate new features into their email client .
Integrated SMS : When Yahoo Mail rolled out of beta , they also added the ability to SMS contacts directly using their email .
The SMS feature and out - of - beta rollout still have n't reached my Yahoo Mail account over three weeks since the announcement , but this added feature is obviously a step in the right direction .

Yahoo !
Mail 's set to get a bunch of new features tomorrow , including built - in SMS capabilities .…

Robust contact management : Yahoo Mail 's Address Book is head and shoulders above Gmail contact management ( which — if you 've ever tried viewing " All Contacts " — is an absolute disaster ) .
Incidentally , Yahoo's Address Book also syncs with the iPhone — again , not applicable to everyone , but an absolute killer feature for anyone who owns an iPhone .
( And it 's worked , too , as I 've set up filters to forward all of my important email from Gmail to my Yahoo account for this feature alone . )

Drag and Drop :
If you want to file a message into a folder , you can do so in Yahoo Mail with a simple drag and drop .
Sure you can label content in Gmail , but unless you 're using a third - party add - on , it requires selecting each email you want to label and then choosing a label from a cumbersome drop - down box .
I can already see all the labels on the left sidebar , Gmail !
Why not add drag - and - drop capabilities like you 've already implemented in Google Docs & Spreadsheets labels into Gmail ?
Or if not , get going on incorporating Gmail Macros ( see below ) .

Where Gmail Tops Yahoo
Advertisement
Threaded Conversations :
The one thing that Gmail has done that absolutely puts all other email applications to shame , web or desktop - based , is its threaded conversations .
This single feature — along with the third - party Gmail Macros — is what keeps me in complete love with Gmail .
It 's revolutionized the way I view and keep up with email .
The endless thread of Re:s comes to a screeching halt in Gmail , and I still do n't understand why every email application does n't follow suit .
Labels :
They may take some getting used to for people who are used to straight folders , but Gmail 's labels outsmart Yahoo Mail 's folders if only because labels are not buckets in the traditional sense that folders are .
You can label a single email with as many labels as you want , meaning you can access through as many organizational avenues as you feel are applicable .
Advertisement
Chat Transcripts : Like I said above , Gmail outdoes Yahoo with its chat transcripts , which rather seamlessly integrate with regular email content — even within email threads .
It 's a simple but powerful implementation .
Where Third Party Add-ons Come In
Gmail Macros : Written by Google 's very own Mihai Parparita , Gmail Macros up Gmail 's keyboard navigation one hundred fold .
In fact , Mihai — who 's the tech lead for Google Reader — actually integrated a very similar set of keyboard macros into Google Reader , which — * GASP *— just left Google 's labs and beta labels in the dust .
The Gmail Macros script has been available from Mihai as a Greasemonkey script for a couple of years now , and it 's currently bundled into Lifehacker 's popular Better Gmail Firefox extension ( see below ) , but when will we see this kind of crazy - useful functionality baked directly into Gmail ?

Better Gmail : Because we want to love Gmail so much , Lifehacker has bundled all the greatest third - party Gmail scripts ( including Gmail Macros ) into a Firefox extension called Better Gmail .
Better Gmail adds Gmail Macros , Google Reader integration , Google Calendar integration , and tons more into the best email beta on the block .

The Possibilities
It 's probably obvious that Gmail is my preferred web - based email ( I 've sung its praises many times before ) , but I 'll be damned if I do n't want to see some improvements out of it .
Aside from what I 've discussed above , Gmail could shut me up about most of my complaints if and when they pull off the rumored and much - anticipated offline Gmail via Google Gears .
( Is it any wonder that Google Reader was the first — and so far only — Google app to actually use Google Gears ? )
Advertisement
Personally , though , I 'd much prefer a dedicated Gmail desktop client that incorporates most of the third - party abilities and syncs labels and read / unread status with the web version .
Gears could be all right , but sometimes you just need the speed of a dedicated desktop application — but you still want virtually the same interface and a lot of the same features you 're used to in the browser .
I 'm probably asking way too much .

Any Gmail / Yahoo
Mail users care to defend / tear down your client ?
Let 's hear your thoughts in the comments .
When Bear Grylls dashes off into the wilderness to film the survival show Man vs. Wild , he is often prepared to make fire with a rather fascinating metal alloy .
At the beginning of nearly every episode , the famous adventurer explains that he is equipped with " only a knife , a flint , and a water bottle . "
However , his handy firestarter is not a piece of rock .
It ’s a rod made from a blend of rare earth elements called mischmetal — which is mostly cerium .
When scraped with a knife , tiny particles fly off of the metal bar .
As their freshly exposed surfaces come in contact with air , the little bits of metal oxidize — becoming super hot sparks .
Safe and sane flash bang grenades , developed at Sandia National Laboratories , operate under the same general principle .
Hurl a cloud of tiny un -oxidized metal particles into the air .
Bang !
They will violently react with oxygen .
On the other hand , the old - fashioned way to make a fire is more challenging , but it operates on the same principle .
The sharp edge of a flint stone can scrape tiny specks from a high - carbon steel bar .
As they come in contact with oxygen , the bits of metal ignite .

Allardyce was in charge at St James ' Park for 24 games
The club , currently 11th in the Premier League , said the decision had been reached " by mutual agreement " .
Allardyce , who was in charge for 24 games , said : " I 'm disappointed but I wish them all the best for the future .
It was a shock , I did n't expect it . "
Former Magpies captain Alan Shearer is extremely unlikely to take over , with chairman Chris Mort revealing : " A new manager has not yet been appointed . "
First - team coach Nigel Pearson will take charge of the team for Saturday 's Premier League meeting with Manchester United .
606 : DEBATE Performances under Allardyce were the worst in living memory for Newcastle
zeppelins_attack !
Earlier on Wednesday , Allardyce had attended a news conference ahead of that game but gave no hint that his time at the club might be coming to an end .
Indeed , the 53 - year - old had discussed his plans for the January transfer window and , ironically , spoke about the lack of time afforded to Premier League managers in the modern - day game .
However , shortly afterwards , Newcastle announced news of his departure with a statement on their official website .
Allardyce signed a three - year deal when he replaced Glenn Roeder in May after eight years in charge at Bolton .
He was quickly working under a new regime at St James '
Park after billionaire Mike Ashley completed his takeover , and long - standing chairman Freddy Shepherd left the club .
KEY DATES 29 April 2007 : Allardyce resigns as Bolton boss
15 May 2007 : Allardyce signs three - year deal at Newcastle
29 June 2007 : New Magpies owner Mike Ashley increases his stake to 92.3 %
25 July 2007 : Freddy Shepherd stands down as Newcastle chairman
2 Jan 2008 : Magpies lose 2 - 0 at home to Manchester City , their third straight league defeat
6 Jan 2008 : Newcastle draw 0 - 0 with Stoke in FA Cup
9 Jan 2008 : Allardyce leaves Newcastle " by mutual consent "
The new manager signed nine players during the summer at a total investment of around £ 26 m , with Joey Barton ( £ 5.8 m ) , David Rozehnal ( £ 2.9 m ) and Alan Smith ( £ 6 m ) among the new arrivals .
The Magpies began the season with a 3 - 1 win at the Reebok Stadium but he soon came under fire from fans unhappy with the team 's style of play .
The pressure built with a run of three straight league defeats over the festive period - although midfielder Nicky Butt was among those who urged the club to keep faith with Allardyce .
" It was an open secret that he was under pressure after making such a mediocre start - but the timing of his leaving was still unexpected , " said BBC Radio 5 Live 's chief football correspondent Mike Ingham .
" But Newcastle 's problems stretch back over 30 years - not half a season .
Managers have been hired and fired far too quickly .
" When will the penny finally drop that stability and continuity are the main ingredients needed to achieve success ? "
The pressure is too much now in the Premier League
Former Newcastle boss Sir Bobby Robson
Former Newcastle boss Sir Bobby Robson said the news of Allardyce 's departure had come as a great shock to him .
" I was very surprised and stunned when I heard the news , " Robson told BBC Radio 5 Live .
" That 's the eighth Premier League manager we 've lost this season already .
The pressure is too much now in the Premier League .
" The dismissals of manager are coming fast and frequent and it's rather sad for the game in many respects . "
Allardyce 's last game in charge was a 0 - 0 draw at Championship side Stoke in the FA Cup third round on Sunday .
He becomes the eighth Premier League managerial casualty this season , leaving with an overall record of eight wins , six draws and 10 defeats .
Since Kevin Keegan left 11 years ago , six permanent managers have now come and gone at St James ' Park , while it has been 39 years since the club claimed a major trophy .
Goldeneye 007 : Ten Years Later
Note from racketboy : I felt this piece from fastbilly 1 did a wonderful job looking at one of the most pivotal console FPSs and how it is still relevant and practical today .
I hope you enjoy it .
Few games have caused as much awe and frustration as Rareware ’s 1997 Goldeneye 007 .
Bringing four - player FPS multiplayer to a console was unheard of at the time to the vast majority of gamers .
Sure there were the PC fans who had played through Wolfenstien 3D , Rise of the Triad , or Doom 1 & 2 , but the casual crowd had yet been exposed to slaughtering their friends for fun .
Predating Half Life by a year , Goldeneye provided us a reason to gather up the troops and stalk the halls of the temple .
But how does it play today ?
Controls
Simplicity was what made Goldeneye unique and special .
While not as simple as Mario Kart 64 , compared to other FPSs , Goldeneye ’s control scheme was intuitive enough that even the very casual gamers could pick up the majority of the nuances with just a handful of games under their belts .
“ Use the joystick to move and the trigger to shoot , blue button opens doors and reloads the gun ” with that basic rundown of controls most anyone could join you until they either wanted to learn the more advanced controls or became bored of the game ( this would become commonplace if you played with people who always hunted down the new players , you all know what I am talking about ) .
The controls are still spot on , and have been added into more modern games as optional controls ( in Halo that is Legacy with the triggers in Southpaw ) .
They may seem alittle akward at first , but after a couple games you will feel the groove coming back .
And if you can not get use to the single joystick controls , pick one of the 2.1 control styles and grab another controller .
Sure it means on a 1 on 1 game but you will get a more modern control style .
Multiplayer :
Goldeneyes is not so much unique as it is an example of utter brilliance .
The stage designs are nearly flawless .
From the open breezeways of the Temple , to the labyrinth like Complex , to the harrowing halls of the Facility , the stages had the right amount of everything to make for epic battles of supremacy .
Though after ten years of playing Temple it grows quite stale .
The same goes for the Facility .
If you played the game to the extent that the majority of us did , you will still remember the hiding spots in the Complex , the high holes in the Temple ’s main room , and ofcourse the bullet proof glass in the Facility , they will seem like old friends .
But after playing them for a few hours you will remember that the Facility is bottlenecked at the bullet proof glass , the hiding spots in complex are nigh useless , and that still nobody remembers those holes in the Temple ’s walls .
Is this to say that the stages are bad ?
No , but I do not believe that most people will be willing to put in anywhere near the amount of time the use to on them .
They were amazing , but by todays standards they are very plain and lack gusto .
Then again I started playing through Goldeneye again a couple weeks ago and have enjoyed the spats of multiplayer quite a bit .
But when compared to something like Timesplitters 2 / Future Perfect , Halo , or Half Life 2 , there really is no fair comparison .
The weapons in Goldeneye were always a mixed bag .
I knew very few people who actually liked getting the PP7 ( commonly referred to as the PPtrash ) and even less who liked timed mines .
Mixed bag or not the weapons still provide a nice balance that few games have replicated .
Weapon sets may have annoyed many players , something that Perfect Dark “ fixed , ” but it just kept with the idea that the game was made to be simple .
I mean when choosing Automatics , all the guns use the same bullets .
How can that be any simpler ?
Yes simplicity is good to get new players , but the balance is what kept people coming back .
The most powerful weapon will always spawn in the same place , the RCP90 is going to be outside the bathroom door , but you have a clear shot to it from most of the way down the hallway if you are crouched , and a headshot with the magnum will kill them .
And while your RCP90 can shoot through that metal door , much like the moonraker , my Magnum can shoot through the bullet proof glass AND the door behind it .
And for some reason fire can go through walls , 10 years and I still have n’t figured that one out .
Ask any fan of the game two simple words and the stories will come pouring out , proximity mine .
I could go on about games in Bunker , or the Temple respawn pattern , but that is not why yall are here .
If you cannot tell already , I would say that apart from the Unreal Tournaments and possibly Red Fraction , there has not been a more balanced set of weapons , let alone weapon sets , in an fps .
I just wish I would stop getting stuck with that daggum klobb when we are not playing License to Kill .
Scenario - wise Goldeneye pulled from its parents in the genre and ironed out a lot of the kinks in making a console version of them .
Your standard deathmatch is fairly straight forward .
But adding in a one shot kill option , License to Kill , spiced things up some ( then people actually want the klobb ) .
Limited lives ,
You only Live Twice , was fun for tournaments but not so much for casual play , sans drinking games potential .
Flag tag , The Living Daylights , was probably our least played game type , even more so than limited lives .
The concept is that there is one flag , and you try to hold on to it the longest , timewise .
It never clicked with my group of friends and family , so my exposure to it is jaded and boorish .
Ofcourse there are your usual team layouts , 2v2 and 3 v1 , neither all that profound , but a whole mess of a lot of fun .
Finally we have one of the best , The Man with the Golden Gun .
This is a very simple one where there is one Goldengun , it forces the weapon set to be goldengun , whoever grabs the gun is “ it ” and is the only one who can get points , everyone else is on a team to best them and grab the gun ( best when played without a time limit ) .
Enough variety to keep most players happy for sometime , it is hard to say what kind of impact it made since most of these scenarios had been in games before it .
But there is no question that even by todays standards the scenarios are worthwhile , and more importantly they are still fun .
However the lack of being able to use more than one at a time is a sad drawback .
Team License to Kill and a true Capture the Flag mode would have been choice additions , but sadly it just is not so ( though the first can be accomplished through modifiying players health and / or using a gameshark ) .
With twelve available by default , 33 after completing the game , and 64 if you used a cheat , there is a character for everyone .
Be it the cast of the movie , your generic badguys , or even old Bond villains , the multiplayer characters are as diverse as the people who play them .
Granted you will run into people who only will only play the short man oddjob or maybe that ghillisuit esq Siberian Special Forces , but there is little to gripe about characterwise .
Newer games boast cast in the hundreds , Timesplitters , but really how many do you really need ?
Granted I do have over 1000 characters on my Mugen roster so I cant really talk .
Overall the multiplayer is still amazingly fun , even if the stage designs are a bit dated .
All the tricks have been figured out and there are no secrets left , but with alittle practice , and some good friends , Goldeneye can still dish out what you remember it doing back in the 90s .
Sure it is dated , the characters only kinda look like the people they are supposed to represent , and there are no reload animations , but it can still dole out that sweet endorphin rush of days gone by .
Singleplayer :
Goldeneye may have been known mostly for its divine multiplayer , but the single player was no slouch either .
Following the movie decently , good enough for a movie game , the storyline took you all over the world .
Starting off with the dam with that big green truck that you have to out run and ending with a brilliant jump to the bottom of the Cradle .
While there were slow parts , Statue , and parts that were over the top violent , Runway ’s tank , the game played fluidly from stage to stage .
However the storytelling dynamics are ruined by stock characters and a somewhat convoluted jump from part to part with bare reasons for such a jump .
While this can be construed to be just like the movie , or most Bond movies for that matter , it does not translated well into a ground breaking single player experience .
In its time it was unrivaled , but now with brilliant retellings of the second World War , stories of intergalactic civil wars of racism and hate , and a lonely MIT graduate in the wrong place at the wrong time , Goldeneye shows its age .
And while that is not a bad thing in some aspects , the single player game did not age anywhere near as good as the multiplayer .
This does not mean it is a horrible game , just that it has been surpassed .
Playing Goldeneye 007 Today
If you want to dive back into Goldeye ten years after its released , you really have three options :
Dust off the Nintendo 64 Play a Goldeneye Mod for another game Emulate
We will hit all three of these in fair detail , pro and con , and some how - tos to make your experience more enjoyable
Nintendo 64 :
If you do n’t have one , they go for $ 15 at goodwill and about $ 30 with two controllers and a game on eBay ( pre-shipping ) .
Goldeneye will set you back another $ 10 or so .
( You could even find a system bundled with the game )
So yes it is cheap , but there are two problems with playing it on the N64 :
First of all , old hardware can be spotty , I know in college we went through a N64 in a year and a half playing Mario Kart 64 ( ended up that when we added extra cooling it started to work again , but who wants a pc heatsink on a console ? ) .
Secondly , the controllers can be a hassle .
Yes the great thing about playing the game is that the N64 controller was spot on , nigh perfect , for the game .
However , the joysticks on the controllers are simply tripe .
How do you know if your controller is shot , the easy way to do it is hold it by one of the claws and shake it around in a gentle circle .
If the stick moves around , well it might be time to get some new ones .
Sure you can still play with the busted up sticks , I did it for years , but the difference between the sticks is night and day .
Downside to this is it is increasingly difficult to purchase new first party controllers for a decent price , even on eBay .
There is another way , if you are comfortable with electronics , or know someone who is that owes you a favor , you can easily and painlessly replace the joystick and for about $ 7 per controller .
eBay is littered with people selling the joysticks and the triwing screwdriver you may need .
Once open it is a matter of plug and play to switch out the joysticks , I will make the safe bet of ten minutes per , but in reality it can take as few as two after you figure it out .
So for about forty dollars and maybe an hour , you can replace all your joysticks , clean your contacts for your buttons , and have four N64 controllers that feel like new .
That is by far the best way to get better controllers , but if you do not already have four controllers eBay or craigslist are your best options .
Do be careful though and make sure you are buying Nintendo brand controllers and not the third party kind .
Even if the seller says they are first party if they have slowmo features , well that should be a hint .
Mods :
The most popular of all the Goldeneye mods is obviously Goldeneye Source .
Utilizing the power of the Source Engine , and the creativity of the Half Life community , Goldeneye Source provides a very faithful rendition of the multiplayer to the modern audience .
Sporting both online play and more maps the game could be played endlessly .
However there are some drawbacks .
For one you need a decent computer to run it , Half Life 2 will run on most anything , but Goldeneye Source has brought my pc down to a crawl on decently populated servers .
It also requires a copy of a base Source game , your best option would be either Half Life 2 or The Orange Box .
A better question would be why do n’t you already have a copy or two of Half Life 2 ( but that is just the TFC fan I me screaming for later this year ) .
One thing that I did not like about Goldeneye Source , and this is just a personal gripe , is that they took away your ability to not fall off of things .
Sure it makes sense to do it that way , but that was one “ problem ” with Goldeneye that I actually liked .
It added something so unintuitive that it through everyone for a loop the first couple games , that and I do not like falling to my death ( that ’s the UT / Quake fan in me talking ) .
Personally I prefer the mods for the Unreal Tournament series , even if they were never finished .
The maps were redone in a more UT style , ie the columns in the Library main room , and really fit the game .
However the guns are worthless , in comparison to even their original form .
I take it to mean that the Lizard people are just that strong that it takes several shots from the Goldengun to kill them .
Just using the maps with the UT weapons leads for some funny battles , but this is in no way a substitute for the original game .
Either choice is good , but for a real rendition , there is really no reason to look any further than Goldeneye Source .
Sadly though it is a pcgame , meaning one player per pc ( this is not Serious Sam you know ) , taking away some of the fun , but online and lanparties do alleviate you of that .
Emulation :
Ah the sticky subject , well this one is still kind of iffy .
Rareware utilized a unique skybox that so far the emulation community has yet to duplicate .
Meaning all stages that are supposed to have a sky just have black , makes Surface kinda apocalyptically foreboding .
It really does not affect multiplayer that much but it is worthwhile to point out .
Emulation has several major advantages over the other two options .
Not only do you still have four players on one system , you can also have online through kalliera ( project64 k and mupen64 k ) .
You can also enhanced the graphics , though I would suggest against that , and you can up the ram to the game so you do not have as many slowdowns as you use to .
However you are stuck with pretty crappy controls , and to play fourplayer with less slowdown you need a fairly “ cherry ” pc .
The pc problem can be fixed over time or simply for a couple hundred if you are not so technically inclined , the controls are another problem all together .
You could cheat and use a mouse and keyboard , but that takes away ALL of the challenge .
The more common way of playing is with pc controllers , Logictech ’s DualShock styled one being the most obvious choice ( which racketboy personly uses and enjoys ) .
The Wiimote can also be used through glovepie and a Bluetooth dongle , but like the mouse and keyboard I believe the precision takes the challenge out of the game , well except when you are fighting the auto aim .
However , there is a still another easy way to get better controls , console adaptors .
For N64 to USB you have two choices , Adaptoids which are the more expensive , N64 - only solution or the PS1 / PS2 / N64 adapters that are available from eBay , Amazon , and other retailers .
Sadly I have missed out on the last shipment of Adaptoids and currently play using a Super Joybox 5 and PS2 controllers .
It is by far not the most ideal way of playing , the deadzone on the PS2 controllers is smaller than the N64 so sometimes when strafing you start looking up really quickly , but it is very much playable .
Another fantastic aspect of emulation is that you can hack the game .
Not only can you start out with all 64 players in multiplayer available by default , you can play new stages in multiplayer .
That ’s right there are stages for Goldeneye that you have not memorized ; Namely the Cradle ( the last stage for the single player game ) and the Citadel ( a beta multiplayer stage – unfinished but very playable ) .
However any stage can become a multiplayer stage with the help of the Goldeneye level editor care of the brilliant minds of the Rare Witch Project .
This editor allows you to lay down items , characters , weapons , cover , statues , and even miniaturized tanks , if that is what you fancy .
With this powerful tool you could simply add another set of body armor to a stage or go so far as to create your own stage – though I feel I should warn you that this does involve a fair bit of work and I did end up crashing the emulator countless times , my entire pc once , for one reason or another ( standard fare for me and level creation actually ) .
With the ability to make new stages and missions , coop missions at that ; this could be seen as reason enough to configure an N64 emulator and figure out the editor .
This powerful tool actually breathes more life into the game than anything else .
Thanks to SubDrag , Zoinkity , Wreck , whoever else worked on this , and the Project64 team , almost every qualm I ever had with Goldeneye over the years is instantly gone .
Sadly there is still no way to play a standard game of capture the flag , but I can live with that .
Also with these tools you can finally have that All Bonds cheat , granted it really is not worth it .
Sadly the last update to the Rare Witch Project was in 2005 and they never did get enough levels to create their repository they were hoping for .
But hopefully enough people will take interest with it now in that even a $ 300 pc from Best Buy ( on sale this week ) can run the emulated game as well as the console and we have just passed the 10th anniversary .
Granted I hope to get four adaptoids the next time they go on sale , so maybe I am not the best one to lead this charge .
SupDrag has many videos of his fantastic maps up on youtube for those who wish to know more .
He even went so far as to port some of the better Perfect Dark stages to Goldeneye then , using a backup device , tested them on a console .
If that is not a hardcore fan , then what does it take ?
In Summary …
So this started out as a simple review of an old game to more modern counterparts , but evolved into much more .
As you can see the game is as good as it was back then , even if games have surpassed it in different categories .
You still get to be Bond , you still get to save the world , and you still get to kill you friends .
Best of all , even after all these years the game is still fun .
Subdrag and his team took the game to the next level and sadly most people did not realize that .
Now , days after the 10th anniversary , we can finally give the game a proper revival .
With all sorts of licensing issues it is doubtful that it will ever be re-released on a modern console , but it is fairly easy to track down , cartridge or rom , and even better the game has expanded from those twenty missions and eleven multiplayer stages we all were enthralled with back in 1997 .
And who knows , maybe we will have a grassroots revival of the game , mapmakers with flock to the editor and create amazing things .
Then the online community can take off and really bring the game back .
If that happens , I might have to chair a league .
“ … and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon ,
over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop , Bob ! ”
A Christmas Carol
At the very end of the beloved Charles Dickens holiday classic A Christmas Carol , a reformed Ebenezer Scrooge and his long - suffering employee Bob Cratchit share an oddly named libation :
“ A Merry Christmas , Bob ! ” said Scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken , as he clapped him on the back .
“ A merrier Christmas , Bob , my good fellow , than I have given you for many a year !
I ’ll raise your salary , and endeavor to assist your struggling family , and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a bowl of Smoking Bishop , Bob ! ”
The drink is hot , spiced wine similar to wassail — something like a hot sangria , scented with oranges and infused with port .
In his book Drinking with Dickens , Cedric Dickens — the great - grandson of Charles — tells us that people back in the 1800s enjoyed a whole range of “ clerical drinks . ”
“ Pope is burgundy , Cardinal is champagne or rye , Archbishop is claret , Bishop is port , and so on , ” Dickens says .
Here ’s Dickens ’ “ Smoking Bishop ” recipe :
Take six Seville oranges and bake them in a moderate oven until pale brown .
If you cannot procure any bitter Seville oranges , use four regular oranges and one large grapefruit .
Prick each of the oranges with five whole cloves , put them into a warmed ceramic or glass vessel with one - quarter pound of sugar and a bottle of red wine , cover the vessel , and leave it in a warm place for 24 hours .
Take the oranges out of the mixture , cut in half and squeeze the juice , then pour the juice back into the wine .
Pour the mixture into a saucepan through a sieve , add a bottle of port , heat ( without boiling ) , and serve in warmed glasses .
Drink the mixture , and keep Christmas well !
Smoking Bishop – Purple Wine
At the end of A Christmas Carol , Scrooge proposes that he and Bob Cratchit will discuss all that Scrooge will do for Bob ’s family later that afternoon “ over a bowl of Smoking Bishop ” .
In his notes for the 1907 edition of A Christmas Carol E. Gordon Browne describes this Christmas punch :
The drink is made by pouring red wine , either hot or cold , upon ripe bitter oranges .
The liquor is heated or “ mulled ” in a vessel with a long funnel , which could be pushed far down into the fire .
Sugar and spices ( chiefly cloves , star anise , and cinnamon ) are added according to taste .
It is sometimes called “ purple wine ” and received the name “ Bishop ” from its colour .
5 unpeeled , Seville oranges
1 unpeeled grapefruit
36 cloves
¼ pound of sugar
2 bottles of red wine ( strong )
1 bottle of port
Wash the fruit and bake them in the oven until
they are brownish .
Turn once .
Put them into a warmed earthenware bowl with
six cloves pricked into each .
Add the sugar and pour in the wine – not the port .
Cover and leave in a warm place for a day .
Squeeze the fruit into the wine and strain .
Add the port and heat .
DO NOT BOIL !
Serve “ smoking hot ” in small wine glasses .
Yield : 15 to 20 servings
Recipe for “ Smoking Bishop ”
‘ Port was the base for a number of drinks : “ we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon , over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop . ”
Smoking Bishop seems to have been a very popular drink , and no wonder .
I discovered it many years ago and it quickly became a traditional winter party drink .
Not only is its taste exquisite , but equally its medicinal qualities are great .
You can feel it doing good .
Temperatures go up , from the top of the head ( bald heads turn red ) right down to the toes . ’

Expert : Crime of torture could only have been ordered by the president David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday January 3 , 2008

It was announced on Wednesday that the Justice Department has opened an official criminal investigation into the destruction of CIA torture tapes .
However , rather than appointing an outside special counsel , Attorney General Mukasey has assigned an assistant US Attorney from Connecticut to handle the proceedings .
At the same time , the chairman and co-chair of the 9/11 Commission are charging in a New York Times op - ed that the CIA obstructed their own investigations in 2003 - 04 by not disclosing the existence of the tapes .
Constitutional expert Jonathan Turley told Keith Olbermann that as many as six criminal offenses could be involved in the 9/11 Commission charge alone , including obstruction of Congress , obstruction of justice , perjury , and conspiracy .
However , Turley emphasized that the real crime under investigation is not merely obstruction , but the actual torture documented by the tapes .
" It is still , even after the last seven year , a crime to torture suspects , " Turley commented .
Turley suggested that under those circumstances , the failure to appoint a special prosecutor was a serious problem , because " the investigation will essentially be the Justice Department investigating itself .
...
Picking some guy in Connecticut or Cincinnati or Delaware or any other state does n't make any difference .
His boss is Michael Mukasey .
And Michael Mukasey 's boss is the president of the United States .
If torture occurred , he was the guy who ordered it . "
Turley suggested that there is a reluctance throughout official Washington , not " just Republicans , " to pry into an underlying crime which is potentially far more serious than the burglary which was the start of Watergate .
When Olberman asked if the investigation " could still lead to criminal culpability for the president , " Turley replied , " Most certainly it can .
That original crime could only have been ordered by the president and it leads directly to his office . "
Turley finally expressed a concern that the Justice Department might try to " narrow this , define it in a way to avoid torture . "
He explained , " Nobody in this town wants to talk about it because they know that there 's a lot of people in the country that like the idea of torturing these people .
And that 's just a painful fact .
But it 's also a painful fact that it 's a crime .
And when the president says that we got some useful evidence , I do n't know if that 's true or not , but it 's immaterial .
Just because it had good results or good motivations , it remains a crime . "
A full transcript of Jonathan Turley 's appearance on Countdown is available here .

Immediately after AMD and ATI consummated their 2006 merger , their first order of business was to announce plans and a timeframe for the first true offspring of their corporate union : a CPU / GPU fusion product called , aptly enough , " Fusion . "
This Fusion idea has taken more than one shape in AMD 's roadmaps since it was first announced , and I wo n't summarize that history here , though it is worth recalling that AMD had been planning to use a newly developed processor core , codenamed " Bulldozer , " for the CPU half of Fusion .
But in a financial analyst day meeting early this past December , AMD revealed that the company 's first Fusion product would " use existing CPU core and GPU core technologies , " suggesting that Bulldozer had gotten the boot in favor of a core from AMD 's current lineup .
In a recent InfoWorld interview , AMD confirmed that Fusion will be a dual - core design based on the Phenom core in its initial incarnation .
There 's still no word on the GPU that AMD will pair with Phenom as the second core on the die , but apparently something will be announced relatively soon .
So now that we know that Fusion will combine a Phenom core with an as - yet unannounced GPU core , we can put together the following picture of AMD 's mobile " Shrike " platform , due out in the second half of 2009 .
AMD's " Shrike " Platform
Shrike is the successor of the Puma mobile platform that I described in an earlier article and that 's set to launch sometime this year .
At the heart of Shrike is the 45nm " Swift " processor ; AMD is calling Swift an Accelerated Processing Unit ( APU ) because it contains both a CPU and a GPU .
This " APU " ( I 'm not so sure this term is going to catch on ) part should start sampling in late 2008 or early 2009 .
In a nutshell , the Shrike platform simply moves the integrated graphics processor ( IGP ) off of the northbridge and onto the CPU die .
In other words , the GPU core that AMD will integrate with Phenom will not be on the same level in terms of performance as a discrete GPU .
This is more of an IGP with a significantly improved performance per watt ratio , which is why it will show up in laptops first .
Once AMD gets its feet wet with this initial , mobile - oriented design , it will begin to think about how to apply that same CPU / GPU concept in the workstation and high - performance computing ( HPC ) spaces .
But truly leveraging a very tight level of integration between the CPU and GPU to do nongraphics work is more of a software problem than anything else , so the challenge for AMD and its partners lies first in finding an application domain to plug this into and second in adding enough value via acceleration to make Fusion ( or its socket - level counterpart , Torrenza ) a compelling reason to invest in AMD hardware .

Many people within the libertarian community are skeptical about the science behind global warming .
I happen to think the threat of global warming is of uncertain magnitude but of real concern .
Most people who share my concern are eager for the government to step in and regulate carbon emissions , and for this reason find it difficult to bring themselves to support Ron Paul 's presidential campaign , fearing that a Paul administration would stand back and do nothing to combat global warming .
But this is hardly the case .
In fact , a Paul presidency would be a great asset to anyone concerned about global warming .
This may seem counter - intuitive at first , but Ron Paul is the one candidate who offers a serious promise to stop the governmental policies that threaten to wipe out our most important solution to the problem — grass - farming .
Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide can be reduced in two ways : the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere can be reduced , and the amount of carbon dioxide sequestered from the atmosphere in oceans , soils , plant and animal life , and other " carbon sinks " can be increased .
Reducing carbon emissions only slows the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 while increasing carbon sequestration causes reductions in atmospheric CO2 that take effect immediately .
According to the organization Carbon Farmers of America ( CFA ) , the most promising method of carbon sequestration and thus the most immediate and effective solution to global warming is to increase topsoil formation with pasture - based farming .
According to CFA , the amount of topsoil lost in the Great Plains over the last 150 years can sequester the same amount of carbon that has been released into the atmosphere by human industry since the Industrial Revolution .
By restoring the same amount of topsoil , we could reduce atmospheric CO2 to pre-industrial levels .
On a global scale , we could achieve the same result by merely increasing the level of topsoil by 1.6 % !
CFA promotes the ideas of P.A. Yeomans , who discovered over fifty years ago that the combination of grazing livestock on pasture and a process of mechanically aerating soil between grazing and irrigation called " subsoiling " could lead to astounding rates of topsoil formation .
When practiced correctly , CFA claims that 18 to 24 inches of topsoil can be formed by these methods in just three years .
CFA 's innovative solution to provide an incentive for topsoil formation involves no government regulation .
It pays farmers $ 19 for every ton of carbon dioxide they sequester into each half - ton of soil organic matter .
This is financed by selling $ 25 " carbon sinks " to environmentally conscious consumers who wish to offset their own carbon consumption or contribute even more .
An additional $ 5 is spent on training and educating farmers about the necessary procedures and $ 1 is spent on administrative expenses .
Other organizations such as the Weston A. Price Foundation promote grass - based farming because of the superior nutritional value of the foods it produces .
EatWild .
Com promotes it for its benefits to animals , farmers , and the environment as well .
Consumer pressure based on these concerns provides an additional incentive for farmers to turn to grass - farming .
Where does Ron Paul fit into all of this ?
Without a Ron Paul presidency , grass - farming might not have a future in this country .
As discussed in the documentary The Future of Food , American corn is actually sold at well below the price it costs to produce it because of government subsidies .
This distortion of the market is one of the factors that make confinement operations profitable and enable them to overpower pasture - based operations — but this has been going on for a long time .
As the president of the American Grassfed Association has pointed out , the USDA 's proposed standards for the coming " grass - fed " label would allow confinement operations to be labeled accordingly without the animals actually grazing on pasture — and thus without the promise of topsoil formation .
The greatest potential threat to grass - farming , however , is the National Animal Identification System ( NAIS ) .
NAIS is the USDA 's plan to track the movement of every farm animal and certain kinds of pets within the country , ideally with microchip technology .
The plan severely penalizes pasture - based farmers by allowing factory farms to use a single ID to register each group of thousands of animals while requiring farmers with more genetically diverse and free - ranging animals to use an ID for each animal .
Ron Paul is the leading opponent of NAIS in Congress .
Indeed , he is the only presidential candidate who has spoken out against this monstrosity .
What damage NAIS might cause to small farms and pasture - based farms we do not yet know .
But it is very well possible that the fight over NAIS will be the fight over the right of the small farm and pasture - based farm to exist .
Ron Paul also supports the right to raw milk , which is closely associated with grass - farming .
Most consumers who demand raw milk for health reasons also demand grass - fed milk , and many farmers conscious of the benefits of grass - feeding are also conscious of the health benefits of raw milk .
The website RealMilk .
Com promotes both .
The FDA has been revving up its machinery for a full - on assault on the right to drink raw milk and has recently used our tax money to publish a sensationalist propaganda piece called On the Safety of Raw Milk that offers dubious statistics based on shoddy research alleging that raw milk is responsible for 0.4 % of cases of food - borne illness and then concludes that it is " inherently dangerous " ( emphasis in the original ) and that drinking it is " like playing Russian roulette with your health . "
Under the executive order of Ronald Reagan and under the decree of the FDA , it is illegal to transport raw milk across state lines , even between two states that allow the sale of raw milk .
Ron Paul introduced a congressional bill that would overturn this injustice .
In his speech on the House floor , he called the restriction an " unconstitutional restraint " and said that Americans who wish to consume raw milk " have the right to consume these products without having the federal government second - guess their judgment about what products best promote health . "
The raw milk issue is not going away .
A recent Reuters article predicted it would be the number one top health issue of 2008 .
We can expect 2008 to see more tax dollars spent trying to drive raw milk producers out of the market whether by propagating fear or by the use of force — and thus indirectly another assault on grass - based farming .
And Ron Paul is the only presidential candidate we can expect to stand up to it .
Rather than simplistically assuming that the only solution to global warming involves government regulation of carbon emissions , we should look at the big picture .
Grass - farming and subsoiling may be the most efficient means of sequestering carbon and thus the most immediately effective means of reducing atmospheric carbon .
The government has done enough to promote the agribusiness practices that destroy topsoil as it is , but the coming years may see an all - out war that threatens to eradicate the practices that create it .
This threatens not only to take away a major tool we have to combat climate change , but would take away the major tool we have to form a livelihood independent of the handful of corporations like Monsanto that are well on their way to gaining control of the entire world 's food supply .
Ron Paul will protect our best means of carbon sequestration from the head - on assault of government bureaucrats .
His presidency can be part of the solution .
I urge you all to join me in supporting him in the Republican primaries and , if he is nominated , the general election .

Large parts of the Kashmir area were damaged in the 2005 quake
Mike Sutton , 65 , and his wife Teresa , 66 , were stunned when a plumber made the discovery while working in their Bridport bungalow last August .
He found more than 100 artificial limbs and about 100 crutches and walking frames hidden in their cellar .
They are now being taken to Kashmir to help victims of the 2005 earthquake .
The plumber was repairing the bungalow 's central heating system when he came across the collection , which includes a mixture of left and right legs of different sizes , most with leather straps attached , and a prosthetic hand .
Mr Sutton said : " My wife was quite amazed when the plumber went down , pulled one of the legs out from this hatch and told her there were hundreds more .
" We did n't even know we had a cellar , let alone what was in it .
" We wondered what to do with them but we are absolutely delighted they are going to be put to some good use and not just thrown away . "
Thousands died
The 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck close to Muzaffarabad in Pakistan - administered Kashmir on 8 October 2005 killing nearly 75,000 people and destroying 275,000 houses .
Zafar Khan , chairman of the Limbless Association , which is transporting the limbs to Kashmir , said many of the victims of the earthquake were using heavy wooden prosthesis , with poor quality knee joints , which were uncomfortable and not very functional .
" We are collecting these limbs today in an attempt to try to make a difference to the lives of those who can't afford new prosthesis , " Mr Khan added .
" The average wage in Pakistan is £ 50 a month .
State - of - the - art prosthesis cost between £ 2,000 to £ 4,000 . "
Most people start worrying about debt after they are in too deep and can no longer keep up with monthly repayments .
But what if you are not in debt but are currently planning for the future ?
With wedding season in full swing , here are four tips that will help you manage your finances without falling into the debt trap .
Work out a Wedding Budget
With the average cost of a wedding standing between £ 15,000 and £ 25,000 , it is no surprise that many couples begin married life on a less than stable financial footing .
With this in mind , it makes sense that as a couple you should n’t rush into wedding preparations without deciding on a budget .
Friends with Benefits
Planning a wedding can be stressful and costly but it is n’t something you have to do alone .
Do n’t be afraid to delegate some of the responsibility to friends and family .
This will not only free up some more time for you to plan the major aspects of your wedding for example the venue and the band but it can also save you a fortune .
If you know any talented bakers that could help with your wedding cake or someone tech savvy that could create stunning wedding invitations at a fraction of the cost , utilize your contacts and drive down the cost of your special day .
Reduce the Guest List
If you want to avoid getting into debt , it is essential that you stick to the budget you have put in place .
If you have called in favors from friends but are still finding it difficult to work with your budget , a possible option is to reduce your guest list .
This may be a last resort for many couples but having a more extravagant wedding ceremony with fewer guests is one way to have the wedding of your dreams without compromising your financial security .
Take Instant Action
If you do go over your wedding budget slightly , it is not the end of the world but it is essential to make cuts elsewhere to enable you to pay off any wedding debt immediately .
Burying your head in the sand can cost you more in the long run and it will take you longer to clear your balance .

Researchers have for the first time shown that as many as 1.3 million cases of cancer a year may one day be successfully treated or even prevented by targeting and destroying the viruses that cause them .
Scientists at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in New York City say the finding could pave the way for conquering human cancers that are linked to preexisting viral infections , among them liver cancer ( caused by the hepatitis B and C viruses ) , cervical cancer ( from human papillomavirus ) and lymphomas caused by the Epstein–Barr virus .
They key , they say , is to find and destroy the viruses before they turn cancerous .
In an attempt to do this , the researchers used a technique known as radioimmunotherapy in which radioisotopes ( unstable elements that release radiation ) mounted on antibodies ( protein molecules akin to infection search - and - destroy missiles ) are injected into the body .
Once inside , researchers found that the antibodies zeroed in on their targets — viral antigens — and the radioisotopes destroyed nearby cancer cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissue .
Viral antigens are proteins produced by virus - infected cells that can cause those cells to go berserk and start multiplying out of control , thereby becoming cancerous .
Antibodies are immune proteins with binding sites that can fit like puzzle pieces into corresponding sites on foreign viral or bacterial antigens and disable them ( triggering other immune responses ) .
The problem with viruses that typically cause cancer , though , is that they tend hide out of reach — inside of rather than on the surface of cells .
The Einstein researchers , however , found a way around that .
" We had a hunch that rapidly growing tumors can ' outgrow ' their blood supply , resulting in dead tumor cells that might spill their viral antigens amongst the living cancer cells , " said co-senior study author Arturo Casadevall , chair of Einstein 's Microbiology & Immunology department .
" So we hoped that by injecting antibodies hitched to isotopes into the blood that they'd be carried deep into the tumor mass and would latch onto these now - exposed antigens .
Then the blast of radiation emitted by the radioisotope would destroy the tumor cells nearby . "
The researchers tested their theory on mice , attaching the radioisotope rhenium 18 to antibodies that attack E6 , a viral antigen produced by virtually all cervical cancer cells .
They prepared a similar weapon against liver cancer by piggybacking rhenium 18 on antibodies that target HBx , a viral antigen made by cancerous liver cells .
The mice , which had been injected with human cervical and liver cells , were treated with the appropriate radioimmunotherapy .
In both cases , researchers report in PLoS ONE the therapies significantly slowed tumor growth compared with results in untreated mice .
In the animals with cervical cancer , the tumors not only stopped growing but some actually shrunk .
" Radioimmunotherapy not only worked against these cancers but , in addition , the radioactivity was confined entirely to the tumor masses , leaving healthy tissues undamaged , " said senior study co-author Ekaterina Dadachova , an associate professor of nuclear medicine and of microbiology and immunology at Einstein .
Dadachova , a pioneer in the use of radioimmunotherapy against infectious diseases , previously successfully turned it on a streptococcal bacterium that causes pneumonia .
Last year , she and her colleagues showed that the therapy could also be used to help halt HIV by targeting one of several viral proteins on the surface of HIV - infected cells .
" Our study has shown in principle that radioimmunotherapy can help in treating cancers caused by viruses — and , just as exciting , the approach also holds promise for cancer prevention , '' she said .
" In people chronically infected with hepatitis B or C , human papillomaviruses or other viruses known to cause cancer , radioimmunotherapy could potentially eliminate virus - infected cells before they 're able to transform into cancer cells . "

DEVELOPING STORY : For the latest version of this developing story , read tomorrow ’s editions of The Washington Times or click here .
Last fall during a nationally televised presidential debate , Sen. Barack Obama hesitantly raised his hand and joined with most of his Democratic rivals to declare that he opposed decriminalizing marijuana .
( Play video below . )
But as a candidate for the U.S. Senate four years ago , Mr. Obama told Illinois college students that he supported eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana use or possession , according to a videotape of a little noticed debate that was obtained by The Washington Times .
“ I think we need to rethink and decriminalize our marijuana laws , ” Mr. Obama told an audience during a debate at Northwestern University in 2004 .
“ But I ’m not somebody who believes in legalization of marijuana . ” ( Play video below . )
Asked about the two different answers , Mr. Obama ’s presidential campaign said he in fact has “ always ” supported decriminalizing marijuana as he answered in 2004 , meaning the candidate mistakenly raised his hand during the presidential debate last fall .
That position leaves Mr. Obama as the lone presidential candidate among the four leading challengers in either party who supports eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana .
Mr. Obama ’s chief rival for the Democratic nomination , Sen. Hillary Clinton , opposes decriminalization , Clinton campaign spokesman Phil Singer said .
Also on the site today :
Obama wins big in S. Carolina
On the Republican side , Kevin Madden , spokesman for Mitt Romney , said the former Massachusetts governor is “ not in favor of legalization of marijuana , and that includes medical purposes . ”
The campaign for Arizona Sen. John McCain did not respond immediately to questions .
But the Marijuana Policy Project , which advocates decriminalization , says both Republicans have told its supporters they oppose that move , including in medical cases .
When asked by The Times about decriminalizing marijuana , the Obama campaign reiterated the candidate ’s opposition to legalization .
“ Senator Obama does not believe in legalization of marijuana , but agrees with President Bush that long minimum sentences for first - time drug users may not be the best way to occupy jail space or heal people from their disease , ” Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said .
The campaign went on to say that , as president , Mr. Obama “ will review drug sentences to see where we can be smarter on crime and reduce the blind and counterproductive sentencing of non-violent offenders , and revisit instances where drug rehabilitation may be more appropriate . ”
His campaign later stated that Mr. Obama “ always ” has supported decriminalizing marijuana .
Mr. Obama ’s differing answers on marijuana are among a half - dozen conflicts between positions he took while running for Senate in 2004 and those he now articulates while running for president , a review of debate tapes shows .
Other conflicts range from ending the embargo against Cuba to providing health care for illegal immigrants .
The Times obtained video footage of the public debates from a variety of sources , ranging from open sources such as YouTube to political operatives who oppose Mr. Obama ’s presidential campaign or his Senate bid four years ago in Illinois .
Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign , for instance , recently released footage on its Web site of a 2004 speech in which Mr. Obama spoke about universal health care .
Check back for a full report on Mr. Obama ’s conflicting positions in tomorrow ’s editions of the newspaper .

Rogue employers convicted of exploiting migrant workers will face being banned from recruiting any more staff from abroad , the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , promised yesterday .
She also told the Trades Union Congress that the immigration service would , in future , advise new migrant workers about their employment rights , including the value of a joining a trade union .
The promise to take a tougher approach on the enforcement of penalties against firms that employ illegal migrants came as Ms Smith named Professor David Metcalf , a London School of Economics industrial relations expert , as the first chairman of the migration advisory committee .
As chair of the committee he will advise the home secretary on the level of migration to Britain that is needed and draw up lists of high and lower skilled occupations that should be designated as shortage sectors which need to attract migrant workers .
Ms Smith said she hoped the body would ensure the debate on immigration could be conducted in future on the basis of evidence , rather than anecdote .
The establishment of the committee comes as the government plans to introduce an Australian - style points immigration system next year .
" The system , which will go live early next year , will give us a clear sense of the numbers of people entering the country , and will help match their skills with our needs , " said Ms Smith .
" It will ensure that those who benefit most from migration - employers and educational institutions - have a stake in ensuring the system is n't abused .
When employers want to employ skilled migrants they will need our licence to do so , and we will be rigorous in our approach . "
She said that when a firm applied to sponsor a migrant under the new system they would be asked whether they have any convictions for labour exploitation .
" We will use that pattern of behaviour when we decide how often to check they are playing by the rules .
And when we spot bad behaviour we will make sure that the action we take in response is seamless across government , " she said .
Although penalties against companies for employing illegal workers have been on the statute book since 1996 the regime has , up until now , only been lightly enforced .
The Home Office intends to introduce a system of sanctions , including a sliding scale of fines of up to £ 10,000 an illegal employee for repeat offenders .
They could also face being downgraded as an official sponsor of migrant labour with prospective overseas employees warned of their status .
Those who continue to offend would face being struck off the Home Office sponsorship register which would mean they could not legally bring any migrant worker to Britain .
Ms Smith said the Borders and Immigration Agency would be asked to help everyone who got a work permit to learn about their employment rights , including getting a " clear and early message " about the benefits of joining a trade union .

COLUMBIA , South Carolina ( Reuters ) - Barack Obama easily won South Carolina ’s bitterly contested Democratic presidential primary with the aid of heavy black support on Tuesday , dealing a setback to rival Hillary Clinton after a week of political brawling .
Obama , an Illinois senator who would be the first black U.S. president , beat Clinton and John Edwards handily in the latest fight in a back - and - forth Democratic nominating battle .
Clinton and Edwards were running close for second place , according to exit polls .
South Carolina was the latest test for Obama and Clinton , a New York senator , in their escalating battle for the right to represent the Democratic Party in November ’s presidential election .
After two consecutive losses , in New Hampshire and Nevada , Obama badly needed a win on Saturday as he headed into the February 5 “ Super Tuesday ” contests in two dozen states to have a realistic chance of victory .
The high stakes fueled a week of angry accusations , harsh advertisements and increasingly personal jabs between the two candidates , capped by a volley of attacks on Obama from Clinton ’s husband , former President Bill Clinton .
Exit polls showed Obama won four of every five black voters in a state where they were expected to be about half of the primary electorate .
He also won one - quarter of white votes , higher than many had predicted .
Edwards , the former North Carolina senator , chastised his two rivals for their squabbling and ran ads promoting himself as the grown - up in the contentious nominating battle .
Edwards said the tone of the South Carolina contest was disappointing : “ There ’s been a lot of effort by the other two candidates to tear each other down which is why I ’m focused on the voters and doing positive things . ”
Clinton left South Carolina for two days during the week and headed to states with contests on February 5 , leaving her husband to carry the campaign load here .
All three candidates have portrayed themselves as the strongest leaders of a shaky economy .
Clinton has hammered Obama for a lack of experience and highlighted her readiness to lead “ from day one ” in the White House .
But Obama questioned her judgment on Friday , noting her vote in 2002 to authorize the Iraq war and her failed stewardship of the health - care overhaul during Bill Clinton ’s administration .
“ It ’s not a question of being ready on day one , ” he said at an evening rally in Florence , South Carolina .
“ It ’s a question of being right on day one . ”
The Republican presidential contenders , who held their primary in South Carolina last week , are focused on Florida ’s Tuesday primary .
Slideshow ( 28 images )
Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are in a tight race in Florida , polls show , after splitting contests last week -- McCain won South Carolina and Romney won Michigan .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is desperately seeking a good showing that could get him back in the race .
Giuliani , who once led the Republican field in national polls , has slipped after he essentially pulled out of the early voting states to concentrate on Florida .

As a followup to my post about Java yesterday , I wanted to throw out some quick observations about JavaScript and where I think it might be able to help Sun revive the interest in Java as a cutting edge platform .
I say " observations " because I have n't really come up with a hard - and - fast conclusion about what all this stuff means in the big picture , but I think the following points to something pretty interesting :
* Sun actually owns the trademark to the name JavaScript .
Despite the fact that it has several other names like ActionScript , ECMAScript , JScript , etc. just about everyone still calls it JavaScript .
It makes sense for Sun to really embrace this .
* JavaScript is not only the most popular programming language in the world , with some insane percentage of web content written in it , but it 's also one of the hottest languages right now because of the interest in AJAX .
* Despite the fact that JavaScript is so popular , it 's not used in web servers really at all .
A long time ago there was Netscape 's servers that were popular and used LiveScript or a variation , but now I think you'd be hard pressed to find a lot of sites using it , preferring instead PHP , Ruby , or Java servlets .
I think this is going to change * really * soon .
There 's already some movement in this area - I ran across a mod_javascript out there a while ago and the news that someone at Google had written a Rails clone using JavaScript was met with tons of positive reception and eagerness to get at the code .
I think there 's a lot of pent up demand here which is going to cause something to happen pretty soon .
* JavaScript is not used as a general scripting language either .
I have never seen any .js scripts with a !#/usr / bin/ javascript in the header doing stuff like managing files or doing background tasks , etc .
Also , I can write plugins for much of Gnome using Python , but not JavaScript .
On the other hand , many Microsoft scripts using the Windows Scripting Engine are actually written in JScript , which is cool - but it needs to have a lot more support in the Unix world .
Sun could really help here by making libraries , etc .
* Apache 's Rhino is actually a great implementation of JavaScript .
Unlike something like Jython , which is good , but several versions behind CPython , Rhino is actively updated and maintained and works seamlessly with all the Java libraries as well .
It makes it a no brainer to integrate into Java projects already , and is being used for some * really * cool demos using JQuery .
* There 's a lot of work being done by the Mozilla foundation and Adobe to integrate a killer JavaScript interpreter into both Flash and Firefox using Adobe 's Tamarin engine .
This is great - and could lead to JavaScript being used in more general purpose areas as well if the interpreter speed is good .
Also , is n't Adobe 's AIR stuff using it extensively ?
So where Java seems to be stuck in corporate bloated hell with more deserters every day , JavaScript is actually super popular and on the cutting edge of innovation .
And considering that it 's completely unrealistic to expect that Java itself will get a total overhaul , maybe Sun would be well served to embrace JavaScript as the official next - generation language for their JVM - starting with a set of libraries and tools that would let it take the place of where PHP , Python , Ruby and the rest are being used now .
This is an important point I want to make - I 'm not talking about making the JVM more scripting compatible and embracing a bunch of various scripting languages from Ruby to Groovy , I 'm talking about making JavaScript the pre-eminent scripting language for the Java platform .
[ Update 8/26 : Ben Meadowcroft pointed out that Rhino is already included in Java 6 !
I knew this , but somehow totally forgot when writing this post !
Now the question is , will Sun think of Rhino as just another included library , or really embrace it and start pushing JavaScript as their main scripting language ? ]
Why ?
Because I do n't think that the multi-language focus of Microsoft 's CLR is the right path * at all * .
Now , this is completely , 100 % my opinion , but I just do n't like working with multiple languages at the same time .
I much prefer to have one language in my toolbox that I try to use for as much as possible , so that I can avoid time - sapping context changes , re-use code , and become more proficient with each line of code I write whether its on the desktop , in the browser or on the server .
Also , when trying to maintain the code , or work together with others , having one language is orders of magnitude more easy than trying to support a heterogeneous computing environment .
I honestly think most developers are like this , but I could be wrong .
There are definitely some people out there that love to tinker with as many languages as they can , but I have to believe this is the exception rather than the rule .
So rather than an overhaul with Java , Sun should jump on board the JavaScript train and help push it to even greater heights .
( Owning the trademark here will help them jump in front of the queue in many ways , for good or for bad ) .
Imagine how nice it would be to write your server - side scripts and your browser scripts all using the same language and libraries , with the knowledge that it'd work well and be portable to many different platforms ?
It really fits well with the original vision of Java , does n't it ?
And it would make the ticker symbol JAVA all that more relevant again .
Just my thoughts ... please feel free to tell me something I might have missed , as I 'm definitely not a JavaScript expert by any stretch .
- Russ
Update 8/26 : I got a few emails pointing out some server - side JavaScript projects .
Tim Bray pointed out Sun 's new Project Phobos , and Chris Zumbrunn pointed out the more mature Helma .
Very nice , and I 'm sure there might be others out there as well , but my point is that neither is gaining or has gained much of a following compared to something like PHP or even regular Java , and everything pales in comparison to the use of JavaScript on the browser .
1831 : HMS Beagle , a 10 - gun , Cherokee - class brig sloop of the Royal Navy 's survey service , sets sail from Plymouth , England on its second voyage as a survey vessel .
On board , at the invitation of the Beagle ’s captain , Robert FitzRoy , is a young biologist called Charles Darwin .
Darwin ’s account of The Voyage of the Beagle , published in 1839 , establishes him as one of the foremost naturalists of his time .
Darwin accepted the invitation over the objections of his father , who saw the proposed two - year voyage as a chance for his son to continue idling , something he had become pretty good at since graduating from Cambridge .
What became a five - year voyage was intended primarily to continue exploring the coastline of South America , many parts of which remained uncharted .
Coasting in this fashion enabled Darwin to spend long periods of time ashore as the Beagle meandered around South America and the Galapagos Islands , taking depth soundings and charting coastlines .
The ship also visited numerous islands in the South Pacific and Indian oceans before setting sail for home .
The young naturalist was fascinated by the seemingly endless variety of plant and animal life he encountered .
His ruminations on the source of that variation resulted in his theory of evolution by natural selection , published in an 1858 paper and a year later in his paradigm - shaping The Origin of Species .
Darwin ’s observations of other societies , particularly the natives of Tierra del Fuego , would also provide the basis for The Descent of Man , in which Darwin further elaborates on natural selection .
It was published in 1871 , four decades after the start of the voyage .
The Beagle finally returned to England , reaching Falmouth on Oct. 2 , 1836 .
She would undertake a third survey voyage to Australia , then see duty as a coast - guard watch vessel before being laid up .
The Beagle was broken up in 1870 .

Recent couple of days our team was pointed to number of bugs in MySQL 5.0 which again seriously shakes the confidence in both MySQL Quality Control and bug fix promptness .
Let me just take couple of bugs as examples :
Triggers broken with auto - increment columns for Innodb tables ( bug 26316 ) .
As you can see this bug is reported in February – over 6 months ago and it is still in verified state even though it has “ serious ” severity .
ORDER By DESC broken for Innodb tables ( bug 31001 )
This is also very interesting – the VERY basic functionality gets broken and passes quality control .
And why it is broken ?
Because minor optimization was implemented in MySQL 5.0 .
Surely Baron is right
Bug fixes are not much different from new features in terms of possibility of breaking things .
These raise few questions in my head :
What is MySQL Current Bug Policy ?
A long time ago MySQL had Monty ’s bug policy of “ no known bugs in release ” when it was changed to “ no known serous bugs in release ” and I think later it died off completely , at least in practice .
As you can see now serious bugs can remain unfixed for over half a year .
Furthermore there is no good errata documentation which would outline which things have known problems which MySQL ca n’t fix fast .
What is the state of MySQL Quality Assurance I would tell both bugs are very basic but especially second one .
So how it happened so it was not caught ?
I believe the problem is serious lack of concurrent stress testing and the fact MySQL Test Suite does way too many tests only for MyISAM storage engine which well allows bugs like this to slip through .
What can we learn from this ?
I think we should continue to be cautions using new features which first came in MySQL 5.0
They are now much better than were when MySQL 5.0 just came out ( aka minefield ) but still they are not at quality levels of base MySQL features .
Plus we should be careful and not to take minor upgrades lightly – this is one of many things which was broken along the way in MySQL 5.0 release so being careful is the best .
It also may be good idea to sample queries from your application together with sample database and package it as a test suite to ensure queries which you ’re using will not break .
You would not catch trigger bug this way but it can be helpful for basic query bugs at least .
Plus it is not that hard to do .
Woman who accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harrassment pens stinging retort in Times John Byrne
Published : Tuesday October 2 , 2007

This " I stand by my testimony . "
So writes Anita Hill in Tuesday 's New York Times , the woman whose sexual harrassment charges unsettled the nomination hearings of Clarence Thomas some 16 years ago .
Addressing his new book ,  My Grandfathers Son , " Hill , a Brandeis sociology professor currently in residence at Wellesley , writes , " I will not stand by silently and allow him , in his anger , to reinvent me . "
" Justice Thomas offers a litany of unsubstantiated representations and outright smears that Republican senators made about me when I testified before the Judiciary Committee  that I was a combative left - winger  who was touchy  and prone to overreacting to slights ,  she says .
" A number of independent authors have shown those attacks to be baseless .
What s more , their reports draw on the experiences of others who were familiar with Mr. Thomass behavior , and who came forward after the hearings .
It s no longer my word against his . "
In his book , Thomas portrays Hill 's attack as part of a campaign by special interest groups Powerful interest groups to use " the age - old blunt instrument of accusing a black man of sexual misconduct . "
Among the more striking parts of Hill 's testimony ( which can be read here ) , is when Thomas allegedly asked her about pubic hair on his Coca - Cola .
" One of the oddest episodes I remember was an occasion in which Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office , " she stated .
' He got up from the table at which we were working , went over to his desk to get the Coke , looked at the can and asked , ' Who has pubic hair on my Coke ? '
On other occasions , he referred to the size of his own penis as being larger than normal , and he also spoke on some occasions of the pleasures he had given to women with oral sex . "
In her op / ed , Hill contests in detail Thomas ' allegations about her employment .
" In a particularly nasty blow , Justice Thomas attacked my religious conviction , telling  60 Minutes  this weekend ,  She was not the demure , religious , conservative person that they portrayed ,  she added .
" Perhaps he conveniently forgot that he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to work at the law school at Oral Roberts University , in Tulsa .
I remained at that evangelical Christian university for three years , until the law school was sold to Liberty University . "
Hill pens the second half of her piece to discuss the attacks on women who accuse men of sexual harassment in general .
" Regrettably , since 1991 , " she continues , " I have repeatedly seen this kind of character attack on women and men who complain of harassment and discrimination in the workplace .
In efforts to assail their accusers  credibility , detractors routinely diminish peoples professional contributions .
Often the accused is a supervisor , in a position to describe the complaining employees work as mediocre or the employee as incompetent .
Those accused of inappropriate behavior also often portray the individuals who complain as bizarre caricatures of themselves  oversensitive , even fanatical , and often immoral  even though they enjoy good and productive working relationships with their colleagues . "
" When attacks on the accusers  credibility fail , those accused of workplace improprieties downgrade the level of harm that may have occurred .
When sensing that others will believe their accusers  versions of events , individuals confronted with their own bad behavior try to reduce legitimate concerns to the level of mere words or slights  that should be dismissed without discussion .
Despite her line by line rebukes of Thomas ' accusations , Hill ends with a seeming message of hope .
" Fortunately , we have made progress since 1991 .
Today , when employees complain of abuse in the workplace , investigators and judges are more likely to examine all the evidence and less likely to simply accept as true the word of those in power , " she says .
" But that could change .
Our legal system will suffer if a sitting justices vitriolic pursuit of personal vindication discourages others from standing up for their rights . "
" The question of whether Clarence Thomas belongs on the Supreme Court is no longer on the table  it was settled by the Senate back in 1991 .
But questions remain about how we will resolve the kinds of issues my testimony exposed .
My belief is that in the past 16 years we have come closer to making the resolution of these issues an honest search for the truth , which , after all , is at the core of all legal inquiry .
My hope is that Justice Thomass latest fusillade will not divert us from that path . "
Read Hill 's full editorial here .
The following video is from ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast on October 2 .
Looking to save $ 1 million , 20 tons of paper , or close to 500 trees , the White House said today President Bush ’s 2009 Federal Budget will for the first time be posted online .
The E - Budget will be available for downloading at the Office of Management and Budget Web site on Feb .
4 .
Typically the White House has paper - bombed congress and anyone else who wanted to read the budget with a tome which can reach 3,000 pages and weighed multiple pounds each .
The Associated Press reports that non-computer users out there , or old - timers as it calls them , will still be able to buy paper copies of the four - volume budget from the Government Printing Office .
But at more than $ 200 each , the electronic version looks pretty good .
Jim Nussle , the White House budget director announced the move by e-mail to reporters .
According to the AP , Nussle took the step after a few months running the Office of Management and Budget , where hundreds of old budget volumes are gathering dust on bookshelves or are being put to use as platforms for computer monitors .
He reads the budget on his computer , where it 's searchable .
" In terms of fiscal savings , we estimate the E - Budget will save nearly a million dollars over the next five years , " Nussle said .
Perhaps giddy from the online budget news , White House senior staff today started first of its kind blogs about President Bush 's current trip to the Middle East .
Press Secretary Dana Perino said the online updates will be called " Trip Notes from the Middle East " and posted on the White House Web site , whitehouse.gov .
Perino said the practice may be used for future trips as well .

On the one hand , Karl Rove was out yesterday spinning how Republicans are going to win this year .
On the other hand , the Politico provide its report on the GOP ’s pervasive “ funk ” and how the party ’s failings are approaching “ maximum toxicity ” .
Seems every major news outlet has been writing some variation of the theme that the GOP is a mess these days .
Rove can spin all he wants .
That the Republican Party is demoralized and imploding is the legacy of Rove and his boss , George Bush .
There ’s much more after the break .
These articles are really fun to read .
But , I ’d rather be reading them in October — and the way things are going , we just might be :
' IT'S ABOUT TIME ' 'IT'S ABOUT TIME '
No one has been executed on New Jersey 's death row since 1963 , but that did n't make living there 18 years any easier , inmate Robert Marshall says .
DEATH PENALTY BY STATE DEATH PENALTY BY STATE
Thirty - seven states currently have the death penalty , according to the Washington - based Death Penalty Information Center .
A bill to abolish the death penalty in New Jersey was approved Thursday by the state Assembly .
It now goes to Gov. Jon S. Corzine , who has said he would sign it .
States with the death penalty : Alabama , Arizona , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Idaho , Indiana , Illinois , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maryland , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , Nebraska , Nevada , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New Mexico , North Carolina , Ohio , Oklahoma , Oregon , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Utah , Virginia , Washington , Wyoming .
States without the death penalty : Alaska , Hawaii , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , North Dakota , New York , Rhode Island , Vermont , West Virginia , Wisconsin .
Source : Associated Press TRENTON , N.J. ( AP )  New Jersey will become the first state in four decades to abolish the death penalty under a measure lawmakers approved Thursday and the governor intends to sign within days .
Assembly members voted 44 - 36 to replace the death sentence with life in prison without parole .
The state Senate approved the bill Monday , and Gov. Jon S. Corzine , a Democrat , has said he will sign the bill within a week .
A special state commission found in January that the death penalty was a more expensive sentence than life in prison , has n't deterred murder and risks killing an innocent person .
" We would be better served as a society by having a clear and certain outcome for individuals that carry out heinous crimes , " Corzine said .
" That 's what I think we 're doing , making certain that individuals would be imprisoned without any possibility of parole . "
The measure would spare eight men on the state 's death row , including Jesse Timmendequas , a sex offender convicted of murdering 7 - year - old Megan Kanka in 1994 .
That case sparked a Megan 's Law , which requires law enforcement agencies to notify the public about convicted sex offenders living in their communities .
Marilyn Flax , whose husband Irving was kidnapped and murdered in 1989 by death row inmate John Martini Sr. , said she seethes at the thought Martini will remain alive " while my innocent , loving , adoring husband lies in a grave . "
" I feel the system has spit on me , has slapped me and I am fuming , " Flax said .
Republicans said that 's why they opposed the bill .
Assemblyman Richard Merkt said the bill was " a victory for murderers and rapists . "
" It does not benefit families .
It does not benefit New Jersey society .
It does not benefit justice , " he said .
Senate Republicans had sought to retain the death penalty for those who murder law enforcement officials , rape and murder children , and terrorists , but the Senate rejected the idea .
Democrats control the Legislature .
Although New Jersey reinstated the death penalty in 1982 , six years after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to resume executions , no one has been executed in the Garden State since 1963 .
The last states to eliminate the death penalty were Iowa and West Virginia in 1965 , according to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty .
New Jersey has been barred from executing anyone under a 2004 court ruling that determined the state had to revise procedures on how the penalty would be imposed ;
It never did .
Among those who have been executed in New Jersey are Bruno Richard Hauptmann , who was executed in 1936 for the kidnapping and murder of aviator Charles Lindbergh 's son .
The nation has executed 1,099 people since the U.S. Supreme Court reauthorized the death penalty in 1976 .
In 1999 , 98 people were executed , the most since 1976 ; last year 53 people were executed , the lowest since 1996 .
Other states have considered abolishing the death penalty recently , but none has advanced as far as New Jersey .
According to the Washington - based Death Penalty Information Center , 37 states have the death penalty .
Bills to abolish the death penalty were recently approved by a Colorado House committee , the Montana Senate and the New Mexico House .
But none of those bills has advanced .
The nation 's last execution was Sept. 25 in Texas .
Since then , executions have been delayed pending a U.S. Supreme Court decision on whether execution through lethal injection violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt proposed legislation on Thursday allowing the death sentence for people convicted of forcibly raping or sodomizing a child younger than 12 .
The state currently allows the death penalty only for people convicted of first - degree murder .
But Missouri has n't executed anyone since October 2005 because of a legal challenge to its method of lethal injection .

盗聴法 （1999年） 東浩紀氏は通信傍受法、通称 「 盗聴法」が可決された1999年に、「通信傍受法と想像力の問題」において、この法案をめぐる議論の方が抱えていた一種の機能不全について、次のように指摘している。
私がそこで問題としたのは、ひとことで言えば、この法案が、一方でデジタル通信の傍受を想定しているにもかかわらず、他方でその技術的な条件(デジタル通信を傍受する状況）についてあまりに無配慮なことであり、しかもその矛盾が、技術に対する想像力の貧しさに支えられているということだった。
東氏は、通信傍受法の12条にある「立会人」と「切断権」をめぐる議論に、その無配慮さを見出している。
12条は傍受捜査に必ず第三者が立ち会う旨定めた規定であるが、その第三者が「傍受すべき通信」を同時に聴き、必要な場合には傍受の中止をする権利、すなわち切断権を与えるかどうかが、国会で大きな争点となった。
察しの良い方はおわかりだと思うが、この議論で暗黙のうちに前提とされているのは、アナログ通信、要するに電話である。
デジタル通信はそもそも送信側と受信側の時間的一致を必要としない。したがってその傍受もまた、時間的一致を前提とすることはできない。例えば電子メールを発信とともに読むのは不可能だし、携帯電話の通話もまたデジタル化されているため、リアルタイムで聴くためにはそれぞれ異なった復号化装置が必要とされる。それゆえデジタル通信の傍受は実際には、ヘッドホンのイメージで想像されるようなリアルタイムの作業（盗聴）ではなく、デジタル化・暗号化された通信データをとりあえず傍受して保存し、内容の理解と分析はあとから行うという時間的に遅れた作業（データベース化と解析）になることが多いと予測される。 つまり「切断権」のような概念は、多くの場合実質的な意味を失う結果になる。これは、技術に対する想像力の貧しさの産物だったと言える。
このような問題について、もちろん、ネットユーザーなら気がついていた。技術に対する想像力をめぐらす必要もなく、感覚として悟っていたのである。実際、当時インターネット上や専門誌などではこうした問題意識が共有され、批判が繰り返されていたようである。
マスコミや野党も法案の審議がはじまってから、技術的関心を持つにいたった。その結果として、ネットの活動家であった小倉利丸氏が参議院の法務委員会に招かれた。
しかし、その8日後には法案は可決された。
遅すぎたのである 。
ネットユーザーと非ネットユーザーの乖離は、大きくひらいたままだった。
輸入権のときもまた、社会的関心が集まりはじめたのが遅かったのかもしれない。しかし、盗聴法のときよりも、事態はずっとましだったと言える。
レコード輸入権（2004 年） 2003年末に、著作権分科会のパブリックコメントが募集された。
「 レコード輸入権」と、雑誌・書籍の貸与権付与（適用除外規定廃止）が主たる内容だった。パブリックコメントに前後して新聞記事でも「レコード輸入権」のことは何度か採りあげられていたが、邦楽のみを対象とするかのような論調だった。同じころ、池田信夫氏のREITIで書かれたコラムで問題提起がなされた。そのため、一部のネットユーザーは危機感を持ったようだ。パブリックコメントをレコード輸入権反対の方向で検討し提出したネットユーザーも少なからずいた。そしてパブコメ締切後、輸入権が話題に上ることは無かった。
しかし、2004年1月、文化庁はパブコメ結果を賛否の数のみ報告。著作権分科会で報告書が原案のまま承認された。詳しくは後述するが、この賛否の数のみ報告するという手法が問題視されることになる。
さて、一部のユーザーの関心は寄せられていたが、法案は2004年に参院を通過。この頃、小倉弁護士が法案の内容から洋楽ＣＤも止め得ることを指摘したり、id:copyright氏が雑誌・書籍に貸与権を付与することに問題があることを指摘したり、謎工氏が議員への働きかけを始めるなど、一部のブロガーによる動きが始まる。
法案が衆議院へ移ったところで、民主党・川内議員からの質問主意書が提出。洋楽ＣＤの輸入をも止められ得る旨の政府答弁を引き出す。ここでネットユーザーが発火点に達し、活動に広がりが生じた。ブログで情報を交換しながら、署名運動、メディアや議員へのメール発信等の動きを活発に行なう。高橋健太郎氏らが輸入権シンポジウムを開催。以後
反対運動の核となっていく*1。 しかし、国会対策が運動の最優先課題としたものの、「輸入権」創設を阻止できなかった。この経験を踏まえて、審議会レベルからの監視を要するとの認識がネットユーザーの間で共有された。しかし、ネットユーザーの団体が設立されるには至らなかった。一部のネットユーザーが著作権行政を注視していたが、本業の忙しさで更新を断念するケースが相次ぎ、当時からは面子がかなり入れ替わってきているようだ。
さて、パブリックコメントについてである。
先述した通り、輸入権問題に際して公開されたのは、賛否の数のみであるから、当然パブコメの内容は報告書に反映されていない。パブコメの内容が明らかにされた後になって明らかになったことだが、反対意見を賛成意見として分類されたユーザーもいたようである。また、組織票と思しき意見が多く見られた事情もある。同じ文面で名前を変えて送られていたようだ（それでも送信者の名前は違う場合には別にカウント）*2。
こうした運用には批判が集まり、またのちのちに不信感を残す結果となった。MIAUのパブコメ推進運動やパブコメジェネレータ作成が「煽動している」との批判がありつつも、一定の賛意を得られたのはこうした事情があったためだと考えられる*3。
なお、 「レコード輸入権」反対運動のさなかに募集された知的財産推進計画
2004の見直しについてパブコメが募集され、（知財推進計画についてのものは毎年行なわれている）、著作権法改正要求事項パブコメ （ 2004 年）、 iPod 税パブコメ（2005年）、ダウンロード違法化・補償金パブコメ （ 2007 年 ） とプレーヤーが入れ替わりながらも提出運動がそのたびに地味だが着実に実行されていた。
As for the relaxation of the newspaper - broadcast rule , telecommunications lawyers said it could pave the way for Rupert Murdoch to win permanent waivers to control two television stations in New York , as well as The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal .
In one 3 - to - 2 vote on Tuesday , Mr. Martin sided with the agency ’s two other Republicans to relax the newspaper - broadcast cross -ownership rules in the nation ’s 20 largest markets .
Under the new rule , a company can own both a newspaper and either a television or radio station in those markets as long as there remain at least eight other independent sources of news .
If it is a television station , the rule requires that it can not be one of the top four .
Mr. Martin said that the change was a modest , though vital step toward assisting the newspaper industry , which is struggling financially as advertising and readership migrates rapidly to the Internet .
“ We cannot ignore the fact the media marketplace is considerably different than when the media ownership rule was put in place more than 30 years ago , ” he said .
In a second 3 - to - 2 vote , Mr. Martin joined with the two Democratic commissioners to impose a limit to prevent Comcast , which controls nearly 30 percent of the market , from getting larger .
Mr. Martin has been critical of the cable television industry for raising rates faster than the rate of inflation and for failing to offer consumers enough lower - price choices in subscription packages .
In a series of dissents , the commissioners took issue with Mr. Martin ’s assessments .
“ In the final analysis , ” said Michael J. Copps , a Democratic commissioner who has led a nationwide effort against relaxing the media ownership rules , “ the real winners today are businesses that are in many cases quite healthy , and the real losers are going to be all of us who depend on the news media to learn what ’s happening in our communities and to keep an eye on local government . ”
Robert M. McDowell , a Republican commissioner , was sharply critical of the cable restrictions .
“ The cap is out of date , is bad public policy and is not needed in today ’s public market , ” he said .
He called the cable rule “ archaic industrial policy ” that would surely be struck down by an appeals court , as a similar rule was six years ago .
In the 1970s , Dannon ran an ad that featured ancient yet appealing Russian villagers — robust men with full white beards , strong and sturdy women who had aged with grace and dignity .
Their secret , of course , was eating lots of yogurt .
While I do n’t think my daily yogurt will have me doing Russian dances on tables , a new study suggests that it may prevent the development of a real problem for many people — diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics .
In addition to killing bacteria that cause disease , antibiotics also kill bacteria in our intestines that help keep our guts healthy .
These beneficial bacteria crowd out the less friendly strains that can cause problems like diarrhea .
One of the worst of these is Clostridium difficile , a major scourge in hospitals , where it ’s estimated that between 5 and 25 percent of people who receive antibiotics develop diarrhea .
About 20 percent of those cases are caused by C. difficile , and the cost of treating one case of C. difficile diarrhea is estimated to be about $ 3,700 .
Many dietitians — and , recently , some doctors — think that one way to fix this problem is by eating probiotics , or good bacteria , which helps to reset the natural balance in the intestines and thereby prevent a run on toilet paper .
Yogurt contains active cultures that are thought to be probiotics , but we still have only a basic understanding of which bacteria actually are probiotics and exactly what they do .
In a recent study in the British Medical Journal , investigators divided up patients receiving antibiotics into two groups .
One group received a commercially available probiotic yogurt drink called Actimel .
The other group got a similar - tasting but sterile placebo .
Only 12 percent of the patients who received Actimel developed diarrhea compared with 34 percent of the patients who got the placebo .
None of the Actimel patients developed the more dangerous C. difficile diarrhea , compared with 17 percent of the placebo group .
When you consider that the cost of treating a patient with Actimel was about $ 100 , this seems like a pretty good deal .
As studies go , this one was well done .
The investigators corrected for many factors that might have skewed their data , such as what antibiotics patients received , how long they took them , and what kind of infections they had .
The researchers also did their statistical analysis using a rigorous standard called intention to treat , in which the results from all subjects involved in the study are counted , even if they fail to follow directions .
The number of patients in the trial was relatively small ( 135 ) , and we have no way of knowing which of the three bacteria in Actimel was responsible for the benefit , but these are small quibbles with a potentially important study .
Now , claims of the remarkable healing powers of dietary supplements generally raise an eyebrow or two among evidence - based , textbook - toting physicians who are all about the science of medicine .
( I might even be labeled as one of those stodgy eyebrow raisers . )
But when there is evidence to back up the claim , medicine does tend to embrace unusual treatments , and antibiotic - related diarrhea is a big problem just waiting for an effective remedy .
There ’s obviously still a lot we do n’t know about probiotics , but this study provides us with the kind of credible information that could inspire doctors to prescribe little white tubs instead of little white pills .

“ That ’s right , New Year ’s Eve , ” Chris Rock said .
“ I ’m a little nervous .
I have n’t done this in a while . ”
These were just about the first words he spoke all night , and this was definitely the last time he sounded hesitant .
Monday ’s show was among the early dates on his new tour , and it was a big one :
His job was to entertain a sold - out crowd in Madison Square Garden during the last hours of 2007 .
He had booked an impressive opening act , the soul singer Jill Scott , whose set nodded at hip - hop , jazz and opera , none of it a stretch for her .
And before he took the stage , big screens displayed work by two mischievous African - American painters , Michael Ray Charles and Kehinde Wiley .
All of this helped set a mellow , grown - up mood , especially since the arena was full of nattily ( or at least neatly ) dressed couples sipping Champagne from plastic flutes .
So what ?
People had n’t just come to laugh .
They had come to laugh harder than they had ever laughed in their lives .
They had come to laugh until their eyes and bladders welled up , laugh until they were struggling to breathe , laugh until they were dry - heaving , then laugh some more .
Mr. Rock +
New Year ’s
Eve = beyond - high expectations .
But meeting his fans ’ expectations does n’t seem to be Mr. Rock ’s first priority these days .
And who can blame him ?
Over the past decade he has established himself as arguably America ’s most beloved  and most quotable  stand - up comedian .
His high , braying voice has come to seem like a cultural institution .
And his corrosive , minimalist approach  no props , no physical comedy , no long stories , no impersonations  has turned seemingly innocuous phrases ( “ Want a cookie ? ” ) into catchphrases .
Show Her Appreciation
Your wife needs you to show her that you appreciate her , in both words and actions .
That means telling her “ I appreciate what you do ” and “ I appreciate who you are ” … but mostly in a more specific sense , as in “ I appreciate that you were there for me when I needed it the other day . ”
For ideas on how to show her appreciation through actions , you might want to read 7 Quick Tips On How To Make Your Wife Happy .
Show Her Respect Men and women both need to be shown respect , but how you go about it can be very different .
You can show your wife respect by being old - fashioned when it comes to certain things : open , and hold , doors for her , let her always enter before you , and standing up for her when someone insults her .
You can also show her respect by things that are n’t so old - fashioned , things that will be important for as long as the human race is around , like paying attention to her and actively listening to her when she talks to you .
Show Her Romance
It ’s unfortunate , but some men simply are n’t romantic by nature … and women can tell .
In spite of that , women will still appreciate the effort that you put into trying to be romantic .
If it does come naturally , that ’s even better .
One thing to remember when you are being romantic is that it means a lot more when you are creative .
Rather than just take her to dinner and a movie , for example , you could leave her a small trail of notes , one leading to another , with the last one leading to the tickets .
Trust me … she will remember things like that .
Show Her Love
This can tie into being romantic , but is a whole lot more , as well .
There are so many ways that you can show her love … hundreds of little things .
And make no mistake , showing her love is all about the little things , not the big ones .
In a relationship it ’s much more important to get the little things right day to day than it is to do big things .
Some of those small things you can do : hold hands , listen to music that is special to you together , touch her face , kiss her , hug her , and one that ’s important but also usually one of the first things to be forgotten – soul gaze .
Show Her Respect For Family Women , in general , are more socially aware than men .
They pick up on how you treat others , especially how you treat family .
This includes both her family and your family .
Treat family , on both sides , with respect .
This means helping them when they need it … without complaining .
It also means not speaking badly about them … which does n’t mean hiding the bad parts , but rather that you be nice .
In other words , you do n’t have to pretend that they do no wrong , but you do n’t have to call them names .
Show Her What You Love About Her Women , and men , too , for that matter , need to hear specifics about what it is that you love about them … and not just one time .
Your wife needs reminded of what it is that makes her special to you .
This can be physical things , like her eyes , her lips , or her touch .
It can also be personality traits , like her honesty , compassion , or sense of humor .
One of the really good things to tell her is what you love about how she makes you feel .
Yet Another Congress Member Backs Cheney Impeachment Hearings
By David Swanson

Barbara Walters criticizes President Bush for sending a religious Christmas card
Veteran anchor and present - day co-host of The View Barbara Walters showcased holiday cards received from various public figures including celebrities and royalty .
Among these cards was one from the White House signed by President Bush and the First Lady .
" Usually , in the past , when I 've received Christmas cards , it 's been ' Happy Holidays ' and so on , " says Walters .
This one , however , has a bible verse printed directly on it :
You alone are the LORD .
You made the heavens , even the highest heavens , and all their starry host , the earth and all that is on it , the seas and all that is in them .
You give life to everything , and the multitudes of heaven worship you .
NEHEMIAH 9:6 ( NIV )
Asks Walters : " Does this also go to agnostics , and atheists , and Muslims ? "
" Do n't you think it 's a little interesting , " Walters also asks , " that the president of all the people is sending out a religious Christmas card ? "
" By the way , " continues Ms. Walters as she looks away from the camera , " I do n't want to put down the President of the United States and his wife .
I think it 's very nice that they sent me a Christmas card . "
This video is from ABC's The View , broadcast on December 13 , 2007 .
Garmin's Nuviphone promises to wed GPS and cellphone with finesse and flair .
It 's the talk of town , a mid-week surprise : a company with a bankload of credibility in a nearby technological niche muscling in on the cellular game .
Well , perhaps not so surprising that we forget the last time such a thing happened .
" Has iPhone met its match ? "
asks ZDnet .
" Garmin hits iPhone directly with Nuviphone , " says
Electronista .
i Phone , iPhone , iPhone : Nothing demonstrates
Apple 's impending dominance of the sector better than the fact that it 's already the journalist 's favorite metric for anything new that comes along .
The Nuvi will be a touchscreen slab - style handset with a 3.5 "
display and serious GPS - centered chops .
Think of it as geolocation matured and properly integrated into the smartphone experience .
A suite of software stocked with millions of interesting locations will be packaged with it , and WiFi , Bluetooth and a 3G modem ( using the HSDPA
standard ) will keep the data flowing no matter where you are or what you 're doing .
Expect the browser to be desktop - caliber , with solid productivity apps and capable media playback .
Despite the beastly specs that must be under the hood , Garmin 's keeping mum on the details .
It wo n't be released until the fall , so it 's not unreasonable to assume that development is still underway .
As shown , it lacks a few of the iPhone 's distinctive features , such as multitouch and good design .
There 'll be no SDK , which means third - party software will be either be corporate - approved or unlicensed hacks .
But both phones have strikingly similar dimensions .
There 's no word of price or carriers , either , though HSDPA means
AT&T ( or , conceivably , T - Mobile ) .
Garmin might sell them unlocked , but will certainly aim for subsidies to take the bite out of what 's going to be a chunky tag : it 's too brutal and utilitarian to be a Prada - like fashion item .
If nothing else , the Nuviphone marks part two of an emergent trend : new players from outside the clique bringing their own beer .
Apple brought the mobile industry 's first pleasurable user interface and the genuine technological innovation that makes it work .
Garmin hopes to bring GPS that 's more than a disabled afterthought .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Pregnant women who drink two or more cups of coffee a day have twice the risk of having a miscarriage as those who avoid caffeine , U.S. researchers said on Monday .
A cup of coffee is seen in this undated file picture .
REUTERS / file
They said the study provides strong evidence that high doses of caffeine during pregnancy -- 200 milligrams or more per day or the equivalent of two cups of coffee -- significantly increase the risk of miscarriage .
And they said the research may finally put to rest conflicting reports about the link between caffeine consumption and miscarriage .
“ Women who are pregnant or are actively seeking to become pregnant should stop drinking coffee for three months or hopefully throughout pregnancy , ” said Dr. De-Kun Li of Kaiser Permanente Division of Research , whose study appears in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology .
“ There has been a lot of uncertainty about this , ” Li said in a telephone interview .
“ There was no firm advice from professional societies to say what a pregnant woman should do about caffeine intake . ”
Li said anywhere from 15 to 18 studies have found a link between caffeine use during pregnancy and miscarriage .
But that association has been clouded by the fact that many pregnant women avoid caffeine because it makes them nauseated , which could skew the results .
Li and colleagues took pains to control for that possibility .
Their study involved 1,063 pregnant women who were members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan in San Francisco from October 1996 through October 1998 .
Women in the group never changed their caffeine consumption during pregnancy .
What they found was women who consumed the equivalent of two or more cups of regular coffee or five 12 - ounce cans of caffeinated soda -- were twice as likely to miscarry as pregnant women who avoided caffeine .
This risk appeared to be related to the caffeine , rather than other chemicals in coffee , because they also saw an increased risk when the caffeine was consumed in soda , tea , and hot chocolate .
Li said many researchers think caffeine is harmful because it stresses the fetus ’ immature metabolism .
It may also decrease blood flow in the placenta , which could harm the fetus .
“ To me , the safe dose is zero , ” Li said .
“ If you really have to drink coffee , try to limit it to one cup or at the most two cups . ”
Or better yet , switch to decaffeinated beverages , he added .
Based on the findings , Dr. Tracy Flanagan , director of women ’s health at Kaiser Permanente Northern California , said pregnant women should think about limiting coffee to one cup a day , and they might want to cut it out entirely .
“ So many causes of miscarriage are not controllable , ” she said in a telephone interview .
“ This is an opportunity to do something active . ”
The director of a successful Norwegian ' Kill Bill ' parody movie who admits to downloading TV shows via BitTorrent himself , does n't support his distributor as they take legal action against his fans .
Fourteen people accused of sharing the movie have been reported to the police by MPA copyright lawyer , Espen Tondel .
Tommy Wirkola is the director of ‘ Kill Bill ’ parody , ‘ Kill Buljo ‘ , which has been one of this years most discussed Norwegian movies .
Having started as a joke and despite its feeble $ 163,700 budget , its been a success , and has so far pulled in 90,000 domestic admissions and 62,000 DVD sales in 26 territories .
Inevitably , ‘ Kill Buljo ’ was available for download from file - sharing networks around 6 weeks before the DVD was due its commercial release .
However , in a interview with Thomas Talseth of VG Nett , director Wirkola reveals that he ’s not concerned about people downloading the movie and feels that they probably would n’t have bought it anyway , which is quite an unusual stance for someone in the movie industry .
This article is in part , direct translation of the original Norwegian interview .
Many thanks to HÃ¥vard and RayJoha .
Wirkola believes it is an honor to have people download your movie and reveals he is a BitTorrent user himself , downloading TV - shows such as ‘ The Sopranos ’ and ‘ South Park ’ .
He explains why :
“ I download lots of TV - shows , I ’ll admit that .
But it ’s also about them already having been aired on TV , and have kinda been accessible for free already .
I also think it ’s stupid to have to wait for six or seven months to get to watch a TV - show that ’s already been aired in the USA . ”
Despite the pro-sharing stance of Kill Buljo ’s director , the distributor of the movie CCV and their lawyer ( uh oh , here he is again ) Espen Tondel , are going on the offensive against BitTorrent users .
This week they sent a letter to the Norwegian police wishing to press charges against 14 individuals it accuses of sharing ‘ Kill Buljo ’ on The Pirate Bay BitTorrent tracker .
Director Tommy Wirkola does n’t think that downloading causes any problems , on the contrary , he believes the opposite is true :
“ I understand that CCV is pressing charges , and feel the need to protect their movie .
But it ’s flattering that people are making copies of the movie and releasing it on the internet .
Besides , all movies today are released onto the web .
It would have been worse if no one wanted to share the movie . ”
“ The artist in you feels some pride ? ” asks Thomas Talseth , the interviewer .
“ Yes , you can say that ” admits Wirkola .
“ I love watching movies in the cinema , in large theatres , and I do n’t like the bad quality you often find on the versions floating around online .
But I have no moral position on this . ”
Lawyer Espen Tondel , representing both CCV and Norwegian Videogramforening ( they distribute all films in Norway ) , disapproves of Wirkola ’s downloading habit :
“ No , he should n’t be doing that ” Tondel tells VG adding that there ’s no difference in downloading TV - shows or motion picture movies :
“ The laws on copyright have not introduced any way to make a difference between this kind of material , independently of what sequence the TV - show has been aired around the globe . ”
Tondel is making quite a noise around Norway at the moment .
It ’s a shame he does n’t listen to people like Wirkola and Eric Wilkinson – he might learn something .

Saddam Hussein offered to step down and go into exile one month before the invasion of Iraq , it was claimed last night .
Fearing defeat , Saddam was prepared to go peacefully in return for £ 500 million ( $ 1 billion ) .
The extraordinary offer was revealed yesterday in a transcript of talks in February 2003 between George Bush and the then Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar at the President 's Texas ranch .
The White House refused to comment on the report last night .
But , if verified , it is certain to raise questions in Washington and London over whether the costly four - year war could have been averted .
Only yesterday , the Bush administration asked Congress for another £ 100 billion to finance the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The total war bill for British taxpayers is expected to reach £ 7 billion by next year .
More than 3,800 American service personnel have lost their lives in Iraq , along with 170 Britons and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians .
However , according to the tapes , one month before he launched the invasion Mr Bush appeared convinced that Saddam was serious about going into exile .
" The Eqyptians are speaking to Saddam Hussein , " said Mr Bush .
" It seems he 's indicated he would be prepared to go into exile if he 's allowed to take $ 1 billion and all the information he wants about weapons of mass destruction . "
Asked by the Spanish premier whether Saddam - who was executed in December last year - could really leave , the President replied : " Yes , that possibility exists .
Or he might even be assassinated . "
But he added that whatever happened : " We 'll be in Baghdad by the end of March . "
Mr Bush went on to refer optimistically to the rebuilding or Iraq .
The transcript - which was published yesterday in the Spanish newspaper El Pais - was said to have been recorded by a diplomat at the meeting in Crawford , Texas , on February 22 , 2003 .
Mr Bush was dismissive of the then French President Jacques Chirac , saying he " thinks he 's Mr Arab " .
Referring to his relationship with Downing Street , he said : " I do n't mind being the bad cop if Blair is the good cop . "
The President added : " Saddam wo n't change and he 'll keep on playing games .
" The time has come to get rid of him .
That 's the way it is . "
Days before the invasion began on March 22 , 2003 , the United Arab Emirates proposed to a summit of Arab leaders that Saddam and his henchmen should go into exile .
It was the first time the plan had been officially voiced but it was drowned out in the drumbeat of war .
A spokesman for Mr Aznar 's foundation had no comment on its authenticity .
Bomb attacks killed 57 people in Iraq yesterday .
" A decade from now , I 've no doubt we 'll be similarly astounded with the way these technologies will have reached even further into our lives . "
But predicting exactly what will be the next thing or which ideas will bomb and which will fly is fraught with difficulty .
( Besides , if I knew for certain , do you really think I 'd still be writing for a living ? )
What follows is a smorgasbord of websites , services , concepts and gadgets that at first glance seem to have little to do with each other but which taken together give a picture of where our brave new networked world may be heading .
THE CHUMBY
The creators of this bizarre little device have generated a huge buzz over the past few months - and it's not even due to be launched until early in the year .
The Chumby is a wireless internet device about the size of a rugby ball .
It has no keyboard or mouse but instead uses software called widgets to display pretty much anything you want it to - all the time .
For instance , it will act as an alarm clock , play your music , show you constantly updated news or track an eBay auction .
And the really interesting thing is that it is designed to be hacked - everything from the software code to the specifications for the case are freely available .
No one , including the manufacturers , knows what owners will make Chumbys do once they are released .

MICROBLOGGING
This involves sharing short messages among a group .
Messages are typically posted from mobile phones via SMS or instant messaging .
True microblogging obsessives will dispatch messages to the group dozens of times daily , updating their peers on even the most inconsequential details of their lives .
The best - known microblogging service is called Twitter and its best - known user is US presidential hopeful Barack Obama .
Twitter has also spawned a host of imitators such as Pownce and Jaiku .
Microblogging fans claim that , at their best , the mini-messages are almost haiku - like , while detractors question the usefulness of being bombarded with messages such as " Just made cup of tea " .

EVERYBLOCK
This is still in development but EveryBlock is definitely worth keeping an eye on , if only because it is the work of young Chicago journalist and programmer Adrian Holovaty .
He was the brains behind a celebrated project called chicagocrime.org , which overlays crime statistics from the Chicago Police Department on maps , thus providing a powerful graphic overview of crime in the city .
EveryBlock will use some of the same techniques to create " hyperlocal " news .
The kinds of information Holovaty wants to provide include the results of house sales , scores from youngsters ' sports events , local crime figures and stories written by local people .

23ANDME
With the tagline " genetics just got personal " , 23AndMe allows anyone to unlock their own genetic history - and likely future .
For $ US1000 ( $ 1145 ) the service ( named after the 23 pairs of human chromosomes ) will reveal whether you have a predisposition to arthritis or Alzheimer 's or , more frivolously , why you can't stand tomatoes .
23AndMe customers provide a sample of saliva from which technicians extract the DNA for analysis .
When the results are in , customers are given a secure login that allows them to explore their own genome at their leisure , revealing their genetic " family " around the world as well as their likely future health .

PEER-TO -PEER LENDING
Whether you 're distributing music or books , auctioning off unwanted household items , wanting to bet on a horse race or looking for a soulmate , the internet can put you in touch with someone who is interested in what you have or are .
Kiva takes that idea and applies it to the established concept of microfinance - making small loans to the working poor to help them establish or expand businesses .
So , instead of giving a donation to an organisation such as Oxfam to distribute , peer - to - peer lending lets you invest small amounts directly in a particular entrepreneur - such as Mohamad Marah in Kabala , Sierra Leone .
With his $ US200 loan , Marah has been able to expand his garment business , buying three extra sewing machines .
So far he has repaid half the loan .
More than $ US15 million has already been lent through Kiva - and the default rate is claimed to be just .23 per cent .

MOB RULES
The concept of a " mob " of networked citizens forming an irresistible force has been proposed and developed by , among others , futurist Harold Rheingold and Sydney web theorist and author Mark Pesce .
Pesce has pointed out that in about the middle of this year every second person on Earth will have a mobile phone .
" In just a decade , we 'll have gone from half the world never having made a telephone call to half the world owning a phone , " he said recently .
In effect , he reckons , the people are the network and when that mob of people get together and decide to go in a particular direction they are virtually unstoppable .
Just ask the record companies that have battled in vain for years to stop people sharing music or former Philippines president Joseph Estrada , who was forced from office in 2001 by mass protests co-ordinated by waves of SMS messages .
According to Pesce , the mob is " faster , smarter and stronger than you are " .
Just as importantly , the mob is quite unpredictable - so expect a wild ride in coming years .

GUERILLA WI -FI
Having a wireless internet system set up at home is becoming increasingly common .
However , tapping into the internet while out and about is still very hit and miss - and where it is available is often nose - bleedingly expensive ( Telstra " hot spots " cost $ 14 an hour while Optus slugs users about $ 12 an hour ) .
Meraki is an internet start - up that aims to change all that by providing cheap - or free - wireless networks .
Meraki sells a remarkable device call the Meraki Mini for $ US49 .
Plug it in to your internet connection and it will instantly provide shared access to other users up to 50 metres away .
Put several Merakis together in a neighbourhood ( and perhaps include a few of the more powerful versions that cover up to 350 metres ) and they will instantly form a " mesh " network , giving internet access to anyone in the area .
These " guerilla " networks are beginning to spring up in cities around the world , driven by people for whom internet access is a social - equity issue .
Do internet service providers like this Robin Hood - style behaviour ?
Not at all .
Can they do much about it ?
Er , no .

WORLD COMMUNITY GRID
The World Community Grid project is one of the latest examples of a concept called distributed computing .
The idea , though not new , involves harnessing the computing power of many thousands of idle PCs around the world to try to crack complex scientific challenges .
Distributed computing first came to prominence with the Seti@home project , which uses participants ' computers to analyse radio telescope data in the search for extra-terrestrial life .
World Community
Grid takes the concept one stage further and aims to establish " the world 's largest public computing grid to tackle projects that benefit humanity " .
So far 343,000 members have donated a total of 128,000 years of computing time .
Projects include one aimed at giving scientists a better understanding of cancer and another that is modelling the effects of climate change in Africa .

LOOPT
One of many social networking services that capitalise on the global positioning software now standard on many mobile phones .
Loopt members register with the site and then , when one of their friends is nearby , their location is shown on a map plus a note about what they are doing at that time .
You might not want your location to be always visible - so , thankfully , users can turn off the service .

ONE LAPTOP PER CHILD
When marvelling at the potential of the networked world it 's easy to forget the 2 billion youngsters in the developing world who do n't have the tools to connect .
The One Laptop per Child program is a bid to help bridge this digital divide with a machine called the XO Laptop that sells for just $ US200 .
OLPC is a non-profit group established by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nicholas Negroponte and supported by companies including News Corp , Intel and Google .
Under a " Give One Get One " scheme , donors give $ US399 and they receive a child - sized XO machine and another will be sent on their behalf to a youngster in Afghanistan , Cambodia , Haiti , Mongolia or Rwanda .

Let ’s lighten things up with a gadget post .
You may have seen that Everex launched a $ 200 computer that runs Linux .
It looks like Wal - Mart sold out of them , but not to worry : more are on the way .
Why should you be interested ?
Well , instead of Windows , it comes installed with gOS , which is a version of Ubuntu that is customized to work well with web - based tools from Google , Flickr Facebook , and Skype .
When I heard that , I had to order one of these PCs to check it out for myself . 🙂
In this post , I ’m just covering the unboxing .
I ’ll use the PC for a while and let you know what I think in a later post .
First , the box .
The “ gPC ” stands for Green PC , not Google PC as some people have thought :
When you open the box , you ’ll find a pretty flyer on top of the PC :
Here ’s what the flyer looks like in more detail .
For people that have never seen Linux , the flyer is a great little introduction :
For $ 199.00 , I was expecting a barebones machine , but it comes with a PS / 2 keyboard , mouse , and even USB - powered speakers :
The front of the machine looks like a standard computer .
You can see the DVD - ROM drive , speaker and microphone jacks , and two USB ports .
There are also two silver buttons for power and reset :
The back of the PC is pretty standard :
Directly connected to the motherboard , you see four USB connectors and an ethernet port .
The expansion card is a modem , but I believe the machine only supports broadband connections , not dial - up .
The machine itself is light but sturdy .
I jostled it quite a bit and did n’t hear anything loose or rattling around in the machine .
Okay , that ’s it for tonight .
Tune in later to see what I think of it . 🙂
The sex trade fuels human trafficking , says Ms Harman
Harriet Harman Commons Leader Harriet Harman has told the BBC she wants the law to be changed to make it illegal to pay for sex .
She said ministers were to look at how Sweden brought in such a law , and said a " big debate " was needed in the UK .
It would counter international human trafficking which sees girls bought and sold by criminals in the UK , she added .
Buying or selling sex is legal , but many activities related to prostitution such as kerb crawling , brothel keeping , pimping and soliciting are not .
The government has toughened its stance on prostitution in recent years , after initially considering " tolerance zones " .
Plans to permit small brothels , with two prostitutes and a maid , to operate legally also appear to have been shelved .
A Home Office spokesman said the idea was being put out to " further consultation " after concerns were raised about its impact on local neighbourhoods .
' Sexual exploitation '
The government is carrying out a wholesale review of the laws around prostitution , with the aim of reducing demand and increasing the safety of sex workers .
But Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said there would be a " mini review " looking at lessons from Sweden , after home office minister Vernon Coaker 's fact finding trip there in the new year .
Do we think it 's right in the 21st Century that women should be in a sex trade or do we think it 's exploitation and should be banned
Harriet Harman
Commons leader
How it works in Sweden Your views on law change
She said : " We recognise that there is considerable support for us to do more to tackle the demand for prostitution and to prevent the trafficking of people for sexual exploitation . "
A Home Office spokesman said it was " too early to say " whether any changes to the law would apply across the UK or just in England and Wales .
Brothel keeping The Sexual Offences Act 2003 made it illegal to buy sex from anyone aged under 18 and introduced tough penalties for trafficking adults and children for the purposes of sexual exploitation .
UK PROSTITUTION LAWS Prostitution is not illegal Brothel - keeping is a criminal offence Kerb - crawling and soliciting are also illegal The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced penalties against those who sexually exploit children Trafficking adults or children for the purposes of committing sexual offences was also outlawed
It is not illegal for an individual aged over 18 to work as a prostitute in off - street premises but where there is more than one prostitute , the owner of the premises can be prosecuted for keeping a brothel .
Many of the activities associated with street prostitution , such as soliciting and kerb - crawling , are also illegal and it is against the law to advertise sexual services on cards in telephone boxes .
The current laws are largely aimed at reducing nuisance for local neighbourhoods , a Home Office spokesman said .
But Harriet Harman says more needs to be done to tackle demand and protect women .
' Very big debate '
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " Just because something has always gone on , does n't mean you just wring your hands and say , ' Oh well there 's nothing we can do about it ' .
" We do need to have a debate and unless you tackle the demand side of human trafficking which is fuelling this trade , we will not be able to protect women from it .
Outside of sex trafficking , it seems to me that it's the women exploiting the men
Godfrey Bloom , UKIP MEP
" That is what they 've done in Sweden .
My own personal view is that 's what we need to do as a next step . "
Ms Harman , who is also deputy Labour leader and equality secretary , said she wanted a " very big debate " on the issue involving groups such as the Women 's Institute , community organisations , Church and other faith groups .
This should look at whether " we think it 's right in the 21st Century that women should be in a sex trade or do we think it 's exploitation and should be banned " .
Newspaper ads Ms Harman said action needed to be taken to tackle the demand side of international human trafficking , which had led to " teenage girls being bought and sold by criminal gangs in car parks in this country " .
She was speaking after talks with newspapers over small advertisements offering services at brothels believed to be linked to human trafficking .
Ms Harman said there was to be new guidance from the Newspaper Society next month that would address the issue .
" The new guidance will stop those ads .
But the next question is - can we really stop this trade when we 've still got a lawful sex trade going on ? "
The English Collective of Prostitutes attacked Ms Harman 's support for the Swedish system and urged her to look at New Zealand 's system of legalising brothels instead .
State - run facilities Spokeswoman Cari Mitchell said the Swedish system of criminalising men who buy sex had forced prostitution further underground and " made women more vulnerable to violence " .
Alan Gordon , vice chairman of the Police Federation , also spoke out against further criminalisation , adding : " A move towards legalising state - run facilities would certainly be something which could be examined , as they could possibly eradicate underground prostitution and therefore have a knock - on effect on human trafficking . "
Ms Harman 's words were welcomed by Tory MP Philip Hollobone who is campaigning for a ban on selling sex but Lib Dem spokesman David Howarth said a ban could put women in more danger .
UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom said " consensual prostitution " should remain legal adding : " Ms Harman said that she wants to look at ways of ending the ' exploitation ' of women but outside of sex trafficking , it seems to me that it 's the women exploiting the men . "

The following article is an updated and revised version of a piece first posted on November 19 , 2007 .
That piece misidentified Freedom ’s Watch as the sponsor of the focus group described below .
We regret the error .
Laura Sonnenmark is a focus group regular .
“ I ’ve been asked to talk about orange juice , cell phone service , furniture , ” the Fairfax County , Virginia - based children ’s book author and Democratic Party volunteer says .
But when she was called by a focus group organizer for a prospective assignment earlier this month , she was told the questions this time would be about something “ political . ”
On November 1 , she went to the offices of Martin Focus Groups in Alexandria , Virginia , knowing she would be paid $ 150 for two hours of her time .
After joining a half dozen other women in a conference room , she discovered that she had been called in for what seemed an unusual assignment : to help test - market language that could be used to sell military action against Iran to the American public .
“ The whole basis of the whole thing was , ‘ we ’re going to go into Iran and what do we have to do to get you guys to along with it ? ” says Sonnenmark , 49 .
Soon after the leader of the focus group began the discussion , according to Sonnenmark , he directed the conversation toward recent tensions between Iran and the United States .
“ He was asking questions about [ Iranian president Mahmoud ]
Ahmadinejad going to speak at Columbia University , how terrible it was that he was able to go to Columbia and was invited , ” Sonnenmark says .
“ And he used lots of catch phrases , like ‘ victory ’ and ‘ failure is not an option . ' ”
According to Sonnenmark , two fliers distributed at the focus group session bore the logo and name of Freedom ’s Watch , a high - powered , well - connected group of hawks .
This summer , Freedom ’s Watch launched a $ 15 million ad campaign to support the escalation of troops in Iraq .
It counts former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer and former deputy assistant to President Bush Bradley A. Blakeman among its leaders .
The first flier handed to the group bearing Freedom ’s Watch ’s logo , Sonnenmark recalls , raised questions about Ahmadinejad ’s recent appearance at Columbia University .
The second one was also related to Iran .
Sonnenmark assumed Freedom ’s Watch had arranged for the session .
And the upshot of this focus group ?
“ After two hours , [ the leader ] asked three final questions , ” Sonnenmark recalls : “ How would you feel if Hillary [ Clinton ] bombed Iran ?
How would you feel if George Bush bombed Iran ?
And how would you feel if Israel bombed Iran ? ”
Sonnenmark says she responded , “ It would depend on the circumstances … .
What is the situation in Iraq ?
Do we have international support ? ”
When asked by Mother Jones about this focus group , Freedom ’s Watch spokesman Matt David responded , “ As a general policy we wo n’t comment on our internal strategy . ”
And an employee at Martin Focus Groups who only gave his name as Steve declined to say anything about the session .
( In 2003 , Steve Weachter , the manager of the firm ’s Alexandria offices , told a local Virginia newspaper , “ We help whoever calls .
It could be about cigarette smoking , drinking , whatever .
We could even have a group to evaluate Pepsi one day and Coke the next . ”
In the same article Donna Carter , the assistant manager at Martin , recalled the time the outfit was conducting a Republican focus group in one room and a Democratic group in another . )
After an earlier version of this story attributing the focus group to Freedom ’s Watch was posted , Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi , the founder and president of the Israel Project , contacted Mother Jones and said that her group had commissioned the focus group and that it was designed by Public Opinion Strategies , a Republican polling firm .
The Israel Project is a nonprofit group that supports Israel and conducts extensive polling on American public attitudes toward Israel and the Middle East .
Its board of advisers includes 15 Democratic and Republican members of the House and the Senate , plus actor Ron Silver .
Mizrahi says that her group and Freedom ’s Watch share a common interest in “ thwarting the threat of Islamic extremism ” and in “ dealing with the threat of Iran . ”
But Freedom ’s Watch “ in no way is directing our work , and it ’s not funding our work . ”
She pointed out that the Israel Project is not “ involved with Iraq , ” a major concern of Freedom ’s Watch .
But the two outfits , she said , “ shared information ” produced by this focus group .
She insisted the focus group was designed to help the Israel Project promote “ our belief in pushing sanctions . ”
She added , “ We ’re working day and night to persuade people the options [ concerning Iran ] are very limited .
We ’re pushing really aggressively on the economic and diplomatic fronts . ”
Mizrahi confirmed that Freedom ’s Watch material was distributed to members of the focus group but insisted that ads from “ lots of other groups ” were handed out .
“ We test a lot of messages , ” she said .
“ Of all the focus groups I ’ve ever been to , ” Sonnenmark wrote in a subsequent email to a group of fellow volunteers for the 2006 Senate campaign of Jim Webb , “ I ’ve never seen a moderator who was so persistent in manipulating and leading the participants . ”
( Webb is lead author of a Senate letter warning President Bush not to attack Iran without congressional approval ; see here and here . ) )
The gist of the event was “ anti-Iranian , ” says Sonnenmark .
If the group ’s organizers were testing the case for military action against Iran — even as a last resort —
Sonnenmark believes they could not have been encouraged by the results of this focus group .
“ I got the general feeling that George Bush did n’t have a shot in hell ” of winning public support for an Iran attack , she says .
Some members of her group suggested that if Hillary Clinton were elected president she might have more credibility in making such a case .
As for the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran , Sonnenmark ’s impression was that the group ’s members did not believe it was up to them to judge .
Sonnenmark left the session wondering if foreign policy hawks would soon be pushing publicly for military action against Iran using language that had been tested on her .
But , she says , “ It is not going to be so easy this time around . ”
Ed Gillespie , counselor to Bush , pointed to efforts by the U.S. Congress to overhaul the Federal Housing Administration program developed in 1934 amid the Great Depression and designed to make home ownership more affordable .
Members of the House of Representatives and Senate have been trying to work out a compromise plan .
" There 's more to be done we think on the housing front to address the concerns people have about the housing markets , including FHA reform and other reforms that the president has called for , " Gillespie told reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush returned from a weeklong holiday at his Texas ranch .
" We think there 's an opportunity for bipartisan consensus on that . "
One idea that has been under consideration by the administration and Congress is allowing mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae < FNM.N > and Freddie Mac < FRE.N > to buy loans above the current ceiling of $ 417,000 , mortgages known as jumbo loans , he said .
While Gillespie declined to provide more specifics , his comments revealed that the administration is closely watching the housing market as fears grow that it could send the overall U.S. economy into a recession .
A report on Friday showed sales of new homes dropped 9 percent in November , to the lowest rate in more than 12 years , while another report on Monday showed the pace of existing home sales moved up slightly in November off a record low .
Gillespie also made it clear the administration would not bail out investors who made risky investments .
" You have to tread a fine line here of helping those who found themselves in a difficult situation and maybe did n't realize at the time the situation into which they were headed , and on the other hand removing any sense of moral hazard from the marketplace for those who are engaged in speculation , " he said .
With growing talk of a possible recession , Gillespie said the White House was carefully eyeing the economic data and would not take off the table the idea of an economic stimulus package as recommended by some leading economists .
" We 'll do what we think is appropriate to foster economic growth , " Gillespie said .

SANXENXO , Pontevedra ( Reuters ) - “ Today it ’s my birthday and my grandson , who is very stingy , gave me a blog . ”
Web - blogger Maria Amelia Lopez shows the home page of her blog on a laptop screen in Sanxenxo October 5 , 2007 .
At the age of 95 Lopez has surprised herself by a sudden conversion from Web- illiterate to cybercelebrity .

So reads the first entry by one of the world ’s oldest Webloggers , Maria Amelia Lopez , who , at the age of 95 , has surprised herself by a sudden conversion from Web- illiterate to cybercelebrity .
“ At first I thought a blog was just a type of paper notebook , ” said Lopez , a great grandmother .
“ When I saw my grandson using the Internet , it caught my attention .
I said to myself ‘ What ’s this ?
You can find out about anything .
I want an Internet ! ’ ”
With 60,000 regular readers so far , Lopez 's homely mix of memory and chat , available at amis95.blogspot.com / , attracts regular readers from around the world and has put her back in touch with the younger generation in a way she had never imagined .
“ No one pays any attention to old women any more .
Not many people love us .
But I was surprised by the Internet , because young people who were 18 years of age , or 14 or 15 , tell me about their lives and what they think and ask my advice , ” said Lopez .
Only one in 10 people over the age of 65 use the Internet in Spain , slightly below the European average .
Although that proportion has nearly doubled over the last two years , it still suggests older citizens are missing the digital revolution even though they make up a growing portion of the population .
“ Age is more important ( to determining Internet use ) than income , gender .... or level of education , ” said Domingo Laborda , an official Spain ’s Industry Ministry .
The proportion of Internet users declines even more steeply after 65 .
Only 2.7 percent of over - 74s has ever surfed the Net .
But technology can help break down the isolation brought so often by advancing age .
“ Although nothing can make up for affection , the Internet can help communication , with mail , chat or messaging , and it ’s fun and always available , ” said the ministry ’s Laborda .

LOQUACIOUS
Visit Lopez ’s home in the village of Sanxenxo in the rainy northern Spanish region of Galicia and you see her ability to pour out words on the net is matched by loquaciousness in person .
“ I was always talkative , but now I feel more wanted , embraced , because so may people write to me , ” said Lopez .
On her blog she makes occasional references to her youthful good looks ( “ Ah , how pretty I was , and how little I realised it ” ) , but today she has white hair and walks with a stick .
“ Look at what I was , ” she wrote in one entry , beneath a photograph of herself from 60 or 70 years ago , “ And look at what I am , at what I have become .
My eyes are n’t pretty , nor my mouth , or anything , not my body .
Age disfigures everything . ”
“ The Internet has given me life , ” she told Reuters , describing how she receives messages from places as diverse as Brazil , Russia and Japan .
Lopez has called herself as “ the world ’s oldest blogger , ” although a quick Google search reveals several pretenders to the title , including 108 - year - old Australian Olive Riley , who can be found at www.allaboutolive.com.au/.
CIVIL WAR MEMORIES
Due partly to cataracts which mean she ca n’t see screens well , Lopez is assisted in her blogging by her grandson , Daniel , who takes her dictation .
Many of her stories deal with a long life , which started happily and then had to steer through Spain ’s vicious Civil War and the long years of dictatorship by General Francisco Franco which followed .
“ I had a very happy youth , ” she wrote , describing expeditions to bullfights and fun times with her cousins .
“ Young men were different back then .
They brought us flowers , gardenias , violets , chocolates .
Not like the foul - mouthed bunch today . ”
It was one of these polite young men who told her of the outbreak of Civil War in 1936 .
“ He had left - wing ideas .... the boy said to me ‘ Maria Amelia , this is a revolution ! ’
And I began to hear shooting , ” Lopez blogged , describing how later that day her father was chased out of his job at a customs office by Franco ’s men .
Spain ’s Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has written to congratulate Lopez on her blog and she recommends other seniors to take up blogging .
But it ’s not all easy .
“ I ’m going to die before I get broadband , ” read one recent , sad entry .

I grew up an only child .
I had friends , but sometimes they were n’t around .
I had both parents and we went places and played often .
But I enjoyed listening to my radio and coloring in my Spiderman coloring book in my room as much as I enjoyed playing with my friends or parents .
I learned early on how to enjoy myself when I was alone .
Not that way you sick monkey ... well , at least , not yet .
It also meant that when someone left , it was n’t a huge loss .
A friend would move away , I would miss them , but it was n’t devastating .
An uncle would die , I would be sad , but it did n’t bring the world to a screeching halt .
As I grew into adulthood I began to treasure my time alone .
Again , I had friends and we would go out and drink , hit on women way out of our league , and laugh about it later , but I enjoyed reading in my apartment listening to music alone as much as I enjoyed going out .
Girlfriends came and went until I met your mother .
She had the most beautiful legs I ’d ever seen .
We met at work and dated secretly for six months before we did n’t feel like hiding it anymore .
We got married four years later .
Then you came along a couple of years after that .
There has never been anybody in my life that I could n’t live without .
I do n’t think it ’s a psychological issue ( but crazy people really do n’t know their crazy , do they ? )
Even if my beautiful wife left or died , I ’d be despondent for some time , but life would go on .
I never needed anyone before … until you .
You were so noisy and bothersome that for the first 6 months of your life I begged my wife to let me sell you on the black market .
You were cute and had all your fingers and toes so you would have fetched a hefty sum ; enough to put a nice down payment on a new house .
But your mother just looked at me with daggers shooting from her eyes and I would slink out of the room .
Damn her .
Then one day … it was close to my birthday , I was holding you and I made a funny face and you laughed .
It was all downhill from there .
I began to love you .
And it only got worse as time went on .
No one in my life has ever gotten in as far as you have .
My favorite time is bed time when we ’ve finished reading “ Where the Wild Things Are , ” and “ Guess How Much I Love You ” and I turn out the light and get the covers snuggled up under your chin .
I kiss you on the tip of your nose and tell you , “ I love you , big girl . ”
And you say , “ I love you too , daddy .
” I get choked up every time I hear that .
I ’m glad the lights are out .
How I wish to God I could keep you this age , but I know that you ’ll eventually become a teenager , and may very well break my heart .
That ’s okay ; it ’s yours to break .
A life lived of choice is a life of conscious action .
A life lived of chance is a life of unconscious creation .
– Neale Donald Walsch
By Leo Babauta
As much as possible , I try to live my life by bringing to my consciousness what is bubbling up from my unconsciousness .
I try to clear the fog through which we often drift , to see where I ’m going , to make conscious choices instead of automatic ones .
Do you ever have a feeling that you ’re drifting through life , and not going where you want to go ?
Or that you do n’t know how you got where you are today ?
Living consciously is about taking control of your life , about thinking about your decisions rather than making them without thought , about having a life that we want rather than settling for the one that befalls us .
If you ’re drifting through life , or feel out of control , or do n’t know how you got here … deciding to live consciously could be the single most important thing you do .
Are you living unconsciously now ?
Ask yourself the following questions … if you find yourself saying yes to many of them , you might want to consider trying conscious living :
1 . Are you in a job that you fell into rather than the job you want ?
2 . Are you doing things that are given to you rather than what you love to do ?
3 . Are you spending your time doing busy work rather than what you want to do with your days ?
4 . Do you wish you could spend more time with loved ones ?
5 . Do you find yourself overweight because you ’ve been eating the food you ’ve been eating for years and stuck in a rut of not exercising ?
6 . Do you find yourself living from paycheck to paycheck or in debt , not knowing where your money goes ?
7 . Do you find yourself wasting your time doing things that are n’t important rather than focusing on completing the things that are very important ?
8 . Do you go through your days not thinking about what you want out of life and how to get it ?
If you answered “ no ” to all of these questions , you ’re probably already living consciously , and you do n’t need this article at all .
For those who would like to live more consciously , read on .
How to Live Life Consciously
It ’s not something you can change overnight .
Living consciously is a lifestyle , a skill , an art .
It ’s not something you do just once , but a habit that you can form for the rest of your life .
But it is deceptively simple :
Be conscious , and think about , everything you do .
Make conscious choices rather than doing things without thinkings .
That ’s all .
It sounds simple , but it ’s amazing how few people actually do this , and it ’s amazing how easy it is to live life on autopilot , and just do what we always do because that ’s what we ’re used to doing .
And it ’s easier that way , even if our lives are difficult .
It ’s not easy to changes our lives , to break out of our routines , to begin to live the lives we want .
It takes willful effort , energy and constant vigilance to think about our choices … all of them .
Here are some key tips that have worked for me :
1 . Make reflecting on your life a regular routine .
Whether you keep a journal , or make reflecting on your day part of your evening routine , or have a weekly session where you review your life or take some time away from the office to reflect on everything … it ’s important that you give things some thought .
Regularly .
2 . At least once a year , set or review your life ’s goals .
What do you want to do in life ?
What is important to you ?
What do you want your life to be like ?
And how will you get there ?
Write it down , and keep it somewhere you will see it often , and take action .
3 . Also review your relationships .
The people we love are among the most important things in our lives , if not the only important things .
You need to think about your relationships .
Do you spend enough time with them ?
Do you show your appreciation for them ?
Is there a way you can improve your relationship ?
Do you need to forgive or apologize about anything ?
Are there barriers that can be removed ?
Communication that can be improved ?
Also review your relationships with others , such as co-workers .
4. Consider your impact on the world .
How does what you do , what you consume , and how you live , impact the environment ?
How does it impact poor people in Third World countries ?
How does it impact the poor , the powerless , the voiceless ?
How does it impact your community ?
Your life has an impact , whether you think about it or not .
Being conscious of how your decisions affect others is important .
5. Consider the real costs of each purchase .
We often buy things without really thinking about what we ’re doing or what they really cost .
Sure , it ’s just $ 30 … no problem , right ?
But that $ 30 might represent several hours of your life … hours that you ’ll never get back .
Do you really want to spend your life earning money for trivial purchases ?
Is that what you want to do with your life ?
Worth some thought , I think .

6. Consider the real costs of the things in your life .
Our lives are filled with stuff … our houses , our offices … and beyond just the cost of buying the stuff , this stuff takes a toll on us .
The stuff in our life must be arranged , cleaned , moved , taken with us when we move … it takes up the space in our life , it is visual stress .
Later , we ’ll have to get rid of it , sort through all of it , take time to throw it away or recycle it or donate it .
If having the stuff is not worth all of that , then get rid of it .
7. Review how you spend your time .
Until we do a time audit , and keep a log of our day , even if it ’s just for one or two days , we do n’t really know how we spend our time .
And if we do audit our time , it can be very surprising .
And if we know how we ’re spending our time now , we can make conscious decisions to change how we spend our time in the future .
For computer - based time tracking , try Rescue Time .
8. Explore yourself .
Not in a dirty way .
Take some time to think about what kind of person you are .
What your values are .
Whether you live your life according to those values .
How you treat people .
How you treat yourself .
Think about this : what do you want people to say about you when you die ?

Barclays ' exposure to America 's sub - prime mortgage fiasco took a dramatic turn last night as the bank sued the Wall Street firm Bear Stearns for fraud and deception over the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in an ill - fated hedge fund .
In a lawsuit filed in New York , Barclays accused Bear Stearns of systematically hiding losses in a fund which swallowed $ 400 m ( £ 200 m ) of the British bank 's money .
The fund had to be bailed out in June after reaching the brink of collapse following a disastrous series of investments in mortgage - backed securities .
Barclays described the fund 's demise as " one of the most high profile and shocking hedge fund failures in the last decade " .
The suit alleges that up to the last days before the bail - out , Bear Stearns executives engaged in a cover - up to hide the slump in its value .
In addition to Bear Stearns , the suit targets the Wall Street firm 's senior managing director for asset management , Matthew Tannin .
A third defendant , fund manager , Ralph Cioffi , is already under investigation by US federal prosecutors for withdrawing his own money from the hedge fund while assuring investors not to worry .
" The defendants entered intentionally into a relationship in which Barclays placed trust and confidence in them , " the suit says .
It describes Bear Stearns ' conduct as " wilful , malicious , reckless and without regard to Barclays ' rights and interests " .
Barclays has been under pressure over its exposure to the credit crunch , which has frequently depressed its shares .
The bank announced last month that it had written off $ 1.7bn in loans and mortgages .
Its involvement in Bear Stearns ' hedge fund first became public over the summer .
The British bank is understood to have lent $ 400 m to a complex vehicle linked to the fund which was used by Bear Stearns to leverage returns for its clients .
Little of the money has been recovered .
According to Barclays , Bear Stearns frequently diverged from agreed guidelines on the type of investments to be made by the fund .
Between 75 % and 100 % of the fund 's portfolio was supposed to go into assets with top - notch credit ratings of between AAA and AA minus .
The suit says Bear Stearns and Cioffi " hatched a plan to make more money for themselves " by creating an unauthorised new investment vehicle which they planned to float .
Barclays details a series of lunch meetings in New York at which its staff were assured that the fund was going well .
But it says detailed updates of performance tended to be provided late and incomplete .
Throughout the spring of 2007 , it says , Tannin repeatedly used the word " great " to describe progress .
Barclays is not alone in suing Bear Stearns over the debacle .
A New York securities lawyer , Jake Zamansky , has mounted a lawsuit on behalf of clients who lost money in the fund , brought under the name of a 73 - year - old American investor who lost his retirement savings of $ 500,000 .
Criminal prosecutors are examining whether Cioffi , who managed the fund , improperly withdrew $ 2 m of his own money while providing bullish updates to clients about the fund 's performance - a move characterised as a hedge fund manager " hedging himself " .
Cioffi recently left the firm , although Bear Stearns has not disclosed the circumstances of his departure .
A Bear Stearns spokeswoman said the firm denied any wrongdoing and said Barclays was a " highly sophisticated financial institution " which ought to be able to calculate investment risk .
" While we do not like to see investors or counterparties lose money , we believe this lawsuit is an attempt by Barclays to avoid taking responsibility for its own actions , " the spokeswoman said .
" We are not responsible for Barclays ' losses and intend to defend vigorously against Barclays ' claims . "
Bear Stearns has faced intense heat of its own over the funds ' failure which led to the departure of its chief operating officer , Warren Spector .
In financial results due today , Bear Stearns will reveal the extent of the damage to its balance sheet arising from the credit crunch .
Its chairman , Jimmy Cayne , and fellow executives are likely to forgo their annual bonuses as a result of the havoc .
Turner denied claims of abuse by his former wife
He died at his home near San Diego , California .
There was no immediate word on the cause of death .
He rose to fame in the 1960s , and is best remembered for his musical partnership and stormy marriage with Tina Turner , who said he abused her .
In later years he rehabilitated his image and won his second Grammy in February for Risin ' with the Blues .
He shared his only other Grammy with Tina Turner in 1972 for their cover of Proud Mary .
" Ike Turner passed away this morning .
He was at his home , " said Scott Hanover , an official at the performer 's management company .
' Demonised '
Michele Schweitzer , a spokeswoman for his former wife , said : " Tina is aware that Ike passed away earlier today .
To critics he will be known as a great founder , unfortunately to the general public he will always be known as a brutal man
Paul Gambaccini , broadcaster
" She has not had any contact with him in 35 years .
No further comment will be made . "
Singer Chuck Berry was getting ready to perform on stage when he heard the news .
" What can you have but sorrow if you lose one of your colleagues , you know ? " he said .
Turner , a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , is credited by many music historians with making the first rock ' n ' roll record , Rocket 88 , in 1951 .
Broadcaster Paul Gambaccini told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme : " In musical terms [ he was ] very important .
" Rocket 88 is one of the two records that can claim to be the first rock ' n ' roll record , being the other being The Fat Man by Fats Domino from 1949 , " he said .
He said the track was an " indisputable claim to fame " for Turner .
" To critics he will be known as a great founder , unfortunately to the general public he will always be known as a brutal man , " he added .
Turner was also known as a prolific session guitarist and piano player .
After marrying Tina Turner in 1959 , the pair produced a string of hits , including A Fool In Love and It 's Gonna Work Out Fine .
The song River Deep Mountain High , produced by Phil Spector , was one of their most successful singles .
But Turner will be forever remembered for his turbulent relationship with Tina Turner , the BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles says .
In 2001 , Turner denied his ex-wife 's claims that he abused her and expressed frustration that he had been demonised in the media .
Your comments :
Whatever his troubles were you can't take away what he contributed to the music world .
Bowie and Jagger revived Tina Turner 's career but Ike created it .
I 'm not saying how he treated her in private was right , I 'm saying he is a musical genius whose contributions will be missed .
I saw him perform at the Long Beach blues festival a few years back and his set blew everyone away .
A true talent .

This is such a loss to the music scene .

Not so much for what he did to Tina Turner that is unforgivable in a man .
We still should not judge him for thing in the passed .
He will be missed .

Ike Turner was one of the greatest musicians , arrangers and producers of the modern era .
He invented rock n roll and you can not take that away from the man .
Yes , he was a bad man but so were many of our musical heroes .
Even today people with tarnished reputations top the charts , such as 50 Cent and Eminem .

I know it will sound cruel , even though Tina lives in another country then Ike did .
However , now Tina Turner can rest .
No more having the fear of him coming into a room .
No more looking over her shoulder .
Mike , Washington , DC
Ike 's incredible dedication passion for his music has always inspired me .
Seeing him play alongside Rosco Gordon showed two of the great blues players with such varying personalities -
Ike 's powerful and non compromising style and Rosco 's sweeping , gentle manner - two of the greats gone .
Now they 're gone

Whilst he was portrayed as a wife beater , tyrant and good musician he was still a human being .
Death is never good .
My heart goes out to Tina who must be feeling the pain and mixed emotions after what happened to her
Kevin Ross , Scotland , UK
What an incredible musician this world has lost .
Being a Turner fan I feel the loss and my heart is filled with grief .
Every marriage has got ups and downs and we should not look at whatever happened between him and Tina .
He will be missed .

I saw Ike performing live a few years ago and for the first time .
He " blew me away " .

Ike was a musical genius who was determined to be a success .

As a music student , having studied soul music , I have only just come across what Ike Turner contributed to the music world .
Although his tumultuous relationship with Tina was an issue during their respective careers , there is no denying that his death will have a serious impact throughout the music industry .
His work as a singer , guitarist , pianist and most importantly as a songwriter will be forever captured on record , and in the end , the recognition for his work is the most important thing at this time .
R.I.P . Ike
Tom Beck , Brighton , UK
Ike and Tina may have had a stormy relationship , but they put on a hella good show .
He 'll be missed .
Shell Lavender , Snowflake , Az. U.S.A .
Ike Turner was a musician 's musician .
He understood that music comes from PEOPLE , not just a singular performer .
He knew how to craft and combine sounds to create complex yet compelling songs .
He could mix class and strut with funk and dirt .
And humour .
You never miss the water till the well runs dry , and I will miss Ike Turner .
Dano delaMano , Minneapolis
I had the pleasure of meeting Ike when he played at the Koh Samui Music Festival in 2005 .
As one of the organisers I had plenty of time to talk with him and found him to be one of the nicest most open and honest people I have met .
He admitted all the bad things he had done but said they had been overstated and that there are always two sides to the story - and only one had been told .
Nevertheless , during his time here in Koh Samui he was the most accommodating of any of the famous stars we had here , no airs and graces , no silly demands .
His most famous phrase during his stay was " What can I do to make this work ? "
A great guy and great musician who will be sadly missed .
Harry Bonning , Koh Samui , Thailand
We must n't forget that for all his vices , he is single handedly responsible for introducing the world to Tina Turner .
As previous comments on here have suggested , there are always two sides to every story and a jaded past should never overshadow his massive contributions to the music industry .
Rest in Peace Ike
Richard , York , UK
I knew Ike Turner in recent years , long after his stormy relationship with Tina and his excessive living had passed .
Ike was a great musical talent and in his earlier years a talent scout , producer and arranger for Chess Records .
At a low point , he signed a contract allowing someone to make a film about his relationship with Tina without the right to reply or refute what was said .
It made a great film .
Sadly that is how people will remember him .
Fran Leslie , London UK
I have no doubt in my mind that Ghanaians of what I would call ' menopausal age 'will always remember the wonderful performance Ike and Tina Turner put up in Ghana in the late 1960s .
It is a pity that the two had a such a stormy relationship and ended up going their separate ways .
May
Ike rest in perfect peace .
Tete Cobblah , Luanda , Angola
Ike and Tina came through my home town frequently for years to perform .
I remember that their posters would be plastered all up and down the avenue .
They would pack people into the local theatre to see their show .
It is unfortunate that their personal relationship overshadowed the truly great musician that he was .
May he rest in peace .
And may we remember him for his contribution to soul music !

New Hampshire Couple Vows to Fight Feds to the Death
In standoff with feds , Ed Brown says he will " walk out of here free or we die . "
June 18 , 2007  --
Calling the federal agents surrounding his fortified compound " guns for hire , " a New Hampshire man convicted of tax evasion vowed today that he and his wife would fight U.S. marshals to the death if they tried to capture them .
" Do not under any circumstances make any attempt on this land .
We will not accept any tomfoolery by any criminal element , be it federal , state or local , " said Ed Brown in a press conference from the stoop of his concrete - clad home in Plainfield , N.H.
" We either walk out of here free or we die . "
Brown and his wife , Elaine , were sentenced in absentia in April to serve 63 months in prison for failing to pay more than $ 1 million in income tax .
The couple , however , insists that there is no law that requires citizens to pay income tax .
" There is no law .
We looked and looked , " Brown told the press .
Brown and his supporters , including Randy Weaver , leader of the 1992 standoff with ATF agents at Ruby Ridge , Idaho , told the press that the government has unlawfully tricked people into believing they have to pay income tax , knowing full well that such a law would be unconstitutional .
" We will defend it to the death .
This is 1776 all over again .
You cannot tax someone 's labor because that is slavery , " Brown said .
Carrying a pistol in his waistband , Brown also insisted that he could not receive a fair trial in a federal court because " the court system falls under freemasonry . "
" There [ are ] no longer any lawful courts .
The Freemasons have taken over our nation .
… [ Freemasons want ] to take over our nation and all nations on the planet , " Brown said .
Weaver , whose son was killed by federal agents and who later received a $ 100,000 settlement from the government , said he was there to support the Browns .
" I 'd rather die on my feet right here than die on my knees under this de facto government , " he said .
" Bring it on . "
Despite months of surveillance and reports of agents hiding in the woods of the couple 's 110 - acre compound , U.S. marshals said this morning that the Brown 's Plainfield , N.H. , home was not surrounded by their officers .
U.S. Marshal Stephen Monier made an effort to starkly contrast the actions of the Marshals with those of the ATF agents who besieged Ruby Ridge in 1992 .
In addition to Weaver 's son , one federal agent was killed in that incident .
" There is no standoff and the house is not surrounded . "
Monier told ABC News.com .
" We have no intention of assaulting the house or engaging in a violent confrontation . "
Monier said he believed Weaver would attend the press conference the Browns are hosting this afternoon .
He said Weaver and others -- some of whom are believed to have brought the couple weapons -- have been freely allowed to enter Brown 's property .
" There is no reason to block Weaver .
People are free to exercise their First Amendment rights , " Monier said .
" We are not setting up roadblocks or surrounding the house . "
In April , Ed and Elaine Brown were sentenced in absentia to 63 months in prison for failing to pay more than $ 1 million in taxes .
Since failing to appear in court the couple has remained within the concrete - fortified walls of their rural New Hampshire home .
Monier said the Marshals have been communicating with the couple in an effort to get them to turn themselves over the federal authorities without having to resort to the use of force .
" We know they have weapons and we do not want to see this escalate , " he said .
Last week agents cut off the home 's telephone , Internet and power access .
Monier said the couple most likely had generators -- possibly solar or wind powered -- but that eventually the Browns would become uncomfortable enough in their isolation that they would be forced to surrender .
" They probably have generators but those will soon need fuel and need people to fix them .
We want to continue to encourage them , and make it uncomfortable enough for them that they 'll give up . "
Brown said he and his wife had enough supplies to wait out the government no matter how long it lasted .
He said the couple did not use air conditioning and could chop down trees from firewood .
Last week , Danny Riley a friend of the Browns was arrested near their home by federal agents while walking the couple 's dog .
The Marshals claim they were engaged in routine surveillance of the property , but the Browns believe Riley thwarted a potential raid .

In situations like these , I 'd prefer line. strip ( ) to ( line.split ( ) ) [ 0 ] .

I thought it might be fun to do it in C# , just for kicks : using System ; using System .
IO ; using System .
Linq ; using System .
Collections .
Generic ; public class AnagramNames { public static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { var names = from name in File.ReadAllLines ( " dist.male.first " ) select name .
Split ( ' ' ) [ 0 ] ; var pairs = from pair in ( from name in names group name by SortCharsInString ( name ) ) where pair .
Count ( ) > 1 select pair ; foreach ( var pair in pairs ) { Console.WriteLine( String.Join ( " , " , pair .
ToArray ( ) ) ) ; } } public static string SortCharsInString ( string s ) { char [ ] arr = s.ToArray ( ) ; Array .
Sort ( arr ) ; return new string ( arr ) ; } }
It could be even shorter and more memory - efficient if I could find a way in the standard library to : Get an IEnumerable < string > for " lines in a file " without reading the whole file into an array ( it 's easy to write such a thing , so I 'm sure it's in the standard library somewhere ... )
for " lines in a file " without reading the whole file into an array ( it 's easy to write such a thing , so I 'm sure it's in the standard library somewhere ... )
Sort the characters in a string in a functional way , rather than in - place

Test this - it will throw a TypeException ; in addition you need to print only the entries with more than one name in the list .
" setdefault " is easier .

This problem is one of many that involve clustering values based on their signatures .
If you factor out the signature - computing method as a parameter , what 's left is a handy , reusable function that solves a large family of related problems :

Lou Dobbs says the candidates for president have not intelligently addressed the key issues .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Remember how excited everybody was just a short while ago that this presidential campaign was the first in 80 years to be wide open , without a president or vice president in the campaign ?
Remember how excited we all were that American presidential politics had matured to the point that a woman and a black man were winning primary and caucus votes that allowed both to claim front - runner status ?
Now Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are ensnared in petty racial and gender politics and that does neither of them credit .
But at least the ugly spectacle that Clinton and Obama created should serve as a reminder to all of us that group and identity politics have outlived their effectiveness and that pandering to socio-ethnocentric interest groups and special interests , whether as large as corporate America or as small as the construction company in a congressman 's district , has no rightful place in 21st century American politics .
The Democratic and Republican candidates for president have done hardly better than President Bush and the Democratic - led Congress on the issue of the war in Iraq .
The candidates trip over one another to bring more of our troops home faster than the other candidates , or refusing to withdraw our troops from Iraq until the job is done ; policy choices not dissimilar to the simplistic White House 's false choices in either staying the course or cutting and running .
But these presidential candidates , both Republican and Democrat , obviously would prefer not to discuss the war in Iraq in their campaigns , nor to state clearly whether they would secure our borders and ports as an absolute first condition before taking up the issue of immigration reform .
Both parties and nearly all of their candidates continue to drive false choices for the illegal immigration debate as well .
The centrist and appropriate policy response to this crisis is to secure our borders and ports , and enforce current immigration laws .

Now that the economy has become the number - one issue for primary voters of both parties , we can expect the candidates to come up with new economic programs that will solve every problem in our society .
Economic stimulus packages will soon be the order of the day , with more false choices :
The Democrats will offer handouts to every man , woman and child and the Republicans will give drastic tax breaks to large corporations and the wealthy as the panacea for what ails us .
These candidates will not have addressed the causes of our economic malaise :
The critical issue of the faith - based free trade policies of the past decade that have been devastating to working men and women and their families , policies that have enlarged our trade debt to more than $ 6 trillion .
And while presidential candidates of both political parties talk about our public education system in terms of globalism and American competitiveness , they fail to recognize the crisis in our public schools and they fail to prescribe urgently needed solutions .
This partisan nonsense and predictable platitudes of this presidential campaign does not augur well for the nation , and I fear none of the candidates of either party is capable of extricating us from the mess their partisan politics have created .

It is feared the problem has been exacerbated by organised crime
The Italian government has set up an emergency commission to try and stop the spread of the disease , which affects milk production .
The plains of Campania , around Naples , are home to large buffalo herds .
As much as 30 % of the herd who live in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius are reported to be infected .
The area is the exalted home of mozzarella di bufala : not only an essential part of the Italian diet , but one of Italy 's most important exports .
But the Neapolitan farmers who make this famous milky cheese are facing a crisis .
In the next two months , the Italian government will start the slaughter of 32,000 buffalo , infected with Brucellosis - a contagious bacterial disease that in livestock leads to abortion , infertility and reduced milk production .
It can be transmitted through food to humans , causing severe intermittent fever - though the milk which produces the cheese is perfectly safe when it is pasteurised .
Mafia ' threat '
Brucellosis has been present in the herd for 10 years .
But the Italian papers say the local vets who are supposed to test and put down infected animals have been intimidated by the local mafia - the Camorra - who also control some of the farms .
Consequently , it is reported , the disease has been allowed to spread to almost 30 % of the herd .
Caserta , one of two key mozzarella - producing areas , is the worst affected .
In the coming weeks , armed police will accompany government vets to help with the cull .
They say every infected animal destroyed will be burnt - and it is estimated the cost to the Italian government will be 66 m euros ( $ 97 m ; £ 49 m ) .
In this Freedom of Information Act lawsuit the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) seeks information about two electronic surveillance systems developed by the FBI : DCS - 3000 and Red Hook .
Little is publicly known about these spying tools .
DCS - 3000 was developed in the wake of " Carnivore " or DCS - 1000 a controversial surveillance system the FBI used several years ago to monitor online traffic through Internet service providers .
One Department of Justice report said DCS - 3000 was created to " to intercept personal communications services delivered via emerging digital technologies used by wireless carriers . "
According to the same report Red Hook is a system developed to " collect voice and data calls and then process and display the intercepted information . "
On May 7 2007 a federal judge ordered the FBI to process and release documents responsive to EFF 's request on a rolling basis .
Those records will be posted here as EFF receives them .
Infants who are raised in bilingual homes learned two similar - sounding words in a laboratory task at a later age than babies who are raised in homes where only one language is spoken .
This difference , which is thought to be advantageous for bilingual infants , appears to be due to the fact that bilingual babies need to devote their attention to the general associations between words and objects ( often a word in each language ) for a longer period , rather than focusing on detailed sound information .
This finding suggests an important difference in the mechanics of how monolingual and bilingual babies learn language .
These findings are from new research conducted at the University of British Columbia and Ottawa .
They appear in the September / October 2007 issue of the journal Child Development .
Immigration , official language policies , and changing cultural norms mean that many infants are being raised bilingually .
Because nearly all experimental work in infant language development has focused on children who are monolingual , relatively little is known about the learning processes involved in acquiring two languages from birth .
The researchers sought to determine whether the demands of acquiring more sounds and words lead to differences in language development .
An important part of language development is the ability to pay attention to native speech sounds to guide word learning .
For example , English learners expect that the nonsense words " bih " and " dih " refer to different concepts because " b " and " d " are different consonant categories in English .
By 17 months of age , monolingual English infants use native - language speech - sound differences to guide them as they learn words .
Do bilingual infants show a similar developmental pattern ?
The study revealed that bilingual infants follow a slightly different pattern .
Researchers tested bilingual children ages 14 , 17 , and 20 months on their ability to associate two words that differed in a single consonant sound with two different objects .
Experiment 1 included a heterogeneous sample of bilingual babies ( i.e. , those exposed to English and another language ) .
Experiment 2 tested two homogeneous groups of bilingual infants ( English - French and English - Chinese ) .
In both experiments , infants were repeatedly presented with a crown - shaped object that was called " bih " and a molecule - shaped object called " dih . "
They were then tested on their ability to notice a switch in an object 's name ( for example , the molecule - shaped object being called " bih " instead of " dih " ) .
In all of the groups , the bilingual infants failed to notice the minimal change in the object 's name until 20 months of age , whereas monolingual infants noticed the change at 17 months .
This later use of relevant language sounds ( such as consonants ) to direct word learning is due to the increased demands of learning two languages , the researchers suggest .
Ignoring the consonant detail in a new word may be an adaptive tool used by bilingual infants in learning new words .
Outside the laboratory , there is little cost to overlooking some of the consonant detail in new words , as there are few similar - sounding words in infants ' early vocabularies .
By paying less attention to the detailed sound information in the word , bilingual infants can devote more cognitive resources to making the links between words and objects .
Extending this approach to word learning for a few months longer than monolinguals may help bilinguals " keep up " with their peers .
Indeed , previous research has shown that bilinguals and monolinguals achieve language - learning milestones ( such as speaking their first word ) at similar ages and have vocabularies of similar sizes when words from both languages are taken into account .
" Through studies with bilingual infants , we can gain a deeper understanding of language development in all infants , " according to Christopher T. Fennell , assistant professor of psychology at the University of Ottawa and the lead author of the study .
" In addition , the findings emerging from such studies will have practical implications for parents who are raising their children in a bilingual environment by revealing how young bilinguals acquire language . "

America 's determination to halt illegal immigration across its border with Mexico is set to claim an unusual victim - the jaguar .
The US government has just vetoed a plan to save the species , Panthera onca , one of the world 's most endangered , and beautiful , large cats - and activists blame the Bush administration for its determination to cut illegal immigration from Mexico .
' The US is building a wall along the border to keep out immigrants .
But that would stop jaguars crossing the border and entering the US .
We wanted to set up refuges over here and create breeding populations that might save the species , but the government has said " no way " .
It does n't want anything interfering with that wall , ' said Kieran Suckling , of the US Centre for Biological Diversity .
' Yet the US is the animals ' best hope of avoiding extinction .
Its numbers are declining alarmingly today .
But now that chance has been blocked - for political reasons . '
Jaguars were once common across the southern United States - as well as in Central and South America - but were wiped out in the US in the sixties .
The last animal was shot in 1963 .
In other countries it has clung on , but numbers have begun to decline dramatically in recent years .
However , conservationists were recently delighted to discover several jaguars had been returning to New Mexico and Arizona from Mexico - probably because global warming was changing their habitat .
Suckling and his colleagues then prepared plans to use these stray jaguars as the core for a breeding population , but have just been told by the US Fish and Wildlife Service their plan will not be adopted .
' The Bush administration does n't like the idea of reintroducing species and it does n't want anything getting in the way of its Mexican wall , ' he added .
' Our jaguar scheme would have needed gaps in the wall , and that was deemed unacceptable . '
Yet the US , although it killed off its jaguars , is the animals ' best chance for survival , say biologists .
The US has wild places , is now ecology - conscious , and has organisations that could protect the animal .
' Other countries do n't have the resources to save the jaguar .
We do and have done so with other species , like the grey wolf , but are now being blocked for political reasons . '
Sundial Park Genk
8. Digital sundial
Be it accidental or not , the four most innovative sundials line the high side of the Sundial Park : the digital dial , the conical dial ( nr. 9 ) and the shadow plane dials ( nr. 10 and nr. 11 ) .
" What in heaven is a digital sundial ? "
That was the title of an article in Scientific American ( August 1991 ) , which prompted a flurry of mental activity in many a smart brain .
One answer is on display here : a sundial that displays the time , not by throwing a shadow on a set of lines , but in plainly readable digits .
The dial functions from 8:00 to 5.55 hr , in 5 minute steps .
There is a smooth transition from one reading to the next .
In the picture above , the " 0 " from 3:20 is still faintly visible .
The sundial has been invented by Hans Scharstein and Werner Krotz - Vogel ( Germany ) and Daniel Scharstein ( USA ) .
See for more information the website of Digital Sundials International .
My comments :
A real black box !
When we first visited the Sundial Park , I saw this shallow black box high on a pole , still needing support apparently .
The weather was heavily overcast , and the object gave no indication of any sundial functionality , be it that the short rod carrying the box seemed to be pole - stylish .
It looked as if something could be displayed on the black screen , but no electrical connection could be seen .
Sine sole sileo ( I am silent without sun ) would be a most adequate motto for this device !
Principle of the digital dial
The sundial consists of two closely spaced parallel masks .
The first mask , facing the sun , has a regular array of thin vertical slits , which cast a striped light pattern onto the second mask .
That mask , facing the visitor , is composed of narrow stripes , cut from the digits to be displayed .
These stripes are intermingled , so that they are illuminated consecutively .
The figures below illustrate this in a simplified example for the right - most numeral , which is either a " 0 " or a " 5 " .
mask facing sun
mask facing visitor
In one position of the sun , the stripes cut from the " 0 " are lit .
Five minutes later the sun has moved over 1.25° and the stripes derived from the " 5 " are illuminated .
Again 5 minures later , the stripes from the " 0 " are again illuminated , but the light falling through a given slit has advanced one stripe to the left .
A translucent screen behind the second mask helps diffusing the thin light lines and enables the numerals to be read from a broad angle .
Narrow your eyes , if necessary , to simulate this effect .
In reality the twelve numbers for the minutes display : 00 , 05 , 10 , ... , 50 , 55 , are cut and intermingled together .
So only after one hour will the light falling through a given slit has advanced one stripe to the left .
Similarly , the ten hour numbers : 8 , ... , 12 , 1 , ... , 5 are mixed in the left half of the box .
The fineness of the fabrication process is obvious from the picture at right , showing a detail from the top one : between each pair of light lines , eleven others will appear successively in one hour time .
The slits and the stripes are pointing to the celestial pole , therefore the date ( declination of the sun ) does not play a role .
The principle and construction of the digital dial is described in more detail in the patent application .
The trick that makes it really work
That sounds not too complicated , is n't it ?
No , but it would n't work very well this way ...
In fact , each slit in the first mask is the gnomon of a small polar dial .
The stripes in the second mask are the time lines : 5 - min lines for the minute numbers , 1 - hour lines for the hour numbers .
First , have a look at the dial face of a polar dial , such as the Book of Time ( nr. 12 ) .
The hour lines are not equally spaced , but their interval increases considerably to the sides .
The shadow of the pole - style moves slowest across the dial face around noon , and faster in the morning and the afternoon .
Now have a look at the right - most panel in the figure above , the one with the three sun icons .
Assume that we are here somewhere in the afternoon .
The effect of increasing velocity of the lines of light would cause them to hit the next stripes just somewhat too early .
The effect would get stronger as the sun moves further to the west , so that the time would advance at an increasing pace .
And that is not what a clock is expected to do ...
What is needed is a way of linearizing the relationship between solar angle ( corresponding to time ) and the velocity of the light across the second mask .
This problem can be solved by profiting from an oddity of nature , and that is in my view the real heart of this invention .
This ' oddity ' is Snell 's law of refraction , which describes how light traverses the boundary between two media .
The relationship between angle a ( in air ) and b ( in some transparent medium ) depends on the index of refraction n of the medium :
sin(b ) = sin( a ) /n .
Four large digital dials installed
The digital dial in Genk was the first one on public display world - wide .
Next , the Sundial Garden in the Deutsches Museum in Munich ( Germany ) had one installed , followed by the Municipal Museum in Köln ( Cologne , Germany ) .
The latest one is in front of a house on Martha 's Vineyard , an island off the coast of Massachusetts ( USA ) .
The window - sill version
A smaller version of the digital dial has been developed that can be placed on the window - sill of a south - facing window .
The minutes now are displayed in a column to the right of the hour numbers , in 10 min steps .
The advantage is that the transition from one number to the next does not occur at the same place .
This enables accurate reading , by interpolating the observed intensities .
In the example below , it is between 12:35 and 12:40 hr .
A new type , or just a multiple polar dial ?
Is this just a multiple polar dial , comparable to multiple dials like the polyhedron dial ( nr. 4 ) ?
Some people think so .
In my view , that does not do justice to the degree of organization of this instrument .
Using an array of hundreds closely spaced , interacting polar dials to get pictures out of the instrument is quite an innovative step .
As a metaphor , compare a single string under tension that produces a single tone when hit with a piano on which a Beethoven sonata could be played ( or a boogie - woogie if one preferred ) .
Other ' digital ' dials
Several sundial designers have called their product ' digital ' .
Examples are :
The Thew sundial , in which an equatorial band has holes in the form of the hour numbers .
These are projected onto the dial face , on which a vertical , pole - oriented line marks the time .
See for instance the Whitehall dial in our garden .
The digital sundial of HinesLab , Inc. ( USA ) .
This is essentially ( a blueprint package for ) an equatorial dial , where the light is picked up by optical fibers and routed to a 7 - segment digital display .
No electronics involved .
The display resolution is ten minutes .
Robert L. Kellogg ( USA ) developed a " compound polar dial " that is similar to the Scharstein dial .
One sundial covers a time span of 4 hours , so that 3 dials are necessary to span a day .
The display resolution is 10 min .
His description was published in the NASS Compendium vol. 2 nr. 3 ( 1995 ) , p. 4-10 .
The digital sundial by Dietrich Ahlers in Bremen ( Germany ; website in German ) , a more sophisticated version of the Thew dial , capable of reading civil time with 1 - 2 min accuracy .
A sundial using digital ( computer ) power was the virtual vertical sundial designed by Willy Leenders ( Hasselt , Belgium ) for an exhibition in the Municipal Museum in his home town in the summer of 2000 .

Violence has dipped in Iraq since ' the Surge ' began earlier this year , but as New York Times video journalists Stephen Farrel and Diana Oliva Cave document , chaos can erupt at any moment .
The two visited a centuries - old exotic pet market in Baghdad where life seemed to be returning to normal .
" Families are venturing back , with the violence down , " said one Iraqi merchant , " for the first time in a long time . "
But fast - forward to that same market one week later .
This time , shoppers and sellers are reeling from the detonation of a bomb that had been concealed in a box used for transporting birds .
" Last week , nothing happened .
And for weeks before that , nothing happened , " said an Iraqi .
" Then , they let the people feel safe ... when they see the families start to come out , they used this opportunity . "
The blast , which killed 13 people , was the third on this market in just 18 months .
Citizens now feel unprotected .
" There is no security , " another Iraqi merchant says .
" There is no searching .
They should put two or three police patrols inside the market to search boxes . "
This video is from The New York Times , broadcast on November 23 .

The shelter can withstand storms , extreme cold , and even bullets
Its creators were on BBC TV's Dragon 's Den , but they refused investment from the show 's entrepreneurs because they wanted too much of their company .
Will Crawford and Peter Brewin 's design will go into production at their new plant near Pontypridd next summer .
It is made by adding water , pumping it into shape and waiting for it to dry .
Their " concrete canvas " shelters have already drawn interest from aid agencies and the military .
" We originally came up with the idea when were entering loads of design competitions to fund our way through college , " said Mr Crawford .
" The concrete cloth is inspired by the material used to make plaster casts in hospital , but we had to come up with a completely different way of making it work with concrete . "
The " dragons " actually offered us the money we wanted , which was around £ 85,000
Will Crawford , Concrete Canvas
Along with his friend from Imperial College London , Mr Brewin , the two 28 - year - olds turned the concrete cloth idea into a way of putting up cheap , long - lasting emergency shelters .
The shelter is delivered in a bag , which is ripped open and water added .
The material soaks up the moisture , activating the concrete .
But the cloth remains flexible and is inflated by a battery - operated pump .
After 12 hours , the shelter becomes completely solid , and can even withstand being shot at with handguns .
" One of the competitions we entered helped to fund us to go out to Uganda for five weeks where we spoke with aid agencies and non-government organisations on the ground , " said Mr Crawford .
" That really encouraged us to pursue the idea of the shelters . "
The two inventors were so confident in their product they showcased it on the BBC's Dragon 's Den , where entrepreneurs bid for funding from real - life millionaires .
" The ' dragons ' actually offered us the money we wanted , which was around £ 85,000 , " said inventor Mr Crawford .
" But they wanted 40 % of the company for that investment , and that was simply too much for us , so we walked away . "
However , the shelter idea did not go unnoticed and the pair won development funding from the Department of Trade and Industry , and a regional assistance grant from the Welsh Assembly Government .
It has led to them setting up their production base at Treforest , near Pontypridd , with full - scale production starting in eight months .
The entrepreneurs have already sold a shelter to the US military to be assessed , and they will fly to America in the new year to give a demonstration to the US Naval Construction Force and federal emergency planners .

Livia Iacolare -
Simplest GUI widgets are the building blocks for most functionality on the web , but it 's rare to find sites that use all the dialog controls correctly .
Even something as simple as radio buttons and checkboxes are incorrectly used half the time .
And let 's not even get started on drop - down menus , which are horribly abused .
This article talks about another design element that gets frequently misused : tabs .
( Here , I 'm talking about in - page tabs , as shown in the several example screenshots below .
These are the tabs you might design yourself , as part of your website or web - based application .
A different kind of tabs is used as browser chrome to allow users to keep multiple pages open in the browser at the same time .
I 'm not discussing browser tabs in this article . )
Tab - Usability Guidelines
Here are 12 design guidelines for using tabs :
Use tabs to alternate between views within the same context , not to navigate to different areas .
This is the single most important point , because staying in place while alternating views is the reason we have tabs in the first place .
Logically chunk the content behind the tabs so users can easily predict what they 'll find when they select a given tab .
( Card sorting is one option for researching this “ mini - IA ” problem .
If you do n't find clearly distinct groupings , then tabs are likely the wrong interface control for managing your content . )
Use tabs only when users do n't need to see content from multiple tabs simultaneously .
If people do need to compare the info behind different tabs , then having to switch back and forth puts an added burden on their short - term memory , increases cognitive load and interaction cost , and lowers usability compared to a design that puts everything on one big page .
Design tabs that are parallel in nature .
If the tabs are significantly dissimilar , users will interpret them as site navigation .
Highlight the currently selected tab .
Make sure that the highlighting is prominent enough so people can tell which tab is selected .
In addition to highlighting , you can mark the current tab by size , a boldfaced label , an icon , or by making it appear to be in front of the other tabs .
As shown in the above example , such additional signaling is important if there are only two tabs .
The unselected tabs should be clearly visible and readable , reminding the user of the additional options .
If the nonhighlighted tabs are faded too much into the background , there 's a risk that users will never click them and never discover the many hidden features .
Connect the current tab to the content area , just as if you were shuffling several physical index cards with tabs stuck to them .
This emphasizes which panel is being shown , and also tells users which tab is selected when there are only 2 tabs .
Write short tab labels and use plain language , rather than made - up terms .
Tab labels should usually be 1 – 2 words .
Short labels are more scannable ; if you need longer labels , it ’s a sign that the choices are too complicated for a tab control .
Do not use ALL CAPS for tab labels .
ALL CAPS is rarely a good idea because it 's harder to read .
Readability does n't matter so much for single , short words , but — as guideline # 20 for homepage usability states — you should pick one capitalization style ( be it sentence - case or title - style capitalization ) and stick to it .
Stick to only one row of tabs .
Multiple rows create jumping UI elements , which destroy spatial memory and thus make it impossible for users to remember which tabs they 've already visited .
Also , multiple rows are a sure symptom of excessive complexity :
If you need more tabs than will fit in a single row , you must simplify your design .
Place the row of tabs on top of the tab panel — not on the sides or the bottom , where users often overlook them .
The scope controlled by the tabs should be obvious from the visual design .
Metaphorically , using tabs is like leafing through index cards in a drawer of an old - fashioned card catalog , so users must be able to tell at a glance what constitutes an " index card " ( i.e. , tab panel ) .
Tabs should all look and work the same .
Consistency is important in GUI control design because it builds the user ’s feeling of mastery over the interface in several ways :
Recognizability .
When something always looks the same , you know what to look for and you know what it is when you find it .
Predictability .
When something always works the same way , you know what will happen when you act on it .
Empowerment .
When you can rely on your past knowledge of all the available features , you can easily compose a set of actions to achieve your goal .
Efficiency .
There 's no need to spend time learning something new or worrying about the effect of inconsistent features .
Conclusion
Tabs may seem like a humble and uninteresting aspect of graphical user - interface design .
But as shown here , there are many specific design issues in creating tabs that work well , are easy to use , and support an empowering user experience .
Tab - design problems are a common finding when using analytics for a UX health check .
Assuming that you ’re tracking within - page actions , you may find that users rarely use the tabs on certain pages .
Check if you ’re violating any of the guidelines in this article .
If yes , you probably have the culprit , and you can be a hero by doing a quick A/ B test that will often show twice the use of tabs redesigned to be compliant .
If you follow the design guidelines in this article , users will know how to use your tabs without further exploration or error - prone guessing .
This again means that they can devote all their time and brainpower to understanding the content and features that you ’re making available under these tabs .
Tabs have no value in themselves , but they shine ( in terms of meeting UX and business goals ) when they do n’t draw attention to themselves but facilitate access to the content .

WASHINGTON - Israel has improved its record on human trafficking in the last year , according to a US State Department human rights report published Tuesday .
The report ranks 151 nations based on their behavior in combating human trafficking , such as prostitution and slavery , highlighting government efforts involving prosecution , protection , and prevention .
Israel was among 23 nations placed on a US ' Watch List ' regarding trafficking in human persons in 2005 , the second lowest category on an annual State Department report .
This year , in an assessment of the issue in 2006 , Israel was one of 10 nations to succeed in rising to a higher category .
According to the report , " The Government of Israel does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking ; however , it is making significant efforts to do so .
Israeli efforts Law to forbid human trafficking Aviram Zino Bill passes in second and third readings in Justice Committee , includes for first time category ' trafficking of human beings , ' trafficking of organs , and employing workers in slavery conditions .
Chairman of committee : ' Law puts Israel in line with enlightened countries of world '
Law to forbid human trafficking
" This year , the government passed crucial amendments to its anti-trafficking law that comprehensively prohibit all forms of trafficking in persons , including involuntary servitude and slavery .
In addition , the government extended legal assistance to victims of trafficking for involuntary servitude , and passed a national action plan to combat trafficking for forced labor . "
Despite these improvements , because the government still " does not provide forced labor victims with adequate protection services - such as shelter , medical , and psychological aid – and …has not yet reported any criminal prosecutions under its new law for labor trafficking , " Israel did not break through to the top category .
Serving as a hopeful sign for future progress , Israeli Rahel Gershuni was listed among ' heroes acting to end modern - day slavery ' and was praised for leading the reform movement within the Israeli government " by serving as a catalyst for the development of policies that treat sex trafficking victims as true victims and not as criminals . "
Over the last three years , she has changed countless attitudes , shaped scores of policies , and , most importantly , saved many lives , " said the report .
The report
The report splits nations into four categories .
Tier 1 , the highest category , is awarded to nations who comply with minimum standards of Congress ' Trafficking Victims Protection Act ( TVPA ) of 2000 .
A country that fails to make significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons , per US law , receives the lowest ranking - a “ Tier 3 ” assessment .
Such an assessment could trigger the withholding of non-humanitarian , non-trade - related assistance from the United States to that country .
In between there are Tier 2 and Tier 2 " Watch List " countries .
Tier 2 countries are those whose governments do not fully comply with the Act ’s minimum standards but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards .
Watch list nations , while making similar compliance efforts , differ from Tier 2 countries in that the absolute number of victims of severe forms of trafficking is significant or increasing or there is a failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat human trafficking .
As stated , Israel has moved up to Tier 2 , and is no longer on the US watch list .
According to the report , Israel is a destination country for low - skilled workers from China , Romania , Jordan , Turkey , Thailand , the Philippines , Nepal , Sri Lanka , and India who migrate voluntarily for contract labor various industries .
Some are subsequently subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude , such as withholding of passports and other restrictions on movement , threats , and physical intimidation .
Israel is also a destination country for women trafficked from Eastern Europe — primarily Ukraine , Moldova , Uzbekistan , Belarus and Russia — for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation .
This is the seventh annual Trafficking in Persons Report , which the State Department is required to submit each year to the US Congress .
It is intended to raise global awareness , to highlight the growing efforts of the international community to combat human trafficking and to encourage foreign governments to take effective actions to counter all forms of trafficking in persons .
The students had already taken off their clothes and slipped into robes when they lined up in two rows facing each other .
They stood close in the softly lit room , with seven women on one side and seven men just across from them .
The men would soon practice stroking the women .
But first , they had some warm - up exercises to do .
A sultry - voiced , earthy brunette named Shara Ogin introduced the group to the practice of " obnosing , " or noticing the obvious , which involves looking at someone and listing off their physical characteristics .
A steady hum filled the quiet , yogalike studio as each man gazed at the woman facing him and rattled off his observations .
The freckles on a cheek .
The shape of an eyebrow .
The way a band of color stretched around a woman 's pupils .
The exercise helped them practice for later , when the class would shift its focus to obnosing female genitalia .
Then , when it came time for the stroking exercise to begin , each woman stretched out an arm and the man across from her took it and cradled it gently in his own .
The sleeves of their robes , whether silky or fuzzy , pink or baby blue , were pushed back to expose the soft bare skin on the inner side of the forearm .
The stroke is a key aspect of the practice known as " orgasmic meditation " ( or OM ) , which is designed to help people tap into sensual energy through stimulation of the clitoris .
The practice is at the heart of One Taste Urban Retreat Center in SOMA , a shared - living community where the stroking class is being taught .
Orgasmic meditation is devoted to female orgasm  after all , the women are typically the ones being stroked .
But the idea is that the " strokers " ( who are often men , but may be women , too ) are also fulfilled through what community members call " pleasure by proxy , " as well as by enjoying the sensations in their bodies as they stroke .
There are courses in how to satisfy a woman with hands - on instruction designed to show what she wants , and how to give it to her .
One class , for example , is titled " Ten Women Want You to Know : How to Handle a Woman 's Pussy . "
But for now , it was arms only .
" The men are going to stroke it as you would the clit during an OM , " Ogin instructed .
" Like you would a cat ! " added Nicole Daedone , who was leading the class .
With forefingers busy stroking , Ogin worked the room , inspecting everyone 's technique  although at One Taste they say sensuality is about 80 percent learning to navigate resistance and only 20 percent technique .
She urged the men to shut their eyes and feel how much pleasure they could extract from the arm - stroking exercise .
Did they want to change the speed ?
Change the pressure ?
How much sensation could they feel ?
Next , the women were encouraged to share .
One felt an opening in her throat .
Another felt a quivering .
" I feel a warmth in my pussy , " yet another woman said .
They do n't say " vagina " here .
They prefer " pussy " and " cock " because , in the parlance of the people running the place , those words are more " chargey , " or full of energy .
This little exercise was just a flavor of what was to come in the nearly 10 - hour , $ 195 introductory workshop at One Taste .
Over the next few hours , those attending would watch an orgasmic meditation demonstration and , if they wished , pair up for more hands - on exercises .
During the lunch break , they could eat anything they wanted so long as it was fed to them by someone else .
The day - long course would literally climax with multiple climaxes  at least for the women .
And no , they were n't faking it .
At One Taste Urban Retreat Center , orgasm is life .
One Taste is home to more than 50 " turned on " people who describe themselves as " messengers of orgasm . "
Community members cook , eat , do yoga , and sleep together .
They live together in several buildings in the same neighborhood , with as many as 24 people staying in one of the large bedrooms .
Most pair up as " research partners " to explore sensuality with one another .
That can mean simply sharing a bed , making out , having intercourse , or some level of intimacy in between .
Research partnerships can last for as short as a week or for more than a year .
While some at One Taste are monogamous , many are not .
And just because a pair of residents may have broken up as research partners does n't preclude them from occasionally snuggling and making out on one of the center 's comfy vintage couches .
They call this a research community rather than a commune , although communal living is part of the deal .
It 's not the first sensuality - focused community , but there are a couple of things that set One Taste apart .
For one thing , while it clearly has a pleasure principle , One Taste also emphasizes discipline  one reason that its denizens created what they call an " urban monk " sensual immersion program .
The community typically comes together to practice orgasmic meditation three times each weekday , at 7 a.m. ( that 's the big one where just about everybody goes ) , 2 p.m. , and about 6:45 p.m .
The afternoon and evening OMs tend to be a bit smaller , due to work and other obligations .
The schedule differs slightly on weekends , with a 7:45 a.m. OM session to allow community members to sleep in .
Then there 's the fact that this is a sensuality community focused on building connections to others through stroking the clitoris .
The female - centric nature of One Taste makes sense since it was founded by a woman : 39 - year - old Nicole Daedone .
She 's striking , a dynamic presence whose speech is punctuated by pregnant pauses and plenty of hand gestures .
Her chestnut hair normally hangs in perfect waves , and she always seems to have the right amount of makeup on her olive skin .
She gets quoted a lot by others at One Taste .
A community member may say , " Nicole says , " Avoidance is buying pain on credit cards with interest ' " or " Nicole says , " We should be an open source for sensuality . ' "
Pentagon chief says US ready to deploy combat troops in Pakistan
By Bill Van Auken
26 January 2008
The United States is “ ready , willing and able ” to deploy American combat troops in Pakistan for joint military operations in the country ’s troubled border region , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday .
The public statement about an American intervention in Pakistan appeared aimed at pressuring the regime of President Pervez Musharraf into accepting a more direct US role in the suppression of internal opposition , which is linked to the growing resistance to the American - led occupation of neighboring Afghanistan .
According to media reports , the Bush administration has conducted extensive top - level discussions on the crisis in Pakistan and drawn up plans for a US intervention in the wake of last month ’s assassination of Pakistan Peoples Party leader and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
The administration reportedly sees the political crisis in the aftermath of the political killing as an opportunity to expand its influence in the country .
Washington ’s stepped - up pressure on Pakistan is developing in the context of increasing fighting between tribal forces and government troops in a region bordering Afghanistan .
The government has reported that more than 200 fighters and 30 government soldiers have died during three weeks of violence in the South Waziristan region .
Gates ’s statement came in response to a reporter ’s question at a Pentagon news conference .
“ We remain ready , willing and able to assist the Pakistanis and to partner with them to provide additional training , to conduct joint operations , should they desire to do so , ” the defense secretary said .
While Gates acknowledged that the Pakistani regime has yet to request such aid , he stressed that “ this is clearly an evolving issue . ”
He added , “ What we have tried to communicate to the Pakistanis and essentially what we are saying here is we are prepared to look at a range of cooperation with them in a number of different areas , but at this point it ’s their nickel and we await proposals or suggestions from them . ”
Gates said that American forces could be used in “ going after Al Qaeda in the border area , ” while claiming that such an operation would involve “ a very small number of troops . ”
Asked what he meant by “ a very small number , ” Gates refused to comment .
He also declined a response to a question about whether American troops were already crossing the border from Afghanistan — where more than 28,000 are presently deployed — in pursuit of fighters resisting the US occupation .
In 2002 , the then chief of the US Central Command , Gen. Tommy Franks , said that Pakistan had agreed to allow US troops to engage in “ hot pursuit ” of forces fleeing across the border .
Washington has also acknowledged the presence of 50 US military “ advisors ” supposedly engaged in the training of Pakistani forces .
According to some reports , these troops have also participated in combat operation alongside Pakistani units .
The defense secretary said that Washington is “ concerned about the reestablishment of Al Qaeda safe havens in the border area . ”
In what amounted to a justification for US intervention in the name of the “ global war on terror , ” he added : “ I think it would be unrealistic to assume that all of the planning that they ’re doing is focused strictly on Pakistan .
So I think that that is a continuing threat to Europe as well as to us . ”
The remarks from the defense secretary followed a visit to Pakistan earlier in the week by the top US military official in the region , the chief of Central Command , Adm. William Fallon .
While in Pakistan , Fallon held talks with the officer who succeeded Musharraf after the military strongman relinquished his role as army chief , Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani .
While the two made little public comment during the visit , according to a written statement , they discussed “ the overall security situation in the region . ”
According to the Associated Press , on the eve of his trip to Pakistan , Fallon issued a secret order to US military commanders to draft plans for long - term operations in Pakistan aimed at propping up the existing regime and combating the internal insurgency that is threatening the government .
Citing an unnamed “ senior defense official , ” the news agency said that the plan was to extend until 2015 .
During a meeting in Florida with Middle Eastern defense chiefs held a week before his trip to Pakistan , Fallon told the media that the increased fighting in the country was leading the government to become more inclined to accept a US presence .
“ They see they ’ve got real problems internally , ” he said .
“ My sense is an increased willingness to address these problems , and we ’re going to try to help them . ”
He added that US aid would be “ more robust . ”
Meanwhile , Musharraf met with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland Thursday .
It represented the highest level contact between Islamabad and Washington since the Bhutto assassination .
Rice praised Musharraf in advance of the meeting as a “ good ally in the war on terrorism . ”
While declaring US concern for a “ free and fair election ” in Pakistan next month , she stressed that the administration had no intention of curtailing the billions of dollars in military aid that has propped up Musharraf ’s dictatorship .
For his part , Musharraf publicly opposed proposals for a stepped - up US military intervention in Pakistan .
“ This can not be done by US forces , ” Musharraf told a meeting in Davos .
“ Please do n’t think that the US forces have some kind of magic wand and they ’ll come and lead to success ....
They have their hands full in Afghanistan . ”
The Pakistani ruler claimed that his regime opposed any foreign presence in the country .
He added in relation to a US military intervention , “ The man in the street will not allow this — he will come out and agitate . ”
Whether Musharraf ’s statements are for public consumption or he is genuinely dragging his feet on accepting an expanded US military presence for fear of provoking even greater internal unrest in Pakistan is not clear .
There are indications , however , that Washington may be preparing an alternative to Musharraf .
The Washington Post reported Thursday that the Pakistani president “ is increasingly losing support from major constituencies , including his traditional military base , amid growing questions in both Pakistan and the United States about his ability to govern . ”
The paper cited a statement issued by the Ex- Servicemen ’s Society , a group that includes retired military commanders and security chiefs with extensive ties to the active military , calling for Musharraf ’s immediate resignation .
It also noted that the new military commander , General Kiyani , has issued an order forbidding any military officers from meeting the president without his approval and is preparing to withdraw officers from civilian posts in the Musharraf government .
According to the Post , “ US intelligence officials have told agencies in Washington for the first time that the Pakistani leader may be beyond political rescue or long - term relevance . ”
CAFR By Walter J. Burien , Jr. http://CAFR1.com
SUBMITTED TO : Snopes.com : 10/21/06
Please include the following at snopes.com
* It is VERY important to bring the following forward to the public *
-------------------
.HISTORY : It has been reported that trillions of collective dollars not shown in government Budget reports are shown through Government CAFR reports and they are virtually never openly discussed by the syndicated NEWS media , both the Democratic and Republican Party members , the House , Senate , and organized public education , and as in such over the last 50 years the domestic and international investment assets of US Federal and Local Governments as a whole have taken over the Stock , Derivative , Insurance , and Debt Markets .
The collective private sector 's assets and investments as of 2000 are now insignificant in comparison with what US Government now owns by and through investment . .
With , and being that the CAFR is " the " accounting document for every local government , and with it being effectively " BLACKED OUT " for open mention over the last 60 years , and that this fact of intentional omission of coverage is the biggest financial conspiracy that has ever taken effect in the United States .
First , what is a CAFR ?
A CAFR ( Comprehensive Annual Financial Report ) is government 's complete accounting of " Net Worth " .
The CAFR was established as local government 's complete accounting record starting in 1946 through the efforts of a private group located out of Chicago , IL by the name of Government Financial Officers Association ( GFOA ) http://gfoa.org and became mandatory by Federal requirement on all local governments in 1978 to complete if they did not all ready do so .
What Government , both political parties , organized education , and the syndicated News media have presented to the public over that 60 year time period were Budget Reports .
A Budget report is strictly planned expenditures for the year from a grouping of specific government service agencies .
A budget may also note some statistical , statutory , and demographic data for reference .
Most Government budget reports show where " tax " revenue will be used .
The CAFR on the other hand is not a projection of one year 's expenditures from a select grouping of agencies , but a complete cumulative record of assets , investments , and gross income from all agencies and all sources benefiting or held by that local government body .
A CAFR is the counter part to the Annual Financial Report ( AFR ) that publicly traded corporations are required to produce each year and give to every share - holder as a requirement of Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) law .
In many cases , a CAFR may show two to three times more income over what is shown in the corresponding Budget Report .
Relevant to taxpayer interests , the CAFR " is " the report for review over a limited showing as seen in the corresponding Budget report .
The CAFR could be considered the Bible of asset accounting for any local government body .
So , is the CAFR being " BLACKED OUT " from mention by the syndicated news media and both the Democratic and Republican Party members , and the House or the Senate , and even organized education ?
A Google search for CAFR produces over 1,500,000 hits but a Google " NEWS " search for CAFR as of 10/21/06 only produces seven ( 7 ) obscure hits of simple mention .
A corresponding " NEWS " search in the archives of the New York Times , LA Times , Chicago Tribune , and Wall Street Journal , which go back in their data banks , several decades showed in combination less than seven hits for CAFR .
Here with this disparity the answer for " is there a Black - Out from the Syndicated NEWS " agencies ?
The answer here would have to be a clear yes .
Have the school districts from across the USA that educate their students on Budgets , who also produce a CAFR each year made simple and basic mention of the CAFR at any point for education of their students of this basic subject ?
No , they have not .
Here does a Blackout exist ?
Apparently , yes is the answer .
Have elected officials or politicians in or running for office who talk continuously about Budgets openly made mention of the greater report of their local city , county , or State the CAFR , linked them at their web sites , or linked for mention in their news letters over the last 60 years ?
Virtually not a peep if at all any mention .
Here does a Blackout exist ?
Apparently , yes is the answer .
Are local Government CAFRs sent to all members of the House , Senate , Editors of Local News Papers , News Networks , and Educational department heads ?
Yes , they have .
The printing of the CAFR is a budgetary item requiring records to be kept as to each sending .
The before mentioned representatives have been sent the local government CAFR reports relevant to their locale now for over 50 years .
Here does a Blackout exist ?
Apparently , yes is the answer .
Upon overall review of the question : Does a Blackout , and in fact a conspiracy exist towards bringing the CAFR into the light of day for public scrutiny .
Based on the clear record over the last 50 years of abstention from the use or mention to the public , the answer here also appears to be a clear yes .
From the over 84,000 CAFR reports produced by local Government each year in combination with Federal Government 's own investment holdings , shows a conservative value of sixty trillion dollars held by Local and Federal Government as of 1999 .
An example of the holdings shown from just one Government CAFR ( NY STATE 2005 RETIREMENT FUND CAFR ) shows 133 billion dollars of investments held ( Microsoft 44 million shares thereof ) .
http://cafr1.com/NYSR.html
Motive for conspiracy to Blackout the simple mention of CAFR from the public 's realm of comprehension ?
ANSWER : The substantial money , Investments , and Power obtained there from and accomplished for those on the inside track could be the most probable answer .

The Rambo Knives
In 1968 David Morrell began writing " First Blood " while in college .
The book was published in 1972 .
In 1980 Carolco Pictures released the hit movie of the same name after hiring actor Sylvester Stallone to play the novel 's lead character , John Rambo .
( The name " Rambo " actually comes from the Pennsylvania Rambo apples . )
Stallone also wrote the screenplay for the movie .
Although the Rambo character in the book did not have a knife and died in the story , the movie character brandished a large " survival " knife that went on to become almost as much of a star as Rambo who survived to reappear in the sequels .
" First Blood " was followed by three sequels , " Rambo : First Blood Part II " in 1985 ( screenplay written by Stallone ) and " Rambo III " in 1988 ( written by Stallone ) , and " Rambo " in 2008 ( written and directed by Stallone ) .
David Morrell wrote novels for Rambo II and Rambo III based on the screenplay for the movies .
Each of the Rambo movies featured John Rambo and his big knife that was custom designed for each movie .
The Rambo knives were revolutionary to the world of knife enthusiasts and collectors .
This is the story of the Rambo knives .
This is the information that I have gathered in bits and pieces from various sources .
I am certain that I am not the leading authority on the Rambo knives and I welcome and corrections or omissions from our readers .
The knife , as with the knifemaker , has become legendary and as with any legend it is often hard , if not impossible , the separate facts from myths .
Stallone , who is a knife enthusiast and collector of custom knives , enlisted the services of two master knifemakers , Jimmy Lile and Gil Hibben , to design and make the custom knives for the movies .
The knifemakers and Stallone collaborated on the design of each knife .
Designs and prototypes were sent back and forth between the knifemakers and the movie studios until they came up with a knife that pleased Stallone and the movie prop people .
Stallone's " wall of knives " in his home First Blood - 1980
There have been a lot of rumors circulated among knife enthusiasts about various knifemakers that Stallone supposedly approached to make a knife for the movie .
One story even suggests that the legendary master knifemaker Bill Moran was approached and may have even made a prototype but then declined the offer to make the knives for the movie .
What we do know for sure is that a deal was struck for a master knifemaker from Arkansas , Jimmy Lile , to make the knives for " First Blood " .
Jimmy Lile had been a full time knifemaker since 1970 and had become one of the world 's most respected custom knifemakers and operated a knifemaking shop in Arkansas until his death in 1991 .
Lile had other knifemakers working in his shop under his supervision so not every knife that came out of his shop was handmade by Jimmy Lile but those that were not were marked differently with a " dot " stamped above the " Lile " name .
After Jimmy Lile 's death in 1991 , his wife Marilyn kept the shop open until 2003 when it closed for good .
Knives produced by his shop after Jimmy Lile 's death were also stamped with " LILE " but with a dot stamped above the name .
Jimmy Lile and Sylvester Stallone in 1985
Lile came up with an innovative new design that incorporated features that he envisioned a person needing in a survival situation .
The knife featured 14 split saw teeth along the spine , Philips and flat screwdrivers made into the cross guard , holes in the guard for lashing and a watertight hollow handle with a compass in the cap .
The original design had a second small folding knife stored in the handle but they later chose to use the handle storage for survival items such as fish hooks , fishing line and matches .
In the photo below , the knife You see on top is a Prototype for the First Blood Movie .
This is the only Prototype that was made with the same features as the movie knife .
It has 14 sawteeth and a polished blade .
The knife
You see under it is serial number 055 of the First Blood knives with 12 sawteeth .

One of the original 100 First Blood knives - 12 saw teeth
The knife was prominently displayed in the movie and used in several key scenes .
The unique design was an instant hit with knife enthusiasts and the " Survival Knife " was born .
Jimmy Lile made 100 serial numbered copies of the original First Blood knife .
Numbers 1 - 13 had 14 saw teeth along the spine .
Numbers 14-100 had 12 saw teeth .
Numbers 1 - 6 were stamped " movie knife " and sent to Stallone for use in the movie .
It is rumored that all 6 were pretty much destroyed during filming and are stored somewhere in bits and pieces .
Originally , Lile kept numbers 7 - 14 and Numbers 15 - 100 were sold to collectors around the world for $ 1,000 each with a top grain cowhide sheath .
Those knives now command prices of several thousand dollars each in those rare occasions when they are offered for sale .
Lile 's shop also produced 800 unnumbered First Blood knives .
14 saw teeth and folder
The original Lile knives were 13.8 inches in overall length with a 9 inch flat ground blade and a grey bead blasted finish except for the bright edges .
The knifes were usually made from D2 steel but some custom orders were made from 440C stainless steel .
The hollow handles were also D2 or 440C steel and wrapped with 36 feet of green nylon paracord sealed with a commercial lacquer for protection and waterproofing .
All of the serial numbered First Blood knives had a compass in the handle cap but some of the unnumbered knives had the optional " skull crusher " pommel .
The original movie sheath was made by Jim Buffaloe but it was reportedly modified by the movie prop people to give it a more worn and abused look .
Lile 's shop also sold the " Sly II Survivor Knife " .
These originally sold for $ 580 and were available in D2 or 440C steel and had a lugged guard .
They were available with 6 inch , 7 1/2 inch or 9 inch blades .
Other available options included polished edges and the screwdriver guard .
Lile " Sly II " with lugged guard The First Blood knife design was licensed to United Cutlery to make factory reproductions of the knife .
United Cutlery 's replica model UC - RB1 is 14 " overall and has a 9 " long , 1/4 " thick stainless steel blade .

Lile once again made the knives for the second Rambo movie , " Rambo : First Blood Part II " .
The Rambo II knives are generally referred to as the " Mission " knives since they were stamped with " Rambo The Mission " .
The movie knives were very similar to the First Blood knives , only slightly larger .
They are a little over 15 inches in overall length and have a 10 inch blade .
For the movie , they decided to use a black blade with polished edges so the contrast would show well in the film .
The blades were available in various finishes such as black with bright edges , gray with bright edges and all gray .
Only 100 serial numbered " Mission " knives were made .
They had black blades and bright edges , 14 saw teeth along the spine and the screwdriver cross guard .
Lile " Mission " Knife .
Somewhere around 800- 1000 un-numbered knives were made with a gray bead blasted finish .
I read that there was one Rambo II knife specially made for a custom order with 13 saw teeth .
Lile " Mission " knives with various blade finishes Lile also made a stilleto knife that was made from 440C stainless steel with a micarta insert in the handle .
it was a little over 10 inches in overall length and had a 5 1/2 inch blade .
Again , United Cutlery was licensed to make factory reproductions .
The United Cutlery replica model UC - RB2 was 15 3/8 " overall and had a 10 " blade .

Rambo III
In 1988 Carolco Pictures released " Rambo III " .
Stallone again went to Jimmy Lile to make a knife for the movie .
Lile could not or would not produce the knife that Stallone wanted so he went to master knifemaker G il Hibben about making the knife .
Stallone had previously purchased several of Gil 's custom knives for his personal collection .
Gil made some prototype knives and sent them to Sly .
Jimmy Lile and Gil Hibben
Gil Hibben and Sylvester Stallone An early Hibben prototype continued the Lile survival knife style .
Notice the finger grooved hollow handle .
The inspiration for the handle came from a bicycle handlebar grip .
Gil Hibben made at least 4 different versions of this knife each with different guards .
This knife was actually used in a couple of scenes in the movie .
Stallone originally wanted the Bowie style knife , which ultimately became the now famous Gil Hibben Rambo III Knife .
There was a point in which Stallone changed his mind and wanted Gil to make a polished saw tooth type , Gil added finger grooves to the handle .
The mine field scene was one of the first filmed .
Then came the phone call from Stallones ' secretary telling Gil to sit down , Sly changed his mind again and we are going with your original model , the Bowie type .
Well , by the time they realized that they had the saw tooth knife in the mine field scene , it was too late and cost prohibitive to go back and re-shoot it .
Funny thing is , most people never even noticed it was two different knives .
Eventually , they decided to abandon the hollow handled " survival " knife and come up with a whole new design .
Gil obliged with the now famous large bowie with the angled stainless steel guard and stainless steel butt cap .
The movie script called for Rambo to be seen forging his knife .
Gil made a video showing Stallone how to forge a knife .
In his example , he forged a blade from a piece of a truck leaf spring .
Still captures from Gil 's forging demonstration video for Stallone .
Gil sent Stallone several blades in various stages of the process to be used in the forging scene .
The scene was shot but later edited out of the movie .
Still captures from the deleted scene
You can see the deleted scene here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vkjqnWhg8k
It 's a shame the knife forging scene was deleted from the movie .
Rumor has it that Rambo may be seen forging another knife in the new movie " John Rambo " .
Have you ever wondered about the slot in the blade ?
This is one of the rarely seen prototypes .
Gil made a removable second blade that fit horizontally into the slot in the main blade .
It was held in place by spring loaded release button .
Only two of these knives were made , Sly has # 1 and Gil has # 2 .
Gil and Stallone communicated several times by telephone and faxes until they agreed on the now famous design .
This massive bowie style knife features a 11 3/4 " long , 2 1/4 " wide , 5/16 " thick blade of 440C stainless steel and a macassar ebony handle .
The movie knife was 18 " long overall and weighed 2 pounds .
It featured a stainless steel guard and pommel .
The unique angled guard is reminiscent of the knives that Gil had previously designed for use in Kenpo karate .
Gil made approximately 20 knives for use in the movie .
Some were used , some were not .
He also made a dagger that was briefly seen in the finished movie .
The 10 1/2 " inch dagger is one - piece construction of 440C stainless steel treated with a black non -glare finish .
Gil sells handmade copies of the dagger .
Some were serial number to match his handmade Rambo III knives and some were unnumbered as seen above .
Gil made only two of these daggers with his famous mirror polished finish .
One bears his " Louisville KY " stamp and is in the hands of a collector .
The second knife bears Gil 's current " La Grange KY " stamp and remains in Gil 's possession .
The " La Grange " mirror polished Rambo III Dagger .
After the movie was released , Gil made 350 serial numbered 440C stainless steel full size handmade copies and 101 serial numbered Damascus steel Rambo III knives .
Each of these were sold with certificates of authenticity .
The stainless steel models hand a hand rubbed satin finish except for the polished false edge on the top of the blade .
Number 2 of 350 full size handmade movie replicas
Handmade Damascus Rambo III
Gil also made one out of meteorite Damascus .
It is not serial numbered but the guard is marked " Meteorite " .
This knife was also licensed to United Cutlery to make factory reproductions .
It became one of the biggest selling collector knives ever made selling over 250,000 copies .
It also really started the trend of making reproduction movie knives as collectibles .
The United Cutlery replica is 16 " in overall length and has a 11 " long by 1/4 " thick blade thus it is a little shorter and has a thinner blade than the actual movie knife .
United Cutlery UC - 201 Rambo III
( Early models were cataloged as United Cutlery Model RB - 3 ) United Cutlery also produced a replica of the Rambo III Dagger and a miniature Rambo III knife .
UC - 245 Dagger
UC - 246 Miniature Rambo III
The United Cutlery Miniature Rambo III shown with the United Cutlery Rambo III for size comparison .
Gil also makes a handmade miniature Rambo III that is even smaller .
The Rambo III was a huge success for United Cutlery selling over 250,000 copies worldwide .
It opened up a whole new field of collectible movie memorabilia and set the stage for dozens of movie knife and sword replicas to be made over the next twenty years .
United Cutlery Rambo III Models
( The top 3 Rambo III knives are the same size .
The length looks different because of the angle of the photograph . )
United Cutlery continued to cash in on the success of the Rambo III replica by releasing two limited special editions in 1998 and 2000 .
The original version - United Cutlery UC - 201 was originally released in 1988 ( although I have seen it referenced as RB3 ) .
The UC - 201 model is still listed in the United catalog .
In 1998 United released the 10th Anniversary Edition UC - 1162 .
It was serial numbered xxxx / 5000 , has a " John Rambo " signature etched on the blade , and the flat of the blade is mirror polished .
This was a limited edition of 5,000 knives .
United Cutlery UC - 1162 10th Anniversary Rambo III
In the year 2000 , United released another version , UC - 1238 Rambo III Special Edition .
This version had a black handle , the blade is etched with the " John Rambo " signature , it is serial numbered , and it came with a display plaque and a collectors card .
This was also a limited edition of 5,000 knives .
United Cutlery UC - 1238 Special Edition Rambo III 28 years later the Rambo saga is still going strong .

click THIS LINK Rambo IV - " Rambo " Scheduled for release in the U.S. January 25 , 2008 .
Once again Sylvester Stallone called upon
Gil to make a knife for the upcoming movie " Rambo " scheduled to be released in 2008 .
In the movie script , Rambo loses his famous Rambo III and has to quickly forge a new knife from the materials he has available ( a piece of spring steel ) .
Gil Hibben begins the design process in October 2006 Stallone had an idea of what he wanted the knife to be .
Gil made at least 5 prototype versions of the knife before they finally arrived at the design that will be used in the movie .
Gil made the first prototypes from pieces of old truck leaf springs to be authentic and faithful to the movie script .
It 's hard to believe how much time and effort went into developing this knife .
Over the course of a year , Gil made nearly two dozen handmade prototypes before they arrived at exactly the knife Stallone wanted for the film .
And then when they finally had the final version , the studio needed several copies for filming .
Some of the early prototypes :
Gil started out by making a knife that was reminiscent of the Rambo III knife .
Stallone liked the blade design but said it was much too perfect .
He wanted something much more crude looking , as if it had been pounded out quickly from limited available resources .
Gil went back to the drawing board .
Since they were agreement on the basic blade design it was now a question of the handle and finish of the knife .
Gil thought about what materials might be available to the character in the movie .
He considered leather , wood , paracord , tape and even seat belt webbing for use on the handle .
He decided that paracord was the practical choice .
According to the script , Rambo loses his previous knife ( also designed and made by Gil ) and has to forge the new one quickly .
Without the time or resources to make a new sheath , he cuts the end off of his old sheath to allow room for the wider blade .
A " clean " prototype of the movie knife
They were getting close but Stallone said the knife was still to " finished " looking .
Stallone said , " the knife has to be brutal " .
Gil finally decided that considering Rambo's skills and experience , and the materials that the character would have available , the knife would have a cord wrapped handle , perhaps covered with some tape for additional grip .
The blade would be marked with depressions from the hammer blows from being forged quickly without time or resources to put a fine finish on the blade .
Following the tradition of the Rambo knives , it would be a large heavy blade with a thick spine .
Here is the final product as will be seen in the movie .
This is one of the actual knives that Gil sent to the movie studio .
Since , in the movie , Rambo would be modifying his 20 - year - old sheath from his previous knife , Gil weathered and aged the sheath for effect .
The retaining strap was removed since it had no function with the new knife design .
Gil Hibben debuts the new knife at the 2007 Knifemakers Guild Show
In the original script , Rambo still has the knife from Rambo III .
Stallone asked Gil to make some new ones from D2 steel for the new movie .
D2 carbon steel is stronger than the 440C stainless steel that was used previously .
Apparently Stallone had planned to put this knife to some heavy use but it apparently would up on the cutting room floor and was never seen in the new movie .
Maybe we will see it in the DVD version .
In the original script , Rambo throws the Rambo III knife away into the fire when he burns the river pirates boat .
He then has to make a new knife when he decides to go rescue the missionaries .
Actual Rambo III model made from D2 carbon steel for the new movie Gil will make a limited edition of 100 serial numbered handmade full size screen accurate replicas of the knife he made for use in the movie .
The handmade copies are exact replicas of the knife used in the movie except that the sheaths are not " weathered and aged " as they were to emulate the 20 year old sheath for the movie .
The handmade replicas come with a handmade leather sheath , Certificate of Authenticity and a special padded carrying case .
You can order your own handmade copy from his online catalog HERE .
J.R. 2nd Edition
The original Limited Edition series of 100 handmade movie knives quickly sold out .
Due to the high demand , Gil Hibben is making a second unlimited edition the is the same steel and size as the movie knife but with a black sheath , different handle and Certificate of Authenticity .
United Cutlery will be making a factory reproduction of the knife .
See UNITED CUTLERY WEBSITE United Cutlery is the ONLY manufacturer authorized by Gil Hibben to reproduce his designs .
Copies of Gil Hibben designs , including replicas of the knives that Gil Hibben designed for the movies , that are being sold by Master Cutlery , Hollywood Collectables Group or any other manufacturer other than United Cutlery are NOT authorized , endorsed , approved by or otherwise associated with Gil Hibben or Hibben Knives in any way .
CLICK HERE to see my comparison and review for the Rambo IV replica knives .
Gil also plans to sell handmade replicas of one of his original prototypes that was rejected by the movie studio for being to " finished " looking .
The " Big John " knife will be available in a limited handmade version .
There is also discussion about maybe offering this knife as a factory produced model based on Gil 's design .
" Big John " based on one of the early prototypes rejected by the movie .
Click HERE for a look at Rambos BOWS Rambo V ?
Rumors abound but it does appear that Stallone has signed a contract for " Rambo V " and is writing a script .
He reportedly said that Rambo V would not be a war movie and he wants to take the saga in a different direction .
There are persistent rumors that the movie would be set in the U.S. ( although not necessarily be filmed here ) .
The ending of " Rambo " certainly left the door open for a continuation of the story with Rambo returning home .
Although it was not a huge hit , " Rambo " grossed over $ 100 million in theaters worldwide and they have n't even gotten into DVD sales yet .
Not too bad for a $ 50 million movie .
$ 50 million + profit would have to get the attention of producers who might want to keep the cash train rolling .

Everyone tells a white lie on occasion , it ’s just a question of why .
Some white lies save relationships , some ease a hectic situation , and others buy us time .
The list could go on forever .
Stretching the truth is a natural component of human instinct because it ’s the easy way out .
We all do it , so there is no reason to deny it .
Honestly , I think the world is probably a better place because of our white lies .
As long as we are n’t hurting others or breaking the law , these innocent lies can make life more pleasant .
They can absorb potential friction between our varying personalities and vacillating moods as we nudge into one another on the quest through our daily routine .
Most of these white lies only stretch an interpretation of what the truth actually is anyways .
Given our rigid optimism to each lead a tailored ideal life , white lies simply cushion us from ourselves .
Here ’s my list of the 15 most common white lies and why we tell them :
It was n’t me !
–
Because some things just are n’t worth taking credit for .
The table will be ready in 5 minutes .
–
Because it sounds a lot better than 15 minutes .
Oh , yeah .
That makes sense .
– Because option B involves admitting that I am clueless .
Thank you so much !
I just love it !
–
Because telling someone that their gift sucked would make me look like an insensitive jerk .
Yeah , you look great in that dress .
–
Because it ’s better than being slapped .
Oh , things would have been different if I was there !
– Because I ’m Superman and I can always make a difference … or at least that ’s how I want others to perceive of me .
No , officer … I have no idea how fast I was going .
– Because claiming ignorance is sometimes better than admitting to insubordination .
I ’m 29 . – Because 29 is like 20 years younger than 30 .
Yeah , I ’ll start working on that ASAP !
–
Because telling you I have 10 things to do first would just irritate you .
Yes , John was with me last night .
–
Because that ’s what friends do … we agree and ask questions later .
My resume is 5 pages long for a good reason .
– Because I ’m darn good at bullshittin’ !
Man , that sucker was 10 feet long !
–
Because anything less would be boring .
Yeah , I was a badass on my high school football team !
–
Because I want to be seen by others in an even stronger light than I see myself .
I ’m 21 , 6 ’5 , with a muscular build .
–
Because you ca n’t see me in this online chat room … ha ha !
I thought I already sent that email out .
I ’m sure I did .
–
Because telling you that it was a low priority and I forgot would probably hurt our relationship .

I ’m overwhelmed at the response to my recent article about Lisp : The Golden Age Isn\’t Coming Back , Let\ ’s Welcome a Bright Future !
It clearly shows my blogging virginity that I ’m excited about 4,000 page views , but that does n’t make me any less excited !
Not only that , there have been lots of good comments , almost 100 total , on this site , programming .reddit.com and Hacker News .
I ’d like to address some of the comments and criticisms in one place , here , rather than all over the place .
First , my mindset and perspective were poorly communicated and set the wrong stage going into the article .
( I hate putting “ WARNING ” tags at the beginning of posts to set the right context , even though they are so useful ! )
A lot of people thought I was just another noob complaining about how hard it was to use Lisp .
I mean , I guess I sort of was , but that was n’t the point .
The point was that Lisp has barriers to becoming a more popular , mainstream language , and every one of them is tractable !
Here are a couple of the points , along with the solutions :
There ’s no default / most prominent implementation – finish SBCL threading work on Windows and OSX
The family of languages thing is confusing to new users – refer to # 1 : making a default implementation removes this stumbling block for beginners without stifling the benefit to experienced users of having a choice of implementation Installing and setting up is hard ( meaning not automatic ) – write streamlined , bulletproof installers !
Write better tutorials , FAQs , and troubleshooting guides , and have active forums where people can get help ( note : these happen automatically with a larger user base )
The learning curve is steep – there are dozens of valuable resources out there that beg to be organized .
Watch this space for an upcoming announcement related to this Nobody believes me when I tell them Lisp is great – tell them in terms that matter to them why it ’s great !
Everyone says this ca n’t be done but I think it can ( check back here for this , too ) Lisp ’s community is weird – no , it ’s just headless .
Viewed from the outside , Paul Graham is the biggest figure in the Lisp world , but he ’s more of a philosopher than an evangelizer .
He ’s also not a teacher ( at least not to the masses – I hear wonderful things about he treats his YCombinator companies ! )
The Lisp community is like the Mongol hordes : talented and powerful , but needing a Genghis Khan .
I did n’t see anything on that list that was n’t fixable .
The technical talent is certainly there to do # 1 and # 3 .
Solving # 1 solves # 2 . # 5 is one canonical resource away .
# 4 ( and possibly # 5 could be fixed by one organized , passionate person , and # 6 could be solved by the same person but would probably be someone else .
I know it seems like an oversimplification to say that 1 - 2 people could launch Lisp into popularity , but imagine where Ruby would be today without DHH ?
Second , several people pointed out that the name Lisp is a barrier to wider adoption .
Because Lisp is old and has a long history ( that included some overhyping and a fall from grace ) , any new attempt to discuss or promote Lisp has to overcome decades of negative perception and introduce decades of improvement .
A critical mass of new , successful uses of Lisp will wipe ( or at least diminish ) that old prejudice .
For instance , Python probably has more legitimacy than any other emerging language because if anyone says “ Python ?
Who the heck uses Python ? ” all you need to say is “ Google and NASA . ”
No further explanation or legitimation necessary .
Paul Graham did it with Viaweb , but that was a decade ago .
I think the company with the biggest chance to do this is ITA Software .
Most people have n’t heard of them but they have used Orbitz , etc , so it is a prominent display of the usefulness of Lisp .
Of course , my favorite explanation of the baggage that the name Lisp carries is at A Nickel ’s Worth :
Last but certainly not least , here is the worst programming language name of all time : Lisp .
OMFG this is a bad name .
Bad bad bad .
What does “ lisp ” mean ?
Lisp means “ speech impediment ” !!
Do you want a speech impediment !?
I do n’t think so !
Back in college I had even less patience for Lisp than I did for Smalltalk .
I mean , when it came down to it , I ’d rather at least be able to make small talk , at a party , without having a lisp .
Hint to John McCarthy : next time you come up with something brilliant , name it after something POSITIVE .
Geez .
And , as with Erlang , it just does n’t get any better when you try to explain why Lisp is called Lisp .
It ’s short for LISt Processing …
Get it ?
Is n’t that funny ?
I do n’t hear you laughing .
Yeah , ‘ cuz it ’s one of the worst puns ever .
And not only is it not funny , guess what , most programmers do n’t actually think they ’re going to do much “ list processing ” , so they ’re like , “ maybe it IS good at List Processing , but I could give a flying monkey ’s posterior because that ’s just not what I want to be working on ” ( these programmers would much rather be working on their ORM layer , ironically ) .
Read the whole post , it ’s worth it !
Third , I said that â€ œI \’m learning Linux , emacs , SBCL , Slime and Common Lisp at the same time ” and that it was a lot to absorb .
Well , I broke my own cardinal rule of “ Compared to what ? ” and I got called out on it .
I did n’t mean that it was harder than learning a different programming stack , it was just a statement that learning a new programming stack is a lot of work .
When I was choosing to embark on a project of learning a new language , I considered Ruby and Python because of the popularity of their web frameworks .
But since I wanted to get comfortable with Linux anyway , and all of these languages use SVN or Darcs or some source control product that is n’t Visual Source Safe , I had to learn one of those too .
So no matter what language I chose , I would have to learn 1 ) the language , 2 ) the libraries , and 3 ) its IDE of choice .
Learning one language vs another is a wash – just read stuff and write programs .
People complain about the difficulty of finding the right library in Lisp , but since identifying a good library is a bigger problem than installing a known one , this is not a big deal .
And emacs has n’t been hard – I made a nice cheat sheet and I use it like a normal IDE ( just like you can write Fortran in any language , you can program like Visual Studio in emacs ) – I ’ll learn the power user stuff later .
Since the total cost is about the same , I chose the one that I thought would be most powerful and have the longest shelf life .
Fourth , one additional comment on community : I ’m sort of the opinion that if you live by the community , you die by the community .
So languages like Ruby where community is one if its biggest strength could be in trouble if the community weakens or moves on .
I think Lisp has the best technical foundation of any language , and that shines through even without ( some would say in spite of ) its community .
Out of all the comments and responses , this was one of the biggest treats :
I ’ve enjoyed reading Dan ’s blog since he started is a couple months ago ( and I ’ve already linked to it repeatedly ) .
He has given me most of my historical perspective on Lisp and he seems to be very fair and impartial in his judgment , even though he was in the thick of many of these things !
He ’s also an excellent writer who quickly moved up my “ Must Read ” list in Google Reader .
Dan – I ’m a little giddy that you commented on my blog .
I ’m still getting used to the social aspect of the internet ( as opposed to just consuming info ) so the fact that someone whose writing and experience I admire very much read my article is flattering !
Thanks again everyone for your comments and I hope to keep producing articles worth reading and talking about !

Visitors to the Rose Bowl who take the scenic route into the stadium ’s adjacent neighborhoods may come upon a leafy enclave of timeless , grand homes .
Anchored by Prospect Boulevard , Pasadena ’s Prospect Historic District counts among its famous addresses Frank Lloyd Wright ’s La Miniatura , Charles and Henry Greene ’s Gamble House and , though lesser known , a 1911 two - story home by architect Sylvanus B. Marston .
Marston is considered a master architect who expanded the humble aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts movement into mansions for wealthy Pasadena residents .
Yet this five - bedroom , four - bathroom house is at once a showplace for entertaining and a cozy family home .
Many imposing early 20th century homes and the private K - 8 Chandler School are in the neighborhood , which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 .
The Rose Bowl and its attractions are within walking distance of the district , which is quiet even though it sits near the 210 and 134 freeways and Old Pasadena .
The grand scale of the homes and the broad , shady streets prove irresistible to film crews , which show up with some frequency .
Set on a broad lawn alongside a canopy of massive trees , the 4,536 - square - foot house retains such period details as built - in oak cabinetry , a tiger oak stairway , multiple pocket doors , fireplaces , leaded - glass windows , inglenooks , window seats and wood - beam ceilings .
Large windows provide garden views and allow light into every room .
A butler ’s pantry , built - in shelves , dressing rooms , maid ’s quarters and generous basement provide ample storage .
The current owners ’ active children play in the finished attic , along the paved and gated driveway and in a carpeted , second - floor playroom .
Various owners have added improvements throughout the years , including an enclosed sun porch , an outdoor kitchen with fireplace , and a formal English garden .
Rose vines drape around a hot tub , dog run and archway , while neatly clipped hedges zigzag up sloping hillsides and delicate ornamental trees shelter outdoor seating areas .

According to FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds , there is a vast black market for nukes , and certain U.S. officials have been supplying sensitive nuclear technology information to Turkish and Israeli interests through its conduits .
It ’s a scathing allegation which was first published by the London Times two weeks ago , and Edmonds ’ charge seems to be on the verge of vindication .
In likely reaction to the London Times report , the Bush Administration quietly announced on January 22 that the president would like Congress to approve the sale of nuclear secrets to Turkey .
As with most stories of this magnitude , the U.S. media has put on blinders , opting to not report either Edmonds ’ story or Bush ’s recent announcement .
The White House Press Release claims that President Clinton signed off on the Turkey deal way back in 2000 :
" However , immediately after signature , U.S. agencies received information that called into question the conclusions that had been drawn in the required NPAS ( Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement ) and the original classified annex , specifically , information implicating Turkish private entities in certain activities directly relating to nuclear proliferation .
Consequently , the Agreement was not submitted to the Congress and the executive branch undertook a review of the NPAS evaluation My Administration has completed the NPAS review as well as an evaluation of actions taken by the Turkish government to address the proliferation activities of certain Turkish entities ( once officials of the U.S. Government brought them to the Turkish government ’s attention ) . "
What " private entities " the press release refers to is not clear , but it could well include the American Turkish Council , the " entity " revealed in the Times article .
The Bushites seem to be covering their own exposed backsides , for the timing of Bush ’s call to sell nuke secrets to Turkey is certainly suspicious , if not overtly conspicuous .
It appears the White House has been spooked by Edmonds and hopes to absolve the U.S. officials allegedly involved in the illegal sale of nuclear technology to private Turkish " entities " .
One of those officials is likely Marc Grossman , the former ambassador to Turkey during the Clinton Administration who also served in the State Department from 2001 - 2005 .
Grossman has been named by Edmonds who claims he was directly involved in the nuclear smuggling ring that she says has allowed the intelligence agencies of Pakistan , Israel and Turkey to operate in the U.S. with impunity .
Totally complicit in the nuke trade , the U.S. government , according to Edmonds , has known of the vast criminal activities of these foreign nations ’ presence in the States , which has included all sorts of illegal activities like drug trafficking , espionage and money laundering .
Edmonds says " several arms of the government were shielding what was going on " which included an entire national security apparatus associated with the neoconservaties who have profited by representing Turkish interests in Washington .
As Justin Raimondo recently reported in Antiwar.com :
" this group includes not only Grossman , but also Paul Wolfowitz , chief intellectual architect of the Iraq war and ex-World Bank president ; former deputy defense secretary for policy Douglas J. Feith ; Feith ’s successor , Eric Edelman ; and Richard Perle , the notorious uber - neocon whose unique ability to mix profiteering and warmongering forced him to resign his official capacity as a key administration adviser Edmonds draws a picture of a three - sided alliance consisting of Turkish , Pakistani , and Israeli agents who coordinated efforts to milk U.S. nuclear secrets and technology , funneling the intelligence stream to the black market nuclear network set up by the Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan .
The multi-millionaire Pakistani nuclear scientist then turned around and sold his nuclear assets to North Korea , Libya , and Iran . "
Is the Bush Administration seeking to exonerate these " officials " with its plea to allow Turkey to obtain U.S. nuclear secrets ?
Besides Grossman , who else was involved in Edmonds ’ grim tale of the nuke - for - profit underground ?
As the news that U.S. officials have allegedly been supplying Turkey with nuclear technology begins to creep in to the mainstream media , the Bush team appears to be moving to legalize the whole shady operation .
If Congress does not block or amend Bush ’s legislation to sell nukes to Turkey within 90 days , it will become law automatically , likely acting retroactively to clear the alleged crimes of Marc Grossman and his neocon , nuke - trading friends .
Sprinting all the day long
Wow .
So the “ official ” Django sprint day is over , though ( in my time zone , at least ) work actually started yesterday and looks like it ’ll keep on going into tomorrow .
Already the amount of activity ( as measured by the Trac timeline ) is simply astounding , and that ’s likely to continue ; there have been about 150 commits so far , and I could n’t even begin to count the number of patches that have been filed and the number of tickets which have been triaged .
I got a bit of a late start today and focused mostly on documentation issues ; I spent the first part of the day working on a patch for ticket # 4234 — documentation for django.contrib.contenttypes — and hopefully that ’ll be ready to commit soon .
I ’ve long been a fan of the contenttypes app , and it ’s always irked me that there ’s no real documentation for some of the neat stuff it can do ( aside from some model examples for generic relations ) .
Aside from that I ’ve put up about a dozen documentation patches , and done what I can to review a bunch more that were already in the tracker .
And I was n’t the only one working on documentation ; there ’s a pretty busy changelog for the docs right now , with a ton of miscellaneous improvements and two entirely new sections :
Documentation for Django ’s “ shortcuts ” module which , while currently containing only two functions , packs quite a punch .
Documentation for the form preview application that ’s been added as part of the development of newforms .
I highly recommend checking this one out , along with django.contrib.formtools which — as of right now — is still waiting to be properly documented .
In the broader world of Django development , the newforms - admin branch is getting a lot of love from several developers , and will , when finished , be a huge leap forward for Django ; not only does it represent the decoupling of the admin application from various other bits of Django , it ’s also driving a huge amount of innovation in the newforms library .
Attempts to fix ticket # 3591 have yielded some fruitful ideas about ways to make the handling of “ applications ” a bit cleaner ( Adrian ’s suggestion of moving to a class for either INSTALLED_APPS or for the entries in it is particularly promising ) , and would clean up some strange things people have had to do to _meta.app_label in the past ( e.g. , manually assign it inside the Meta class in order to split models up across multiple files in a module ) .
Django ’s translators have been busy , too ; the last two days have seen updates to translation files for fifteen of the languages Django officially supports , plus the groundwork for a brand - new translation : Irish .
And , of course , there have been a huge number of smaller fixes and improvements .
My favorite : render_to_response picked up an optional mimetype argument today , so you can now use it to directly return responses of types other than text / html ( instead of manually altering the Content - Type header or instantiating your own HttpResponse ) .
Malcolm has been liveblogging the sprint ( part 1 , part 2 ) , and brings up an interesting statistic : over one hundred and twenty tickets have been closed so far as part of the sprint .
There are still a lot more open , but that ’s a pretty big jump for such a short period and there are a whole lot more tickets waiting for final review and checkin now than there were forty - eight hours ago ; we really ought to do this sort of thing more often .
And while it ’s not technically an improvement to Django itself , it ’s worth noting that Django now has a buildbot ( heavy lifting was done by Matt and design by Christian ) , which is already easing the job of keeping an eye on the various configurations Django supports .
This version of stretching appears in a bestselling book on male sexuality .
It also involves stretching the penis in both its flaccid and erect state .
1. With your right hand , grip the penis and rhythmically pull it forward and away from your body 10 times ( roughly 15 seconds each pull ) .
2.Repeat to the right ( 10 times ) , to the left ( 10 times ) and down ( 10 times ) .
3. Rub the head of your penis with your thumb until you get an erection .
Circle the penis at its base with your thumb and forefinger .
Pull forward an inch ( 10 times ) to force energy into the head .
4. Pull the erect penis to the right and rotate in small circles while pulling outward ( 10 times ) .
Repeat to the left ( 10 times ) .
5.Gently slap your erect penis against inner thigh while pulling out on each side ( 10 times ) .
Milking is an " ancient " technique that has been performed for centuries by many tribes and cultures .
It is considered THE most effective method of penis enlargement .
These milking exercises force blood into the penis .
Over the course of several months , the blood spaces in the penis became larger , which means that they can hold more blood .
This in return makes your penis larger .

なんだか随分ひさしぶりのエントリになります。
かなり出遅れ気味ですが 、Rails 2.0 がリリースされたので AP4R も一部対応させてみました。
まだ trunk にあげているだけですが、以下の点を修正しています 。
■ AP4R 本体の修 正
こちらは一箇所だけです 。
戻り値が Fixnum ではなく ActiveSupport : : Duration のインスタンスになりました。
sleep 時間なんか を 10.seconds とか 1.minute で設定できるようにしてたらひっかかりました。 ( ^^ ;
■ HelloWorld サンプルアプリの修 正
一瞬 、Rails 1.2 系と 2.0 系それぞれ用にサンプルを用意しようかとも思ったのですが、やはりメンテがしんどくなりそうなので、いけるとこまでは同居
( どちらでも動くように ) していくことにしました。
で 、2.0 系でもある程度動くようにしましたが、いまのところ 、 1.2 を「主」としています。
Rails 2.0 から ActionWebService が除外されることになったので、サンプルのなかの
SOAP と XML - RPC の部分が動かないです 。
代わりに ActiveResource が来たわけですが 、Rails 的には REST の道をゆくにしても SOAP を使いたい場合はどうするんでしょう ?
今後ちゃんとメンテされていくのかな??
ちょっとぐぐってみた感じでは、AWS
の行く末はいまひとつ見えませんでした... orz
あと 、Rails 2.0 上でむりくり使おうとすると、おかしな挙動をするみたいです?
# 念のため書いておくと 、AP4R 本体のほうで、非同期連携プロトコルとして SOAP や XML - RPC を使う分には問題ありません 。
# ただ、サンプルをベースにテストもしてたんで、そこらへんが動かなくなるとちょっと考えないといけないなぁと思ってます。ここは宿題。
secret key を定義しておかないと怒られるので、environment.rb に追記。
( 2.0 以上で動かすときだけ、評価されるようにしています)
config.breakpoint_server = true
Rails 起動時に warning のようなメッセージがでてきます 。
*******************************************************************
* config.breakpoint_server has been deprecated and has no effect .
* *******************************************************************
ぐぐってみると、config/environment/development.rb を修正せよとのことでした。でも、害はないようなので、Rails 1.2 系が主ということでとりあえずほっておきます。 ( ^^ ;
暫定的ですが、 Rails 2.0 対応、ざっとこんなとこでした。
Immigration strategies taking shape
In separate rooms on overlapping morning hours at the National Press Club this week , two very different groups were launching the next rounds in the simmering immigration fight .
In the Zenger Room , named for German immigrant John Peter Zenger , who helped establish free speech law , Californians for Population Stabilization released a study claiming there are 20 million to 38 million illegal immigrants in America , not the 12 million the federal government says .
" Immigration is in a state of anarchy , " organization member James Walsh , a former Immigration and Naturalization Service lawyer , fervently told the room .
" Not chaos , anarchy . "
Two doors down in the Murrow Room , named for American broadcaster Edward R. Murrow , the Spanish - language network Telemundo debuted a series of upbeat public service announcements urging their audience to register and vote .
News anchor Jose Diaz - Balart said Telemundo wants to leverage the passion from last year 's immigration rallies into a stronger turnout among Latinos , who historically vote at disproportionately low rates .
" Hispanics in the U.S. will now have a way to channel all that frustration and do some good , " Diaz - Balart said .
Whether the two groups were aware of each other , neither side let on .
But each represents emerging new strategies stirring out of the void left by the failure of immigration reform .
The population group from California believes its more alarming population figures , which are not credited or supported by other independent research , will result in tougher policies on immigration .
Result of mistrust
Diana Hull , a behavioral scientist and former Houstonian who is president of Californians for Population Stabilization , said the federal government 's alleged undercount of illegal immigrants is partly the result of mistrust .
" We have a very large group of people who do n't have the same feeling about responding to legitimate questions from their government , " Hull said .
For example , she said , large numbers of illegal immigrants living in a single house may not tell a census - taker how many people are really living there .
" The fact of the matter is they do n't answer the question , " she said .
The population figure presented by the group was tabulated by Fred Elbel , a computer specialist and anti-immigration activist from Colorado .
The Social Contract Press , which published his report , also publishes racist works , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Around the corner at the Telemundo event , cheery VJ " Crash " had her own statistic that would no doubt alarm the population stabilization group in the Zenger room .
She said 50,000 Hispanics turn 18 in this country every month , and not enough are registering to vote .
" I am super - excited for this upcoming election , and I really feel like this time we are going to make a difference , " Crash said .
Added Alfredo Richard , senior vice president of communications and talent development for the network , " It 's not enough to grow in numbers , but to gain in political strength . "

On September 18th , I asked my fellow photographers to join me in an artistic experiment .
I wanted to see how a single photo could be interpreted by different people , and to do this I presented the test - subjects audience with an unprocessed photograph and asked them to “ Edit My Photo “ .
I knew that each participant would produce a different photo via post - processing , but how different was unknown .
I must say that I ’m shocked and amazed at the diversity and creativity of these results .
The photographs on this page clearly show the boundless possibilities of artistic interpretation , and it all spawned from a single image .
Want more great projects , amazing photos , Photoshop tips , and articles on photography ?
Subscribe to Epic Edits today ( free ! ) so you do n’t miss a thing .
Read below the images for more discussion of results AND for part 2 of this experiment — everybody ’s invited .
Before going any further , I ’d like to sincerely thank all of the people who participated in this project so willingly and enthusiastically .
Seriously gang , this would n’t have happened without each and every one of you .
Every photo on this page is an integral part of this project .
And a huge thanks again to my Grandfather , Ron McCoy , who gave me this great idea for a project .
Now … on with the discussion .
WHY DID I CHOOSE THIS IMAGE ?
You may be asking yourself “ Why the heck did this guy pick such a cruddy photo to run the project with ? ”
Well , the image was completely intentional on my part .
I literally have hundreds of unprocessed images in the “ To - Do ” pile , but this one presented unique opportunities for the project .
Technical Flaws
The horizon is crooked , there are dust spots , it ’s not perfectly exposed , and there are probably other things wrong with it too .
I was curious to see how people would either “ fix ” these flaws , overlook them , or incorporate them into their final image .

Lack of Color
The image contains color — it ’s just not as vibrant as most of us would like to start with .
I wanted to see how people would deal with this , and how color affects the mood of the image .

Foreign Objects
There ’s a string of buoys in the water , and I was interested in how people would deal with something that seemed out of place .

Simple Subject
The composition is so simple in this image that it opens itself up for a number of interpretations .
The overall mood of the processed photo would be highly dependent on the participants .
So basically , I picked the image because it would present the project participants with many processing options .
I also wanted to convey ( with these results ) that typically overlooked images may actually have some life in them — you just have to be creative and open your mind to “ out of the box ” options .
WHY ARE THE RESULTS SO AMAZING ?
The photos above represent vastly different artistic styles , each of which is as unique as their creators .
The combined effort is much greater than any one person would spend on a single photo , and the results are far more creative and diverse than any one person could achieve .
Some of the participants are photographers who I ’ve been following for some time now , and I can certainly see their artistic style showing through even though they did n’t take the photo .
This experiment further affirms my own beliefs that photography is 50 % capture , 50 % processing .
You may not hold the same views ( I already know I ’m going to hear about this comment from the “ purists ” ) , but you ca n’t completely dismiss the power of post - processing .
When it comes to the artistic side of photography , Photoshop and other similar software is a vital tool of expression .
The main reason I think these results are so amazing is because I gave no instructions or boundaries as to what to do with the original image , other than “ process the photo until you ’re satisfied ” .
What I got back was a huge range of technique and style .
Amazing .
WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS ?
I ’ve learned a lot watching this project take it ’s course , and I ’m sure that the participants learned a few things too .
But I think there are many key things that all of us can take away from this .
There ’s More Than One Way to Process a Photo
In fact , there may be an infinite number of ways , you just have to seek them out and have the creative drive to try different Photoshop techniques .

Artistic Style Counts
Your own style can show through with post - processing just as much as it can in taking the photo .

It ’s Not the Software , It ’s the Artist
A ton of different software packages were used in these creations .
Find something that works for you and develop your techniques .

Give Your Photos a Second Chance
Just because a photo initially looks unusable , does n’t mean it ’s not worth pursuing .
A larger processing skillset will give you more options and allow you to use more of your images .

Art is Subjective , Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder
Everybody has a different taste for art and photography .
Do n’t be so quick to judge the work of others as “ bad ” just because it ’s different than you would have done it .
Instead , study their work and try to understand what the artist has conveyed .
Being less critical and judgmental will allow you to enjoy a much wider spectrum of art .
So study the photos presented here , explore the techniques that were used , ask yourself why you ’re drawn to certain images , and see if you can find an understanding of why the artist arrived where they did .
There ’s a lot more to learn than I ’ve listed here , but you ’ll have to find it yourself .
PARTICIPATE IN PART 2 OF THIS EXPERIMENT
Watching one image transform into multiple works of art has been absolutely amazing , but I ’d like to take things a step further .
What is it that makes certain works of art more appealing than others ?
Are there any patterns or consistencies to the more “ popular ” photos ?
To give us some insight to these questions , I need everybody ’s help again .
I want you to list your top 3 favorites from the images above .
You can vote for up to 3 , but no more — the results will be more interesting if you list 3 , but you can also list 1 or 2 .
Each image is numbered from left to right , top to bottom .
If you hover your mouse over an image , you should see the little text - tip pop up that shows the number and the artist ’s name .
Vote by leaving a comment on this page with the numbers for your selections , and feel free to tell us what made you vote for them .
I know there are a lot of them , but seriously try to view all of them at their higher resolution by following their links — there are a lot of subtleties that ca n’t be seen in the thumbnails .
I tried to set this up with my usual poll plugin , but it did n’t like the images very well .
Besides , I think voting in the comments will work out better because we can vote for more than just one .
So cast your votes now — I ’ll tally up the results and discuss my findings next Tuesday ( 10-23-07 ) .
Oh yeah , the most voted for artist will receive $ 50 in cash or giftcards ( I ’ll let the winner decide ) .

Why do n’t Haskell Developers Use Windows ?
Reading a recent thread on haskell - cafe , it was mentioned that there are n’t a lot of Windows Haskell programmers .
That ’s true , but I think it ’s misleading to say it that way .
This is one of those situations where correlation does mean causation .
Here ’s my story .
I write Haskell using Windows … sort of .
Okay , not really .
What I do is use a Windows laptop to open a PuTTY window , in which I write Haskell code on a UNIX system that ’s sitting on the other side of the room .
This is certainly not my ideal working environment .
I ’d love to really write Haskell on Windows , but I do n’t for several reasons .
I do n’t write Haskell with Windows because I have n’t found a good environment for it .
I like my IDE programs , and especially Eclipse – which I already use for Java , C , and C++ programming ; but that does n’t look feasible .
The closest I could seem to come was eclipsefp , but it ’s nearly unusable .
It gets syntax highlighting completely wrong .
( It ’s easy to get hard cases wrong in Haskell ; writing a really correct syntax highlighter is hard ; but this one even gets obvious things wrong like forgetting to highlight deriving , and requiring the occasional frivolous edit to poke it into changing syntax highlighting when something changes . )
I tried to fix some things , but the Haskell code is in a darcs repository , and the only darcs plugin for Eclipse never seemed to work .
Writing Eclipse plugins in any environment except Eclipse is hideously painful ; so enough of that .
Even if I did get it to work , the Eclipse support for Haskell does n’t seem to advanced ; may as well use a command line .
I do n’t write Haskell with Windows because of Lambdabot .
Lambdabot and GOA ( GHCi On Acid ) are important tools for me .
They are far more important than the platform I develop on .
But it looks rather non-trivial to build them for Windows .
I tried to do so for several hours , before I gave up .
I do n’t write Haskell with Windows because I build development versions of GHC a lot .
( I do this to at least help with testing , and partly because I have aspirations to contribute to GHC myself in the future . )
While most of the breaking of GHC seems to happen on MacOS , I notice a lot of patches floating around to fix broken builds of GHC for Windows as well .
One rarely sees a developer commit something that breaks the build for Linux , because that ’s what the developers use .
There are probably more people out there in the same situation .
There seems to be a catch - 22 here .
It ’s not that Haskell does n’t attract Windows .
Haskell attracts people , who subsequently realize that developing on Windows is harder than developing on Linux .
Since Haskell does not attract the sort of people who are slaves to their platform , that means there are fewer people developing Haskell with Windows .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City Comptroller William Thompson on Friday expanded a class- action law suit filed against Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N , naming additional company officers and directors , 26 underwriters and two accounting firms .
Thompson , in a statement , said executives of Countrywide Financial , one the biggest U.S. mortgage lenders , “ cashed out to the tune of almost $ 700 million ” while borrowers lost homes and the value of investors ’ shares fell sharply .
“ We will pursue every avenue to ensure that those who defrauded investors are held accountable for their actions , ” said Thompson , who helps run the city ’s pensions .
Politico editor :
It looks like someone helped Rudy ' cover his tracks ' during affair Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday November 29 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This During Wednesday evening 's Republican debate , GOP presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani flatly denied a new report that as mayor of New York he had obscured security expenses during the beginning of an extra-marital affair -- but his explanation leaves a lot to be desired , according to the editor - in - chief of the publication that broke the story .
Appearing on the CBS Early Show , Politico's John Harris was asked if Giuliani 's answer about the potential scandal was " enough to make it go away . "
" Well , for people who are interested in the details of the story that Ben Smith broke on Politico yesterday , no it 's not , " he said .
" Because the question was n't whether he had security ... the question is why was he hiding security expenses for his relationship , at that time still an extra-marital affair with Judith Nathan , why was he hiding them in obscure city agencies ? "
First reported on on Wednesday , the original Politico story cites documents acquired through a New York Freedom of Information Law proving Giuliani " billed obscure city agencies for tens of thousands of dollars in security expenses . "
The story also asserts that " mayoral costs had nothing to do with the functions of the little - known city offices that defrayed [ Giuliani's ] tabs , including agencies responsible for regulating loft apartments , aiding the disabled and providing lawyers for indigent defendants . "
In Wednesday evening 's debate , Giuliani called the story " not true " only hours after it was first published on Politico 's website .
" I had 24 - hour security for the eight years that I was mayor .
They followed me everyplace I went , " he added .
" It was because there were , you know , threats , threats that I do n't generally talk about .
Some have become public recently ; most of them have n't ... "
Last month , the New York Post reported that New York mafia leaders had been close to " sanctioning a hit " on Giuliani in the 1980's , when he was working as a federal prosecutor targeting the mob .
Many mafia experts , however , doubt that a serious threat against the mayor 's life ever existed .
But Harris said that it appeared the bills were designed to help obfuscate the mayor 's activities .
" Look , he 's responsible as the Mayor of New York , " said the editor .
" Somebody was clearly trying to help him cover his tracks is the way it looks . "
Harris also said suggested it would remind voters of the former mayor 's rocky relationship history .
" It 's obviously , I 'd say , a reminder that Giuliani 's personal life , let 's face it , is not The Brady Bunch , " he said .
" But people know that .
He does n't want that reminder ... he's got to compete well in Iowa and New Hampshire , where he's not in the lead and then try to get the race nationally , where he is in the lead . "

A mouse in a file photo .
Japanese researchers have implanted a small camera inside a mouse 's brain to see how memory is formed , in an experiment they hope to some day apply to humans to treat illnesses such as Parkinson 's disease .
REUTERS / File
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japanese researchers have implanted a small camera inside a mouse ’s brain to see how memory is formed , in an experiment they hope to some day apply to humans to treat illnesses such as Parkinson ’s disease .
The study , published in the “ Journal of Neuroscience Methods ” and “ Sensors and Actuators ” , used a camera 3 mm ( 0.1 inch ) long , 2.3 mm wide and 2.4 mm in depth , said Jun Ohta , professor at Nara Institute of Science and Technology in western Japan .
Working with researchers at Kinki University , Ohta implanted the special semiconductor camera inside the hippocampus of the mouse ’s brain , designing the devise so that a screen showed blue light whenever the camera captured memory being recorded by the brain .
The researchers injected the mouse with a substance that lights up whenever there is brain activity .
The camera then captures that light and the visuals come up on a screen .
The team now plans to use the camera while the mouse is walking .
“ We are thinking about how to apply this to humans , though we must be very careful , as it involves implanting something into the brain , ” Ohta told Reuters .
“ It would take 10 years at the earliest . ”
The researchers hope the study will lead to new ways to treat Parkinson ’s disease , as they aim to have the camera track brain activity that trigger symptoms such as tremors .
The Middle East peace process is finished .
It did not die : it was killed .
Mahmoud Abbas was undermined by the President of the Palestinian Authority and humiliated by the Prime Minister of Israel .
His successor awaits a similar fate .
Israel continues to mock its American patron , building illegal settlements in cynical disregard of the “ road map . ”
The President of the United States of America has been reduced to a ventriloquist ’s dummy , pitifully reciting the Israeli cabinet line : “ It ’s all Arafat ’s fault . ”
Israelis themselves grimly await the next bomber .
Palestinian Arabs , corralled into shrinking Bantustans , subsist on EU handouts .
On the corpse - strewn landscape of the Fertile Crescent , Ariel Sharon , Yasser Arafat , and a handful of terrorists can all claim victory , and they do .
Have we reached the end of the road ?
What is to be done ?
At the dawn of the twentieth century , in the twilight of the continental empires , Europe ’s subject peoples dreamed of forming “ nation - states , ” territorial homelands where Poles , Czechs , Serbs , Armenians , and others might live free , masters of their own fate .
When the Habsburg and Romanov empires collapsed after World War I , their leaders seized the opportunity .
A flurry of new states emerged ; and the first thing they did was set about privileging their national , “ ethnic ” majority — defined by language , or religion , or antiquity , or all three — at the expense of inconvenient local minorities , who were consigned to second - class status : permanently resident strangers in their own home .
But one nationalist movement , Zionism , was frustrated in its ambitions .
The dream of an appropriately sited Jewish national home in the middle of the defunct Turkish Empire had to wait upon the retreat of imperial Britain : a process that took three more decades and a second world war .
And thus it was only in 1948 that a Jewish nation - state was established in formerly Ottoman Palestine .
But the founders of the Jewish state had been influenced by the same concepts and categories as their fin- de - siècle contemporaries back in Warsaw , or Odessa , or Bucharest ; not surprisingly , Israel ’s ethno- religious self - definition , and its discrimination against internal “ foreigners , ” has always had more in common with , say , the practices of post - Habsburg Romania than either party might care to acknowledge .
The problem with Israel , in short , is not — as is sometimes suggested — that it is a European “ enclave ” in the Arab world ; but rather that it arrived too late .
It has imported a characteristically late - nineteenth - century separatist project into a world that has moved on , a world of individual rights , open frontiers , and international law .
The very idea of a “ Jewish state ” — a state in which Jews and the Jewish religion have exclusive privileges from which non-Jewish citizens are forever excluded — is rooted in another time and place .
Israel , in short , is an anachronism .
In one vital attribute , however , Israel is quite different from previous insecure , defensive microstates born of imperial collapse : it is a democracy .
Hence its present dilemma .
Thanks to its occupation of the lands conquered in 1967 , Israel today faces three unattractive choices .
It can dismantle the Jewish settlements in the …
Grudgingly , Japan is starting to respect its neighbors .
“ Until now , Japanese saw China and India as backwards and poor , ” said Yoshinori Murai , a professor of Asian cultures at Sophia University in Tokyo .
“ As Japan loses confidence in itself , its attitudes toward Asia are changing .
It has started seeing India and China as nations with something to offer . ”
Last month , a national cry of alarm greeted the announcement by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that in a survey of math skills , Japan had fallen from first place in 2000 to 10th place , behind Taiwan , Hong Kong and South Korea .
From second in science in 2000 , Japan dropped to sixth place .
While China has stirred more concern here as a political and economic challenger , India has emerged as the country to beat in a more benign rivalry over education .
In part , this reflects China ’s image in Japan as a cheap manufacturer and technological imitator .
But India ’s success in software development , Internet businesses and knowledge - intensive industries in which Japan has failed to make inroads has set off more than a tinge of envy .
Most annoying for many Japanese is that the aspects of Indian education they now praise are similar to those that once made Japan famous for its work ethic and discipline : learning more at an earlier age , an emphasis on memorization and cramming , and a focus on the basics , particularly in math and science .
India ’s more demanding education standards are apparent at the Little Angels Kindergarten , and are its main selling point .
Its 2 - year - old pupils are taught to count to 20 , 3 - year - olds are introduced to computers , and 5 - year - olds learn to multiply , solve math word problems and write one - page essays in English , tasks most Japanese schools do not teach until at least second grade .
Indeed , Japan ’s anxieties about its declining competitiveness echo the angst of another nation two decades ago , when Japan was the economic upstart .
“ Japan ’s interest in learning from Indian education is a lot like America ’s interest in learning from Japanese education , ” said Kaoru Okamoto , a professor specializing in education policy at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo .

So , your Wii sensor bar has slid down the back of your TV for the umpteenth time and you just are n't up for diving into the rats nest of cables this time , maybe this time you should just leave it there .
You can pick up this Wireless Sensor Bar for a mere $ 4 , a quarter of what you 'll pay for most competing products .
Of course , they 're using the term " wireless " liberally here , and the bit about being " detected automatically by your Wii console " is pure rubbish -- all it takes is a pair of IR emitters , or even a couple candles to make a sensor bar replacement -- but we 'll let it slide for this kind of price .

If you publish your photos online , you ’re understandably giving up some amount of control over those photos .
Everyone and their uncle can copy and modify the photos , and while you have some amount of copyright protection , that protection is limited .
But some online photo companies are moving beyond that and are claiming rights to your copyrighted photos in their terms of service even if you never publish the photos online .
Photobucket does it ( section 3 of their TOS ) , but so does another company : Google .
Specifically , if you read down the Picasa Web Albums TOS to section 4 , “ Proprietary Rights , ” you ’ll find this lovely gem :
You or a third party licensor , as appropriate , retain all patent , trademark and copyright to any Content you submit , post or display on or through Picasa Web Albums and you are responsible for protecting those rights , as appropriate .
By submitting , posting or displaying Content on or through Picasa Web Albums , you grant Google a worldwide , non-exclusive , royalty - free license to reproduce , adapt , distribute and publish such Content through Picasa Web Albums , including RSS or other content feeds offered through Picasa Web Albums , and other Google services .
In addition , by submitting , posting or displaying Content which is intended to be available to the general public , you grant Google a worldwide , non-exclusive , royalty - free license to reproduce , adapt , distribute and publish such Content for the purpose of displaying , distributing and promoting Google services .
Google will discontinue this licensed use within a commercially reasonable period after such Content is removed from Picasa Web Albums .
In other words , in case these are n’t clear enough , you retain patent , trademark , and copyright and are responsible for protecting those rights , but Google has the right to use your patented , trademarked , and / or copyrighted work free of charge if you simply use Picasa Web Albums for storage and tagging of your photos , regardless of whether or not you choose to publicly display the submitted photos .
And if you look through the Google TOS , the other TOS that you agree to abide by in order to use Picasa ( the very first paragraph of the Picasa TOS says so ) , you ’ll read similar language .
By submitting , posting or displaying the content you give Google a perpetual , irrevocable , worldwide , royalty - free , and non-exclusive licence to reproduce , adapt , modify , translate , publish , publicly perform , publicly display and distribute any Content which you submit , post or display on or through , the Services .
Note , however , that the regular Google TOS is worse than just the Picasa TOS – here the right to use your content is perpetual and irrevocable , meaning that Google can use your stuff forever even if you ask them to stop .
Given that the main Google TOS and the Picasa Web Album TOS contradict each other , which is legally binding , the one that says Google can use your copyrighted / patented / trademarked content forever and there ’s nothing you can do about it , or the one that says Google will stop using that content “ within a commercially reasonable period after such Content is removed ” ?
I imagine that a lawyer acting on a complaint against Google could have a field day with Google in court over this one .
Of course , considering that we ’ve got a five page ( printed ) Picasa Web Albums TOS and an eight page Google TOS , we ’re not done yet .
Not by a long shot .
Section 2 of the Picasa TOS says “ You agree that you are responsible for …any Content that you create , transmit , or display while using Picasa Web Albums and for any consequences thereof . ”
But wait a minute – Google claims no ownership of your pictures and you retain the responsibility of anything that happens as a result of your photos , but Google still has the right to duplicate or modify your photos in order to make money off the free services you ’re getting from Picasa .
But does n’t this mean that you could potentially be held liable for any complaints made against Google by a third party because Google used your photos ?
And maybe it ’s a bit extreme , but the logical extension of this kind of responsibility could end up with Google legally having the right to charge you for the costs
Google incurred by their use of your copyrighted photos in a failed marketing campaign .
And the Google TOS has this provision too ( section 8.5 ) , but with an added kicker : “ … you are solely responsible for any Content that you create , transmit , or display while using the Services and for the consequences of your actions ( including any loss or damage which Google may suffer ) by doing so .
( emphasis mine ) ” That sure sounds like you could be held responsible by Google for their court losses if they get sued , and could be held responsible for any loss of profit due to failed marketing that used your photos .
Lovely .
Nearly every online service has a provision that lets the supplier cancel your service without notice , and the Picasa Web Albums TOS is no exception .
Section 9 says :
You agree that Google may at any time and for any reason , including a period of account inactivity , terminate your access to Picasa Web Albums , terminate the Terms of Service , or suspend or terminate your account .
Ok , fair enough , and hardly a surprise .
But when you add to it the next sentence , we have a problem .
In the event of termination , your account will be disabled and you may not be granted access to Picasa Web Albums , your account or any files or other content contained in your account .
So , Google can terminate a Picasa account for any reason at any time without notice and prevent you from accessing your photos long enough to extract them from Picasa .
Excuse me ?!
If you ’re using Picasa as your only storage point for your photos , you ’re utterly screwed if Google holds to the extreme authority they ’re claiming – you could literally lose every photo you ’ve ever taken if you put them all up on Picasa .
( Of course , if you do n’t make local backups , you probably deserve what you get , but that ’s a different issue . )
Not only that , but Section 6 of the Picasa TOS says “ … Google has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store or make available any Content and other communications maintained or transmitted by Picasa Web Albums . ”
So if a photo you put up happens to be accidentally or intentionally deleted , oops , you ’re SOL .
You ’re also SOL if your copyrighted , trademarked , or patented
content is stolen or is irretrievably corrupted due to software errors , or if downloading Picasa Web Albums to your computer destroys your entire photo catalog , something that Google specifically says in TOS section 13 , Disclaimer or Warranties .
Thankfully , some of the terms of the TOS may not be lawfully excluded or included depending on what state or country you live in , but how many of us really understand what the web commerce laws and copyright / trademark laws are in our state ?
And given the state of flux that Web - targeted laws are in right now , can we really say that this is any real protection if a billion dollar patented design is stolen off a home PC because Picasa opened up a security hole in our personal firewall ten miles wide ?
Most of this discussion has been about Picasa Web Albums , but it ’s actually bigger than just that one service .
I ’ve been emphasizing the word “ content ” previously because the Google TOS ’s terms apply to any content you use on Google , not just to Picasa Web Album photos and images .
Google can potentially use your emails in GMail , your photos and patented drawings for a better mousetrap in Picasa , your Google Groups communications and archives , the copyrighted novel you ’re writing in Google Docs , etc. for marketing purposes , and you could potentially be liable for Google ’s own screw ups .
Not only that , but section 11.2 of the Google TOS says that Google can give away your content to Google - associated companies so that those companies can use your copyrighted content free - of - charge too :
You agree that this license includes a right for Google to make such Content available to other companies , organizations or individuals with whom Google has relationships for the provision of syndicated services , and to use such Content in connection with the provision of those services .
I ’m not a lawyer , so I do n’t claim to know how the laws on “ general ” TOSs interact with the laws on “ service specific ” TOSs .
I do n’t know Internet law well enough to know if my worst - case scenarios above are utter smoke or are realistic .
I ’d like to believe that all these TOSs are just there to cover Google ’s corporate ass from litigation - drunk lawyers and morally bankrupt thieves like SCO .
I want to believe that “ Do n’t be evil ” is enough to protect me , and my copyrighted , trademarked , or patented intellectual property from abuse by Google or by their commercial partners .
But with terms like these , I just can’t .
I ’m a user of Google Docs for writing harmless documents that I share with family and friends .
I love Google News and Google Maps .
But I do n’t use Gmail because I want my email to be private , and I ’m careful what I use Google Docs for – no short stories that I might someday make money from .
And I will not ever use Picasa Web Albums .
Nor , for that matter , will I ever use Photobucket .
I ’m unwilling to give up control over my photos , or my children ’s photos , so they can be used by some unscrupulous marketing exec even if I never publish them .
And when you realize that Google ’s TOS ( section 2.2.B ) says that you accept the terms of the TOS if you use their services even if you clicked “ no ” and refused to accept the TOS , “ do n’t be evil ” sounds remarkably hollow .
Sometimes caution is absolutely warranted .
( Thanks to my wife , Jennifer , for putting me onto the Picasa Web Albums and Photobucket TOSs .
If anyone is looking for a photo album / cataloging program that is inexpensive and enables you to “ tag ” your photos for easy sorting and searching , we ’re quite happy with Corel Photo Album thus far . )

Maybe it was just too long a night ; maybe she did n't want to punch another photographer .
Whatever the reason - and there can be no easy explanation - Lily Allen left a London nightclub early today carried by her friends in a large plastic bag .
The 22 - year - old pop star was dragged 50 yards down Oxford Street in a Habitat shopping bag , then bundled into a car which sped off into the night .
Scroll down for more ...
The singer had spent the night at Soho nightclub Punk with about 10 friends .
Despite being advised to rest after suffering from sinusitis and strep throat , forcing her to pull out of several European dates .
Allen cancelled a handful of festival appearances due to her ' illness ' she even posted her doctor 's note online to prove it .
The group left the club , walked about 50 yards to a building under renovation and re-emerged with Lily in the bag , thwarting waiting paparazzi .
Those on Lily - in - a- Bag lifting duty included her best friend - and surely only a best friend would schlep a full - grown adult down Oxford Street in a bag - Miquita Oliver , a 23 - year - old television presenter .
Scroll down for more ...
Confined to such a small space , Lily was unable to show off her trademark kung fu kick , usually reserved for photographers .
Nor was she able to throw a punch or two , a wise move given the last time she did so back in March she ended up with a police caution .
This has caused a setback for Lily , daughter of actor Keith Allen , in her attempt to conquer the US music scene .
When she arrived in Los Angeles from Australia on 8 August , US authorities revoked her visa because of the punch - up .
A series of West Coast concerts may have to be cancelled and she has been dropped from the MTV Music Awards in Las Vegas .
All of which is enough to make a rising pop star want to close her eyes and curl up inside a plastic bag .
Note from reader MR : the Puma ad is from poland , dated around 2004 - 2006 so its not vintage .
nice to see it here tho .
Want to tell your strange story ?
Tell us about it and it could be featured on Oddee .

When Republicans are called chickenhawks , they howl .
They cry about how the term is ad hominem .
They lash out and point to other Republicans who have served in wars .
They do everything but actually join the military .
Now , prior to the days when Republicans had yet to break the U.S. military , chickenhawks had a valid argument against the fairness of the term .
But now — not so much .
Glenn Greenwald summed it up nicely earlier this year :
It is true that where there is an amply stocked volunteer military , it is natural and inevitable that many citizens will support a war in ways other than by enlisting .
No additional troops were needed , for instance , at the time of the invasion of Afghanistan ( or during the action in Kosovo ) , and there was thus no tension between supporting those wars and not fighting .
But the current situation is completely different .
Even according to the war 's remaining advocates -- particularly those who want to escalate in Iraq -- there is a serious and harmful shortage of willing volunteers to fight in Iraq and to enable a more aggressive application of U.S. military force generally .
So we do now have a situation where those who are cheering on more war and escalation really are needed not at the computer screen but on the battlefield , in combat .
And their refusal to fight is actually impeding the plans of those on whom the President is relying for " Victory . "
As a result , it is now morally indefensible for those who are physically able to do so to advocate a " surge , " or even ongoing war in Iraq , without either volunteering to fight or offering a good reason why they are not doing so .
Fortunately for most contemporary chickenhawks , they ’re too old to enlist , and thus marginally excusable .
But not all of them are .
Indeed , there is a very vocal minority of Republican chickenhawks , still young enough to enlist in the military , but still unwilling to physically support their beloved war .
Ironically , four of the five listed below are only still eligible because the Army had to raise its enlistment age from 35 to 42 — because it could n’t find enough qualified recruits to send to Iraq .
While raising the age limit twice within five months ( first to 40 , then to 42 ) , the Army was also forced to lower physical standards at the same time .
These facts alone should be reason enough for the most ardent supporters of the war to sign up .
Obviously the military needs people that know so much about war .
I present them to you now :
1. Michelle Malkin , age 36
Time left to enlist : 5 years , 4 months , 16 days
Michelle is a prime candidate for the military .
She knows more about terrorism and war than anybody .
Just ask her .
She even has first hand experience , having spent a whole week in Iraq earlier this year trying to gain some type of moral authority over her legions of detractors .
But what makes Michelle ideal for the military , is the fact that she not only has a fervent hatred of terrorists , but that she also finds foreigners inherently distasteful .
And what better place to fight terrorists and foreigners than in foreign countries with lots of terrorism ?
I mean , fight them there , so we do n’t have to fight them here , right ?
With her degree , they may even let Michelle become an officer .
2. Matt Drudge , age 40
Time left to enlist : 1 year , 4 months , 23 days
If Matt Drudge is going to enlist , he better do it soon .
We ’re talking less than a year and a half here for this protector of The American Way and Tabloid - Style News .
Matt thinks the war in Iraq is awesome — and he slanders lies about those who do n’t .
He owes it to himself to pull at least one tour in the urban jungles of Iraq .
3. Patrick McHenry , age 31
Time left to enlist : 10 years , 4 months , 18 days
Patrick McHenry is perhaps the smarmiest , smuggest member of the U.S. House of Representatives .
On February 7 , 2007 , as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , McHenry vehemently defended Blackwater USA — whose home state of North Carolina he represents .
Patrick is primarily suited for the military because of his youthfulness and his penchant for vomiting up stupid Republican talking points :
They 're advocating a policy called cut and run .
They 're advocating a policy of waving the white flag to our enemies .
It is a policy , Mr. Speaker , make no mistake about it , that the left in this country are advocating .
But we are fighting a war .
We are fighting a war against Islamic extremists that hate the very fiber of our being as Americans .
We ?
We who ?
And would that be the Sunnis or the Shia ?
It is very rare , even in this day and age , to find someone so young , so passionate about defending this nation , and so willing to lead the nation on the path to war , who has no desire to fight it himself .
4. Dan Bartlett , age 36
Time left to enlist : 5 years , 11 months , 3 days
George W. Bush ’s longest serving aide , Dan Bartlett , announced last week that he was resigning his position with the White House to enlist accept a commission " pursue new career options " in the private sector .
Dan has come to be known as a hardcore apologist for Bush ’s stubbornness concerning reality .
While the White House is certain to miss him , the military could really use him — especially the Army Reserves , which is already 1,300 soldiers short of its mid-year goal this year .
5. Jonah Goldberg , age 38
Time left to enlist : 3 years , 9 months , 17 days
This guy is great .
I could n’t make this stuff up if I tried .
When asked by one of Juan Cole ’s readers why Goldberg ( a rabid Iraq war proponent ) did n’t have his ass " in the kill zone , " Goldberg responded in a manner typical of many pseudo - erudite , arrogant chickenhawks :
As for why my sorry ass is n't in the kill zone , lots of people think this is a searingly pertinent question .
No answer I could give -- I 'm 35 years old , my family could n't afford the lost income , I have a baby daughter , my ass is , er , sorry , are a few -- ever seem to suffice .
Right .
Because those are certainly disqualifying criteria for military service .
Jonah is also the genius who lost the bet to Juan Cole over how Iraq would turn out .
On February 8 , 2005 , Goldberg said :
Anyway , I do think my judgment is superior to his when it comes to the big picture .
So , I have an idea :
Since he does n't want to debate anything except his own brilliance , let 's make a bet .
I predict that Iraq wo n't have a civil war , that it will have a viable constitution , and that a majority of Iraqis and Americans will , in two years time , agree that the war was worth it .
I 'll bet $ 1,000 ( which I can hardly spare right now ) .
Wow .
Who would pay this man for his opinion on Iraq ?
Wait . . . do n’t answer that .
And by the way , does anyone know how old Frederick Kagan is ?
UPDATE : I just received an email from a Vietnam veteran and U.S. government employee who tells me that Frederick Kagan 's birthday is March 26 , 1970 , making him 37 years old -- and officially making him a young chickenhawk .
Netflix will be making a big announcement tomorrow , coincidentally one day before Apple will be making some [ similar ] big announcements of its own :
Starting Monday , January 14 , 2008 , Netflix subscribers will have unlimited access to movie viewing online .
The company plans to do away with its quota / hours system it had in place before ( viewing hours per month were based upon how much you paid for you mail - in DVD plan ) .
The only group of Netflix subscribers to be left out of this unlimited plan : you who pay the minimum of $ 4.99 to rent just two DVDs per month .
Right now the Netflix online catalog consists of approximately 6,000 titles , which is still only a fraction of the 90,000 titles in the company ’s DVD collection .
But the number of movies available for online viewing is still on the rise and has doubled since the online service went live a year ago .
And it ’s still a bigger library than most other video - on - demand services available .
This news has even bigger potential when combined with the previous Netflix announcement of Netflix and LG marketing an LG - branded device ( like a cable box ) that will allow you to watch movies on your TV via Netflix streaming .
The LG partnership is to be the “ first of many ” Netflix hopes to announce this year with makers of hardware devices , including videogame consoles .
Netflix ’s news of unlimited movie watching comes just one day before Apple ’s expected release of an iTunes movie rental service .
The main advantage Apple will have is that its digital content will be viewable on iPods and iPhones along with computers .
But so far , most consumers appear to prefer watching movies on their big- screen TVs .
Apple already has a product , Apple TV , which syncs movies from your computer to your TV .
But it has been met with some critism and is not without its limitations .
The Netflix unlimited plan may be more attractive than Apple ’s expected $ 3.99 per movie plan , which will likely require movies to be downloaded and viewed within 24 hours of purchase .
Whatever the case , more competition in this space is definitely a good thing .
( CNN ) --
The new seven wonders of the world were named Saturday following an online vote that generated server - crushing traffic in its final hours .
The Great Wall of China was among the top vote - getters of the " New 7 Wonders of the World " project .

The final tally produced this list of the world 's top human - built wonders :
• The Great Wall of China
• Petra in Jordan
• Brazil 's statue of Christ the Redeemer
• Peru's Machu Picchu
• Mexico's Chichen Itza pyramid
• The Colosseum in Rome
• India 's Taj Mahal
Before the vote ended Friday , organizers said more than 90 million votes had been cast for 21 sites .
Watch the contenders and controversy surrounding the ' new ' seven wonders »
Voting at the Web site , www.new7wonders.com, ended at 6 p.m. ET Friday .
Traffic was so heavy Friday that the site was crashing at times .
One message urged voters to use text messages as an alternative form of voting .
" Keep on voting , as it is your votes that decide the New 7 Wonders of the World , " the message said .
" We have traffic that is simply off the scale , " Tia Vering , spokeswoman for the " New 7 Wonders of the World " campaign , told CNN.com .
" Things are just going ballistic . "
The new wonders were announced at a star - studded event Saturday in Lisbon , Portugal , that featured performances by Jennifer Lopez and Chaka Khan .
The event was hosted by Oscar winners Hilary Swank and Ben Kingsley as well as Bollywood star Bipasha Basu .
Send CNN.com photos and video of your favorite " wonder "
The top contenders for the seven wonders were last made public in early June .
The oldest candidate was Britain 's Stonehenge ; the newest was Australia 's Sydney Opera House .
The U.S. Statue of Liberty also was among the choices .
Voting nearly doubled after the June results , when organizers said about 50 million votes had been cast .
A single user can cast multiple votes .
To be considered for the competition , all structures had to be built or discovered before 2000 .
All are among top tourist attractions around the world .
Of the seven ancient wonders of the world , only one remains standing today , the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt .

New 7 Wonders campaign TIME.com : Photo essay
Some nations have enthusiastically endorsed the new wonders campaign .
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Jordan's Queen Rania actively promoted their countries ' hopefuls .
But the new wonders campaign has n't been universally recognized .
The United Nations ' cultural organization , UNESCO , issued a statement saying it has " no link whatsoever " to the vote .
Egypt 's top antiquities expert also objected to the list .
He said Egypt 's pyramids are a " symbol of the genius of the ancient people " -- and are above any sort of online poll .
As a result , the organizers struck up a compromise .
The pyramids have been assured honorary status , in addition to the new seven wonders .
The new wonders project was the brainchild of Swiss businessman Bernard Weber .
He said he wanted to invite the people of the world to take part in selecting the world 's greatest wonders .
" So that everybody can decide what the new seven wonders should be and not some government , not some individuals , not some institutions , " he said .
Vering said she believes the vote has accomplished that goal .
" We 've managed to bring culture out of the museum -- out of the dusty , dry academic corners -- and have people talk about it , " she said .
" That , we feel , is the greatest achievement of this campaign . "

Mr. Speaker , while I oppose federal efforts to redefine marriage as something other than a union between one man and one woman , I do not believe a constitutional amendment is either a necessary or proper way to defend marriage .
While marriage is licensed and otherwise regulated by the states , government did not create the institution of marriage .
In fact , the institution of marriage most likely pre-dates the institution of government !
Government regulation of marriage is based on state recognition of the practices and customs formulated by private individuals interacting in civil society .
Many people associate their wedding day with completing the rituals and other requirements of their faith , thus being joined in the eyes of their church and their creator , not with receiving their marriage license , thus being joined in the eyes of the state .
If I were in Congress in 1996 , I would have voted for the Defense of Marriage Act , which used Congress ’s constitutional authority to define what official state documents other states have to recognize under the Full Faith and Credit Clause , to ensure that no state would be forced to recognize a same sex marriage license issued in another state .
This Congress , I was an original cosponsor of the Marriage Protection Act , HR 3313 , that removes challenges to the Defense of Marriage Act from federal courts ’ jurisdiction .
If I were a member of the Texas legislature , I would do all I could to oppose any attempt by rogue judges to impose a new definition of marriage on the people of my state .
Liberty Defined : 50 Es ... Paul , Ron Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 5.75 ( as of 02:55 EST - Details )
Having studied this issue and consulted with leading legal scholars , including an attorney who helped defend the Boy Scouts against attempts to force the organization to allow gay men to serve as scoutmasters , I am convinced that both the Defense of Marriage Act and the Marriage Protection
Act can survive legal challenges and ensure that no state is forced by a federal court ’s or another state ’s actions to recognize same sex marriage .
Therefore , while I am sympathetic to those who feel only a constitutional amendment will sufficiently address this issue , I respectfully disagree .
I also am concerned that the proposed amendment , by telling the individual states how their state constitutions are to be interpreted , is a major usurpation of the states ’ power .
The division of power between the federal government and the states is one of the virtues of the American political system .
Altering that balance endangers self - government and individual liberty .
However , if federal judges wrongly interfere and attempt to compel a state to recognize the marriage licenses of another state , that would be the proper time for me to consider new legislative or constitutional approaches .
Conservatives in particular should be leery of anything that increases federal power , since centralized government power is traditionally the enemy of conservative values .
I agree with the assessment of former Congressman Bob Barr , who authored the Defense of Marriage Act :
 The very fact that the FMA [ Federal Marriage Amendment ] was introduced said that conservatives believed it was okay to amend the Constitution to take power from the states and give it to Washington .
That is hardly a basic principle of conservatism as we used to know it .
It is entirely likely the left will boomerang that assertion into a future proposed amendment that would weaken gun rights or mandate income redistribution . "
Passing a constitutional amendment is a long , drawn - out process .
The fact that the marriage amendment already failed to gather the necessary two - thirds support in the Senate means that , even if two - thirds of House members support the amendment , it will not be sent to states for ratification this year .
Even if the amendment gathers the necessary two - thirds support in both houses of Congress , it still must go through the time - consuming process of state ratification .
This process requires three - quarters of the state legislatures to approve the amendment before it can become effective .
Those who believe that immediate action to protect the traditional definition of marriage is necessary should consider that the Equal Rights Amendment easily passed both houses of Congress and was quickly ratified by a number of states .
Yet , that amendment remains unratified today .
Proponents of this marriage amendment should also consider that efforts to amend the Constitution to address flag burning and require the federal government to balance the budget have been ongoing for years , without any success .
Ironically , liberal social engineers who wish to use federal government power to redefine marriage will be able to point to the constitutional marriage amendment as proof that the definition of marriage is indeed a federal matter !
I am unwilling either to cede to federal courts the authority to redefine marriage , or to deny a state ’s ability to preserve the traditional definition of marriage .
Instead , I believe it is time for Congress and state legislatures to reassert their authority by refusing to enforce judicial usurpations of power .
In contrast to a constitutional amendment , the Marriage Protection Act requires only a majority vote of both houses of Congress and the president ’s signature to become law .
The bill already has passed the House of Representatives ; at least 51 senators would vote for it ; and the president would sign this legislation given his commitment to protecting the traditional definition of marriage .
Therefore , those who believe Congress needs to take immediate action to protect marriage this year should focus on passing the Marriage Protection Act .
Because of the dangers to liberty and traditional values posed by the unexpected consequences of amending the Constitution to strip power from the states and the people and further empower Washington , I cannot in good conscience support the marriage amendment to the United States Constitution .
Instead , I plan to continue working to enact the Marriage Protection Act and protect each state ’s right not to be forced to recognize a same sex marriage .

Physicists at UC Riverside have created molecular positronium , an entirely new object in the laboratory .
Briefly stable , each molecule is made up of a pair of electrons and a pair of their antiparticles , called positrons .
The research paves the way for studying multi-positronium interactions – useful for generating coherent gamma radiation – and could one day help develop fusion power generation as well as directed energy weapons such as gamma-ray lasers .
It also could help explain how the observable universe ended up with so much more matter than “ antimatter . ”
Study results appear in the Sept. 13 issue of Nature .
The researchers made the positronium molecules by firing intense bursts of positrons into a thin film of porous silica , which is the chemical name for the mineral quartz .
Upon slowing down in silica , the positrons were captured by ordinary electrons to form positronium atoms .
Positronium atoms , by nature , are extremely short - lived .
But those positronium atoms that stuck to the internal pore surfaces of silica , the way dirt particles might cling to the inside surface of the holes in a sponge , lived long enough to interact with one another to form molecules of positronium , the physicists found .
“ Silica acts in effect like a useful cage , trapping positronium atoms , ” said David Cassidy , the lead author of the research paper and an assistant researcher working in the laboratory of Allen Mills , a professor of physics , the research paper ’s coauthor .
“ This is the first step in our experiments .
What we hope to achieve next is to get many more of the positronium atoms to interact simultaneously with one another – not just two positronium atoms at a time . ”
When an electron meets a positron , their mutual annihilation may ensue or positronium , a briefly stable , hydrogen - like atom , may be formed .
The stability of a positronium atom is threatened again when the atom collides with another positronium atom .
Such a collision of two positronium atoms can result in their annihilation , accompanied by the production of a powerful and energetic type of electromagnetic radiation called gamma radiation , or the creation of a molecule of positronium , the kind Cassidy and Mills observed in their lab .
“ Their research is giving us new ways to understand matter and antimatter , ” said Clifford M. Surko , a professor of physics at UC San Diego , who was not involved in the research .
“ It also provides novel techniques to create even larger collections of antimatter that will likely lead to new science and , potentially , to important new technologies . ”
Matter , the “ stuff ” that every known object is made of , and antimatter cannot co-exist close to each other for more than a very small measure of time because they annihilate each other to release enormous amounts of energy in the form of gamma radiation .
The apparent asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is an unsolved problem in physics .
Currently , antimatter finds use in medicine where it helps identify diseases with the Positron Emission Tomography or PET scan .
Cassidy and Mills plan to work next on using a more intense positron source to generate a “ Bose - Einstein condensate ” of positronium – a collection of positronium atoms that are in the same quantum state , allowing for more interactions and gamma radiation .
According to them , such a condensate would be necessary for the development of a gamma-ray laser .

Norma Gabler , a Texas homemaker who recoiled at material in her children ’s textbooks and became the public face of a crusade with her husband to rid schoolbooks of content they considered antifamily , anti-American and anti-God , died on July 22 in Phoenix .
She was 84 .
The cause was Parkinson ’s disease , her son James said .
From its origins at the Gablers ’ kitchen table in Hawkins , Tex. , in 1961 to its incorporation as Educational Research Analysts in 1973 , the mom-and - pop textbook - criticism enterprise grew to occupy a prominent niche in the nation ’s conservative pantheon .
For more than four decades , the couple influenced what children read , not just in Texas but around the country .
The reason was Texas ’ power to be a national template ; the state board chooses textbooks for the entire state , and of the 20 or so states that choose books statewide , only California is bigger than Texas .
It is difficult and costly for publishers to put out multiple editions , so a book rejected by Texas might not be printed at all .
In a 1982 article in The New York Times , Anthony T. Podesta , executive director of People for the American Way , a liberal group , said , “ Texas has the buying power to influence the development of teaching materials nationwide , and a textbook edition chosen for Texas often becomes the sole edition available . ”
Katie was " overwhelmed " when she received the invitation
Katie Gallogly , 16 , a pupil at St Andrew 's High School in Coatbridge , said it had always been her dream to study at Harvard in Boston .
The university contacted Katie after she achieved high scores in the American college entrance exams .
Katie wants to complete her sixth year at school before deciding whether to pursue a place at Harvard .
The teenager , who is a keen scientist and wants to study medicine , said : " Ever since I was little I always wanted to study and work in America .
It is the place of dreams .
" But to get into the best universities there you have to pass the SAT exams .
I did an internet search and found out I could register for them on a website called College Board . "
Katie prepared for SAT exams in maths and chemistry while also studying for her Highers .
She 's a great ambassador for the school and a role model to other pupils
Tom Mills
Head teacher
She was able to sit the exams at a special test centre at Glasgow University and was delighted when she got her results back .
Her marks were in the top five per cent for chemistry and the top three per cent for maths .
She also achieved straight A passes in her highers .
Katie said : " I came in from school one day and there was a letter for me .
Everyone likes getting post but then I saw it had the Harvard Crest .
" I opened it up and it said they wanted to encourage me to apply to Harvard .
" I was just overwhelmed and so happy . "
Childhood dream
Other US universities have also been in touch , encouraging her to consider their international scholarship programmes .
Her mum , Paula Gallogly , 38 , said : " When she was nine her teacher at primary school told us that she always talked about going to Harvard .
Katie 's mum , Paula , is very proud of her daughter
" America is her dream and that same teacher told us ' Katie will do it ' . "
Mrs Gallogly added : " My phone bill is going to be sky high this month from phoning everyone I know to tell them about the Harvard letter . "
Tom Mills , head teacher at St Andrew 's High , said everyone at the school was very proud of Katie .
" She 's a young person with exceptional academic ability .
" She 's a great ambassador for the school and a role model to other pupils , " he added .
Japanese scientists are set to test the largest wireless electricity transmission ever attempted in a Tesla like spectacle that is sure to capture a great amount of atention and spark strong interest and support for a technology that could change the World .
The event is to take place at the Tokyo Tower , the largest man made structure in Japan , at 1100 feet tall .
The nighttime experiment is meant to Illuminate the top spire of the mammoth steel structure to demmonstrate the use of the first wireless electricity transfer system in the World .
The test is designed to transfer about 1200 watts of power at a range of 100 feet and will be a first of its kind use of a system Japanese scientists are developing to transmit power at distances they hope could reach 300 feet using a science that is based on magnetically coupled resonance .
Resonance energy is when a receiver coil is tuned to the same frequency as the emitter coil , the sender coil emits electricity by way of a magnetic field oscillating at a specific frequency , only the receiver coil is able to pick up the transmitted energy , the surrounding environment is unaffected and the system does not need line of site as the energy travels through any weather condition as well as structures .
Wireless energy transmission is seen as the Holy Grail of power because of it ’s potential in developing nations where electricity is limited and expensive due to the massive infrastructure costs of installation .
Wireless Electricity like cell phone service would be quick and easy to install and its effects would be immediate in transforming the lives of impoverished people .

Increased defense spending by Venezuela , Brazil , and Ecuador , coupled with significant arms purchases by Chile and Colombia , may mark the start of an arms race in South America – a region that has n't seen a major war between nations in decades .
" There is a real risk of it escalating and it could become very dangerous , " says Michael Shifter , the vice president of policy at the Inter - American Dialogue in Washington .
Concern has grown in the wake of recent purchases by Venezuela and Brazil .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , flush with oil money , has spent freely on attack and transport helicopters , Russian fighter planes , and 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles .
In neighboring Brazil , which , with half of Latin America 's landmass and population , President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently asked Congress to allocate 10.13 billion reais ( $ 5.6 billion ) – a 53 percent increase – for its 2008 military budget .
Those increases came after Chile invested significant sums earlier in the decade .
Colombia has received hundreds of millions of dollars in US drug - war aid for military purchases .
And now Ecuador is also spending more on weapons .
" I think that it is done in different places for different motivations , " says Mr. Shifter , who testified before the US Congress last year on the implications of Venezuela 's increased military spending . " [ Mr. ]
Chávez is using this as part of mobilizing the country and thinking of a possible attack from the US .
In Chile , it is much more about giving the armed forces what they want .
Colombia spends because a lot of the [ US ] aid comes in the form of military equipment . "
The problem , continues Shifter , is that " there is tremendous mistrust between countries ... if you do n't know what your neighbors ' intentions are , then it is natural is to build up as much as you can to prepare for any contingency . "
Some South American nations worry about Chávez 's ambitions and do not want him to gain a significant military edge .
" Brazil wo n't say it , but Chávez 's build up is what has made it invest in its military , " says Reserve Col.
Geraldo Lesbat Cavagnari , coordinator of the Strategic Studies Group at Unicamp university in São Paulo .
Brazil and Venezuela already vie for political supremacy in South America with Chávez bringing together the radical leftists under his socialist banner and President Lula leading a more measured coalition of social democrats .
At this point , the two leaders are friends and the two nations have no border quarrels or historical feuds that could flare up .
But there are tensions between Venezuela and Colombia over gas - rich territorial waters and border areas where Colombia 's FARC guerrillas are active .
And Veneuzela has made claims on the western part of Guyana .
But few people believe Chávez is buying weapons in order to attack a neighbor .
He has warned opponents of his Bolivian ally Evo Morales that " rifle and machine guns will thunder " if they try to topple President Morales but Venezuela still does not have a military machine capable of shock and awe , analysts said .
In addition , its army is one - third the size of Brazil's , and distinctly less experienced and battle hardened than neighboring Colombia's .
Any attempts to settle territorial claims on western Guyana would give both the US and Britain , a former colonial power , reasons to enter the fray .
Yet the thought of an unpredictable leader with modern weaponry concerns some of the continent 's moderates .
Moreover , many analysts say the region cannot afford to devote large amounts of money to weaponry .
Poverty is still a major problem in most South American countries and that – along with infrastructure , justice , and education – is seen as a more worthy priority than submarines or fighter planes .
" An arms race on our continent will oblige us to depart from the path of giving priority to investments in social programs , " says Jose Sarney , a Brazilian senator and a fierce critic of Chávez .
" Having a military power on the continent is dangerous for both Brazil and ... Latin America . "
Nevertheless , no one wants to get left behind , especially Brazil .
Investment in modern weaponry , analysts agree , is long overdue for South America 's biggest nation .
Years of neglect have left much of Brazil 's war machine obsolete or in disrepair .
Meanwhile , its priorities have changed from worrying about Argentina in the south to protecting its jungle frontiers on the north and west and its territorial waters that are home to sizeable new finds of oil and gas .
" There are very real security concerns that are being neglected , " says Martin Joyce , the South America defense analyst for Jane's .
" One is the Amazon region where drug traffickers are operating with impunity .
Secondly , we are also seeing an increased presence of Colombian guerrillas , and that requires mobility and that is why we see helicopters and military airlift high on the priority list .
Then there is the new oil reserves .
Part of the reason for the procurement of a nuclear submarine is because they said they need to protect those resources .
Venezuela comes fairly low down the list . " .
The alternative energy company that has plans to install hundreds of turbines in the East River to harness tidal energy and generate zero-emission electrical power is running into trouble due to the massive amount of energy they are dealing with .
The small number of turbines already placed in the East River by Verdant Power have been temporarily removed as the strong currents continue to overwhelm the physical construction of the underwater " windmills . "
The six turbines that were placed in the water last December and were capable of supplying 1,000 daily kilowatt hours of power and serving the Gristedes supermarket on Roosevelt Island could not withstand currents .
The East River is not actually a river ; it 's a tidal strait , and one can easily observe the current moving in opposite directions with the tides .
Verdant Power 's plan is to install a field of turbines anchored to the bottom of the East River and use the currents to generate pollution - free electricity for the city .
The currents have proven so strong , however , that the turbine propellers have been sheared off a third of the way down , and stronger replacements were hampered by insufficiently strong bolt connections to the turbine hubs .
The New York Times reports that the company is encountering the setbacks with optimism , encouraged that the East River possesses even more power than originally planned for .
" ' The only way for us to learn is to get the turbines into the water and start breaking them , ' said Trey Taylor , the habitually optimistic founder of Verdant Power . "
Hydro-kinetic power generation is drawing increasing interest .
The predictability of tides makes it attractive in a way that wind - powered turbines lack .
KeySpan is currently partnering with Verdant Power in its project to install East River turbines and a second company , Oceana Energy , recently secured a federal permit to install turbines further up the East River from Verdant's .
Some concern has been expressed about the effect of turbines on aquatic wildlife , but Verdant is funding a close examination of the impact of its turbines on fish and other river species .
WNYC interviewed Dean Corren , Verdant Power 's Director of Technology Development , in April .

Ancient Romans built their towns using astronomically aligned grids , an Italian study concludes .
The research examines the orientation of virtually all Roman towns in Italy and is published on the arXiv physics website , which is maintained by Cornell University " It emerged that these towns were not laid out at random .
On the contrary , they were planned following strong symbolic aspects , all linked to astronomy , " says Professor Giulio Magli , of the mathematics department at Milan 's Polytechnic University
The research examined the orientation of some 38 towns in Italy and is part of a wider study published in Magli 's bookMagli explains that ancient Roman writers , including Ovid and Plutarch , documented how the foundation of a new town took into account the flight of birds and astronomical references .
" However , the link between Roman towns and sky symbolism has never been fully nvestigated , " Magli says .
The Romans founded many towns , or colonies , especially during Rome 's Republican period and the first Imperial period , roughly from the 5th century BC to the 1st century AD .
Their layout , inspired by the so - called castrum or military camp , was always the same .
The town consisted of a rectangle bounded by walls , with streets organised in a grid to form various residential quarters or insulae .
Two main roads , called cardus and decumanus , crisscrossed the whole town .
Their intersection was the centre of the social and religious life , while four main gates were placed at their ends .
" I did not take into consideration all the Roman towns , but only those in which at least the two main roads are still clearly discernible , " Magli says .
For instance , the study did not examine the orientation of Pompeii .
Its two main roads are not obvious as the Romans later modified the town 's layout .
Among towns with two clear main roads , Magli looked at the orientation of grids ' axes in relation to the movement of the rising Sun at the eastern horizon over the course of the year .
He extracted this orientation from available archaeological maps or by using a precision magnetic compass on site .
" It emerged that the majority of Roman towns in Italy are aligned to sunrise , in relation to important sacred festivals or to the cardinal points , " Magli says .
Basically , there are only three towns orientated toward the north : Pesaro , Rimini and Senigallia .
These three also lie relatively close to the west coast of central Italy .
Only two towns in northern Italy , Verona and Vicenza , lie near the summer solstice sunrise line .
They are geographically close and were founded in the same period .
All the other studied towns are oriented either within 10° southeast of sunrise , or near the winter solstice sunrise .
" Given these results , we can say that Roman towns in Italy are not randomly oriented .
This will help us understand what kind of astronomical knowledge the Romans had , " Magli says .
Dr Manuela Incerti , of Ferrara University 's architecture department , describes the findings as " interesting research " .
" It certainly opens the way to more extensive studies , " she says .
When stock markets climb , the fees associated with equity ownership are easy to shrug off .
But with the stock market ailing in 2008 — the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index is down 9.75 percent as of Friday — mutual fund investors are right to wonder and worry about the costs they are paying to own their shares .
Tallying these costs is especially hard for investors in load funds — those with sales charges — bought through a broker .
These are the funds of the alphabet - soup share classes , A , B , C and so on , whose fees vary because of differences in the sales charges and when they are levied .
While the bulk of mutual fund investors wisely choose no -load funds — 73 percent in 2006 , according to the Investment Company Institute — $ 37 billion went into funds with loads .
Some 80 percent of mutual fund investors consult with brokers and other advisers when buying mutual fund shares outside of their retirement plans , the organization said .
Fund prospectuses , nobody ’s idea of easy reading , do n’t help investors understand what they are paying in expenses , either .
Many prospectuses show total return figures that do not factor in sales charges , for example .
Even expense ratios , the numbers that most investors look to as a proxy for costs , do not give shareholders what they probably want : an estimate of their account ’s value after deducting fees and sales charges .
Happily , such a number can be found on the Web site of Finra ( the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ) , the private regulator of brokerage firms and their employees , which was formerly known as the NASD .
The organization ’s mutual fund expense analyzer , which can be found at http://apps.finra.org/investor_Information/ea/1/mfetf.aspx, is a nifty tool that allows investors to compare the costs of various funds and share classes in a way that is tailored to their expected holding period and estimated returns .
Finra cautions that its cost analyzer generates hypothetical results because the data that goes into it involves estimates both for holding periods and returns .
But it is easy to use and far more illuminating about fees than most prospectuses .
Any investor who has been persuaded by a broker to buy a load fund should consult the fee analyzer first to see which share class is cheapest .
One message comes through loud and clear from a trip through the analyzer :
There is no such thing as the right share class for all investors .
Indeed , one of the most intriguing findings is that Class A shares , the most commonly sold class today and the one usually characterized as the best value for individual investors , are often more expensive than B and C shares .
Class
A shares have front - end loads , meaning that the sales charge is paid at the time of purchase .
Class B shares have loads that decline over time , eventually disappearing , and are payable upon selling shares .
Class C shares typically have higher asset - based sales charges levied annually , but no front - or back - end loads .
Class
A shares are typically viewed as cheaper because their lower operating expenses are thought to offset their upfront sales loads , which can run to 5.75 percent .
In 2006 , such shares accounted for 51 percent of all load fund sales , versus 13 percent in 2002 .
Finra ’s fee analyzer shows how wrong this conventional wisdom can be .
That Class B shares can be a better value may also surprise anyone who has paid attention to regulatory actions against fund brokers in recent years .
In many such cases , Class B shares were central to investor abuses — brokers sold large numbers of the shares to investors who would have done better with Class A shares .
The scandals led so many to view Class B shares negatively that some financial services firms now limit the sales of the share class .
But for an investor placing $ 40,000 or less into a fund for a five - year period , Class B shares often result in lower fees than A shares .
One reason is that the high front - end load of the A shares means investors have less money working for them right out of the gate .
In any case , brokers pushing Class A shares because of the problems with the Class B shares are laughing all the way to the bank .
Here are some hypothetical examples of how fees can affect returns in different share classes :
The analyzer shows that a $ 40,000 investment in the Lord Abbett All Value fund , to be held for five years with an estimated return of 5 percent a year , would generate the lowest account value if held in Class A shares : $ 45,532 .
The C shares would produce the highest , $ 46,787 , and an investor in the B shares would wind up with $ 45,987 .
If the Franklin Large Cap Value fund returned 5 percent annually for seven years and you invested $ 10,000 for the period , the A shares would again generate less .
An investor in the A shares would have $ 12,065 ; a holder of B shares would receive $ 12,241 and the C class would produce $ 12,250 .
A third example is the Columbia Acorn International fund .
A $ 20,000 investment held for three years that returned a hypothetical 5 percent a year would generate $ 21,785 in the Class C shares and $ 21,307 in Class B. And Class A brings up the rear , with an account value of $ 21,011 .
For all their notoriety , Class B shares can be even more attractive because brokers will often waive the back - end loads when sales occur as a result of a divorce , disability or required minimum distributions in an individual retirement account .
After comparing account values in a variety of funds and circumstances , C shares seem to be the cheapest of the alternatives most of the time .
But not always .
A $ 40,000 investment in the Alliance Bernstein International Value fund held for seven years with a hypothetical annual return of 7 percent would eke out the best result in Class A , at $ 56,614 , while the B and C classes would turn in the same $ 56,303 .
And the Class A shares of the Davis New York Venture fund would produce the best outcome when $ 25,000 is invested and held for eight years , assuming an 8 percent annual return .
In that circumstance , the A shares would generate $ 41,190 while the B shares would produce $ 40,917 and the C shares $ 40,691 .
All of this illustrates that the conventional wisdom — that Class A shares are the “ best ” for investors — is not always wise .
Every case is different , which is why the Finra analyzer is so helpful .
It allows investors who insist on buying load funds to enrich themselves first , their brokers second .

My husband would beat the child and throw him aside
Forugh
Those detained include many of the big names of Iran 's women 's movement , who are calling for an end to discriminatory laws against women .
It is not hard to find women who have been caused great suffering by the law as it stands .
" This is my son just after he was born , " say Forugh , looking through old photo albums in the tiny apartment where she lives alone .
Ali Reza is now seven and Forugh has not been able to see him for many months .
When she separated from her husband the judge gave him custody of their child .
" From the moment he came home my husband used to start shouting until he left again , " she remembers .
" So many times it ended in a physical beating " .
She says Ali Reza would come to her defence : " ' Do n't do anything to my mum , ' he 'd say .
But he would beat the child and throw him aside " .
Painful separation
The judge said Forugh could see Ali Reza for up to 12 hours a week , but they had to meet in a police station .
It frightened the child so much she gave up .
Forugh lost her son , Ali Reza , and gets no support from the father
Forugh is worried about the damage it has done to Ali Reza .
" One time he came to see me after some months and I asked him : ' Do you feel bad that I separated from your father and you are far away from me ? '
He said : ' No . I could see how much daddy was bothering you ' " .
Forugh breaks down in tears .
Her story illustrates how the laws in Iran are weighted against women : the father automatically gets custody of a boy over two years of age or a girl over seven .
Forugh lost her child and got no financial support from her ex husband .
Fighting for justice
There are those trying to change things .
Parisa is approaching total strangers on the street and talking to them about the legal status of women .
She is collecting signatures for a petition asking for the repeal of Iranian religious laws that discriminate against women .
The campaign has struck a chord with many Iranian women like Mahnoush who are fed up with being second class citizens .
The judges do not consider the value and dignity of women .
It 's disgusting .
Shima
Mahnoush has just signed the petition and explains why : " I am protesting that in any instance I am considered only half a man ... maybe I am more effective than a man so why should my rights be half his " .
Her friend Shima has also signed because she says she has seen lots of women suffer , even her own mother when she divorced .
" The right to divorce is really ridiculous .
I have seen women go and say their spouse is a drug addict and the judge says stay with him , at least he can support you .
The judges do not consider the value and dignity of women .
It 's disgusting . "
Surrounded by fear
Parisa is nervous being filmed collecting signatures .
She thinks plain clothes police are filming us from a parked car nearby even though she only arranged the meeting point at the last minute .
Some of her colleagues have been arrested while campaigning .
Parisa believes the authorities see them as a threat .
Collecting signatures continues despite fears of police harassment
" Officials do n't want to listen to the women 's movement because they think it 's something that 's come from the west , " she explains .
She says the interesting thing is the rich , westernised women are less supportive of the campaign to change discriminatory laws than the poor and more conservative women .
Parisa thinks it is because less well off women cannot afford good lawyers when they run into trouble .
1,000,000 signatures
The one million signature campaign to change the law began with a peaceful protest last June in one of Iran 's biggest squares .
Women activists sat on the grass and sang feminist songs .
Within minutes the police beat them and started firing tear gas and mace spray .
More than 70 people were arrested .
Among them 20 - two - year old student Delaram Ali who is now on trial .
" I am charged with acting against national security , disturbing public order and doing propaganda against the system , and having connections to illegal opposition groups , " explains Delaram .
Officials do n't want to listen to the women 's movement
Parisa
She says she spent three days in solitary confinement in Evin Jail after the police injured her hand in the protest last June .
Delaram is being defended by Iran 's best known woman lawyer , Shireen Ebadi who won the Nobel peace prize for her human rights work .
Mrs Ebadi says Iranian law allows peaceful protests , that it is the police not the demonstrators who should be prosecuted for their violent action .
" We filed a complaint against the police .
Unfortunately although 10 months has passed no representative of the police has come to reply to the complaint in spite of being asked to attend many times , " she explains .
Larry Flynt speaks out on telling Falwell he was ' full of it ' and Bush 's abuse of government David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday July 9 , 2007 Print This Email This Larry Flynt appeared Friday on Henry Rollins ' show on the Independent Film Channel .
Rollins first asked Flynt about his reaction to the death of Jerry Falwell , against whom Flynt won a landmark free speech case in 1983 .
Flynt replied that although he never agreed with Falwell on any issue , as a result of their joint participation in many debates over the years , he finally " could see him as a human being . "
Flynt recalled an occasion when Falwell came to see him at his office , saying , " I honesty believe that he was there to bury the hatchet .
I do n't think ... he felt he was on the winning side of that free speech issue . "
" I was probably the only guy in his entire inner circle of people who knew him who could just tell him he was full of it , " continued Flynt .
" And he did n't get mad at me for that . "
Rollins then suggested that the importance of the pivotal Supreme Court verdict overturning a lower court 's judgment against Flynt for his scurrilous parody of Falwell has never been properly recognized .
" Had that decision been allowed to stand , " agreed Flynt , " someone could sue you and they would n't have to prove libel .
All they'd have to do is prove you hurt their feelings .
Or their dog 's feelings .
Or their grandfather 's feelings . "
However , Flynt also displayed some bitterness , saying " I could have settled .
... I wanted to fight it all the way because I wanted to win .
But if I knew that I would have got as little recognition after spending 3 1/ 2 million dollars , I would have never went the distance on that case , because if people do n't care any more than that about free speech , then let them defend their own concept of free speech . "
When Rollins brought up President Bush , Flynt responded , " I can't think of a single area of government that Bush has n't abused in the most fundamental way .
I think he 's actually scared a lot of people .
...
They 're really frightened of him . "
Flynt suggested that it is only the Iraq quagmire that has spared the porn industry from Bush 's worst intentions .
Rollins asked Flynt about his decision not to run nude photos he obtained of Jessica Lynch , the soldier whose capture by Iraqi forces in 2003 was exploited by the US government for propaganda purposes .
Flynt said that if Lynch had played the role of a hero , as the administration wanted , he would have published the pictures , but " she was a victim " of Cheney and Wolfowitz and he was n't about to " ruin her life . "
Rollins responded to that statement by calling Flynt a " moral person . "
Flynt seemed taken aback and responded , " The only thing you can say about me and be true is that I 'm a pornographer ...
I 've never apologized for being a fan of the curious form of art which is pornography . "
The following video is from IFC's Henry Rollins Show , broadcast on July 6 .
Bill Kristol knows that the current strategy in Iraq will not work as it was designed to do .
He 's not crazy .
The chances of national reconciliation in Iraq have gone backward , not forward , this past year , and the U.S. 's empowerment of anti-Shiite propaganda in Anbar will only isolate Maliki further .
The best that can happen is an indefinite occupation of a dismembered Iraq to slow down genocide and make ethnic cleansing more orderly .
But even that is a very risky proposition .
And the events of last week mean that the Republican party now owns the Iraq occupation more exclusively and deeply than they ever had - and indeed intend to maintain it for another decade .
So what to do ?
Remember that Kristol 's loyalty to the Republicans often trumps national security .
How else to explain his support for the GOP last November , even though a Republican victory would have prevented the surge in the first place and kept Rumsfeld in the Pentagon ?
One option : Change the subject by launching wars against Syria and Iran , and so polarize the country that the choice is framed as : MoveOn or America ?
That 's much better than having , you know , an actual debate about the merits of the war in Iraq and the war against Islamist terror .
On that , Republicans lose .
If the war is far wider and more terrifying , if the enemies can be multiplied and amplified , then the dynamic plays to the advantage of the GOP .
It 's for us or against us again .
We present a design for a class of computers whose “ instruction sets ” are based on LISP .
LISP , like traditional stored - program machine languages and unlike most high - level languages , conceptually stores programs and data in the same way and explicitly allows programs to be manipulated as data , and so is a suitable basis for a stored - program computer architecture .
LISP differs from traditional machine languages in that the program / data storage is conceptually an unordered set of linked record structures of various sizes , rather than an ordered , indexable vector of integers or bit fields of fixed size .
An instruction set can be designed for programs expressed as trees of record structures .
A processor can interpret these program trees in a recursive fashion and provide automatic storage management for the record structures .
We discuss a small - scale prototype VLSI microprocessor which has been designed and fabricated , containing a sufficiently complete instruction interpreter to execute small programs and a rudimentary storage allocator .
By Mark O’Neill
Today has been a particularly rotten day .
I sometimes have these kinds of days in which nothing ever goes right and everyone irritates me .
Clients make unreasonable demands , I drop everything I hold , I am constantly banging into walls , poking myself in the eye … I ’m sure you have these days yourself .
The kind of day when you wonder why you bothered getting out of bed in the first place .
I even stabbed myself in the hand with a knife while washing it .
But recently my neurologist surprised me with a suggestion .
He made the rather geeky idea that I should consider my day to be a computer operating system and that if things were going badly , I should “ re-boot ” and start again .
He continued by saying that there are days when I will feel like an “ early virus - ridden version of Windows 95 but I should get my frame of mind to the point where I am Windows 7 .
By this point , I was looking at my doctor in amazement .
He must be in his 60’s , hardly the generation where you expect computer analogies .
I had previously tagged him as still being a typewriter kind of guy .
If he had said “ consider yourself a Corona typewriter and if you ’re having a bad day , change the ink ribbon ” , I would n’t have raised an eyebrow .
His theory goes like this .
When you feel all is going wrong with your day , stop what you are doing and sit down .
Take a deep breath and then close your eyes for a fifteen minute nap .
The nap is the re-booting of your “ internal operating system ” ( as the doc liked to compare it ) .
Then when you open your eyes again , the re-boot is complete and you must now pretend that it is a new day .
Tell yourself that all the problems and crap was yesterday and that this is a new day with new possibilities .
Then start your day again .
My first automatic response was “ if it takes fifteen minutes for your system to re-boot then you must have a pretty heavy startup process and you need to make some adjustments to your msconfig menu ” .
Then I wondered why I had said that to my doctor as it was n’t particularly relevant .
Sometimes my mouth runs ahead of my brain .
He just looked at me with a bemused look as if to say “ this is my kind of guy ! ”
I am normally sceptical about “ alternative ideas ” like this but I decided to give it a go anyway .
So today when the world was going to hell and my clients would n’t shut up , I just walked away from it all , sat down and did a mental “ re-boot ” .
I told my girlfriend to tell all callers and visitors that I was “ upgrading and re-booting Marko 7 ” ( which she actually did ) .
After my fifteen minute nap ( well it was actually closer to twenty minutes ) , I got up and started again .
And you know what ?
It actually works .
You can actually fool your brain into thinking it ’s a new day .
Try it yourself sometime and you ’ll see what I mean .
Yes it is a rather geeky idea but if it works and you feel better , then so what if people laugh ?
To complete my amazement of this computer - savvy doctor , as I was leaving his office , he asked me if “ I was a digger ” .
When I gave him a blank look , he said “ you know , Digg.com ?
I digg all zee time !
I ’m a BIG digger ! ” .
So there you have it .
A geek writer with a geek digging doctor .
Can this world get any weirder ?
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The suicide of a young man and the murder he committed before he killed himself are being blamed on a cult led by his mother .
Ricky Rodriguez made this video before killing his former nanny and then taking his own life .
Also disturbing , former members who spoke to CNN say they witnessed Ricky Rodriguez having sex with his mother , Karen Zerby , the leader of the sect now known as " The Family International . "
The sect 's activities and history are detailed in a newly released book , " Jesus Freaks . "
The sect was founded in California in the 1960s by David Berg , who referred to himself as " Mo , " short for Moses .
Berg was a self - proclaimed prophet .
Former sect members tell CNN Berg encouraged adult - child sex .
More often than not , they say , the chosen child was Rodriguez , the son of Karen Zerby , who Berg called his queen .
Zerby became the leader of the sect when Berg died in 1994 .
" Jesus Freaks " author Don Lattin says Berg " wanted his child to embrace sexuality , to be a sexual being as an infant and growing up . "
Former members say Berg and Zerby wrote about their beliefs in papers distributed to members .
It was Berg 's how - to guide for raising sexual children .
The Family International now says all " questionable publications were officially renounced and expunged between the late 1980s and early 1990s . "
In Berg and Zerby 's manifesto , Rodriguez was the main character .
Former member Davida Kelley told CNN , " I actually witnessed Karen Zerby having intercourse with her own son , Rick Rodriguez , at age 11 . "
Kelley says she , too , had been abused by Berg , starting at age 5 .
" You were only required to have actual intimate intercourse with David Berg once you were , like , the mature age of , like , 12 , " she says sarcastically .
Berg was apparently so obsessed with sex he used it to expand his group around the world .
Lattin says
Berg sent women out to seduce men and lure them in to accept his gospel of Jesus .
Lattin says Berg called the practice " Flirty Fishing . "
CNN made several attempts to interview The Family International , but it refused .
In a statement , the group acknowledged Berg taught sexual liberty without " instituting safeguards for the protection of minors . "
But it says that was corrected in 1986 and any infractions are an " excommunicable offense . "
The group also told CNN all of Davida Kelley 's allegations are false and Zerby never abused her son .
Rodriguez , who escaped from " The Family International " in 2001 , apparently was so deeply scarred that he was making plans to kill his mother .
CNN has obtained a copy of a videotape he made two years ago , in which he warned , " She 's gonna pay dearly , one way or the other , " while brandishing a knife and loading guns at his kitchen table .
Watch Kelley 's troubling memories , Rodriguez 's video »
Within hours of finishing the tape , in January 2005 , Rodriguez tracked down his childhood nanny , Angela Smith .
Former member Kelley says " she was one of the many female adults that had intercourse with Rick Rodriguez . "
In his first bloody act of revenge , Rodriguez murdered his nanny .
He cut her throat and left her body in his Arizona apartment .
But he was still on the hunt for his mother .
Lattin says Rodriguez felt the need to take justice into his own hands because " most of the abuse was , like , 20 years ago , so the statute of limitations had expired .
Most of it happened outside the U.S. , so it 's very difficult to prosecute . "
A spokesman for the group told CNN its " policy for the protection of minors was adopted in 1986 .
We regret that prior to the adoption of this policy , cases occurred where minors were exposed to sexually inappropriate behavior between 1978 and 1986 . "
Some of those exposed to the alleged abuse may have chosen suicide to escape the pain .
A
Web site set up by people who grew up as children in the cult says at least 30 of them have committed suicide , though CNN has no way of verifying that .
Rodriguez became a part of that group .
He failed to find his mother , something his wife says he could n't live with .
Elixcia Munumel remembers their last phone call : " He 's like ' Baby , I love you . '
He said , ' Come die with me . ' "
Rodriguez died alone at age 29 in January 2005 on a deserted road , four years after he fled the sect .
A single shot to the head ended the misery he fought so hard to escape .
His mother is still the leader of the family .
She has not been charged with a crime and lives in seclusion .

General
Although combinatory logic has precursors , it was Moses Schönfinkel who first explored combinatory logic as such .
Later the work was continued by Haskell B. Curry .
Combinatory logic was developed as a theory for the foundation of mathematics [ Bun:NatICL ] , and it has relevance in linguistics too .
Its goal was to understand paradoxes better , and to establish fundamental mathematical concepts on simpler and cleaner principles than the existing mathematical frameworks , especially to understand better the concept of substitution .
Its “ lack of ( bound ) variables ” relates combinatory logic to the pointfree style of programming .
( For contrast , see a very different approach which also enables full elimination of variables : recursive function theory )
General materials :
Portals and other large - scale resources
Applications
Of course combinatory logic has significance in the foundations of mathematics , or in functional programming , computer science .
For example , see Chaitin 's construction .
It is interesting that it can be important also in some linguistical theories .
See especially the theory of applicative universal grammar , it uses many important thoughts from combinatory logic .
Lojban is an artificial language ( and , unlike the more a posteriori Esperanto , it is rather of an a priori taste ) .
It is a human language , capable of expressing everything .
Its grammar uses ( among others ) things taken from mathematical logic , e.g. predicate - like structures .
Although its does not make use combinatory logic directly ( even , from a category logic / functional programming point of view , it uses also rather imperative ideas ) , but it may give hints and analogies , how combinatry logic can be useful in linguistics .
Implementing CL
Base
Some thoughts on base combinators and on the relatedness of their rules to other topics
Conal Elliott 's reply to thread zips and maps
Intuitionistic fragment of propositional logic
Records in function : in set theory and database theory , we regard functions as consisting of more elementary parts , records : a function can be regarded as the set of all its records .
A record is a pair of a key and its value , and for functions we expect unicity ( and sometimes stress this requirement by writing instead of ) .
Sometimes I think of as having a taste of record selection : selects a record determinated by key in function ( as in a database ) , and returns the found record ( i.e. corresponding key and value ) contained in the container ( continuation ) .
Is this thought just a toy or can it be brought further ?
Does it explain why and can constitute a base ?

Also bracket abstraction gives us a natural way to understand the seemingly rather unintuitive and artificial combinator better
Programming in CL
I think many thoughts from John Hughes ' Why Functional Programming Matters can be applied to programming in Combinatory Logic .
And almost all concepts used in the Haskell world ( catamorphisms etc. ) help us a lot here too .
Combinatory logic is a powerful and concise programming language .
I wonder how functional logic programming could be done by using the concepts of Illative combinatory logic , too .
Datatypes
Continuation passing for polynomial datatypes
Direct product
Let us begin with a notion of the ordered pair and denote it by .
We know this construct well when defining operations for booleans
and Church numbers .
I think , in generally , when defining datatypes in a continuation - passing way ( e.g. Maybe or direct sum ) , then operations on so - defined datatypes often turn to be well - definable by some .
We define it with
in - calculus and
in combinatory logic .
A nice generalization scheme :
as the construct can be generalized to any natural number ( the concept of - tuple , see Barendregt 's Calculus )
construct can be generalized to any natural number ( the concept of - tuple , see Barendregt 's Calculus ) and in this generalized scheme corresponds to the 0 case , to the 1 case , and the ordered pair construct to the 2 case , as though defining
so we can write definition
or the same
in a more interesting way :
Is this generalizable ?
I do not know .
I know an analogy in the case of , , , .
Direct sum
The notion of ordered pair mentioned above really enables us to deal with direct products .
What about it dual concept ?
How to make direct sums in Combinatory Logic ?
And after we have implemented it , how can we see that it is really a dual concept of direct product ?
A nice argument described in David Madore 's Unlambda page gives us a continuation - passig style like solution .
We expect reductions like
so we define
now we translate it from - calculus into combinatory logic :
Of course , we can recognize Haskell 's direct sum construct
Either ( Left , Right )
implemented in an analogous way .
Maybe
Let us remember Haskell 's maybe :
maybe :: a ' -> ( a -> a ' ) ->
Maybe a -> a ' maybe n j Nothing = n maybe n j ( Just x ) = j x
thinking of
n as nothing - continuation
as nothing - continuation j as just - continuation
In a continuation passing style approach , if we want to implement something like the Maybe constuct in - calculus , then we may expect the following reductions :
we know both of them well , one is just , and we remember the other too from the direct sum :
thus their definition is
where both and have a common definition .
Maybe2
Haskell :
module Maybe2 ( Maybe2 , maybe2 , nothing2 , just2 ) where data Maybe2 a b = Nothing2 | Just2 a b maybe2 :: maybe2ab ' -> ( a -> b -> maybe2ab ' ) -> Maybe2 a b -> maybe2 ab ' maybe2 nothing 2Cont _ Nothing2 = nothing2Cont maybe2 _ just2Cont ( Just2 a b ) = just2Cont a b nothing2 :: Maybe2 a b nothing2 = Nothing2 just2 :: a -> b -> Maybe2 a b just2 = Just2
Expected reductions :
Other argument orders are possible , too , but they lead to more complicated solutions than the following :
Combinators :
Conjecture for generalisation :
with straightforward generalisations , e.g .
Catamorphisms for recursive datatypes
List
Let us define the concept of list by its catamorphism ( see Haskell 's foldr function ) : a list ( each concrete list ) is a function taking two arguments
a two - parameter function argument ( cons-continuation )
a zero-parameter function argument ( nil- continuation )
and returns a value coming from a term consisting of applying cons-continuations and nil - continuations in the same shape as the correspondig list .
E. g. in case of having defined
the expression
reduces to
But how to define and ?
In - calculus , we should like to see the following reductions :
Let us think of the variables as denoting head , denoting tail , denoting cons-continuation , and denoting nil - continuation .
Thus , we could achieve this goal with the following definitions :
Using the formulating combinators described in Haskell B. Curry 's Combinatory Logic I , we can translate these definitions into combinatory logic without any pain :
Of course we could use the two parameters in the opposite order , but I am not sure yet that it would provide a more easy way .
A little practice : let us define concat .
In Haskell , we can do that by
concat = foldr ( ++ ) [ ]
which corresponds in cominatory logic to reducing
Let us use the ordered pair ( direct product ) construct :
and if I use that nasty ( see later )
Monads in Combinatory Logic ?
Concrete monads
Maybe as a monad
return
Implementing the return monadic method for the Maybe monad is rather straightforward , both in Haskell and CL :
instance Monad Maybe return = Just ...
in Haskell and
in combinatory logic .
map
Haskell :
instance Functor Maybe where map f = maybe Nothing ( Just . f )
- calculus : Expected reductions :
Definition :
Combinatory logic : we expect the same reduction here too
let us get rid of one parameter :
now we have the definition :
bind
Haskell :
instance Monad Maybe ( >>= ) where ( >>= ) f p = maybe Nothing f
- calculus : we expect
achieved by defintion
In combinatory logic the above expected reduction
getting rid of the outest parameter
yielding definition
and of course
But the other way ( starting with a better chosen parameter order ) is much better :
yielding the much simplier and more efficient definition :
We know already that can be seen as as a member of the scheme of tuples : for case .
As the tupe construction is a usual guest at things like this ( we shall meet it at list and other maybe - operations like ) , so us express the above definition with denoted as :
hoping that this will enable us some interesting generalization in the future .
But why we have not made a more brave generalization , and express monadic bind from monadic join and map ?
Later in the list monad , we shall see that it may be better to avoid this for sake of deforestation .
Here a maybe similar problem will appear : the problem of superfluous .
join
We should think of changing the architecture if we suspect that we could avoid and solve the problem with a more simple construct .
The list as a monad
Let us think of our list - operations as implementing monadic methods of the list monad .
We can express this by definitions too , e.g .
we could name
Now let us see mapping a list , concatenating a list , binding a list .
Mapping and binding have a common property : yielding nil for nil .
I shall say these operations are centred : their definition would contain a subexpression .
Thus I shall give a name to this subexpression :
Now let us define map and bind for lists :
now we see it was worth of defining a common .
But to tell the truth , it may be a trap .
breaks a symmetry : we should always define the cons and nil part of the foldr construct on the same level , always together .
Modularization should be pointed towards this direction , and not to run forward into the T - street of .
Another remark : of course we can get the monadic bind for lists
But we used here .
How do we define it ?
It is surprisingly simple .
Let us think how we would define it in Haskell by foldr function , if it was not defined already as ++ defined in Prelude :
In defining
( ++ ) list1 list2
we can do it by foldr :
( ++ ) [ ] list2 = list2 ( ++ ) ( a : as ) list2 = a : ( ++ ) as list2
thus
( ++ ) list1 list2 = foldr ( : ) list2 list1
let us se how we should reduce its corresponding expression in Combinatory Logic :
thus
Thus , we have defined monadic bind for lists .
I shall call this the deforested bind for lists .
Of course , we could define it another way too : by concat and map , which corresponds to defining monadic bind from monadic map and monadic join .
But I think this way forces my CL - interpreter to manage temporary lists , so I gave rather the deforested definition .
Defining the other monadic operation : return for lists is easy :
instance Monad [ ] where return = ( : [ ] )
in Haskell -- we know ,
( : [ ] )
translates to
return = flip ( : ) [ ]
so we can see how to do it in combinatory logic :
How to AOP with monads in Combinatory Logic ?
We have defined monadic list in CL .
Of course we can make monadic Maybe , binary tree , Error monad with direct sum constructs ...
But separation of concerns by monads is more than having a bunch of special monads .
It requires other possibilities too : e.g. being able to use monads generally , which can become any concrete mondads .
Of course my simple CL interpreter does not know anything on type classes , overloading .
But there is a rather restricted andstatic possibility provided by the concept of definition itself :
and later we can change the binding mode named A e.g. from a failure - handling Maybe - like one to a more general indeterminism - handling list - like one , then we can do that simply by replacing definition
with definition
Self - replication , quines , reflective programming
Background
David Madore 's Quines ( self - replicating programs ) and Shin-Cheng Mu's many writings , including a Haskell quine give us wonderful insights on mathematical logic , programming , self - reference .
Wikipedia 's quine page and John Bethencourt 's quine quine .
See also the writings of Raymond Smullyan , Hofstadter , also his current research project on a self - watching cognitive architecture , Manfred Eigen and Ruthild Winkler : Laws of the Game / How the Principles of Nature Govern Chance , and Karl Sigmund 's Games of Life , and Reflective programming ( see Reflection ' 96 and P. Maes & D. Nardi : Meta - Level Architectures and Reflection ) .
G.J. Chaitin especially his Understandable Papers on Incompleteness , especially The Unknowable ( the book is available on this page , just roll the page bellow that big colored photos ) .
The book begins with the limits of mathematics : Gödel 's undecidable , Turing 's uncompatiblity , Chaitin 's randomness ) ; but ( or exactly that 's why ? ) it ends with writing on the future and beuty of science .
I must read Autopoesis and The Tree of Knowledge carefully from Maturana and Varela to say if their topics are releted to here .
See
table of contents in English
annotations on Autopoesis ( in English ) on The Tree of Knowledge ( in Hungarian ) .
To summarize this annotation by citing its main thought :
The intelligence is not a mere map from the outer world : but it is a continuous world - creating , and there are as many worlds as many minds .
Self - replication
Quines : the idea of self - replication can be conveyed by the concept of a program , which is able to print its own list .
But pure - calculus and combinatory logic does not know any notion of printing !
We should like the capture the essence of self - replication , without resorting to the imperative world .
Representation , qoutation -- the DNA
Let us introduce the concept of representing combinatory logic terms .
How could we do that ?
For example , by binary trees .
The leaves should represent the base combinators , and the branches mean application .
And how to represent combintory logic terms -- in combinatory logic itself ?
The first thought could be , that it is not a problem .
Each combinatory logic term could be represented by itself .
Sometimes this idea works .
The huge power of higher order functions is exactly in being able to treat datas programs and vice versa .
Sometimes we are enabled to do things , which could be done in other languages only by carefully designing a representation , a specific language .
But sometimes , representing CL terms by themselves is not enough .
Let us imagine a tutoring program !
Let the topic be combinatory logic , the language of implementation -- combinatory logic , too .
How should the tutoring program ask the pupil questions like :
Tell me if the following two expresions have the same normal form :
The problem is that our program is simply unable to distinguish between CL terms which have the same normal form ( in fact , equivalence cannot be defined generally either ) .
If we represent CL terms by themselves , we simply loose a lot of information , including loosing any possibility to make distinctions between equivalent terms .
We see that there is something that relates to make a distinction between target language and metalanguage ( See Imre Ruzsa , or Haskell B. Curry )
In this example , the distinction is :
We deal with combinatory logic expressions because our program has to teach them : it is related to it just like a vocabulary program is related to English .
But we deal with programming logic expressions because our program is implemented in them .
Just like VIM is related to C ++.
We said CL terms are eventually trees .
Let us represent them with trees then -- now let us think of trees not as of term trees , but as datatypes which we must construct by hand , in a similar way as we defined Maybes , direct sums , direct products , lists .
where let denote the representation of and that of
Let us make a distinction between term trees and datatype trees .
A Haskell example :
many Haskell expressions can be regarded as term trees
but only special Haskell expressions can be seen as datatype trees : those who are constructed from Branch and Leaf in an appropriate way
Similarly ,
all CL expressions can be regarded as term trees .
CL expressions can be regarded as term trees .
but CL expressions which can be revered as datatype trees must obey a huge amount of constraints : they may consist only of subexpressions , , , subexpressions in an approporiate way .
( In fact , all CL expressions can be regarded as datatype trees too : CL is a total thing , we can us each CL expression in a same way as a datatype tree : we can apply it leaf - and branch - continuation arguments .
Something will always happen .
At worst it will diverge -- but lazy trees can diverge too , amd they are inarguably datatype trees .
But now let us ignore all these facts , and let us define the notion of quotations in the restictive way : let the definition require to be structured in a predefined way . )
We use datatype trees for representing other expressions .
Let us call CL expressions which can represent ( another CL expreesion ) quotations .
Quotations are exactly the datatype trees , but
the world refers to their function ,
refers to their function , the world datatype tree refers to their implemetation , structure
This means a datatype tree
is not only a tree regarded only as a term tree ,
but on a higher level : itself a recursive datatype implemented in CL , it is appropiately consisting of , and , subexpressions so that we can reason about it in CL itself
How do quotations relate to all CL expressions ?
In one direction , informally , we could say , quotations make a very proper subset of all CL expressions ( attention : cardinality is the same ! ) .
Not every CL expressions are datatype trees .
But the reverse is not true : all CL expressions can be quoted !
Foreach CL expressionther is a ( unique ) CL expression who quotes it !
We can define a quote function on the set of all CL expressions .
But of it is an conceptually outside function , not a CL combinator itself !
( that is why I do not typest it boldface .
Is it an example of what Curry called epitheory ? ) .
After having solved the representation ( quoting ) problem , we can do many things .
We can define meta-concepts , e.g .
( the notion of same terms ) by bool tree equality ( equivalence made by reduction ) by building a metacircular interpreter
We can write our tutor program too .
But let us discuss more clean and theoretical questions .
Concept of self - replication generalized -- pure functional quines
How can be the concept of quine transferred to combinatory logic ?
In the bellow definition , let us think of
's as actions , programs
's as , programs and 's as quotations , representations
A quine is a CL term this means quines are pure CL concepts , no imperative compromises for whose normal form this means quines are there exists an equivalent CL - term where datatypes in CL arealmost never defined in their normal form ( not even ordered pairs are ! ) .
They save us from loosing information , but they almost never do that literary .
I faced this as problems in nice rewritings when I wanted to implement CL with computer algebra services is a quotation , which manifests itself in the fact that is a datatype tree ( not only term tree ) with boolean leafs , quotes and is exactly the representation of
So a quine is a program which is run , then rewrited as a quotation and so we get the representation of the original program .
Of course the first three requirements can be contracted in two .
Thus , a quine is a CL - term which is equivalent to its own representation ( if we mean representation as treated here ) .
A metacircular interpeter
We have seen that we can represent CL expressions in CL itself , which enables us to do some meta things ( see the into of this section , especially Reflective programming , e.g. Reflection ' 96 ) .
The first idea could be : to implement CL in itself !
Implementing lazy evaluation
The most important subtask to achieve this goal is to implement the algorithm of lazy evaluation .
I confess I simply lack almost any knowledge on algorithms for implementing lazy evaluation .
In my Haskell programs , when they must implement lazy evaluation , I use the following hand - made algorithm .
Functions of increasing number of arguments pass the term tree to each other during analyzing it deaper and deaper .
The functions are eval , apply , curry and lazy , but I renamed curry , because there is also a Prelude function ( and a whole concept behind it ) with the same name .
So I chose Schönfinkel 's name for naming the third function in this scheme -- it can be justified by the fact that Curry himself attributed the idea of currying to Moses Schönfinkel ( but the idea is anticipated by Frege too ) .
module Reduce where import Term import Tree import BaseSym eval :: Term ->
Term eval ( Branch function argument ) = apply function argument eval atom = atom apply :: Term -> Term ->
Term apply ( Branch f a ) b = schonfinkel f a b apply atom argument = strictApply atom argument schonfinkel :: Term -> Term -> Term ->
Term schonfinkel ( Leaf K ) f x = eval f schonfinkel ( Branch f a ) b c = lazy f a b c schonfinkel s a b = strictSchonfinkel s a b lazy :: Term -> Term -> Term -> Term ->
Term lazy ( Leaf S ) c f x = schonfinkel c x ( Branch f x ) lazy k_or_compound x y z = schonfinkel k_or_compound x y ` apply ` z strictApply :: Term -> Term ->
Term strictApply f a = f ` Branch ` eval a strictSchonfinkel :: Term -> Term -> Term ->
Term strictSchonfinkel f a b = strictApply f a ` strictApply ` b
module Term where import BaseSym import Tree type Term = Tree BaseSym type TermV = Tree ( Either BaseSym Var )
module
Tree where data
Tree a = Leaf a | Branch ( Tree a ) ( Tree a )
module BaseSym where data BaseSym = K | S type Var = String
and it seems hard to me hard to implement in CL .
Almost all of these functions are mutual recursive definitions , and it looks hard for me to formulate the fixpont .
Of coure I could find another algorithm .
The main problem is that reducing CL trees is not so simple : the rule requires lookahead in 2 levels .
Maybe once I find another one with monads , arrows , or attribute grammars ...
A lightweight CL implementation
I mean
instead of writing a CL interpreter ( or compiler ) with a huge amount of command - line arguments and colon - escaped prompt commands ,
why not to write a lightweight library ?
( Lightweight in the sense as Parsec is lightweight in comparison to parser generators , or QuickCheck is lightweight ) .
This latter framework can contain the previous one e.g. by implementing
interpreter :: IO ( ) compiler :: Term ->
Haskell
where Haskell can be a string , an appropriately designed abstract datatype , a rose tree or a Template Haskell term representation of Haskell expressions , thus any way used in Haskell metaprogramming ( in the picture below , does it correspond to ? ) .
So , the latter can contain the former , but what are the new advantages ?
abstract :: Var -> TermV -> Maybe Term abstractV :: Var -> TermV ->
TermV rewrite :: Term ->
Reader Definitions ( Tree ( Either NonVar Definiendum ) )
where type Definitions = Map Definiendum Term .
So we can get compiler algebra and other useful services in a modular way .
Of course also an interpreter can yield useful services , but as the user interface grows , it develops to have a command language , which is in most cases imperative having less gluing possibilities than being able to use Haskell itself by this lightweight approach .
In fact , it the was the quines ( mentioned above ) that forced me to think of a lightweight CL library instead of an interpreter .
Writing a CL quine ( in the way I can do ) requires a lot of : quoting CL terms in CL itself .
But quoting CL can not be done in CL ( only : quoting - the - quotation - of - CL - further can be done in CL ) , so my CL quine plans needed a lot of work quoting CL terms by hand .
A lightweight CL library could do this job by using the power of Haskell ( quoting CL terms can be done in Haskell , or more generally said : in the ultimate implementating language of this CL - project ) .
The quotation stratification of subsequent series of meta- and object languages :
the ultimate implementing language of thus CL project ( here Haskell ) combinatory logic , its terms being represented by Haskell binary tree abstract datatype .
combinatory logic , its terms being represented by combinatory logic binary tree abstract datatype .
We have already seen that we can define lists in combinatory logic by catamorhisms , so we can define binary trees too .
And we can represent the base combinators by booleans which can be defined too in CL .
So we can quote each CL term in CL itself .
...
Quoting :
Invoking :
--
Yet we do not require type safety in quotation stratification of CL terms : type Term1 = Term type Term2 = Term type Term3 = Term -- ... quote '0 :: Term1 -> Term2 quote ' 1_0 :: Term2 -> Term3 -- ... --
At or beyond the depth of quote ' 1 -- these functions can be implemented in CL too -- more generally : everyhing can be made at a higher level too , -- but not vice versa .
So everyhing has a grad --
We index things by this grad -- Ultimate implementing language ( here : Haskell ) is designed by grad 0 -- Unavailable grad is designed by minus infinity -- ( see the analogy of grad of polinomials ) quote ' 1 :: Term1 quote ' 2_1 :: Term1 quote ' 2 :: Term2
Illative combinatory logic
Henk Barendregt , Martin Bunder , Wil Dekkers : Systems of Illative Combinatory Logic complete for first - order propositional and predicate calculus .
I think combinator can be thought of as something analogous to Dependent type : it seems to me that the dependent type construct of Epigram corresponds to in Illative Combinatory Logic .
I think e.g. the followings should correspond to each other :
My dream is making something in Illative Combinatory Logic .
Maybe it could be theoretical base for a functional logic language ?

Israel recently put out a tender for new homes in Har Homa

The two sides agreed at a peace conference in Annapolis in the US in late November to revive the 2003 peace plan known as the roadmap .
According to the plan , Israel must halt all settlement activity and the Palestinians must rein in militants .

The Israeli government has argued that the new homes in Har Homa are part of plans drawn up seven years ago , and that the area - known in Arabic as Abu Ghneim - was in any case not covered by the roadmap .
Thousands of people live in Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem which are expected to remain in Israeli hands under any final peace settlement .

WASHINGTON — When the National Guard helicoptered her husband , Mark , to Staten Island to work as a wireless technician setting up a communications network for thousands of emergency workers who were descending upon Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11 , 2001 , Jeanmarie DeBiase did not know this would begin the unraveling .
She would not realize it until Jan. 8 , 2006 — her birthday — when , during a family celebration , Mark broke down in tears .
“ He sat at my dining room table crying that there was something wrong , that he did n’t want to die , ” DeBiase recalled in an interview from her home in Jackson , N.J .
Her husband , who worked at the landfill where debris from the fallen World Trade Center was dumped , had suffered a cold for a few days — nothing serious , it seemed .
He was a vigorous man of 41 , an exercise aficionado who was so careful about his diet that his wife packed his lunch every day .
Yet that night at dinner , he sobbed that he wanted to watch his young sons grow up , to play ball with them , to know his grandchildren .
The initial diagnosis was pneumonia , but Mark failed to respond to antibiotics ; lung X - rays could not confirm any diagnosis at all .
“ There was so much stuff in his lungs I do n’t think they could pinpoint anything , ” Jeanmarie says .
“ They really did n’t know how to treat it . ”
Visits to the prestigious Deborah Heart and Lung Center did not bring hope .
Mark DeBiase died on April 9 , 2006 , in Philadelphia , while awaiting a double lung transplant .
“ A lot more illness and death is going to come out of this , ” says his widow , who is supporting her three sons on about $ 3,400 a month in Social Security survivors ’ benefits .
Health insurance , still provided by Mark ’s employer , the wireless company Cingular , cost $ 64 a month during the first year after her husband ’s death .
In May , the monthly premium rose to $ 394 .
DeBiase considers herself fortunate — she has supportive family and friends , and access to health insurance .
She has filed a worker ’s compensation claim under a New York state program for workers who were consistently exposed to health hazards in the days and months after the Twin Towers collapsed in a poisonous concoction of dust , burning fuel , chemicals and metals .
The contents and lethality of the toxic stew still are n’t entirely known .
Typically , employers fight the claims , lawyers say .
And typically , a claim takes one to two years to wind through the bureaucracy .
The country says it will always remember 9/11 .
Few politicians miss the chance to appear at this or that commemorative service .
Perhaps it is true we have not forgotten those who died that day .
But we have abandoned those who are dying now .
Thousands of construction workers , janitors , communications specialists , food - cart vendors and others who worked amid the noxious fumes for weeks or months — removing debris not only from Ground Zero but from the office buildings that still stood , reviving communications , feeding and providing aid to those who toiled — are sick with lung disease and all manner of rare cancers , according to various health officials .
An expert panel created by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg concluded that as many as 410,000 people faced sufficient exposure to health hazards that they could become ill .
About 59 percent of those screened at a city center for patients suffering from World Trade Center - related illnesses are uninsured .
The majority have incomes of less than $ 15,000 a year .
Even at a screening center run by Mount Sinai Medical Center for “ first responders ” — an elite group among those who are turning up sick — an estimated 40 percent lack insurance .
New York politicians have persistently pursued more federal involvement and funding .
The federal government has perennially rebuffed them .
Here is one measure :
After federal health authorities involved in monitoring and treatment of World Trade Center emergency responders estimated they would need $ 283 million a year to run the program , President Bush ’s budget allocated $ 25 million .
Rep. Jerrold Nadler , D - N.Y. , whose district encompasses Ground Zero , and other New York lawmakers used the sixth anniversary of the attack to introduce legislation to require health monitoring and care for all those who are sick from exposure to what may be the most serious environmental catastrophe in the nation ’s history .
Yes , it would be an “ entitlement . ”
And yes , it would be costly — certainly more expensive than a ribbon of remembrance .
It would , at last , require the country to come to grips with the knowledge that the official toll of 2,750 from the World Trade Center attack is n’t the final death count .
It ’s only the first .

It has emerged that Woo Suk Hwang , the South Korean scientist who was named and shamed for faking his research , made an amazing breakthrough .
According to Cell Stem Cell , he may have managed to create stem cells solely from human eggs , without fertilization with sperm .
This breakthrough is possibly much more valuable than his original false claims about his work .
Hwang ’s work at Seoul National University was famous worldwide – he became a national hero and possibly the most esteemed stem cell scientist in the world .
In 2005 , his status came crumbling down when it was revealed he had faked much of his claims .
He had said that he and his team created cloned human embryos by putting a cell ’s nucleus into an empty human egg , and then used the stem cells for those embryos .
It was later found that the embryos had originated from the eggs of female members of his laboratory team – in other words , not from cloned embryos .
He was fired and then charged with fraud and misappropriation of funds ( embezzlement ) .
Recently , researchers from Harvard Stem Cell Institute , led by Dr George Daley , examined his research again and determined that the cells came from a another type of embryo .
The scientists say it is well possible that Hwang and team had managed to pull off the world ’s first human case of parthenogenesis , or ‘ virgin birth ’ .
( Parthenogenesis =
When an egg is stimulated into becoming an embryo without sperm fertilization taking place . )
Parthenogenesis has been done with animals , but never with humans where the embryo survived long enough to get viable stem cells from it .
Dr George Daley told the BBC “ Unfortunately at the time they published their work they did not know what they had done so they had mistakenly isolated these parthenogenic embryonic stem cells , and yet misrepresented them as true clones .
In fact they had produced the world ’s first patient - specific embryonic stem cell , and that is very valuable .
Scientists interested in modelling complex diseases would like to be able to move a patient ’s own cells into a petri dish in their embryonic form . ”

In the United States of America , the greatest country in the world , as many as three and a half million people experience homelessness in a given year ( 1 % of the entire US population or 10 % of its poor ) and of that , 1.37 million ( or 39 % ) are children under the age of 18 .
The total number of billionaires in the world is 793 with 371 of them being in the United States of America , that ’s about 322 more than there were 20 years ago .
If it can be said that people with money and power run the world , then 1 % of America ’s wealthiest and most powerful run America behind a façade of democracy .
The façade is coming apart and the true nature of this government is plain to see .
After four years of a useless war , costing Americans their lives and treasure , and enriching the multitude of corporate entities slurping up billions at the Iraqi trough , we have allowed the new robber barons , Bush and his crony capitalist friends to continue conning us out of house and home , our country .
Our constitution is in shreds and our economy is about to crash .
Do n’t let any of the Wall Street freaks try to fool you .
They ’re as scared as we are .
What happens when an economic system reaches the end of its days ; when purchasing power dries up and workers can no longer buy the products they produce ?
When Capitalism still had some vigor , Henry Ford said he would price his cars so that his workers could afford to buy them .
Do you find that kind of insight in Corporate America today ?
Not on your life !
First , they break the unions and then they outsource their high - paying manufacturing jobs .
It ’s a race to the bottom .
Go to wherever the lowest wages can be found .
All we get to hear is that giant sucking sound that Ross Perot talked about when he was running for president – American good paying jobs and manufacturing plants leaving the country .
Let ’s call it “ globalization ” .
Some economists , like Milton Friedman , seem to think it ’s a good thing .
I hate to sound like an old - time Trotskyite , but I ’m beginning to believe now that our political and economic system will have to get worse , before it can get better .
We ’re going to have to take some “ shock and awe ” in this country to knock some of the lethargy out of our citizens , brainwashed by the corporate media .
And it ’s not just the media .
The almost deliberate act of dumbing down the populous has been built into the fabric of society — from public education to academia to computer games to radio and television talk shows .
To keep the sheep compliant , I presume .
When was the last time you heard the labor theories of value or the theory of surplus value discussed anywhere in the public media ?
They ’d rather give us Brittany Spears and O.J. Simpson .
You would n’t know , from what you learned in school or read in the papers , that Franklin D Roosevelt , when he became president in the depth of the depression in 1933 , saved capitalism by providing a “ safety net ” for the millions of destitute Americans .
He did it with the NRA , WPA .
TWA , CCC , AAA , Social Security and other “ socialist - like ” programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children .
So where have all the alphabets gone — along with the flowers of the “ new left ” of the 1960s ?
We thought they ’d re-descend in the 1990s , but they have n’t shown up yet .
So I think it ’s a matter of taking matters into our own hands .
We have a line - up of presidential candidates , Republicans and Democrats , most of them in the pockets of corporate interests , who will take us back to the same old stand , except , perhaps for Republican Ron Paul and Democrat Dennis Kucinich .
But they have already been ruled out of the running because they have something helpful to say to the American people .
Not allowed .
Now , Democratic candidate , Joe Biden , has just announced that he will move to impeach President Bush if he bombs Iran .
Is n’t that courageous !
Does n’t Joe have enough evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors right now and has n’t he had them for the last three or four years ; enough to move those proceedings from the Senate which he ca n’t because impeachment must originate in the House of Representatives ?
Joe must know that .
But he needs something to grandstand on while running for president .
This is typical of the kind of tactics candidates like to use in futzing with the minds of the voters .
It appears that our system is heading into the perfect storm .
With the sub - prime mortgage disaster , a dismal forecast in consumer spending , the maxing out of credit cards and the Fed fighting the credit crunch , can a recession be far behind ?
We might be lucky if it ’s only a recession .
We could get the kind of economic collapse that would make the last depression look like a tea party .
With friends like China , who needs enemies ?
We ’ve fought this Iraqi war ( which we ’re still fighting ) on the cuff — about two trillion dollars worth .
China , a prime creditor , could call in some of this debt if they wanted to be mean .
Bush would like to get our minds off Iraq by attacking Iran .
That way , he could get one more war under his belt .
Go get him , Joe Biden !
Meanwhile , we wander around aimlessly , homeless in paradise , waiting for the other shoe to drop .

When the local racing board changed their drug testing policies , Adam Negrusz and his
colleagues from the University of Illinois at Chicago had the unenviable task of checking for cocaine
in almost twenty thousand horse urine samples .
In theory , coke could make a thoroughbred less prone to fatigue , which would allow it to run faster in
the last stretch .
To prevent horse racing from becoming a drugfest like the the Tour de France ,
overseers collect urine samples from the winners , perform rigorous drug tests , and issue fines when
they catch a cheater .
After several horses unexpectedly tested positive for tiny amounts of benzoylecgonine , a byproduct of
cocaine , researchers found that animals can unintentionally come into contact with
the widespread narcotic .
To be fair , officials decided to tweak the rules a bit .
If a horse is caught with a low levels of the cocaine byproduct , the owners will pay a small fine .
For
higher amounts ( 150 ng / mL if you are curious ) , the penalty can be significantly stiffer .
Since the new
policy requires a precise numerical measurement , and standard test kits only give a yes or no
answer , someone would need to develop an entirely new method for screening large amounts of
equine fluid .
This is where Negrusz came to the rescue .
He and his team tested a laboratory
procedure for measuring the amount of benzoylecgonine in horse urine .
Over the course
of three weeks , they used a Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometer to check
19,315 tubes of the unpleasant bodily fluid .
Those samples were gathered from four race tracks in the Chicago area over the course of two years .
Only 28 of them contained even slight amounts of the drug
byproduct , none exceeded the threshold .
Corresponding with the journal Forensic Science International , Negrusz and his group published a full report of their work .
It is already available online and will be printed in a wee bit .
Special Report : Peak Oil Yes ,
We 're in Peak Oil Today
The collapse of the sprawl land use and transportation model does not lie far in some hypothetical future , but right around the corner .
By Ryan McGreal
Published October 22 , 2007
On August 22 , 2005 , I wrote an article asking whether the world was in peak oil .
In my first paragraph I answered , " It 's too early to tell , although the market does show signs of being close to an absolute production limit . "
A little over two years later , I think it 's prudent , today , to change the answer to a provisional yes .
Consider the evidence : The US Energy Information Agency just released its September 2007 International Petroleum Monthly Report [ XLS link ] , and the overall production in barrels per day ( bpd ) has been flat for the past three years .
Global Daily Oil Production by Month , 2001 - 2007 ( Source Data : EIA )
A closer look at total production reveals the flattening trend since mid-2004 , as output has bounced off a firm 85 million bpd production barrier .
Total Daily Oil Production by Month , 2001 - 2007 ( Source Data : EIA )
As oil prices edge up toward $ 100 per barrel , remember these charts when analysts emphasize political instability or pundits excoriate ' fat cat ' oil companies .
The real issue is what appears to be a hard global limit to the rate of production .
In response to this and other sources or data , the Energy Watch Group has just published its own crude oil supply outlook [ PDF link ] for October 2007 , which makes a strong case that peak oil has arrived :
The major result from this analysis is that world oil production has peaked in 2006 .
Production will start to decline at a rate of several percent per year .
By 2020 , and even more by 2030 , global oil supply will be dramatically lower .
This will create a supply gap which can hardly be closed by growing contributions from other fossil , nuclear or alternative energy sources in this time frame .
Challenging the rosy , cornucopian forecasts of the EIA , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , and other groups with a strong , evidence based analysis , the EWG report predicts that oil production will start to fall by seven percent a year .
This is consistent with many other independent analyses from geologists and economists who do n't have a vested interest in reassuring consumers that all will be well .
It 's also consistent with the report Richard Gilbert presented to Hamilton City Council in 2006 , entitled , Hamilton : The Electric City , in which he projected that gasoline prices have a better than 50 percent chance of reaching $ 4 per litre within twelve years and recommended that Hamilton make energy production and conservation its economic Plan A .
( See the Raise the Hammer Special Report on Gilbert 's essay and presentation to council . )
In particular , Gilbert recommended :
Changing the mix of private vehicles and transit , with a strong emphasis on energy - efficient light rail transit , as well as bicycle lanes , smart commuting , and teleworking ;
Enabling and encouraging a new industry that specializes in retrofitting existing buildings to be more energy efficient and to produce some of their own energy ( via wind turbines , solar panels , and micro- hydroelectric ) ;
Transforming Hamilton 's land use priorities to emphasize brownfield development , intensification , mixed uses , vibrant centres , and low energy transport .
In response , in April 2006 City Council asked staff to prepare a report on ways to reduce energy use .
The report was due in June 2007 , but Citizens at City Hall ( CATCH ) reports that it still has n't been completed .
This is arguably the single most important issue City Council and city staff should be working on .
The sooner Hamilton prepares for the skyrocketing energy prices on the way , the better chance we 'll have to weather the storm and create new growth industries in such a critical field .
Instead , our planning departments are still stuck in greenfield development and aerotropolis - warehousing and logistics around the airport , with transit a low priority .
In a major study conducted for the US Department of Defense in 2005 , Dr. Robert L. Hirsch et al. noted :
Without timely mitigation , world supply / demand balance will be achieved through massive demand destruction ( shortages ) , accompanied by huge oil price increases , both of which would create a long period of significant economic hardship worldwide .
We can no longer afford the luxury of assuming we can continue to build out and live the suburban sprawl dream indefinitely .
The collapse of that land use and transportation model does not lie far in some hypothetical future , but right around the corner .
The sooner we cop to this reality , the better our chances .
Unfortunately , too many people who ought to know better are still stuck in delusional notions about how best to plan for the future .
Ryan McGreal , the editor of Raise the Hammer , lives in Hamilton with his family and works as a programmer , writer and consultant .
Ryan volunteers with Hamilton Light Rail , a citizen group dedicated to bringing light rail transit to Hamilton .
Ryan wrote a city affairs column in Hamilton Magazine , and several of his articles have been published in the Hamilton Spectator .

CAIRO , Egypt —
In a victory for religious freedom , a lower administrative court here today ruled in favor of two lawsuits that sought to resolve the government 's contradictory policy on religious affiliation and identification papers .
The Court of Administrative Justice in Cairo upheld arguments made in two cases concerning Baha 'is who have sought to restore their full citizenship rights by asking that they be allowed to leave the religious affiliation field blank on official documents .
" Given the degree to which issues of religious freedom stand at the heart of human rights issues in the Middle East , the world should cheer at the decision in these two cases today , " said Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations .
" The compromise offered by the Baha 'is in these two cases opens the door to a way to reconcile a government policy that was clearly incompatible with international law -- as well as common sense , " said Ms. Dugal .
" Our hope now is that the government will quickly implement the court 's decision and allow Baha 'is once again to enjoy the full rights of citizenship to which they are duly entitled , " said Ms. Dugal .
The decisions today concerned two cases , both filed by Baha 'is , over the issue of how they are to be identified on government documents .
The first case involves a lawsuit by the father of twin children , who is seeking to obtain proper birth certificates for them .
The second concerns a college student , who needs a national identity card to re-enroll in university .
The government requires all identification papers to list religious affiliation but restricts the choice to the three officially recognized religions -- Islam , Christianity , and Judaism .
Baha 'is are thus unable to obtain identification papers because they refuse to lie about their religious affiliation .
Without national identify cards -- or , as in the case of the twin children , birth certificates -- Baha 'is and others caught in the law 's contradictory requirements are deprived of a wide range of citizenship rights , such as access to employment , education , and medical and financial services .
These problems were highlighted in a report issued in November by Human Rights Watch and the Cairo - based Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( EIPR ) .
" Employers , both public and private , by law cannot hire someone without an ID , and academic institutions require IDs for admission , " said the report .
" Obtaining a marriage license or a passport requires a birth certificate ; inheritance , pensions , and death benefits are contingent on death certificates .
The Ministry of Health has even refused to provide immunizations to some Baha 'i children because the Interior Ministry would not issue them birth certificates accurately listing their Baha'i religion . "
The issuance of birth certificates is at the heart of the first case , which concerns 14 - year - old twins Imad and Nancy Rauf Hindi .
Their father , Rauf Hindi , obtained birth certificates that recognized their Baha'i affiliation when they were born .
But new policies require computer generated certificates , and the computer system locks out any religious affiliation but the three officially recognized religions .
And without birth certificates , the children are unable to enroll in school in Egypt .
The second lawsuit was filed by the EIPR last February on behalf of 18 - year - old Hussein Hosni Bakhit Abdel - Massih , who was suspended from the Suez Canal University 's Higher Institute of Social Work in January 2006 due to his inability to obtain an identity card because of his refusal to falsely identify himself as either a Muslim , a Christian , or a Jew .
In both cases , lawyers representing the Baha 'is have made it clear that they were willing to settle for cards or documents on which the religious affiliation field is left blank or filled in , perhaps , as " other . "
This solution is what makes these two cases different from the lawsuit that was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court last year .
In that ruling , the Supreme Administrative Court rejected a decision by the lower that upheld the right of Baha 'is to be properly identified on government documents .

Jeff Atwood has just posted an interesting article , Hashtables , Pigeonholes , and Birthdays .
Hash Tables are a very interesting subject , you can take almost any aspect of them and follow it down interesting trails .
For example : Performance : Quantifying the performance of a data structure like a Hash Table is interesting .
There are measures like Amortized Cost as well as Worst Case Cost .
This subject is one of the core themes of the book Purely Functional Data Structures .
( You can also download the author ’s thesis on the same subject ) I recommend it whether you have an interest in “ purely functional ” programming or not : “ purely functional ” data structures provide all of the imperative and side - effect oriented operations you know and love — like insertions and removals — while also providing the foundations for highly concurrent environments like threads with shared memory .
Security : One - way functions are strongly related to hash functions .
They are the foundation for many of today ’s security and secrecy protocols .
For example , fingerprinting is used to allow mirror sites to host downloads while giving the public comfort that the downloads have not been compromised with Malware .
However , if the one - way functions underlying them can be cracked — as MD5 was recently — miscreants can substitute bad files for good at will .
Even when security does not appear to be a factor , compromising a hash function can have a security impact .
As one person mentioned in one of Jeff ’s comments , if the hash function for a programming language is public , attackers can deliberately engineer worst - case performance to create a Denial Of Service attack .
Here ’s a deliberately trivialized example : Consider a public - facing site with free user registration .
When you log in , the site performs a look up on the user name .
Now obviously there ’s a database somewhere .
But perhaps the programmers put a cache in front of it .
You could imagine such a cache being useful if cookies are used to keep someone logged in .
If the cache uses a hash table , a vandal can create lots and lots of user names that hash into the same bucket .
Anyone with a user name in the same bucket will face a long wait as the system performs a serial look up within the bucket .
Whimsey :
One of the comments mentioned that the number of buckets is usually a prime number .
Did you know that insects figured this strategy out on their own ?
Editorial / Love Fest : And now for what I really wanted to say .
People have pointed out that Jeff often seems to be summarizing well - known computer science principles .
A Reader ’s Digest for programmers , as it were .
The suggestion seems to be that this is not useful , since anybody with a degree or even a passing interest in programming ought to know these things .
My own feeling is that Jeff ’s blog is far more useful than my own .
Coding Horror is published out in the real world .
It is written for real people .
This weblog operates firmly in Lake Wobegon .
It ’s true !
The very fact that you are reading about programming means that you are exceptional for reading it and I am exceptional for writing it .
I am not going to start a flame war and say you and I are better programmers .
Who really knows ?
But I am very confident when I say that we are not representative of the typical programmer .
The typical programmer does not know what a closure is and does not care .
If they are added to Java he or she will not use them any ways .
The typical programmer may have obtained their degree , but they were far more interested in memorizing whatever was needed to get a B on the examination then they were in the subject matter .
They may have a certification , but they do not own and have not read books outside of their immediate requirements , so Knuth is foreign to them .
While they may talk of refactoring , they have never heard of Martin Fowler or Joshua Kerievsky
When Jeff writes a Digg - able post about multiple monitors , or how to optimize memory on a Windows PC , he get readers that would never subscribe to a blog if they were told it was about programming .
And I am talking about programmers .
Try to wrap your head around the idea of programmers who do not find programming blogs interesting ( in fact , they do n’t find programming interesting at the moment ) .
If they are then exposed to something insightful and interesting about hash tables …
Many will read it and forget it , but a few will be interested enough to delve deeper into the whys behind the whats .
I am all for that .
It is remarkably easy to turn and preach to the choir .
Evangelizing to the bored and uninterested …
This is a frustrating and difficult job .
I wish I had the zeal to reach out across the divide and bring people over to where programming is deeply fulfilling and fascinating .
I ’m glad Jeff is doing the job he ’s doing and wish his blog every success .
With Void in Climate Leadership , Kerry

The man behind the violently pornographic website linked to the murder of teacher Jane Longhurst is still making his sickening films - in a Milton Keynes flat .
Four years ago , The Mail on Sunday effectively shut down a grotesque site which sold images of " extreme pain , asphyxiation and forced sex " , after it drove pervert Graham Coutts to rape and strangle the special - needs teacher .
Scroll down for more ...
But today we can reveal that wealthy Dutchman Frans van der Hulst is still peddling his " snuff " images on the internet , churning out sick footage for thousands of subscribers .
We also discovered the Milton Keynes flat where he illegally shoots some of his films , which could land him with a three - year prison term .
But when confronted by The Mail on Sunday , Van der Hulst remained unrepentant about his vile activities .
This newspaper previously shut down his website hangingbitches.com , after lobbying the companies that allowed him to accept credit - card payments .
Coutts had logged on to the site , which featured an image of a screaming woman with a clear plastic bag pulled tightly over her head on its homepage , the day before killing 31 - year - old Miss Longhurst .
Scroll down for more ...
However Van der Hulst continues to operate a raft of similar sites , charging subscribers £ 25 a month to view pornographic images of asphyxiation , strangulation and hanging .
The introduction on one site boasts that the footage is all made by Van der Hulst 's own company , 3 Fall Productions .
It says : " We have exclusive breath control play action .
Also we show BDSM [ bondage , discipline , dominance and submission ] and ropeworks .
Not the same old material you will see on every site , but fresh and exclusive material made by ourselves . "
One of the British models paid £ 350 a day to act out the sick fantasies said : " One of the reasons why Van der Hulst films here in the UK is because he has so many subscribers here - and models here are prepared to do the work . "
Scroll down for more ...
One site alone has more than 3,000 members , according to an insider at the internet service provider .
" That adds up to a lot of money , " the model added .
" But the downside is that they want more and more new footage .
That is why they are churning this stuff out every couple of weeks . "
The venue for the UK filming is an £ 180,000 luxury flat on the eighth floor of the trendy Hub development in the centre of Milton Keynes , just a few hundred yards from a police station .
It is rented from a local businesswoman by 23 - yearold glamour model Faye Pilgrim .
Scroll down for more ...
Last week the Southampton - born brunette , who also stars in some of the films , showed an undercover reporter around the flat , which is up for rent .
In one video shot in the apartment last December , entitled Xmas Special , Ms Pilgrim simulates dying with a noose placed around her neck , her face screwed up in pain .
Another shows her with an axe pretending to decapitate another model .
Van der Hulst , 54 , also appears in the movie , acting out the shooting of various naked women with pistols .
Ms Pilgrim did not dispute taking part in the filming , but said she was unaware that a similar website run by Rotterdam - born Van der Hulst had been linked to the murder of Jane Longhurst .
When we confronted Van der Hulst in his Netherlands home yesterday , he said : " Once again my business is legal .
" Just because it is not morally acceptable to you does not mean it is illegal or criminal . "
However , after we spoke to him , the father of two abruptly closed down the site containing the Milton Keynes footage to new members .
And despite his insistence that he was doing nothing illegal , Van der Hulst pointedly refused to answer questions about the footage shot in Milton Keynes .
His silence may be because filming such scenes in the UK contravenes the Obscene Publications Act .
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said that distributing or producing the violent pornography is illegal in Britain .
Van der
Hulst is making a fortune from his sites , which are run from the United States , Spain and Holland .
He owns a villa and a beach apartment in Gran Canaria , as well as a house in Holland .
He drives a £ 25,000 Toyota Land Cruiser , and his wife Wilhelmina Jacoba - who is listed as the sole official of 3 F all Productions - owns a sports car .
When we confronted Van der Hulst in 2004 , he showed the same lack of remorse over the fact that Graham Coutts had visited his site hours before killing Miss Longhurst .
He said then : " I 've read all the criticism but I 'm doing nothing illegal .
" Asphyxiation existed long before the internet , and asphyxiation websites were going long before Jane Longhurst 's murder .
I do n't feel responsible for what happened to her . "
At the time the Government said it was powerless to stop sites such as hangingbitches.com .
However , The Mail on Sunday successfully lobbied payment services Visa and PayPal to suspend Van der Hulst 's account - cutting off his cash supply and effectively shutting down the site .
However , his current sites are made possible by Visa Europe and Mastercard allowing their cardholders to pay for the vile images .
When alerted to the situation , both companies spoke of their commitment to stamping out " illegal activity " but then did nothing about stopping Van der Hulst .
The Visa Europe spokesman said : " We work tirelessly to ensure that our credit cards can not be used for illegal purposes .
" If we are made aware of any such allegations we will investigate and if the allegations are substantiated we will stop the merchant 's ability to accept Visa and pass details to law enforcement authorities .
" However Visa does not act as a moral arbiter and if an activity is legal in a given country then merchants will be able to accept our credit cards . "
A Mastercard spokesman said : " We take our responsibility as a corporate citizen very seriously .
" The company does not tolerate the use of its programmes and services for any illegal activities , including the purchase and sale of illegal activities , including illegal pornography . "
Van der Hulst uses two American - based companies to process his credit - card payments - Netcash.com and Webstream.net .
Neither responded to a request for comment .
Yesterday , the mother of murdered Jane Longhurst spoke of her shock and disappointment that Van der Hulst was still in business - and operating in the UK .
" You always imagine that the girls who agree to appear in these films live abroad and are desperately in need of money , " said 76 - year - old Liz Longhurst .
" To hear that it 's girls here is quite sickening . "
Mrs Longhurst has been campaigning for a change in the law that would make downloading violent pornography punishable by up to three years in prison .
A Bill to achieve this is currently going through the House of Lords .
Police found the burning body of her daughter in woods near Pulborough , West Sussex , in April 2003 , four weeks after her boyfriend had reported her missing .
It later emerged that the 31 - year - old was murdered by Graham Coutts , the partner of Jane 's close friend Lisa Stephens .
He was jailed for a minimum of 30 years after killing the talented violinist in his flat in Hove and then having sex with her .
Coutts kept Jane 's body for a month , at times in a storage unit he had hired under a false name , visiting it every few days until staff there became suspicious of a pungent smell .
At Lewes Crown Court , prosecutor John Kelsey - Fry QC said Coutts was " satisfying a bizarre and macabre sexual fantasy .
. . [ acting ] out for real on the unfortunate Jane Longhurst the fantasies he had fuelled on his computer - the strangling , the killing and the raping . "
Mrs Longhurst said : " The new law will make it an offence for people to download these images but unfortunately no one has come up with a means to force the credit - card companies to behave more responsibly and refuse these people the means to operate .
" A police officer told me it would probably take someone else to be murdered because of violent pornography on the internet for society to get the message - I think that says it all . "
Last night MPs Martin Salter and David Lepper , who have campaigned for the new laws against downloading violent pornography , demanded action against Van der Hulst .
" We have laws against people peddling this sort of filth here and they must be applied , " said Mr Salter .
Mr Lepper added : " I will be certainly pressing for the full power of the law to be applied following The Mail on Sunday 's investigation .
" If these despicable films are being made here then those behind them must be stopped . "
The Mail on Sunday is making its evidence on Van der Hulst available to Thames Valley Police .

CHARLIE RANGEL is an old - time Harlem Democrat .
His slicked - back hair , dapper suits and pocket handkerchiefs recall the age of the 77 - year - old congressman 's youth .
But on Thursday October 25th the chairman of the tax - writing committee in the House of Representatives showed he had a modernising side .
Mr Rangel proposed an overhaul of the American tax code that he claims would simplify the collection of taxes .
The bill may not be the “ mother of all tax reforms ” as Mr Rangel reckons .
But neither is it entirely modest .
It is unlikely to make it into law during the remainder of George Bush 's term as president , but it may set the terms of the debate after the election next year , especially if a Democrat is elected .
The main impetus for reform of America 's mammoth , complicated and costly tax code is the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) .
Conceived as a way of making sure that rich people did not find so many loopholes that they paid no tax at all , the AMT has begun to apply to more and more middle - income families .
This is a problem for both Republican and Democrat lawmakers .
For several years politicians have preferred a temporary fix rather than wholesale reform .
Mr Rangel 's bill would do away with the tax entirely — a costly change .
To make up for it , he would raise taxes on couples making more than $ 200,000 a year .
The other headline - grabbing revenue - raiser is a change in the way private - equity managers are taxed .
Most of their income comes from “ carried interest ” , a share of a fund 's profits paid to partners , and is taxed at the capital - gains rate of 15 % .
This is proving too tempting for revenue - raisers , especially Democratic ones : the private - equity zillionaire paying a lower rate of tax than ordinary working folk .
Under Mr Rangel 's plan , carried interest would be taxed as income .
Other elements of the tax bill would include a bigger standard deduction , which would mostly help middle - class families and an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit , essentially a tax rebate for poorer workers .
The EITC mostly goes to working single parents with children ; Mr Rangel would extend it to the working poor without kids .
One part of the bill that Republicans might like is a reduction in the corporate - tax rate .
America 's corporate taxes are unusually high for the rich world , at 35 % .
The bill proposes cutting the rate to 30.5 % while closing various loopholes to make up the shortfall .
But these subsidies are mainly used by American multinationals with foreign subsidiaries .
Objections will be vociferous .
But even Hank Paulson , Mr Bush 's treasury secretary , agrees with the idea of lowering rates while broadening the tax base .
Republicans , including Mr Paulson , have denounced other parts of the bill strenuously .
Mr Rangel says the bill will raise the same amount of money as the current system , and 90 m Americans will get a tax cut .
But the treasury secretary says it will “ hinder America 's ability to compete in the global economy ” .
John Boehner , the Republican leader in the House , called it “ the mother of all tax hikes . ”
Republican presidential candidates have jumped to criticise the bill as well .
Mr Rangel has said he does not expect a vote on the bill this year .
As a complete package , it is unlikely to pass before 2009 and Mr Bush would almost certainly veto it anyway .
And the Senate ( closely divided between the parties ) is cagey .
After a new president takes office in 2009 , though , the picture changes .
Len Burman of the Urban Institute , a think - tank , says it may be “ the baby of all tax reforms ” , which could grow into an adult .
A Democrat would probably support many of the ideas .
Even Republicans agree that a change is needed .
The AMT will not fix itself and , for all its ills , it is forcing America 's politicians to think about a long overdue revamp of the tax system .

Bruce Schneier Blazes Through Your Questions
Last week , we solicited your questions for Internet security guru Bruce Schneier .
He responded in force , taking on nearly every question , and his answers are extraordinarily interesting , providing mandatory reading for anyone who uses a computer .
He also plainly thinks like an economist : search below for “ crime pays ” to see his sober assessment of why it ’s better to earn a living as a security expert than as a computer criminal .
Thanks to Bruce and to all of you for participating .
Here ’s a note that Bruce attached at the top of his answers : “ Thank you all for your questions .
In many cases , I ’ve written longer essays on the topics you ’ve asked about .
In those cases , I ’ve embedded the links into the necessarily short answers I ’ve given here . ”
Q : Assuming we are both still here in 50 years , what do you believe will be the most incredible , fantastic , mind - blowing advance in computers / technology at that time ?
A : Fifty years is a long time .
In 1957 , fifty years ago , there were fewer than 2,000 computers total , and they were essentially used to crunch numbers .
They were huge , expensive , and unreliable ; sometimes , they caught on fire .
There was no word processing , no spreadsheets , no e-mail , and no Internet .
Programs were written on punch cards or paper tape , and memory was measured in thousands of digits .
IBM sold a disk drive that could hold almost 4.5 megabytes , but it was five - and - a - half feet tall by five feet deep and would just barely fit through a standard door .
Read the science fiction from back then , and you ’d be amazed by what they got wrong .
Sure , they predicted smaller and faster , but no one got the socialization right .
No one predicted eBay , instant messages , or blogging .
Moore ’s
Law predicts that in fifty years , computers will be a billion times more powerful than they are today .
I do n’t think anyone has any idea of the fantastic emergent properties you get from a billion - times increase in computing power .
( I recently wrote about what security would look like in ten years , and that was hard enough . )
But I can guarantee that it will be incredible , fantastic , and mind - blowing .
Q : With regard to identity theft , do you see any alternatives to data being king ?
Do you see any alternative systems which will mean that just knowing enough about someone is not enough to commit a crime ?
A : Yes .
Identity theft is a problem for two reasons .
One , personal identifying information is incredibly easy to get ; and two , personal identifying information is incredibly easy to use .
Most of our security measures have tried to solve the first problem .
Instead , we need to solve the second problem .
As long as it ’s easy to impersonate someone if you have his data , this sort of fraud will continue to be a major problem .
The basic answer is to stop relying on authenticating the person , and instead authenticate the transaction .
Credit cards are a good example of this .
Credit card companies spend almost no effort authenticating the person — hardly anyone checks your signature , and you can use your card over the phone , where they ca n’t even check if you ’re holding the card — and spend all their effort authenticating the transaction .
Of course it ’s more complicated than this ; I wrote about it in more detail here and here .
Q : What ’s the next major identity verification system ?
A : Identity verification will continue to be the hodge - podge of systems we have today .
You ’re recognized by your face when you see someone you know ; by your voice when you talk to someone you know .
Open your wallet , and you ’ll see a variety of ID cards that identify you in various situations — some by name and some anonymously .
Your keys “ identify ” you as someone allowed in your house , your office , your car .
I do n’t see this changing anytime soon , and I do n’t think it should .
Distributed identity is much more secure than a single system .
I wrote about this in my critique of REAL ID .
Q : If we can put a man on the moon , why in the world ca n’t we design a computer that can “ cold boot ” nearly instantaneously ?
I know about hibernation , etc. , but when I do have to reboot , I hate waiting those three or four minutes .
A : Of course we can ; Amiga was a fast booting computer , and OpenBSD boxes boot in less than a minute .
But the current crop of major operating systems just do n’t .
This is an economics blog , so you tell me : why do n’t the computer companies compete on boot - speed ?
Q : Considering the carelessness with which the government ( state and federal ) and commercial enterprises treat our confidential information , is it essentially a waste of effort for us as individuals to worry about securing our data ?
A : Yes and no .
More and more , your data is n’t under your direct control .
Your e-mail is at Google , Hotmail , or your local ISP .
Online merchants like Amazon and eBay have records of what you buy , and what you choose to look at but not buy .
Your credit card company has a detailed record of where you shop , and your phone company has a detailed record of who you talk to ( your cell phone company also knows where you are ) .
Add medical databases , government databases , and so on , and there ’s an awful lot of data about you out there .
And data brokers like ChoicePoint and Acxiom collect all of this data and more , building up a surprisingly detailed picture on all Americans .
As you point out , one problem is that these commercial and government organizations do n’t take good care of our data .
It ’s an economic problem : because these parties do n’t feel the pain when they lose our data , they have no incentive to secure it .
I wrote about this two years ago , stating that if we want to fix the problem , we must make these organizations liable for their data losses .
Another problem is the law ; our Fourth Amendment protections protect our data under our control — which means in our homes , in our cars , and on our computers .
We do n’t have nearly the same protection when we give our data to some other organization for use or safekeeping .
That being said , there ’s a lot you can do to secure your own data .
I give a list here .
Q : How do you remember all of your passwords ?
A : I can’t .
No one can ; there are simply too many .
But I have a few strategies .
One , I choose the same password for all low - security applications .
There are several Web sites where I pay for access , and I have the same password for all of them .
Two , I write my passwords down .
There ’s this rampant myth that you should n’t write your passwords down .
My advice is exactly the opposite .
We already know how to secure small bits of paper .
Write your passwords down on a small bit of paper , and put it with all of your other valuable small bits of paper : in your wallet .
And three , I store my passwords in a program I designed called Password Safe .
It ’s is a small application — Windows only , sorry — that encrypts and secures all your passwords .
Here are two other resources : one concerning how to choose secure passwords ( and how quickly passwords can be broken ) , and one on how lousy most passwords actually are .
Q : What ’s your opinion of the risks of some of the new ( and upcoming ) online storage services , such as Google ’s GDrive or Microsoft ’s Live Drive ?
Most home computer users do n’t adequately safeguard or backup their storage , and these services would seem to offer a better - maintained means of storing files ; but what do users risk by storing that much important information with organizations like Google or Microsoft ?
A : Everything I wrote in my answer to the identity theft question applies here : when you give a third party your data , you have to both trust that they will protect it adequately , and hope that they wo n’t give it all to the government just because the government asks nicely .
But you ’re certainly right , data loss is the number one risk for most home users , and network - based storage is a great solution for that .
As long as you encrypt your data , there ’s no risk and only benefit .
Q : Do you think that in the future , everything will go from hard - wired to wireless ?
If so , with cell phones , radios , satellites , radar , etc. using all the airwaves ( or spectrum ) , do you think there is a potential for , well , messing everything up ?
What about power outages and the such ?
A : Wireless is certainly the way of the future .
From a security perspective , I do n’t see any major additional risks .
Sure , there ’s a potential for messing everything up , but there was before .
Same with power outages .
Data transmitted wirelessly should probably be encrypted and authenticated ; but it should have been over wires , too .
The real risk is complexity .
Complexity is the worst enemy of security ; as systems become more complex , they get less secure .
It ’s not the addition of wireless per se ; it ’s the complexity that wireless — and everything else — adds .
Q : There has been some work to date on the cost - benefit economics of security .
In your estimation , is this a sound approach to motivate better security , and do you think it is doomed to begin with since society disproportionately values other things before it values security ?
If so , do you think it ’s time for us to take up digital pitchforks and shine some light on the economic gatekeepers ’ personal lives ?
A : Security is a trade - off , just like anything else .
And it ’s not true that we always disproportionately value other things before security .
Look at our terrorism policies ; when we ’re scared , we value security disproportionately before all other things .
Looking at security through the lens of economics ( as I did here ) is the only way to understand how these motivations work and what level of security is optimal for society .
Not that I ’m discouraging you from picking up your digital pitchforks .
People have an incredibly complex relationship with security — read my essay on the psychology of security , and this one on why people are so bad at judging risks — and the more information they have , the better .
Q : Is there an equilibrium point in which the cost ( either financial or time ) of hacking a password becomes more expensive than the value of the data ?
If so what is it ?
A : Of course , but there are too many variables to answer the question .
The cost of password guessing is constantly going down , and the value of the data depends on the data .
In general , though , we ’ve long reached a point where the complexity of passwords an average person is willing to remember is less than the complexity of passwords necessary to be secure against a password - guessing attack .
( This is for passwords that can be guessed offline only .
Four - digit PINs are still okay if the bank disables your account after a few wrong guesses . )
That ’s why I recommend that people write their passwords down , as I said before .
Q : With over a billion people using computers today , what is the real threat to the average person ?
A : It ’s hard not to store sensitive information ( like social security numbers ) on your computer .
Even if you do n’t type it yourself , you might receive it in an e-mail or file .
And then , even if you delete that file or e-mail , it might stay around on your hard drive .
And lots of people like the convenience of Internet banking , and even more like to use their computers to help them do their jobs — which means company secrets will end up on those computers .
The most immediate threat to the average person is crime — in particular , fraud .
And as I said before , even if you do n’t store that data on your computer , someone else has it on theirs .
But the long - term threat of loss of privacy is much greater , because it has the potential to change society for the worse .
Q : What is the future of electronic voting ?
A : I ’ve written a lot about this issue ( see here and here as well ) .
Basically , the problem is that the secret ballot means that most of the security tricks we use in things like electronic funds transfers do n’t work in voting machines .
The only workable solution against hacking the voting machines , or — more commonly — innocent programming errors , is something called a voter - verifiable paper trail .
Vote on whatever touch - screen machine you want in whatever way you want .
Then , that machine must spit out a printed piece of paper with your vote on it , which you have the option of reviewing for accuracy .
The machine collects the votes electronically for a quick tally , and the paper is the actual vote in case of recounts .
Nothing else is secure .
Q : Do you think Google will be able to eliminate the presence of phony malware sites on its search pages ?
And what can I do to ensure I ’m not burned by the same ?
A : Google is trying .
The browsers are trying .
Everyone is trying to alert users about phishing , pharming , and malware sites before they ’re taken in .
It ’s hard ; the criminals spend a lot of time trying to stay one step ahead of these identification systems by changing their URLs several times a day .
It ’s an arms race : we ’re not winning right now , but things will get better .
As for how not to be taken in by them , that ’s harder .
These sites are an example of social engineering , and social engineering preys on the natural tendency of people to believe their own eyes .
A good bullshit detector helps , but it ’s hard to teach that .
Specific phishing , pharming , and other tactics for trapping unsuspecting people will continue to evolve , and this will continue to be a problem for a long time .
Q : I recently had an experience on eBay in which a hacker copied and pasted an exact copy of my selling page with the intention of routing payments to himself .
Afterwards , people informed me that such mischief is not uncommon .
How can I ensure that it does n’t happen again ?
A : You can’t .
The attack had nothing to do with you .
Anyone with a browser can copy your HTML code — if they could n’t , they could n’t see your page — and repost it at another URL .
Welcome to the Internet .
Q : All ethics aside , do you think you could make more money obtaining sensitive information about high net worth individuals and using blackmail / extortion to get money from them , instead of writing books , founding companies , etc . ?
A : Basically , you ’re asking if crime pays .
Most of the time , it does n’t , and the problem is the different risk characteristics .
If I make a computer security mistake — in a book , for a consulting client , at BT — it ’s a mistake .
It might be expensive , but I learn from it and move on .
As a criminal , a mistake likely means jail time — time I can’t spend earning my criminal living .
For this reason , it ’s hard to improve as a criminal .
And this is why there are more criminal masterminds in the movies than in real life .
Q : Nearly every security model these days seems to boil down to the fact that there must be some entity in which you place your trust .
I have to trust Google to keep my personal data and passwords secure every time I check my mail , even as they ’re sharing it across their Google Reader , Google Maps , and Google Notebook applications .
Even in physical security models , you usually have to trust someone ( e.g. , the security guard at the front desk , or the police ) .
In your opinion , is there a business / economic reason for this , or do you see this paradigm eventually becoming a thing of the past ?
A : There is no part of human social behavior that does n’t involve trust of some sort .
Short of living as a hermit in a cave , you ’re always going to have trust someone .
And as more of our interactions move online , we ’re going to have to trust people and organizations over networks .
The notion of “ trusted third parties ” is central to security , and to life .
Q : What do you think about the government or a pseudo - governmental agency acting as a national or global repository for public keys ?
If this were done , would the government insist on a back - door ?
A : There will never be a global repository for public keys , for the same reason there is n’t a single ID card in your wallet .
We are more secure with distributed identification systems .
Centralized systems are more valuable targets for criminals , and hence harder to secure .
I also have other problems with public - key infrastructure in general .
And the government certainly might insist on a back door into those systems ; they ’re insisting on access to a lot of other systems .
Q : What do you think needs to be done to thwart all of the Internet - based attacks that happen ?
Why it is that no single company or government agency has yet to come up with a solution ?
A : That ’s a tall order , and of course the answer to your question is that it ca n’t be done .
Crime has been part of our society since our species invented society , and it ’s not going away anytime soon .
The real question is , “ Why is there so much crime and hacking on the Internet , and why is n’t anyone doing anything about it ? ”
The answer is in the economics of Internet vulnerabilities and attacks : the organizations that are in the position to mitigate the risks are n’t responsible for the risks .
This is an externality , and if you want to fix the problem you need to address it .
In this essay ( more here ) , I recommend liabilities ; companies need to be liable for the effects of their software flaws .
A related problem is that the Internet security market is a lemon ’s market ( discussed here ) , but there are strategies for dealing with that , too .
Q : You have repeatedly maintained that most of the investments that the government has made towards counter - terrorism are largely “ security theater , ” and that the real way to combat terrorism is to invest in intelligence .
However , Tim Weiner ‘s book , Legacy of Ashes , says that the U.S. government is particularly inept at gathering and processing intelligence .
Does that leave us with no hope at all ?
A : I ’m still a fan of intelligence and investigation ( more here ) and emergency response ( more here ) .
No , neither is perfect , but they ’re way better than the “ defend the target ” or “ defend against the tactic ” thinking we have now .
( I ’ve written more about this here . )
Basically , security that only forces the bad guy to make a minor change in his plot is largely a waste of money .
On the other hand , the average terrorist seems to be quite the idiot .
How you can help : refuse to be terrorized .
Q : I travel a lot and am continually frustrated with airport security .
What can we , the little people , do to help ease these frustrations ( besides taking a deep breath and strapping on our standard - issue orange jumpsuits , I mean ) ?
A : I share your frustration , and I have regularly written about airport security .
But I got to do something you ca n’t do , and that ’s take it out on the TSA director , Kip Hawley .
I recommend this interview if you are interested in seeing him try to answer — and not answer — my questions about ID checks , the liquid ban , screeners that continually do badly in tests , the no-fly list , and the cover - your - ass security that continues to cost us time and money without making us appreciably safer .
As to what you can do : complain to your elected officials , and vote .
Q : What kinds of incentives can organizations put into place to 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of social engineering , and 2 ) persuade individuals to take an appropriate level of concern with respect to organizational security ?
Are you aware of any particularly creative solutions to these problems ?
A : Social engineering will always be easy , because it attacks a fundamental aspect of human nature .
As I said in my book , Beyond Fear , “ social engineering will probably always work , because so many people are by nature helpful and so many corporate employees are naturally cheerful and accommodating .
Attacks are rare , and most people asking for information or help are legitimate .
By appealing to the victim ’s natural tendencies , the attacker will usually be able to cozen what she wants . ”
The trick is to build systems that the user cannot subvert , whether by malice , accident , or trickery .
This will also help with the other problem you list : convincing individuals to take organizational security seriously .
This is hard to do , even in the military , where the stakes are much higher .
Q : I am someone that knows little to nothing about computers .
As such , what advice would you give to someone like me who wants to become educated on the topic ?
A : There are probably zillions of books and classes on basic computer and Internet skills , and I would n’t even know where to begin to suggest one .
Okay , that ’s a lie .
I do know where to begin .
I would Google “ basic computer skills ” and see what comes up .
But I do n’t think that people should need to become computer experts , and computer security experts , in order to successfully use a computer .
I ’ve written about home computer users and security here .
Q : How worried are you about terrorists or other criminals hacking into the computer systems of dams , power plants , air traffic control towers , etc . ?
A : Not very .
Of course there is a security risk here , but I think it ’s overblown .
And I definitely think the risk of cyberterrorism is overblown ( for more on this , see here , as well as this essay on cyberwar ) .
Q : Can two - factor authentication really work on a Web site ?
Biometrics is n’t feasible because most people do n’t have the hardware .
One - time password tokens are a hassle , and they do n’t really scale well .
Image identification and PC fingerprinting technology that some banks are using is pretty easy to defeat with an evil proxy ( i.e. , any phishing Web site ) .
A : Two - factor authentication works fine on some Web sites .
My employer , BT , uses two - factor access for the corporate network , and it works great .
Where two - factor authentication wo n’t work is in reducing fraud in electronic banking , electronic brokerage accounts , and so on .
That ’s because the problem is n’t an authentication problem .
The reasoning is subtle , and I ’ve written about it here and here .
What I predicted will occur from two - factor authentication — and what we ’re seeing now — is that fraud will initially decrease as criminals shift their attacks to organizations that have not yet deployed the technology , but will return to normal levels as the technology becomes ubiquitous and criminals modify their tactics to take it into account .
Q : How much fun / mischief could you have if you were “ evil ” for a day ?
A : It used to be a common late - night bar conversation at computer security conferences : how would you take down the Internet , steal a zillion dollars , neutralize the IT infrastructure of this company or that country , etc .
And , unsurprisingly , computer security experts have all sorts of ideas along these lines .
This is true in many aspects of our society .
Here ’s what I said in my book , Secrets and Lies ( page 389 ) : “ As technology becomes more complicated , society ’s experts become more specialized .
And in almost every area , those with the expertise to build society ’s infrastructure also have the expertise to destroy it .
Ask any doctor how to poison someone untraceably , and he can tell you .
Ask someone who works in aircraft maintenance how to drop a 747 out of the sky without getting caught , and he ’ll know .
Now ask any Internet security professional how to take down the Internet , permanently .
I ’ve heard about half a dozen different ways , and I know I have n’t exhausted the possibilities . ”
What we hope is that as people learn the skills , they also learn the ethics about when and when not to use them .
When that does n’t happen , you get Mohommad Attas and Timothy McVeighs .
Q : In that vein , what is the most devilish idea you have thought about ?
A : No comment .
Q : What ’s your view on the difference between anonymity and privacy , and which one do you think is more important for society ?
I ’m thinking primarily of security - camera paranoia ( as if nosy neighbors had n’t been in existence for thousands of years ) .
A : There ’s a huge difference between nosy neighbors and cameras .
Cameras are everywhere .
Cameras are always on .
Cameras have perfect memory .
It ’s not the surveillance we ’ve been used to ; it ’s wholesale surveillance .
I wrote about this here , and said this : “ Wholesale surveillance is a whole new world .
It ’s not ‘ follow that car , ’ it ’s ‘ follow every car . ’
The National Security Agency can eavesdrop on every phone call , looking for patterns of communication or keywords that might indicate a conversation between terrorists .
Many airports collect the license plates of every car in their parking lots , and can use that database to locate suspicious or abandoned cars .
Several cities have stationary or car - mounted license - plate scanners that keep records of every car that passes , and save that data for later analysis .
“ More and more , we leave a trail of electronic footprints as we go through our daily lives .
We used to walk into a bookstore , browse , and buy a book with cash .
Now we visit Amazon , and all of our browsing and purchases are recorded .
We used to throw a quarter in a toll booth ; now EZ Pass records the date and time our car passed through the booth .
Data about us are collected when we make a phone call , send an e-mail message , make a purchase with our credit card , or visit a Web site . ”
What ’s happening is that we are all effectively under constant surveillance .
No one is looking at the data most of the time , but we can all be watched in the past , present , and future .
And while mining this data is mostly useless for finding terrorists ( I wrote about that here ) , it ’s very useful in controlling a population .
Cameras are just one piece of this , but they ’re an important piece .
And what ’s at stake is a massive loss of personal privacy , which I believe has significant societal ramifications .
Q : Do you think it will ever be feasible to vote for public officials via the Internet ?
Why or why not ?
Internet voting has the same problems as electronic voting machines , only more so .
That being said , we are moving towards vote - by - mail and ( for the military ) vote - by - fax .
Just because something is a bad security idea does n’t mean it wo n’t happen .
Q : Hacker movies have become quite popular recently .
Do any of them have any basis in reality , or are the hacking techniques fabricated by Hollywood ?
A : I ’ve written a lot about what I call “ movie - plot threats ” : the tendency of all of us to fixate on an elaborate and specific threat rather than the broad spectrum of possible threats .
We see this all the time in our response to terrorism : terrorists with scuba gear , terrorists with crop dusters , terrorists with exploding baby carriages .
It ’s silly , really , but it ’s human nature .
In the spirit of this silliness , on my blog I conducted two Movie - Plot Threat Contests .
( First contest rules and entries here , and winner here .
Second contest here and winner here . )
As to the movies : they all have some basis in reality , but it ’s pretty slim — just like all the other times science or technology is portrayed in movies .
Live Free or Die Hard is pure fiction .
Q : What would you consider to be the top five security vulnerabilities commonly overlooked by programmers ?
What book would you recommend that explains how to avoid these pitfalls ?
A : It ’s hard to make lists of “ top ” vulnerabilities , because they change all the time .
The SANS list is as good as any .
Recommended books include Ross Anderson ‘s Security Engineering , Gary McGraw ‘s Software Security , and my own — coauthored with Niels Ferguson — Practical Cryptography .
A couple of years I wrote a reading list for The Wall Street Journal , here .
Q : Can security companies really supply secure software for a stupid user ?
Or do we just have to accept events such as those government computer disks going missing in the UK which contained the personal information of 25 million people ( and supposedly had an underworld value of $ 3 billion ) ?
A : I ’ve written about that UK data loss fiasco , which seems to be turning into a privacy Chernobyl for that country , here .
Sadly , the appropriate security measure — encrypting the files — is easy .
Which brings us to your question : how do we deal with stupid users ?
I stand by what I said earlier : users will always be a problem , and the only real solution is to limit the damage they can do .
( Anyone who says that the solution is to educate the users has n’t ever met an actual user . )
Q : So seriously , do you shop on Amazon , or anywhere else online for that matter ?
A : Of course .
I shop online all the time ; it ’s far easier than going to a store , or even calling a mail - order phone number , if I know exactly what I want .
What you ’re really asking me is about the security .
No one steals credit card numbers one - by - one , by eavesdropping on the Internet connection .
They ’re all stolen in blocks of a million by hacking the back - end database .
It does n’t matter if you bought something over the Internet , by phone , by mail , or in person — you ’re equally vulnerable .
Q : Would n’t the world be simpler if we went back to “ magic ink ” ?
How awesome was that stuff !
A : If you like invisible ink , I recommend you go buy a UV pen .
Great fun all around .
Q : Should I visit Minneapolis anytime soon , what is one restaurant that I would be wrong to pass up ?
A : 112 Eatery .
( Sorry , my review of it is n’t online . )
Q : What was the one defining moment in your life that you knew you wanted to dedicate your life to computer security and cryptography ?
A : I do n’t know .
Security is primarily a way of looking at the world , and I ’ve always looked at the world that way .
As a child , I always noticed security systems — in retail stores , in banks , in office buildings — and how to defeat them .
I remember accompanying my mother to the voting booth , and noticing ways to break the security .
So it ’s less of a defining moment and more of a slow process .
Q : What ’s the worst security you ’ve seen for a major financial firm ?
I use ING and their site forces you to use just a 4 - digit pin .
A : There ’s a lot of stupid security out there ; and I honestly do n’t collect anecdotes anymore .
I even have a name of security measures that give the appearance of security without the reality : security theater .
Recently I wrote about security theater , and how the psychological benefit is actually important .
Q : I read that AES and Twofish have protection against timing analysis .
How does that work ?
A : What an esoteric question for such a general forum .
There is actually a timing attack against AES ; a link to the specific attack , and a description of timing attacks in general , is here .
This is a more general description of the attacks and defenses .
Q : How does it feel to be an Internet meme ?
A : Surreal .
It ’s surreal to be mentioned in The DaVinci Code , to appear before the House of Lords , or to answer questions for the Freakonomics blog .
The hardest part is the responsibility .
People take my words seriously , which means that I ca n’t utter them lightly .
If I say that I use a certain product — PGP Disk , for example — people buy the product and the company is happy .
If , on the other hand , I call a bunch of products “ snake oil , ” people do n’t buy the products and the companies occasionally sue me .
Q : Is it true that there is a giant database of every site we have ever visited , and that with the right warrant a government agency could know exactly where we ’ve been ?
What are our real footprints on the Web , and would it be possible for , say , an employer to someday find out every site you visited in college ?
Is there a way to hide your presence on sites that you believe to be harmless that others may hold against you ?
A : There really is n’t any good way to hide your Web self .
There are anonymization tools you can use —
Tor for anonymous web browsing , for example — but they have their own risks .
What I said earlier applies here , too ; it ’s impossible to function in modern society without leaving electronic footprints on the Web or in real life .
Q : Is there any benefit to password protecting your home Wifi network ?
I have IT friends that say the only real benefit is that multiple users can slow down the connection , but they state that there is no security reason .
Is this correct ?
A : I run an open wireless network at home .
There ’s no password , and there ’s no encryption .
Honestly , I think it ’s just polite .
Why should I care if someone on the block steals wireless access from me ?
When my wireless router broke last month , I used a neighbor ’s access until I replaced it .
Q : Why do large government agencies and companies continue to put their faith in computer passwords , when we know that the human mind cannot memorize multiple strong passwords ?
Why is so much more effort put into password security than human security ?
A : Because it ’s easier .
Never underestimate the power of doing the easy stuff and ignoring the hard stuff .
Q : Do you still find that lying about successes in counter - terrorism is an appropriate option for security experts commenting on these matters ?
A : For those of you who do n’t want to follow the links , they ’re about the German terrorist plot that was foiled in September , and about how great a part electronic eavesdropping played in the investigation .
As I wrote earlier , as well as in the links attached to that answer , I do n’t think that wholesale eavesdropping is effective , and I questioned then whether its use had anything to do with those arrests .
I still do n’t have an answer one way or another , and made no definitive claims in either of the two above links .
If anyone does have any information on the matter , I would appreciate hearing it .
Again , thank you all .
That was fun .
I hope I did n’t give you too many links to read .
Britney Spears Hospitalized 72 Hour Commitment Hold AGAIN
was taken the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles by ambulance at 1:15 a .m. this morning .
Police were called after family members made the decision that the troubled pop star needed immediate help .
Her parents have been on hand for the past few days and have been able to witness her deteriorating behavior .
Spears has been unable to sleep for days and has reportedly been jumping into her car in the middle of the night , driving erratically .
She was said to have nearly plummeting off a cliff at one point two nights ago .
Lynne Spears , in concert with Alli Sims and Sam Lutfi , became so concerned about her mental state early this morning , that they called police and ambulance , after consulting with Britney 's psychiatrist by telephone .
A huge convoy of ambulance , police motorcycles and vehicles holding family and friends made their way to the medical facility , arriving at 1:58 a .m.
E! is reporting that Lynne Spears , Alli Sims and Adnan Ghalib were admitted into a waiting area .
Jamie Spears and son Brian arrived after the convoy .
ET is reporting that Adnan Ghalib was not allowed into the facility .
E! and TMZ are reporting that it was Sam Lutfi who was not allowed in at the request of the family .
It should be interesting to see which source got it right .
The group has been planning to take the necessary steps to get Spears back into the hospital .
They were aware of California Law 5150 , which allows a patient to be hospitalized for up to 72 hours if they are considered a risk to self or others .
That was the premise that allowed them to forcibly restrain Britney on January 3 , 2008 , and transport her to a hospital where she stayed for nearly 48 hours .
Spears has been prescribed medication that she has refused to take .
The reunion between Lynne Spears and her daughter has reportedly been tense .
Rumors ran rampant last night that Spears tried to commit suicide yesterday but both Sims and Lutfi have told People magazine that those rumors are false .
Family sources have asked people to please pray .
“ Well , it is Day 7 of my hunger strike for impeachment , to get the Maine candidates to demand that Tom Allen take a stand on impeachment and I have heard nothing back from any of them .
Nada .
I sent the impeachment proclamation to all of them , Allen , Michaud , Pingree , Lawrence , Strimling , Cote , Brennan , and Duson . ”

More than one - third of assembly members boycotted the vote
Bolivians will now have a chance to vote on the changes in a national referendum next year .
The 164 deputies present , out of the total of 255 , took 13 hours to vote on each article of the new constitution .
The new charter would give more autonomy to indigenous people and allow consecutive presidential terms .
Capital argument
The draft constitution has proved contentious in Bolivia , with strikes and protests against it .
At least three people were killed in the run up to the vote in clashes between protesters and police in the central city of Sucre .
Residents of that town were angered at the absence from the constituent assembly 's agenda of proposals to make Sucre the sole capital of the country , which it was before 1899 .
The argument highlights the division between opponents of President Evo Morales , based in the richer east and his supporters in the poorer mountainous west of Bolivia .
Mr Morales proposed on Wednesday that he step down if " No " votes in the upcoming referendum exceed the vote which elected him in December 2005 - 54 % .
Mr Morales - Bolivia 's first indigenous president - says the reforms would give greater political representation to marginalised and indigenous groups - who make up 62 % of the population .
But the opposition have criticised the plans for allowing the president to seek re-election indefinitely .
Strikes to protest against the reform plans were held in six of Bolivia 's nine provinces last month , attracting the strongest support in the gas - rich province of Santa Cruz - an opposition stronghold .
Dr Karl › Dr Karl 's Great Moments
In Science
Great Wall of China from space ( Part II )
Last time Dr Karl dispelled some of the myths that have grown up around The Great Wall Of China - concerning its history and its current state of repair .
This time Dr Karl takes on the tallest tale that is told about the Great Wall ...
It 's claimed that you can see the Great Wall of China from the Moon .
That 's one big claim , but let 's take this apart brick by brick .
Last time , I pointed out that the Great Wall of China is not actually one huge monolithic wall of great structural integrity , but a whole bunch of walls .
Some sections ( especially the bits that the tourists visit ) appear to be in really mint condition – but they were totally rebuilt in the 1950s .
Some bits have decayed so much that there 's not even a mark in the dirt to show where the original structure was .
But what about the claim that you can see it from the Moon ?
It seems to have begun with the American traveller William Edgar Geil in 1909 .
He wrote a book The Great Wall of China , and in it , claimed that you can see the Great Wall from the Moon .
And that as in 1909 , long before Space Travel .
Then in 1923 , Adam Warwick wrote in the National Geographic , " According to astronomers , the only work of man 's hands which would be visible to the human eye from the Moon is the Great Wall of China " .
Joseph Needham went even further - all the way to Mars .
He wrote in Vol. 4 of his multi-volume work Science and Civilisation in China in 1971 on page 47 , " stretching from Chinese Turkestan to the Pacific in a line of well over 2000 miles ( nearly a tenth of the Earth 's circumference ) , the Wall has been considered the only work of man which can be picked out by Martian astronomers . "
Many other authors , publicists for travel agencies and even the drunk guy down at the pub kept on repeating this story .
But is it true ?
Neil Armstrong , the first man to walk on the Moon , said about the Great Wall of China , " It is not visible from lunar distance " .
Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin , his co-pilot said , " you have a hard time even seeing continents . "
So we can't see the Great Wall from the Moon , which is about 400,000 km away .
But could you see it from the Space Shuttle ?
It flies in Low Earth Orbit , 300 - 530 kilometres up .
The astronaut William Pogue , who flew in space on Skylab 4 , was able to see the Great Wall , but only with binoculars , and with lots of practice .
The American astronaut Sally Ride talked about how the high speed of the Space Shuttle makes it very difficult to see anything down on the ground .
" I found that at this speed ( five miles per second ) , unless I kept my nose pressed to the window , it was almost impossible to keep track of where we were at any given moment - the world below simply changes too fast . "
Karl Henize flew on Space Shuttle 51 F in July 1985 - and he too failed to see the Great Wall from orbit .
The Space Shuttle is so fast that Karl Henize had only a very short time to look for the Wall .
Afterwards , he wrote , " There is little time for map reading - from the time an approaching area is 45 degrees from the ( vertical ) - at which time one can begin to make out a fair amount of detail - until it is slipping under the spacecraft hull is 40 seconds at most . "
The astronaut Andy Thomas wrote about recognising objects on Earth on May 22 , 1998 , while he spent 141 continuous days on the Russian Space Station Mir .
He wrote how striking was " the abundance of clouds " .
After a while , he could recognise the deserts of Northern Africa , the redness of Australia and characteristic coast lines such as the " boot " of Italy .
But even though he tried , he was never able to see the Great Wall .
He wrote about the extreme difficulty in recognising Earthly objects from orbit .
He tells us , " Cities can be seen , although , surprisingly , they do not stand out readily .
But we can make out their grid - like pattern of streets .
The stories about the Great Wall of China being visible from space may be true , but I have yet to see it " .
Imagine looking out of a third - storey window , trying to see a very long fishing line on the ground - you can't .
It does n't matter how long the fishing line is .
It 's simply too skinny to be seen .
Same with the Great Wall of China .
The astronaut James Lovell said that , with the naked eye , he could recognise El Paso airport from orbit , because he had flown over it many times in various aircraft .
But he could not recognise the similar - sized airport at Kinshasa in Zaire even though he knew where to look - because he was not familiar with it .
So maybe Chinese astronauts in the future will report that they can see the Great Wall of China from Space with the naked eye , but so far , nobody has .

Anti-bush protesters attempt to get on the evening news to show their signs that say Impeach [ … ] . ”
Many have called the Bush administration the “ most secretive administration in American history . ”
Among those making this charge is Hillary Clinton ; likely the next to occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue ( unfortunately ) .
On Clinton ’s website , she states that “ We need a return to transparency and a system of checks and balances , to a president who respects Congress ’s role of oversight and accountability . ”
This is quite a departure from her days of her illegal holding of closed meetings regarding her socialized healthcare plan early in her husband ’s administration .
Perhaps she has had a change of heart about transparency in government since then ?
Apparently , this policy does not apply to her campaign , however .
Last week the AP reported that millions of documents being archived at the Bill Clinton Presidential Library from her husband ’s administration will not be available until after the 2008 election ( How convenient ! ) .
Judicial Watch , a conservative watchdog group and no doubt part of the “ vast right - wing conspiracy , ” has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Clinton Library to compel the library to release the records .
Ironically , Hillary Clinton might benefit from the Bush administration ’s secrecy she so decries .
In 2001 , President Bush signed an executive order which allows former presidents to deem certain documents privileged and apparently exempt from the Freedom of Information Act .
Here ’s a wonderful opportunity for Hillary Clinton to demonstrate how open she will be in leading her administration .
All she needs to do is sweet talk her husband and have him release the documents which pertain to her .
I ’m sure she has nothing to hide .
The ball is in your court Hillary .
Why should the American people believe you will be transparent in your administration if you will not be transparent in your campaign ?
The American people have a right to know before they choose the next president .

Mark Mauer says : " Josh Olson , who wrote the Oscar - nominated screenplay for A History of Violence tells a bizarre story in LA Weekly about a friend of his who falls in love with someone over the internet who is not what he claims to be .
Yeah , yeah – old story , but this one is seriously twisted , goes for almost two years , results in a woman leaving her husband and deciding to move to another state to be with this imaginary man who is a firefighter / cowboy / poet /9 - 11 survivor .
It 's a sad , scary yet funny story where Harlan Ellison of all people comes to the rescue . "

The strange thing about something like this , about an encounter with a genuine monster , is that our minds tend to default to what 's normal , to what we know .
We found ourselves talking about the situation as though Audrey had simply made friends with an eccentric person we did n't like .
Surely , it 's Audrey 's business whether or not she wants to be friends with Janna , is n't it ?
Then someone would remember that a potentially dangerous lunatic was in the house with our friend .
I called Harlan .
He understands people like no one you 've ever met .
We were at dinner once , and he started chatting with two biker dudes at the table next to us for a couple minutes .
He asked one guy , " How long have you played chess ? "
The guy was stunned .
Harlan had deduced from the way the guy carried himself in idle banter that he was a chess player .
I 'm pretty good at figuring out what makes people tick – you have to be to be a decent writer – but Harlan knows .
He thought my plan was pretty solid , but offered one variant on it that was brilliant , and completely out of left field .

BBC Environment Analyst
The UK wants a 60 % CO2 reduction by 2050
The figures would have been worse if the UK 's share of pollution from global flights and shipping had been included .
Analysis of the figures highlights key trends : emissions from homes went down , while road transport emissions went up .
UK aviation pollution increased overall but emissions from domestic flights went down as some switched to rail .
The UK has made big cuts in greenhouse gases other than CO2 , so it is still on track to go well beyond its Kyoto commitments .
But ministers are getting worried by their inability to make substantial cuts in the main human - produced greenhouse gas of concern - CO2 .
" As a country we must do much more across the board , " said Environment Secretary Hilary Benn .
" We have to make a real change to every aspect of our lives and our economy .
The government is taking steps to make that happen with the Climate Change Bill in Parliament . "
' Hopeful sign '
The figures are estimates for 2005 - 2006 .
Mr Benn said that the decrease in emissions from the residential sector of 4 % , repeating a similar success in 2005 , was a hopeful sign .
Leaving aviation emissions out of the Climate Change Bill makes a mockery of the Government 's climate strategy
Martyn Williams , Friends of the Earth
" People are much more aware of their impact on the climate than they were even a few years ago , and I 'm hopeful that these figures will become a continuing trend as we all increase our efforts to cut our carbon footprints at home . "
His department is concerned , though , about the 1.3 % rise in transport emissions which is likely to be exacerbated by government policies to build more roads and runways .
Another problem area , electricity generation ( up 1.5 % thanks to the high gas price driving generators to coal ) should be easier to combat as power firms are being squeezed by the European Emissions Trading System .
Emissions from domestic aviation decreased by 2.8 % , while international aviation emissions increased by 1.5 % , due to an increased number of flights .
Between 1990 and 2006 , emissions from aviation fuel - use more than doubled .
A recent report from the Civil Aviation Authority showed fewer people were taking domestic flights .
Mr Benn said the trend demonstrated that Europe needed to bring aviation into an emissions trading system as soon as possible .
Most analysts say this will not curb the growth in overall aviation emissions .
' Mockery '
Controversially , emissions from international planes and ships do not get counted towards the UK 's overall total .
What is more , high - altitude aviation has a greenhouse effect estimated by the government at more than double that of CO2 alone , but this is not reflected in this indicator .
Friends of the Earth 's climate campaigner , Martyn Williams , said : " Leaving aviation emissions out of the Climate Change Bill makes a mockery of the government 's climate strategy .
" It 's plain unfair to expect all the other sectors of the economy to play their part in the fight against climate change while aviation remains outside the law . "
Among the first tasks of the government 's new independent Climate Change Committee , headed by Adair Turner , will be to decide whether the UK's 2050 target of a 60 % CO2 reduction is a sufficient contribution to stabilising climate change , and whether aviation and shipping should figure on the national CO2 inventory .
The Environmental Protection Agency 's decision to refuse California 's request to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions from automobiles is all but certain to provoke lawsuits that could tie the matter up in court , potentially delaying action to curb those emissions for years .
But the move might be struck down – or an injunction granted – in months , if courts find the EPA acted against the advice of its own lawyers , legal experts say .
The decision also holds potential for Congress to become involved as debate over climate - change legislation accelerates .
In the surprise announcement Wednesday , EPA administrator Stephen Johnson said that fuel - economy standards in the brand - new energy law would cut greenhouse - gas emissions nationwide and thus make unnecessary sometimes contradictory state regulations .
" The Bush administration is moving forward with a clear national solution – not a confusing patchwork of state rules , " Mr. Johnson said .
" President Bush and Congress have set the bar high , and , when fully implemented , our federal fuel economy standard will achieve significant benefits by applying to all 50 states . "
But in denying California – and 16 other states poised to adopt nearly identical regulations – the right to regulate tailpipe greenhouse - gas emissions , the EPA acted against the agency 's own well - established regulatory precedent , legal analysts say , and reportedly may also have acted against the advice of its own lawyers .
" This decision baffles me – it makes no legal sense at all , " says Bruce Buckheit , a lawyer and former director of the air - enforcement division of the EPA until he retired in 2003 .
In a detailed legal analysis of California 's waiver request for a private client , he says he found no conflict under the Clean Air Act between the EPA and California regulatory authority .
The new energy law , which governs fuel - mileage standards , is also not a legal substitute for greenhouse - gas regulation , he adds .
California has received more than 40 waivers under the Clean Air Act .
In order to justify denying a waiver on greenhouse gases , the EPA would have to make a far broader finding that the Golden State no longer needs any independent air - pollution control program under the Clean Air Act , he says .
" It would not be just limited to one rule . "
The EPA , however , says global greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are different from local pollutants .
California 's request was " distinct from all prior requests , " the agency said in a press release .
" Greenhouse gases are fundamentally global in nature , which is unlike the other air pollutants covered by prior California waiver requests . "
The US Supreme Court in April found that the EPA did have authority to regulate carbon dioxide .
President Bush in May issued an executive order for the EPA to begin working on a new rulemaking process to reduce carbon from auto emissions – and to work closely with the Department of Transportation and other agencies .
But some sources suspect that a key factor in the EPA 's new position is the Bush administration 's concern – echoed by industry groups – that granting California a waiver to regulate auto emissions could quickly lead to greenhouse - gas regulations for other industries .
Wednesday 's decision appears opposite to the EPA 's apparent position in an internal White House debate last week , reported by the Monitor last week .
In that discussion , Johnson of the EPA told White House officials unequivocally that his agency intended to issue a forceful " endangerment finding " for carbon - dioxide emissions , a prerequisite for a finding that CO2 is a pollutant , according to one source familiar with the discussion , who asked not to be named because he was not permitted to speak to the press .
Once CO2 was so designated , the EPA would be empowered to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions across a range of industries , not just cars .
" It looks as though the strict constructionists won out , " according to this source .
" They 're worried that regulating CO2 will spill over from cars into the rest of the economy . "
Environmental lawyers say the EPA 's position on the California waiver wo n't hold up under court challenges , only delay it .
" The main argument Administrator Johnson used in justifying his decision has already been repudiated by the Supreme Court , " says Jim Marston , a senior attorney with Environmental Defense .
" The courts have said expressly that the existence of [ fuel - economy standards ] does not in any way prohibit or restrict EPA and states from having separate standards on greenhouse emissions .
There 's no conflict . "
There are also indications that the position the EPA announced may have been contrary to an internal position recommended by the agency 's own lawyers .
The Washington Post reported Thursday that a slide presentation by agency lawyers had said that if the EPA granted the waiver and California sued , the " EPA [ is ] likely to lose suit . "
At the same time , if the auto industry sued the agency over granting California a waiver , the " EPA is almost certain to win . "
A Dec. 7 letter to the US Senate by industry groups and the US Chamber of Commerce warned that federal greenhouse - gas regulation could produce the " unintended triggering of an expansive and costly stationary [ greenhouse - gas ] source control program " and that " over 300,000 facilities would potentially become regulated stationary sources . "
Johnson 's decision was met with disbelief .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , state officials , and environmental groups promises to sue the agency quickly .
" We are deeply disappointed that the administrator has chosen to deny our waiver and we are even more discouraged that he did it on such flimsy grounds , " said Mary Nichols , chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board , in a press teleconference .
" We are not happy and intend to pursue our legal remedies .
We will sue and sue and sue and sue until we get our legal rights . "
Researchers have uncovered more evidence that the TOR anonymiser network is being misused by hackers , and quite likely government intelligence agencies .
TOR ( The Onion Router ) is a network of proxy nodes set up to provide some privacy and anonymity to its users .
Originally backed by the US Naval Research Laboratory , TOR became an Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) project three years ago .
The system provides a way for whistleblowers and human rights workers to exchange information with journalists , among other things .
The system also provides plenty of scope for mischief .
The presence of rogue nodes on the network was recently highlighted by security researcher Dan Egerstad , who controversially posted details of login credentials of about 1,000 email addresses , including at least 100 accounts belonging to foreign embassies , obtained by listening to traffic passing through five exit nodes under his control .
Abuse of the system is far from isolated , other research suggests .
Members of the Teamfurry community discovered TOR exit - nodes that only forwards traffic association with ports used for unencrypted versions of protocols including IMAP and POP email ( TCP ports 143 and 110 ) , and IM traffic .
Other nodes only relay traffic associated with MySpace or Google searches .
The malign purposes behind such a system are fairly easy to guess , while their legitimate use is far trickier to imagine .
" Even though just a suspicious configuration is n’t enough to tag an exit - node evil , I would n’t touch these with a ten - foot long toothpick , " Teamfurry warns .
Another
Tor exit node used fake SSL certificates to run man - in - the - middle phishing attacks .
Information on the rogue node was forwarded to German authorities , who moved quickly to take down the node .
The node was the only one of 400 nodes tested that was running man - in - the - middle attacks , but as net security firm F - Secure notes , it " only takes one " .
TOR is set up such that users have little or no idea who controls the exit nodes their data passes through .
For this reason encrypting sensitive traffic sent over the network is the first , but not the only , security precaution for using the network . ®

One in three people worldwide lives in either China , the largest communist country , or India , the largest democracy .
For the moment , China remains the most populous nation , with 1.3 billion inhabitants , followed by India , which is home to 1.1 billion .
But India 's higher fertility rate means the gap is narrowing and the UN expects it to overtake China before 2030 .
Both countries are also experiencing rapid growth in their urban populations .
In China , the number of people in towns and cities is likely to exceed the number in the countryside by 2015 .
JANUARY 18 -- A Wisconsin man who allegedly defecated on the clothing and shoes of neighbors was charged yesterday with the repulsive , month - long soiling spree .
Ronnie Ballard , 19 , is facing misdemeanor charges for ruining the items , which were in the laundry room and hallways of a Madison apartment building that is next door to Ballard 's residence .
According to a criminal complaint filed in Dane County Circuit Court , Ballard defecated on two occasions in a washing machine , ruining a comforter , baby clothing , and other garments .
Ballard , pictured in the mug shot at right , is also charged with defecating in the tennis shoes and boots of building residents , who had left the footwear outside their apartment doors .
The complaint , a copy of which you 'll find below , quotes one resident 's reaction when she discovered the ruined sneakers : ' He shit in someone 's Reebok . '
The document adds that Felicia Walton , owner of the sneakers , 'had not given anyone permission to defecate in her shoes and she was disturbed . '
As first reported by the Wisconsin State Journal , Ballard was apprehended after a neighbor confronted him in the laundry room and followed him home .
At the time of his arrest , Ballard was out on bail on a lewd and lascivious behavior charge from Lincoln County ( he is currently being held on $ 1400 bail at the Dane County lockup ) .
As the Journal 's Ed Treleven reported , during a court appearance yesterday , Court Commissioner Todd Meurer ' ordered Ballard to only defecate in toilets . ' ( 4 pages )
This election cycle , said Wallace , some Democrats are n’t “ playing ball ” with him — or with Fox News .

Wallace : Dems are ' fools ' to boycott Fox
When Chris Wallace replaced Tony Snow as the host of “ Fox News Sunday ” in December 2003 , the network appeared to take a more moderate approach to Sunday talk .
Unlike Snow , a former Republican speechwriter , Wallace ’s broadcasting résumé included nearly three decades at mainstream media staples ABC and NBC .

And Wallace even snagged Howard Dean — who had n’t been on the Fox network in five years — as his first guest ; fellow presidential hopefuls John F. Kerry , Dick Gephardt and John Edwards rounded out the month .
But this election cycle , said Wallace , some Democrats are n’t “ playing ball ” with him — or with Fox News .
On a recent Sunday morning , shortly after refereeing a debate between Karl Rove and Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , Wallace talked to Politico about the Democrats ’ lack of appearances on Fox News , the “ liberal bias ” at competing networks and how November ’s television ratings prove that while his show remains in fourth place nationwide , it ’s on the upswing in Washington .
For Sunday talk shows , thriving in the D.C. ratings — although clearly trumped in size by New York — provides bragging rights over which show reaches more political insiders .
But more importantly , since the Sunday shows ’ objective is not only to reflect on the past week ’s events but to get political leaders to break news and move the conversation forward in the newspapers and the blogosphere on Monday morning , it ’s essential for both leading Republicans and leading Democrats to reach members of D.C. ’s chattering class .
“ I think the Democrats are damn fools [ for ] not coming on Fox News , ” Wallace said .
“ And my guess is that once you get a nominee , they probably will come on , because they know that we get a lot of voters they are going to need if they are going to win the election . ”
So far , Wallace has interviewed Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton , Joe Biden and Chris Dodd and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson ; both Sen. Barack Obama and former North Carolina Sen .
Edwards have declined .
The Edwards campaign confirmed that the candidate declined but did not elaborate further .
The Obama campaign did not respond to requests seeking comment .
Aside from his hourlong Sunday show , the Democratic candidates will not participate in any Fox News - sponsored debates , leaving Wallace to moderate three Republican contests over the course of 2007 .
“ Just imagine if the Republicans , under pressure from right - to - life groups , refused to appear on CNN or MSNBC , ” Wallace said .
“ I think there would be holy unshirted hell .
I think there would be such talk about these people being captives of the extreme right wing and why are they afraid to answer questions .
And I think the absence of that is very telling .
“ At this point , it has become kind of a loyalty test inside the Democratic Party , ... pandering to the far - left - wing , ” Wallace added .
“ And we live with it . ”
Despite missing some candidates from the other side of the aisle , Wallace — along with the Fox public relations team — will happily boast that in the D.C. market , there have been big gains .
That ’s been evident in the past month as influential media blogs like FishbowlDC and TVNewser seized upon the November ratings — the latter declaring in a headline “ Washington Likes Wallace . ”
“ I think we ’re doing a variety of things to distinguish ourselves from the other shows , and Washington , especially , seems to be noticing the difference , ” Wallace said .
Indeed , the ratings have improved lately for Wallace in the D.C. market .
In November , “ Fox News Sunday ” beat both ABC ’s “ This Week ” and CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” each Sunday , while even once topping NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” — perhaps still recovering from all its 60th - anniversary hoopla .
Representatives for “ Meet the Press ” and “ Face the Nation ” were contacted but did not comment .
A representative for ABC ’s Sunday show responded : “ Season to date , ‘ This Week ’ posted increases in both total viewers and the [ key demographic ] , while the competition was down in both categories .
Year to date , ‘ This Week ’ is the only Sunday discussion program to increase in total viewers while , again , the competition is down . ”
The representative added that the George Stephanopoulos - hosted show is “ consistently No. 1 or 2 in eight of the top 10 metered markets and nationally places a strong second behind ‘ Meet the Press . ’ ”
And this past week , according to ratings information provided by NBC and ABC , “ Fox News Sunday ” fell to fourth in D.C. , ending the winning streak against “ This Week ” and “ Face the Nation . ”
Nevertheless ,
Wallace ’s overall tenure has shown increased competition with the three more established programs in Washington , according to data provided by Nielsen Media Research .
In November 2003 , the month before he took over , “ Fox News Sunday ” beat “ This Week ” and “ Face the Nation ” only once in D.C. and never came close to “ Meet the Press . ”
But isolating one market can get tricky .
Andrew Tyndall , an independent television news analyst , noticed increased attention recently being paid to Wallace ’s D.C. numbers .
“ It ’s sort of funny publicity they ’re putting it out , ” Tyndall said .
“ The way they ’re spinning it is that inside the Beltway he ’s doing well .
“ You could spin it the other way , ” he added .
“ How come no one ’s watching him in the rest of the country ? ”
Looking nationwide , however , “ Fox News Sunday ” remains mired in fourth place , just where it was when Wallace arrived .
For the week ended Dec. 2 , “ Meet the Press ” averaged more than 4 million viewers — “ a 239 percent lead , ” NBC ’s press release proclaimed — over fourth - place “ Fox News Sunday , ” which was just shy of 1.2 million .
“ This Week ” and “ Face the Nation ” finished stronger , too , with about 2.9 million and 2.56 million viewers , respectively .
Nevertheless ,
Wallace , with his trademark smirk , remained upbeat while acknowledging that “ it takes a while ” to compete with “ Meet the Press ” — which he briefly moderated in the 1980s — and the other shows nationwide .
“ Changing habits , particularly on something like Sunday morning , which is such a habit for people , is hard , ” Wallace said .
“ People are used to getting up and watching the Sunday show they ’ve watched their whole lives .
So you have to get people to change .
The only way to do that is by having a more interesting show , breaking more news , by doing things the other shows do n’t do . ”
EDITOR ’S NOTE :
This story was updated on Dec. 11 to correct the Dec. 2 viewership of CBS ’s “ Face the Nation . ”
Wallace said the spirited debate between Rove and Van Hollen , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , was something the other programs are not doing .
“ I think there was a passion and an excitement and an energy there that you do n’t get with doing the 14th interview with some senator or presidential candidate , ” Wallace said .
( It should be noted that Wallace interviewed presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Sen. John McCain the following week . )
While Wallace admitted that the “ meat and potatoes ” of “ Fox News Sunday ” will always be politics , a new segment called “ American Leaders ” premiered last month , which veers away from the campaign horse race .
When George H.W. Bush appeared in early November to discuss public service , Wallace said that “ for the first time in the history of the show , we beat everybody in Washington . ”
Also , Wallace is quick to highlight the show ’s effect on steering the political conversation , mentioning how Rudy Giuliani aide Anthony Carbonetti called him the previous night to “ explain what that whole funding mishap was about . ”
And whether there is some exact science to this or not , Wallace contended that “ Fox News Sunday ” has “ had more mentions in the national newspapers ” than any other talk show last year , and so far this year .
Last year ’s biggest mention was certainly his interview with Bill Clinton in September 2006 , in which the former president accused Wallace of doing a “ conservative hit job ” at the request of Fox News brass .
There is a photograph from that much - talked - about Clinton interview on his office wall , alongside two other framed shots —
Wallace standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin in one and next to President Bush in the other .
Regarding the Clinton slugfest — which became a YouTube staple —
Wallace said the story was not that he asked why the former president did not “ do more to get [ Osama ] bin Laden and Al Qaeda out of business ” but “ that none of my competitors in the mainstream media asked him that question . ”
Being the son of legendary newsman Mike Wallace , and in broadcast news for several decades , the Fox host has definitely been able to observe the mainstream media up close for quite some time .
But on his four - year anniversary this week , Wallace said there is something he ’s discovered only since joining the Rupert Murdoch - owned network .
“ I used to laugh and dismiss this talk about how we were — that there was a liberal bias in the mainstream media , ” Wallace said .
“ But I have to say in the four years I ’ve been at Fox , I ’ve come to believe that there is a bias . ”
LOS ANGELES 
The sequel is out there .
The conspiracy theories will not be .
Ten years after the first film and six years after the show went off the air , The X - Files returns to theaters with Fox Mulder , Dana Scully — and a lot riding on the bet that fans want more of the FBI 's paranormal - investigating agents .
The film , which remains without a formal title , will dump the long - running " mythology " plotline — that aliens live among us and are part of a colonizing effort — that made it one of the most popular television shows in the late 1990s but ultimately drove away some viewers who found it too complex and ambiguous .
" We spent a lot of time on ( the mythology ) and wrapped up a lot of threads " when the show went off the air in 2002 , says Chris Carter , creator of the series and director of the new movie .
" We want a stand - alone movie , not a mythology conspiracy one . "
That will come as welcome news to fans of the show 's stand - alone episodes , which included cults , ghosts , psychics and ancient curses .
Carter refuses to divulge any plot points of the movie , but says he wanted to make the film immediately after the show ended .
A contractual dispute with 20th Century Fox kept it on the shelf until the case was settled out of court .
He says the delay may turn out to be a blessing .
" There 's a whole audience I want to introduce X - Files to , " Carter says .
" There were kids who could n't watch it on TV because it was too scary .
Now they 're in college .
I wanted a movie that everyone could go to . "
Whether they will could be a test of the show 's legacy , says Blair Butler of the G4TV network , which caters to video - game enthusiasts and science - fiction fans .
" At its strongest , it had really creepy stand - alone episodes , " she says .
" They turned it into a great franchise .
But a lot of years have passed .
We 'll see if it 's fallen off the radar . "
She says the film could benefit from an ironic twist : the Writers Guild strike .
" I think it could be a sort comfort food for the people who loved how original the show was and are n't seeing original TV now , " she says .
But Carter believes they 'll be drawn by something else : the show 's stars , David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson .
" For me , The X - Files has always been a romance , " he says .
" They had an intellectual romance that 's very rare and restrained compared to so many relationships on TV .
I think that 's what appealed most to the fans .
And they 're back . "

As human right lawyers sought to block US government efforts to stop a lawsuit against a Boeing subsidiary accused of flying detainees to " black sites " where they were tortured , a legal advocacy group published the first testimony of a victim of the Central Intelligence Agency ’s " enhanced interrogation " program .
In the first - ever report of its kind , the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice ( CHRGJ ) at New York University School of Law released a firsthand account of a survivor of enforced disappearance and torture at several CIA " black sites . ”
The 63 - page report , " Surviving the Darkness : Testimony from the US ‘ Black Sites , ’ " is an in - depth account of a former CIA detainee ’s experience in his own words .
The bone - chilling narrative tells the story of Mohammed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah , a Yemeni national who spent more than a year and a half in the CIA ’s secret detention program .
He was never charged with a terrorism - related crime .
The CHRGJ charges that Bashmilah was " illegally detained by the Jordanian intelligence service in October 2003 , tortured into signing a false confession , and then handed over to an American rendition team . "
The group says he spent the next 18 months in the US secret detention network  in sites believed to be in Afghanistan and possibly Eastern Europe .
In May 2005 , he was transferred to the custody of the Yemen government , which held him in proxy detention at the behest of the US until he was put on trial and finally released in March 2006 .
Bashmilah ’s story was made public as the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) filed legal papers opposing the CIA ’s attempt to throw out a lawsuit against Boeing subsidiary Jeppesen Dataplan , Inc. for its participation in the CIA ’s " extraordinary rendition " program .
The ACLU charged that the US government is improperly invoking the " state secrets " privilege to avoid judicial scrutiny of this unlawful policy .
Steven Watt , an attorney with the ACLU ’s Human Rights Program , told IPS , " Five men have been brutally abused with the help of a US corporation , and they are entitled to their day in court . "
" Jeppesen must not be given a free pass for its profitable participation in a torture program , " he said .
" And the government should not be allowed to use the national security defense as a way to cover up its mistakes or , worse , its egregious abuses of human rights . "
The ACLU filing comes in a lawsuit brought on behalf of five victims of the rendition program .
who were kidnapped and secretly transferred by the CIA to US - run overseas prisons or foreign intelligence agencies where they were interrogated and tortured .
According to the lawsuit , Jeppesen knowingly provided flight planning and essential logistical support to aircraft and crew used by the CIA for the clandestine rendition flights .
After the lawsuit was filed , the US government intervened to seek its dismissal , contending that further litigation of the case would be harmful to national security .
But the ACLU contends that the information needed to pursue this lawsuit , including details about the rendition program . , is already in the public domain .
It adds , " Jeppesen ’s involvement in the program .
is also a matter of public record .
It has been confirmed by extensive documentary evidence and eyewitness testimony , including the sworn declaration of a former senior Jeppesen employee , which was submitted in support of the ACLU filing . "
In recent years , the government has asserted the once - rare " state secrets " claim with increasing regularity in an attempt to throw out lawsuits and justify withholding information from the public not only about the rendition program , but also about illegal wiretapping , torture , and other breaches of US and international law .
It has been 50 years since the United States Supreme Court last reviewed the use of the " state secrets " privilege .
The Supreme Court recently refused to review the " state secrets " privilege in a lawsuit brought by Khaled El - Masri , a German citizen also represented by the ACLU , who was kidnapped and rendered to detention , interrogation , and torture in a CIA " black site " prison in Afghanistan .
Meanwhile , more than 250 people once held in Iraqi prisons , including Abu Ghraib , have filed suit against a US military contractor for alleged torture of detainees .
The Center for Constitutional Rights filed the lawsuit seeking millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages against CACI International Inc. of Arlington , Virginia .
The complaint alleges that CACI interrogators who were sent to Iraqi prisons directed and engaged in torture between 2003 and 2004 .
The lawsuit charges that the detainees were repeatedly beaten , sodomized , threatened with rape , kept naked in their cells , subjected to electric shock and attacked by unmuzzled dogs , among other humiliations .
The court action also names two CACI employees  Stephen Stefanowski , known as " Big Steve , " and Daniel Johnson , known as " DJ "  accusing them of participating in the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib .
The suit alleges that the two CACI contractors directed Corporal Charles Graner and Sergeant Ivan Frederick .
Graner was sentenced to 10 years in prison for this role in the Abu Ghraib scandal ; Frederick is serving an eight - year jail term .
" These corporate guys worked in a conspiracy with those military guys to torture people , " said Susan Burke , the lead attorney in the case .
" And now the military have been held accountable , but the company guys and the company have not been , " she said .
The legal status of US private contractors in Iraq and elsewhere abroad remains cloudy .
The Iraqi government says they should be subject to Iraqi law , a position rejected by the US .
It remains unclear whether they are subject to US law .
No US court has yet decided a relevant case , though lawsuits have been brought against a number of contractors , including Blackwater , whose employees are accused of killing 17 unarmed Iraqi civilians in a shooting incident in September .
In the CACI case , to the surprise of some legal observers , the government did not intervene on behalf of the contractors and the court ruled that the litigation could go forward .
In a related development , the New York Times reported Wednesday that Pakistan ’s military and intelligence agencies , " apparently trying to avoid acknowledging an elaborate secret detention system , have quietly set free nearly 100 men suspected of links to terrorism , few of whom were charged . "
Human rights groups in Pakistan say those released are some of the nearly 500 Pakistanis presumed to have disappeared into the hands of the Pakistani intelligence agencies cooperating with Washington ’s fight against terrorism since 2001 .
The Times reported that no official reason has been given for the releases .
But it quoted Pakistani sources as saying that as pressure has mounted to bring the cases into the courts , " the government has decided to jettison some suspects and spare itself the embarrassment of having to reveal that people have been held on flimsy evidence in the secret system . "
Among those pressing to bring the cases into court was the chief justice of Pakistan ’s Supreme Court , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry .
He was dismissed by President Pervez Musharraf and remains in detention , although Musharraf last Saturday lifted the state of emergency he imposed in November .
The Times reported that the prisoner releases were " particularly galling to lawyers " because Musharraf had accused the courts of being soft on terrorists , and had used that claim as one justification for imposing emergency rule .
This has been going on for a while , but yesterday 's release of Rock Band has unleashed a whole new flood of message board posters , thread commenters , and the occasional real - life jackasses who feel the need to ask some variant of the following :
" Should n't you be spending all the time you 're sinking into this game playing a real instrument ? "
Now , anyone who takes it upon themselves to cop a holier - than - thou attitude towards what videogames someone else plays clearly has some broader personality issues that need to be dealt with .
But we 'll put that aside for the moment – I am not your therapist – and simply discuss why the premise is wrong .
Nobody ever said that Rock Band is a substitute for a musical instrument .
* Rock Band * is a videogame , an entertaining challenge prepared by a team of music lovers and instrumental virtuosos , most of whom are well aware what it means to really play music .
This does not deter them from their goals , which are , roughly :
Make a fun videogame , Mimic part of the feel of playing a musical instrument , Change the way people consume music , and Inspire a small segment of that group to pick up a real instrument .
Note that nowhere in that list do the words " provide a substitute for real instruments such that humankind never learns how to play music . "
In fact , they 're hoping for quite the opposite : that playing their videogame will get a few people interested enough in musical instruments that they will attempt to make the jump .
But as I understand it , that 's far down the list .
First and foremost , they 're making a fun videogame .
Which it is .
Like Super Mario Galaxy or BioShock , Rock Band is a lengthy , difficult series of events that challenge you to conquer them .
That its premise happens to be " you are a rock star " is no different than " you are a plumber in space " or " you are a biochemically enhanced guy in an underwater city . "
If Rock Band has any ambition outside " be a fun video game , " it is to change the way that people consume the music that they love .
This does n't mean " make people think they are playing music , haha , what idiots . "
It 's just a more active , kinetic , complex way of experiencing music that 's already been made for you .
Even musicians enjoy playing Guitar Hero and Rock Band .
They enjoy it quite a bit .
Playing music is hard .
I am learning a musical instrument .
I do n't sound very good .
If I put " all the time " I spent playing Guitar Hero and Rock Band into practicing , I still would not sound very good .
I will never be a rock star .
* Rock Band * lets me pretend I am , just like Madden lets you pretend you play in the NFL , or Portal lets you pretend there are such things as portals .
I think learning to play music is one of the most fun and rewarding things I 've ever set myself to do , and I think everybody should try .
But when you see people playing a music game , remember : they 're not making some kind of trade - off in which they'd be learning an instrument if only that game did n't exist .
More than likely , they 'd just be playing another videogame .
We already know that our evangelical Christian president 's invasion of Iraq caused the slaughter and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Christians , and his surge has worsened the dire humanitarian crisis for the Iraqi people .
Digging deeper into the crisis you find that not only are the thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Syria surviving hand to mouth , many are forced to turn to prostitution to survive -- and many of them are children .
Via BBC
News :
With their bright neon signs and glitzy decor , dozens of nightclubs line the streets of the Maraba district in the Syrian capital Damascus .
It 's here that men come from far and wide - car number plates are not just from Syria but Iraq and Saudi Arabia - to watch young women dancing .
Most of the dancers are teenagers and many of them are Iraqi refugees .
They dance for the cash which gets tossed onto the stage .
The dancers are surrounded by bodyguards , to stop them being touched by the men .
But the guards also arrange for their charges to be paid for sex with members of the audience .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
It 's getting hard to wrap your brain around subprime mortgages , Wall Street 's fancy name for junk home loans .
There 's so much subprime stuff floating around - more than $ 1.5 trillion of loans , maybe $ 200 billion of losses , thousands of families facing foreclosure , umpteen politicians yapping - that it's like the federal budget :
It 's just too big to be understandable .
So let 's reduce this macro story to human scale .
Meet GSAMP
Trust 2006 - S3 , a $ 494 million drop in the junk - mortgage bucket , part of the more than half - a- trillion dollars of mortgage - backed securities issued last year .
We found this issue by asking mortgage mavens to pick the worst deal they knew of that had been floated by a top - tier firm - and this one 's pretty bad .
It was sold by Goldman Sachs ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) - GSAMP originally stood for Goldman Sachs Alternative Mortgage Products but now has become a name itself , like AT&T and 3M .
This issue , which is backed by ultra-risky second - mortgage loans , contains all the elements that facilitated the housing bubble and bust .
It 's got speculators searching for quick gains in hot housing markets ; it 's got loans that seem to have been made with little or no serious analysis by lenders ; and finally , it 's got Wall Street , which churned out mortgage " product " because buyers wanted it .
As they say on the Street , " When the ducks quack , feed them . "
Alas , almost everyone involved in this duck - feeding deal has had a foul experience .
Less than 18 months after the issue was floated , a sixth of the borrowers had already defaulted on their loans .
Investors who paid face value for these securities - they were looking for slightly more interest than they'd get on equivalent bonds - have suffered heavy losses .
That 's because their securities have either defaulted ( for a 100 % loss ) or been downgraded by credit - rating agencies , which has depressed the securities ' market prices .
( Check out one of these jewels on a Bloomberg machine , and the price chart looks like something falling off a cliff . )
Even Goldman may have lost money on GSAMP - but being Goldman , the firm has more than covered its losses by betting successfully that the price of junk mortgages would drop .
Of course , Goldman knew a lot about this market : GSAMP was just one of 83 mortgage - backed issues totaling $ 44.5 billion that Goldman sold last year .
Now let 's take it from the top .
In the spring of 2006 , Goldman assembled 8,274 second - mortgage loans originated by Fremont Investment & Loan , Long Beach Mortgage Co. , and assorted other players .
More than a third of the loans were in California , then a hot market .
It was a run -of - the - mill deal , one of the 916 residential mortgage - backed issues totaling $ 592 billion that were sold last year .
The average equity that the second - mortgage borrowers had in their homes was 0.71 % .
( No , that 's not a misprint - the average loan - to - value of the issue 's borrowers was 99.29 % . )
It gets even hinkier .
Some 58 % of the loans were no-documentation or low - documentation .
This means that although 98 % of the borrowers said they were occupying the homes they were borrowing on - " owner - occupied " loans are considered less risky than loans to speculators - no one knows if that was true .
And no one knows whether borrowers ' incomes or assets bore any serious relationship to what they told the mortgage lenders .
You can see why borrowers lined up for the loans , even though they carried high interest rates .
If you took out one of these second mortgages and a typical 80 % first mortgage , you got to buy a house with essentially none of your own money at risk .
If house prices rose , you 'd have a profit .
If house prices fell and you could n't make your mortgage payments , you 'd get to walk away with nothing ( or almost nothing ) out of pocket .
It was go - go finance , very 21st century .
Goldman acquired these second - mortgage loans and put them together as GSAMP Trust 2006 - S3 .
To transform them into securities it could sell to investors , it divided them into tranches - which is French for " slices , " in case you 're interested .
There are trillions of dollars of mortgage - backed securities in the world for the same reason that Tyson Foods offers you chicken pieces rather than insisting you buy an entire bird .
Tyson can slice a chicken into breasts , legs , thighs , giblets - and Lord knows what else - and get more for the pieces than it gets for a whole chicken .
Customers are happy , because they get only the pieces they want .
Similarly , Wall Street carves mortgages into tranches because it can get more for the pieces than it would get for whole mortgages .
Mortgages have maturities that are unpredictable , and they require all that messy maintenance like collecting the monthly payments , making sure real estate taxes are paid , chasing slow - pay and no-pay borrowers , and sending out annual statements of interest and taxes paid .
Securities are simpler to deal with and can be customized .
Someone wants a safe , relatively low - interest , short - term security ?
Fine , we 'll give him a nice AAA - rated slice that gets repaid quickly and is very unlikely to default .
Someone wants a risky piece with a potentially very rich yield , an indefinite maturity , and no credit rating at all ?
One unrated X tranche coming right up .
Interested in legs , thighs , giblets , the heart ?
The butcher - excuse us , the investment banker - gives customers what they want .
In this case , Goldman sliced the $ 494 million of second mortgages into 13 separate tranches .
The $ 336 million of top tranches - named cleverly A - 1 , A - 2 , and A - 3 - carried the lowest interest rates and the least risk .
The $ 123 million of intermediate tranches - M ( for mezzanine ) 1 through 7 - are next in line to get paid and carry progressively higher interest rates .
Finally , Goldman sold two non-investment - grade tranches .
The first , B - 1 ( $ 13 million ) , went to the Luxembourg - based UBS ( Charts ) Absolute Return fund , which is aimed at non-U.S. investors and thus spread GSAMP 's problems beyond our borders .
The second , B - 2 ( $ 8 million ) , went to the Morgan Keegan Select High Income fund .
( Like most of this article , this information is based on our reading of various public filings ; UBS and Morgan Keegan both declined to comment . )
Goldman would n't say , but it appears to have kept the 13th piece , the X tranche , which had a face value of $ 14 million ( and would have been worth much more had things gone as projected ) , as its fee for putting the deal together .
Goldman may have had money at risk in some of the other tranches , but there 's no way to know without Goldman 's cooperation , which was n't forthcoming .
How is a buyer of securities like these supposed to know how safe they are ?
There are two options .
The first is to do what we did : Read the 315 - page prospectus , related documents , and other public records with a jaundiced eye and try to see how things can go wrong .
The second is to rely on the underwriter and the credit- rating agencies - Moody 's and Standard & Poor's .
That , of course , is what nearly everyone does .
In any event , it 's impossible for investors to conduct an independent analysis of the borrowers ' credit quality even if they choose to invest the time , money , and effort to do so .
That 's because Goldman , like other assemblers of mortgage - backed deals , does n't tell investors who the borrowers are .
One Goldman filing lists more than 1,000 pages of individual loans - but they 're by code number and zip code , not name and address .
Even though the individual loans in GSAMP looked like financial toxic waste , 68 % of the issue , or $ 336 million , was rated AAA by both agencies - as secure as U.S. Treasury bonds .
Another $ 123 million , 25 % of the issue , was rated investment grade , at levels from AA to BBB --.
Thus , a total of 93 % was rated investment grade .
That 's despite the fact that this issue is backed by second mortgages of dubious quality on homes in which the borrowers ( most of whose income and financial assertions were n't vetted by anyone ) had less than 1 % equity and on which GSAMP could n't effectively foreclose .
It 's all in the math
How does toxic waste get distilled into spring water ?
Watch .
It 's all in the math - and the assumptions about how borrowers will behave .
These loans , which are fixed - rate , carried an average interest rate of 10.51 % .
After paying the people who collected the payments and handled all the other paperwork , the GSAMP Trust had ten percentage points left .
However , the interest on the securities that GSAMP issued ran to only about 7 % .
( We say " about " because some of the tranches are floating - rate rather than fixed - rate . )
The difference between GSAMP 's interest income and interest expense was projected at 2.85 % a year .
That spread was supposed to provide a cushion to offset defaults by borrowers .
In addition , the aforementioned X piece did n't get fixed monthly payments and thus provided another bit of protection for the 12 tranches ranked above it .
Remember that we 're dealing with securities , not actual loans .
Thus losses are n't shared equally by all of GSAMP 's investors .
Any loan losses would first hit the X tranche .
Then , if X were wiped out , the losses would work their way up the food chain tranche by tranche : B - 2 , B - 1 , M - 7 , and so on .
The $ 241 million A - 1 tranche , 60 % of which has already been repaid , was designed to be supersafe and quick - paying .
It gets first dibs on principal paydowns from regular monthly payments , refinancings , and borrowers paying off their loans because they 're selling their homes .
Then , after A - 1 is paid in full , it 's the turn of A - 2 and A - 3 , and so on down the line .
Moody 's projected in a public analysis of the issue that less than 10 % of the loans would ultimately default .
S&P , which gave the securities the same ratings that Moody 's did , almost certainly reached a similar conclusion but has n't filed a public analysis and would n't share its numbers with us .
As long as housing prices kept rising , it all looked copacetic .
Goldman peddled the securities in late April 2006 .
In a matter of months the mathematical models used to assemble and market this issue - and the models that Moody 's and S&P used to rate it - proved to be horribly flawed .
That 's because the models were based on recent performances of junk - mortgage borrowers , who had n't defaulted much until last year thanks to the housing bubble .
The fallout
Through the end of 2005 , if you could n't make your mortgage payments , you could generally get out from under by selling the house at a profit or refinancing it .
But in 2006 we hit an inflection point .
House prices began stagnating or falling in many markets .
Instead of HPA - industry shorthand for house - price appreciation - we had HPD : house - price depreciation .
Interest rates on mortgages stopped falling .
Way too late , as usual , regulators and lenders began imposing higher credit standards .
If you had borrowed 99 % - plus of the purchase price ( as the average GSAMP borrower did ) and could n't make your payments , could n't refinance , and could n't sell at a profit , it was over .
Lights out .
As a second - mortgage holder , GSAMP could n't foreclose on deadbeats unless the first - mortgage holder also foreclosed .
That 's because to foreclose on a second mortgage , you have to repay the first mortgage in full , and there was no money set aside to do that .
So if a borrower decided to keep on paying the first mortgage but not the second , the holder of the second would get bagged .
If the holder of the first mortgage foreclosed , there was likely to be little or nothing left for GSAMP , the second - mortgage holder .
Indeed , the monthly reports issued by Deutsche Bank ( Charts ) , the issue 's trustee , indicate that GSAMP has recovered almost nothing on its foreclosed loans .
By February 2007 , Moody 's and S&P began downgrading the issue .
Both agencies dropped the top-rated tranches all the way to BBB from their original AAA , depressing the securities ' market price substantially .
In March , less than a year after the issue was sold , GSAMP began defaulting on its obligations .
By the end of September , 18 % of the loans had defaulted , according to Deutsche Bank .
As a result , the X tranche , both B tranches , and the four bottom M tranches have been wiped out , and M - 3 is being chewed up like a frame house with termites .
At this point , there 's no way to know whether any of the A tranches will ultimately be impaired .
" [ In hindsight , ] I think we would not have rated it " had Moody 's realized what was going on in the junk - mortgage market , says Nicolas Weill , the firm 's chief credit officer for structured finance .
Low credit scores and high loan - to - value ratios were taken into account in Moody 's original analysis , of course , but the firm now thinks there were things it did n't know about .
Weill does n't lay blame on any particular party , although in a Sept. 25 special report posted on Moody 's website , he called for " additional third - party oversight that reviews the accuracy of the information provided by borrowers , appraisers , and brokers to originators " when it comes to junk issues .
Or , as he calls them , " non-prime . "
S&P , by contrast , says that it considers both its original rating and subsequent downward revisions correct .
" We used the best information available at the time , " says Vickie Tillman , S&P 's chief rating officer .
If you read documents that Goldman filed with the SEC in connection with this offering , you discover that they warn about pretty much everything we 've discussed so far and some things we have n't : the impact of falling house prices , the difficulty of foreclosing , the possible changes in credit ratings , the fact that more than half the mortgages were in California , Florida , and New York , all of which were overheated markets .
It 's all disclosed .
In capital letters .
So no buyer - and this is aimed at sophisticated investors - can say he was n't warned .
Goldman said it made money in the third quarter by shorting an index of mortgage - backed securities .
That prompted Fortune to ask the firm to explain to us how it had managed to come out ahead while so many of its mortgage - backed customers were getting stomped .
Goldman 's profits came from hedging the mortgage securities it keeps in inventory in order to make trading markets .
It said in a recent SEC filing , " Although we recognized significant losses on our non-prime mortgage loans and securities , those losses were more than offset by gains on short mortgage positions . "
As we interpret this - the firm declined to elaborate - Goldman made more on its hedges than it lost on its inventory because junk mortgages fell even more sharply than Goldman thought they would .
What is there to take away from our course in Junk Mortgages 101 ?
Two things .
First , you have to pay at least some attention to all those " risk factors " that issuers forever warn you about - especially when you 're dealing with a whole new thing like junk mortgages issued en masse instead of by specialists .
Second , when you rely on the underwriter and the rating agencies to do all your homework for you , you do n't have safety .
You have only the illusion of safety .

BAGHDAD – Hundreds of thousands of widows are becoming the silent tragedy of a country sliding deeper into chaos by the day .
Widows are the flip side of violence that has meant more than a million men dead , detained or disabled , Iraqi NGOs estimate .
These men ’s wives or mothers now carry the burden of running the families .
" The total figure of men who have been killed , disabled or detained for long periods of time adds up to more than one and a half million , " Khalid Hameed , chief of the Iraqi al - Raya human rights organization told IPS .
" The average number of Iraqi family members is seven , so about ten million Iraqis are facing the worst living circumstances . "
In these circumstances , he said , women have had to " search for ways to survive and support their families at a time when not much help comes from the international community . "
Most international NGOs left the country by last year apparently on the advice of governments of their countries pointing to growing violence and dangers to NGO members .
" International NGOs were conducting support projects for Iraqi women before they suddenly quit and left the country in a rush in October 2005 , " Faris Daghistani , who was project manager at the Baghdad mission for the Italian humanitarian aid organization in Iraq INTERSOS told IPS .
" There was a wide focus on working women and how to support them by training and providing them with necessary tools to raise income on their own , " he said .
" It is a pity that most of our productive projects have stopped , and we had to leave women to face their fate on their own . "
The violence since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 is not the first to have taken its toll .
Hundreds of thousands of men were killed , taken prisoner or disabled during the 1980 - 1988 war between Iran and Iraq .
" We have never lived our lives as human beings should live , " 42 - year - old Dr. Shatha Ahmed told IPS at her home in Baghdad .
" The Iraq - Iran war took our fathers , and now the Bush war is taking our husbands and sons . "
Women now face a long struggle surviving and bringing up families on their own , she said .
" We could not even dream of developing our own skills . "
Dr. Shatha ’s husband , also a doctor , was killed by Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army in September this year when he was leaving the Ministry of Health offices in Baghdad .
She now has to support her family , and her husband ’s parents as well .
Some help is on offer to widows through groups such as the Iraqi Red Crescent , the Islamic Party , the Muslim Scholars Association and non-governmental organizations .
But this support is not well organized , and is insufficient to help the growing number of widows .
The Social Affairs Office of the government has started paying the equivalent of about 100 dollars monthly to widows .
But this payment cannot support whole families , given particularly the skyrocketing inflation .
And the payment is not easy to get .
" I had to pay a lot of money as bribes to government officials in order to get the monthly support payment , and that is not enough to support my big family , " 47 - year - old widow Haja Saadiya Hussein from Baghdad told IPS .
" Americans killed my husband last year near a checkpoint , and now I have to work as a servant in government officials ’ houses to earn a living for my six children .
I have stopped them going to school , to cut my expenses . "
Some widows have attempted to remarry in order to find support .
Some second husbands , who are usually older , offer to take care of their new sons for religious reasons .
" There can be no compensation for losing a husband , " a spokesperson from the Iraqi Red Crescent ’s social support department told IPS .
On the highway ( TGW ) – AFS Trinity Power Corporation revealed its XH - 150 hybrid SUV today , which gets 150 miles per gallon , and goes 40 miles on electricity alone , at the North American International Auto Show ( NAIAS ) in Detroit .
Also , the eXtreme Hybrid - 150 has rapid acceleration , even in full electric mode , and highway speeds of up to 87 miles per hour in either hybrid or electric mode .
The car is n’t “ a small two - seater , ” says CEO Edward Furia ; it ’s a , “ medium - size family SUV designed to support a serious supermarket run or a family ’s weekend recreational activities . ”
The next step for the company is to license its breakthrough technology to carmakers , Furia said .
“ However , ” he continued , “ If carmakers decide not to take advantage of this offer , AFS Trinity intends to raise the funds to begin modifying existing hybrids or manufacture its own 150 mpg SUV’s and , eventually , 250 mpg sedans .
We believe such production models could be available for sale in three years . ”
Trinity ’s new technology is expected to increase the cost of SUVs by about $ 8700 .
That means if gas prices stay around $ 2.85 , cost savings could “ repay the purchase price premium in 3.5 years . ”
How it works
Typically , hybrids only use electric motors at low speeds or in combination with gasoline for maximum speeds .
AFS Trinity , on the other hand , took a purist position .
The gasoline engine does n’t start until the electric battery runs down .
The car also uses ultracapacitors to capture much more energy from when the driver hits the breaks .
The idea behind the AFS Trinity uses a basic rule of thumb : most drivers drive less than 40 miles a day .
That allows drivers to charge up their cars at night , and if need be for the car to go long distances , they can use oil .

GOP staffers sensed Pelosi plot in temporary Fox News blackout
When Fox News programming mysteriously disappeared last week from televisions at the US Capitol , some Republican Congressional aides were quick to suspect foul play , according to a DC newspaper .
" Staffers looking for their daily dose of ' We report , you decide ' coverage on Wednesday flipped to the usual channel , only to be surprised to find dead air , " report Roll Call 's Emily Heil and Anna Palmer .
" Conspiracy theories , unsurprisingly , abounded . "
Eyeing Democrats as likely culprits , some Republicans on the Hill suggested a far - ranging plot reaching even the highest levels of majority leadership .
 I sense Pelosis behind this ,  one finger - pointing GOP staffer told Roll Call of Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) .
Another Republican aide described the horrors of being compelled to watch other networks ' news coverage during the work day .
" I was just forced to watch an MSNBC segment on going green by shopping at farmers markets , " the withdrawal - afflicted staffer told the paper .
" We need Fox back , stat . "
But last Friday afternoon , when Fox News finally reappeared on the Capitol channel lineup , the explanation for its absence -- the " official " explanation , at least -- did n't quite match the intrigue of a Pelosi - mandated political silencing :
The Hill had just been experiencing some minor technical difficulties .
" A Fox engineer explained that there was a technical glitch as the network shifted its feeds from analog to digital , " reports Roll Call .
" The receivers in the Capitol are being upgraded , too , he said , contributing to the problems .
But all , he promises , is right again . "

I came across an article a few days ago written by John Hockenberry , an award - winning journalist who once worked for NBC ’s Dateline and is now a fellow at MIT ’s Media Lab .
Titled “ You Don’t Understand Our Audience ” :
What I learned about network television at Dateline NBC , this article is a relentless , burning indictment of everything that ’s wrong with the mainstream media today .
In a future era , when historians look back on our time and ask how so many people could have been deceived into supporting the disastrous , nightmarish war in Iraq and ignoring so many other pressing issues , Hockenberry ’s article will be Exhibit A .
Point by devastating point , Hockenberry shows us exactly what ’s wrong with the media : their mindless pursuit of “ balance ” on even the most non-controversial issues of fact :
Our story [ on America ’s “ shock and awe ” attacks at the beginning of the war ] arranged pictures of people coping with the bombing into a slide show , accompanied by the voice of Melinda Liu , a Newsweek reporter describing , over the phone , the harrowing experience of remaining in Baghdad .
The outcome of the invasion was still in doubt .
There was fear in the reporter ’s voice and on the faces of the people in the pictures .
… At the conclusion of the screening … an NBC / GE executive responsible for “ standards ” shook his head and wondered about the tone in the reporter ’s voice .
“ Does n’t it seem like she has a point of view here ? ” he asked .
The way they shove legitimate , critically important stories aside to make room for feel - good fluff , pandering to their viewers rather than risk upsetting them by telling them things they might not already know :
I had been in Corvo ’s office to propose a series of stories about al - Qaeda , which was just emerging as a suspect in the attacks .
While well known in security circles and among journalists who tried to cover international Islamist movements , al - Qaeda as a terrorist organization and a story line was still obscure in the early days after September 11 .
It had occurred to me and a number of other journalists that a core mission of NBC News would now be to explain , even belatedly , the origins and significance of these organizations .
But Zucker insisted that Dateline stay focused on the firefighters .
The story of firefighters trapped in the crumbling towers , Zucker said , was the emotional center of this whole event .
Corvo enthusiastically agreed .
“ Maybe , ” said Zucker , “ we ought to do a series of specials on firehouses where we just ride along with our cameras .
Like the show Cops , only with firefighters . ”
He told Corvo he could make room in the prime - time lineup for firefighters , but then smiled at me and said , in effect , that he had no time for any subtitled interviews with jihadists raging about Palestine .
The way news organizations are literally forced by corporate executives to choose certain stories to air in order to better promote other programs on the same network ( I had n’t known about this , and it floored me to hear it ) :
Sometimes entertainment actually drove selection of news stories .
Since Dateline was the lead - in to the hit series Law & Order on Friday nights , it was understood that on Fridays we did crime .
Sunday was a little looser but still a hard sell for news that was n’t obvious or close to the all - important emotional center .
In 2003 , I was told that a story on the emergence from prison of a former member of the Weather Underground , whose son had graduated from Yale University and won a Rhodes Scholarship , would not fly unless it dovetailed with a story line on a then - struggling , soon - to - be - cancelled , and now - forgotten Sunday - night drama called American Dreams , which was set in the 1960s .
I was told that the Weather Underground story might be viable if American Dreams did an episode on “ protesters or something . ”
The way obvious conflicts of interest are steadfastly ignored :
At mandatory , hours - long “ ethics training ” meetings we would watch in - house videos that brought all the drama and depth of a driver ’s - education film to stories of smiling , swaggering employees ( bad ) who bought cases of wine for business associates on their expense accounts , while the thoughtful , cautious employees ( good ) never picked up a check , but volunteered to stay at the Red Roof Inn in pursuit of “ shareholder value . ”
… I did , however , point out to the corporate - integrity people unhelpful details about how NBC News was covering wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that our GE parent company stood to benefit from as a major defense contractor .
I wondered aloud , in the presence of an integrity “ team leader , ” how we were to reconcile this larger - scale conflict with the admonitions about free dinners .
“ You make an interesting point I had not thought of before , ” he told me .
“ But I do n’t know how GE being a defense contractor is really relevant to the way we do our jobs here at NBC news . ”
And the way in which legitimate , serious issues are barred from the table because they ’re not telegenic enough :
In 2003 , one of our producers obtained from a trial lawyer in Connecticut video footage of guards subduing a mentally ill prisoner .
Guards themselves took the footage as part of a safety program to ensure that deadly force was avoided and abuses were documented for official review .
We saw guards haul the prisoner down a greenish corridor , then heard hysterical screaming as the guard shooting the video dispassionately announced , “ The prisoner is resisting . ”
For 90 seconds several guards pressed the inmate into a bunk .
All that could be seen of him was his feet .
By the end of the video the inmate was motionless .
Asphyxiation would be the official cause of death .
… Yet at the conclusion of the screening , the senior producer shook his head as though the story had missed the mark widely .
“ These inmates are n’t necessarily sympathetic to our audience , ” he said .
The fact that they had been diagnosed with schizophrenia was unimportant .
Worse , he said that as he watched the video of the dying inmate , it did n’t seem as if anything was wrong .
“ Except that the inmate died , ” I offered .
“ But that ’s not what it looks like .
All you can see is his feet . ” … ” But , ” I pleaded , “ the man died .
That ’s just a fact .
The prison guards shot this footage , and I do n’t think their idea was to get it on Dateline . ”
“ Look , ” the producer said sharply , “ in an era when most of our audience has seen the Rodney King video , where you can clearly see someone being beaten , this just does n’t hold up . ”
“ Rodney King was n’t a prisoner , ” I appealed .
“ He did n’t die , and this mentally ill inmate is not auditioning to be the next Rodney King .
These are the actual pictures of his death . ”
“ You do n’t understand our audience . ”
There ’s much , much more in the article , and I ca n’t recommend highly enough that you read the whole thing .
I swore off network TV news long ago , as well as CNN and Fox , and I ca n’t be happier that I did .
It ’s now thoroughly clear , to any thinking person , that their sole reason for existing is to soothe us and pander to us so we ’ll sit still long enough to watch the commercials .
Any idea of informing the public , of telling us the facts we need to know to make informed judgments on important issues , is long , long gone .
For all that blogs are derided as uncouth and radical by the self - appointed guardians of the mainstream , many of them contain more original , relevant , insightful reporting and analysis than the major news networks can muster in days .
These lumbering corporate behemoths have already begun to slide into irrelevance , but the sooner we can bring about their collapse , the better .
Kucinich will sit it out
This just in from the state Supreme Court : NBC / MSNBC win , Kucinich loses .
The congressman from Ohio wo n’t be on stage at the televised debate in 45 minutes .
He argued that the network offered , and then withdrew , an offer that he participate in the debate , and he protested .
The court disagreed .
We ’re waiting now to hear the reason for the ruling .
Stay tuned .

Late last night the White House submitted a curious court filing ( PDF ) in the ongoing case over the 5 to 10 million emails , spanning 2003 to 2005 , that have gone missing from its archives due to a “ technical issue . ”
Faced with a court order ( PDF ) , the White House said that it has backup tapes of its email records — but only after October 2003 , when it stopped recycling its backups .
This means that there are apparently no backups of messages sent and received during the previous ten months of 2003 — an important time period , covering the run up to the Iraq war , as well as the outing of Valerie Plame Wilson ’s covert identity .
As if this story could n’t get more convoluted , the White House is also claiming it does n’t know whether any emails from that period are actually missing .
“ They suggest that they do n’t even know if they have anomalies , but there ’s plenty of public record evidence that they do [ know ] , ” says Anne Weismann , chief counsel for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , which , along with the National Security Archives ( NSA ) , is suing the administration to ensure the preservation of presidential records .
“ This is an extremely carefully worded declaration that when you parse it through does n’t really say a whole lot , ” Weismann said .
One thing the declaration does confirm is the existence of backups for the vast majority of emails sent since October 2003 .
While both CREW and NSA acknowledge that this is good news , their representatives stressed the importance of the months for which backup tapes were recycled .
“ It ’s a pretty important period of time to just by coincidence be missing backup tapes , ” Weismann said .
Both Weismann and Meredith Fuchs , the NSA ’s general counsel , noted that it had taken the plaintiffs months to even learn what the White House had preserved .
“ It ’s kind of remarkable it took a court order for the White House to say that they have backups from Oct 2003 to now , ” Fuchs said .
If the White House is trying to prevent its internal communications from becoming public records , delaying tactics and unclear answers work to its benefit .
The more you use a computer after losing a file , the harder it is to recover .
According to the original court order , “ [ E ] mails that might now be retrievable from email account folders or ‘ slack space ’ on individual workstations are increasingly likely to be deleted or overwritten with the passage of time . ”
Fuchs worries that continued difficulties in obtaining basic information from the White House could imperil the recovery of any emails that were in fact deleted .
“ Their desire is to not to tell the public what ’s going on , but the longer it ’s delayed the more likely it is the records will disappear forever , ” Fuchs said .
The administration ’s response to the court order is far from the end of this story .
It has yet to clarify what if any communications it is missing prior to October 2003 , and both NSA and CREW indicated they will probably file responses in the next few days .
“ We ’re hoping to make a filing , ” Weismann said .
“ It would point out what we think are the flaws or the gaping holes in the declaration . ”
Going forward , Fuchs said , the court will have to decide whether it should order the White House to do more to preserve media that may contain emails from earlier in 2003 .
“ And how did they discover [ the missing emails problem ] and stop recycling their backups ?
Something happened and I want to know what that is . ”
One thing that might make CREW and NSA ’s slog a bit easier would be increased congressional involvement .
In their filings , the plaintiffs refer to a “ detailed analysis ” of the lost emails and the White House refers to a “ chart ” of which emails may have gone missing .
They may or may not be referring to the same document , but CREW has tried to obtain the “ detailed analysis ” under the Freedom of Information Act .
They have so far been unsuccessful , but the plaintiffs have repeatedly indicated that a Congressional subpoena could really grease the wheels of justice .
Tyler Cowen makes one excellent point and one debatable one in the comments :
Cities are mostly low - carbon because they discourage people from having children , or limit the number of children people decide to have .
( Taxing education , or other correlates of children , is in fact one substitute for a carbon tax . )
But cities also export their complementary and indeed financially required pollution to more distant geographic areas ; that means that cities are not low - carbon per se .
Dense cities are a tax on having children , but that 's not an inherent quality of cities .
If we had taller buildings next to spots of green space , you could have more residential space and a convenient play space , and built - in play spaces for your children .
If you had school choice , you could solve many of the fears about the urban school system that lead affluent families to flee the city .
If the tax system were n't set up so that localities bear the responsibility for caring for the indigent , you would n't have affluent families moving out to get away from the tax burden .
A dense city is in many places a better place to raise a child than a suburb : you spend a lot fewer years shuttling the kids around , and there are many more options and activities for them than for suburban children .
But current political culture makes them child - unfriendly .
To be sure , one cannot just wish away current political culture , but if I am imagining something as unlikely as a change in transportation subsidies , cannot I then imagine a more sanely conducted city government ?
On the carbon export angle , I completely agree .
City dwellers are far too self - satisfied with their allegedly low - carbon lifestyle , too willing to impose carbon taxes in the belief it wo n't affect them much .
It is especially irritating to hear people who take multiple annual long - haul flights complain about SUV drivers , but the general phenomenon is broader than that .
I expect that in the event a carbon tax is enacted , I will see a lot of my costs go up -- as they should , to the extent that I am exporting my carbon emissions elsewhere .
But nonetheless , I do n't think they 'll go up as much as those of people in suburban homes , because heating , cooling , and driving to those homes really is simply massively less efficient than doing the same thing in an urban area .
You ’ve got this great idea for a software product .
You are pretty confident that you can crank out version 1.0 working full - time on your own from the spare room , and you are fairly confident that people will buy it .
But you ’ve also got a well paid full - time job ‘ working for the man ’ .
It ’s cosy and familiar in that cubicle .
Is it worth risking your career and savings to set out into uncharted waters on your own ?
Do you take the red pill or the blue pill ?
The aim of this article is just to give you some insight into the economic realities of becoming a one man software company ( a microISV ) .
The results might surprise you .
‘ Working for the man ’ you get a steady monthly income every month .
Working for yourself you start off with no income , while you create your product .
If all goes well you start to make sales when you release v1.0 and these sales gradually improve over time until you are earning the same amount each month as when you were working for the man .
As the sales continue to improve you ( hopefully ) reach the point where you have made as much money as if you had stayed in your old job for the same period of time .
From here on it ’s all gravy .
Here is a very simple model :
Monthly income as microISV vs WFTM ( T0=version 1.0 release , T1 =monthly income equal to WFTM , T2 =areas under the red and blue lines are the same )
Obviously I am making a lot of assumptions and simplifications here .
In particular I am assuming :
Net income from microISV sales rises linearly month - on - month as soon as you release v1.0 .
Obviously this ca n’t happen forever ( or you will be richer than Bill Gates ) but it seems as good a guess as any and it keeps the mathematics simple .
MicroISV start - up expenses ( buying a domain name , starting your company , buying equipment and software , getting an Internet connection etc ) are fairly low compared your monthly WFTM salary .
Even though the model is embarrassingly over - simplified , I think it can still give some insights .
If I plug some numbers for T0 and T1 into a simple spreadsheet I can come up with values for T2 .
I ’ll choose numbers that I consider optimistic , realistic and pessimistic for each .
For T0 ( time to V1.0 ) I choose 3 , 6 and 12 months .
For T1 ( time to same income as WFTM ) I choose 12 , 18 and 24 months .
Months required to reach T2
i.e. if it takes you 6 months to get V1.0 out and then another 18 months until it is making the same monthly income ( after expenses ) as WFTM then it will take you 47 months to reach the point where a microISV has made you more money than WFTM .
So how much do you need in the way of savings to survive until you have a decent income ?
I can work this out by assuming living expenses as some proportion of WFTM monthly income .
Calculating for 50 % ( living on noodles ) and 100 % ( full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes ) :
Maximum debt in months of WFTM income with living expenses=50 % of WFTM income
Maximum debt in months of WFTM income with living expenses=100 % of WFTM income
i.e. if it takes you 6 months to get V1.0 out and then another 18 months until it is making the same monthly income ( after expenses ) as WFTM and your living expenses are 50 % of your WFTM income then your maximum debt is 5 months of WFTM income .
I think the results of this simple little model make a few points :
Rate of sales growth is critical but the the time to getting v1.0 out is also very important .
The longer it takes , the more you have to catch up later .
You are unlikely to come out financially ahead after 2 years as a microISV , even with fairly optimistic sales figures .
It could easily take 3 or 4 years and , if the sales do n’t take off or level out too early , you may never get there .
There are many reasons to start a microISV , but getting rich quick is n’t one of them .
Given that you ca n’t know what T1 will be for your product , you should probably have at least 6 months WFTM income in the bank .
Preferably 12 months .
Learn to love noodles .

So which is it going to be , the red pill or the blue pill ?
MEMBERS of Congress have accused Yahoo ! of lying about its co-operation with the Chinese Government in an incident that led to a dissident 's imprisonment .
Congressmen said on Tuesday that one of Yahoo !'s executives testified falsely last year about how much it knew about China 's 2004 investigation into Shi Tao , a Yahoo ! user .
The executive had said the company " had no information about the nature of the investigation " when it received a demand for Mr Shi 's email records from China 's State Security Ministry .
In fact , the demand specifically said the information was for " a case of suspected illegal provision of state secrets " , a charge frequently made against dissidents .
Some in CIA want to re-hire top notch spy , despite lies about citizenship RAW STORY

An illegal Lebanese immigrant did such a good job as a spy after lying her way into jobs with the FBI and CIA that there are calls within the intelligence agency to re-hire her , according to a new report .
Nada Nadim Prouty pleaded guilty this week to fraudulently obtaining US citizenship and accessing FBI files on Hezbollah , which the US labels a terrorist organization .
Un - named CIA sources tell the New York Daily News that Prouty worked for the CIA 's Baghdad station sometime between 2003 and 2006 , where she excelled at blending in with locals and breaking down captured al Qaeda " high - value targets . "
Prouty did such a good job with the CIA that some in the agency want her back , reports James Gordon Meek .
" She was not only good at debriefing HVTs [ high - value targets ] , she was able to pose as a native Arab and easily blend in , " a source told the paper .
Officials insist Prouty is not suspected of being a Hezbollah mole while working for the CIA .
" There is no indication at this point that she was engaged in espionage " for Hezbollah while at the agency , a senior US official familiar with the case tells Meek .
However there is some disagreement on this point .
" Other knowledgeable sources are convinced otherwise , " Meek reports .
" Her brother - in - law is a fugitive Hezbollah fund - raiser who helped her lie to win U.S. citizenship seven years before she joined the FBI in 1999 . "
" She scoured FBI files for his name , Talal Khalil Chahine , " he continues .
" She once worked for him in Detroit .
Her defenders say she was rifling files out of worry for her sister , who married him in 2000 . "
Meek provided more details about Prouty 's alleged Hezbollah ties in an earlier article .
" Allegedly a friend of top Hezbollah leaders , [ Chahine ] sent a letter to U.S. immigration officials in 1992 saying [ Prouty 's ] sham marriage was for real , " Meek reported .
" Prouty used to wait tables in his La Shish cafes .
In August 2000 , Prouty 's sister married Chahine .
A month later the rookie FBI agent searched the bureau 's Automated Case Support computer system for her name , her sister 's and Chahine's . "

HUMAN beings have spent most of their time on the planet as hunter - gatherers .
From at least 85,000 years ago to the birth of agriculture around 73,000 years later , they combined hunted meat with gathered veg .
Some people , such as those on North Sentinel Island in the Andaman Sea , still do .
The Sentinelese are the only hunter - gatherers who still resist contact with the outside world .
Fine - looking specimens — strong , slim , fit , black and stark naked except for a small plant - fibre belt round the waist — they are the very model of the noble savage .
Genetics suggests that indigenous Andaman islanders have been isolated since the very first expansion out of Africa more than 60,000 years ago .
About 12,000 years ago people embarked on an experiment called agriculture and some say that they , and their planet , have never recovered .
Farming brought a population explosion , protein and vitamin deficiency , new diseases and deforestation .
Human height actually shrank by nearly six inches after the first adoption of crops in the Near East .
So was agriculture “ the worst mistake in the history of the human race ” , as Jared Diamond , evolutionary biologist and professor of geography at the University of California , Los Angeles , once called it ?
Take a snapshot of the old world 15,000 years ago .
Except for bits of Siberia , it was full of a new and clever kind of people who had originated in Africa and had colonised first their own continent , then Asia , Australia and Europe , and were on the brink of populating the Americas .
They had spear throwers , boats , needles , adzes , nets .
They painted pictures , decorated their bodies and believed in spirits .
They traded foods , shells , raw materials and ideas .
They sang songs , told stories and prepared herbal medicines .
They were “ hunter - gatherers ” .
On the whole the men hunted and the women gathered : a sexual division of labour is still universal among non-farming people and was probably not shared by their Homo erectus predecessors .
This enabled them to eat both meat and veg , a clever trick because it combines quality with reliability .
Why change ?
In the late 1970s Mark Cohen , an archaeologist , first suggested that agriculture was born of desperation , rather than inspiration .
Evidence from the Fertile Crescent seems to support him .
Rising human population density , combined perhaps with a cooling , drying climate , left the Natufian hunter - gatherers of the region short of acorns , gazelles and wild grass seeds .
Somebody started trying to preserve and enhance a field of chickpeas or wheat - grass and soon planting , weeding , reaping and threshing were born .
Quite independently , people took the same step in at least six other parts of the world over the next few thousand years : the Yangzi valley , the central valley of New Guinea , Mexico , the Andes , West Africa and the Amazon basin .
And it seems that Eden came to an end .
Not only had hunter - gatherers enjoyed plenty of protein , not much fat and ample vitamins in their diet , but it also seems they did not have to work very hard .
The Hadza of Tanzania “ work ” about 14 hours a week , the ! Kung of Botswana not much more .
The first farmers were less healthy than the hunter - gatherers had been in their heyday .
Aside from their shorter stature , they had more skeletal wear and tear from the hard work , their teeth rotted more , they were short of protein and vitamins and they caught diseases from domesticated animals : measles from cattle , flu from ducks , plague from rats and worms from using their own excrement as fertiliser .
They also got a bad attack of inequality for the first time .
Hunter - gatherers ' dependence on sharing each other 's hunting and gathering luck makes them remarkably egalitarian .
A successful farmer , however , can afford to buy the labour of others , and that makes him more successful still , until eventually — especially in an irrigated river valley , where he controls the water — he can become an emperor imposing his despotic whim upon subjects .
Friedrich Engels was probably right to identify agriculture with a loss of political innocence .
Agriculture also stands accused of exacerbating sexual inequality .
In many peasant farming communities , men make women do much of the hard work .
Among hunter - gathering folk , men usually bring fewer calories than women , and have a tiresome tendency to prefer catching big and infrequent prey so they can show off , rather than small and frequent catches that do not rot before they are eaten .
But the men do at least contribute .
Recently , though , anthropologists have subtly revised the view that the invention of agriculture was a fall from grace .
They have found the serpent in hunter - gatherer Eden , the savage in the noble savage .
Maybe it was not an 80,000 - year camping holiday after all .

In 2006 two Indian fishermen , in a drunken sleep aboard their little boat , drifted over the reef and fetched up on the shore of North Sentinel Island .
They were promptly killed by the inhabitants .
Their bodies are still there : the helicopter that went to collect them was driven away by a hail of arrows and spears .
The Sentinelese do not welcome trespassers .
Only very occasionally have they been lured down to the beach of their tiny island home by gifts of coconuts and only once or twice have they taken these gifts without sending a shower of arrows in return .
Several archaeologists and anthropologists now argue that violence was much more pervasive in hunter - gatherer society than in more recent eras .
From the
! Kung in the Kalahari to the Inuit in the Arctic and the aborigines in Australia , two - thirds of modern hunter - gatherers are in a state of almost constant tribal warfare , and nearly 90 % go to war at least once a year .
War is a big word for dawn raids , skirmishes and lots of posturing , but death rates are high — usually around 25 - 30 % of adult males die from homicide .
The warfare death rate of 0.5 % of the population per year that Lawrence Keeley of the University of Illinois calculates as typical of hunter - gatherer societies would equate to 2 billion people dying during the 20th century .
At first , anthropologists were inclined to think this a modern pathology .
But it is increasingly looking as if it is the natural state .
Richard Wrangham of Harvard University says that chimpanzees and human beings are the only animals in which males engage in co-operative and systematic homicidal raids .
The death rate is similar in the two species .
Steven LeBlanc , also of Harvard , says Rousseauian wishful thinking has led academics to overlook evidence of constant violence .
MEPL
I know it 's a drag Godric , but it 's progress
Not so many women as men die in warfare , it is true .
But that is because they are often the object of the fighting .
To be abducted as a sexual prize was almost certainly a common female fate in hunter - gatherer society .
Forget the Garden of Eden ; think Mad Max .
Constant warfare was necessary to keep population density down to one person per square mile .
Farmers can live at 100 times that density .
Hunter - gatherers may have been so lithe and healthy because the weak were dead .
The invention of agriculture and the advent of settled society merely swapped high mortality for high morbidity , allowing people some relief from chronic warfare so they could at least grind out an existence , rather than being ground out of existence altogether .
Notice a close parallel with the industrial revolution .
When rural peasants swapped their hovels for the textile mills of Lancashire , did it feel like an improvement ?
The Dickensian view is that factories replaced a rural idyll with urban misery , poverty , pollution and illness .
Factories were indeed miserable and the urban poor were overworked and underfed .
But they had flocked to take the jobs in factories often to get away from the cold , muddy , starving rural hell of their birth .
Homo sapiens wrought havoc on many ecosystems as Homo erectus had not
Eighteenth - century rural England was a place where people starved each spring as the winter stores ran out , where in bad years and poor districts long hours of agricultural labour — if it could be got — barely paid enough to keep body and soul together , and a place where the “ putting - out ” system of textile manufacture at home drove workers harder for lower pay than even the factories would .
( Ask Zambians today why they take ill - paid jobs in Chinese - managed mines , or Vietnamese why they sew shirts in multinational - owned factories . )
The industrial revolution caused a population explosion because it enabled more babies to survive — malnourished , perhaps , but at least alive .
Returning to hunter - gatherers , Mr LeBlanc argues ( in his book “ Constant Battles ” ) that all was not well in ecological terms , either .
Homo sapiens wrought havoc on many ecosystems as Homo erectus had not .
There is no longer much doubt that people were the cause of the extinction of the megafauna in North America 11,000 years ago and Australia 30,000 years before that .
The mammoths and giant kangaroos never stood a chance against co-ordinated ambush with stone - tipped spears and relentless pursuit by endurance runners .
This was also true in Eurasia .
The earliest of the great cave painters , working at Chauvet in southern France , 32,000 years ago , was obsessed with rhinoceroses .
A later artist , working at Lascaux 15,000 years later , depicted mostly bison , bulls and horses — rhinoceroses must have been driven close to extinction by then .
At first , modern human beings around the Mediterranean relied almost entirely on large mammals for meat .
They ate small game only if it was slow moving — tortoises and limpets were popular .
Then , gradually and inexorably , starting in the Middle East , they switched their attention to smaller animals , and especially to warm - blooded , fast - breeding species , such as rabbits , hares , partridges and smaller gazelles .
The archaeological record tells this same story at sites in Israel , Turkey and Italy .
Bridgeman Art Library
Another fine environmental mess we 've got ourselves into
The reason for this shift , say Mary Stiner and Steven Kuhn of the University of Arizona , was that human population densities were growing too high for the slower - reproducing prey such as tortoises , horses and rhinos .
Only the fast - breeding rabbits , hares and partridges , and for a while gazelles , could cope with such hunting pressure .
This trend accelerated about 15,000 years ago as large game and tortoises disappeared from the Mediterranean diet altogether — driven to the brink of extinction by human predation .
In times of prey scarcity , Homo erectus , like other predators , had simply suffered local extinction ; these new people could innovate their way out of trouble — they could shift their niche .
In response to demographic pressure , they developed better weapons which enabled them to catch smaller , faster prey , which in turn enabled them to survive at high densities , though at the expense of extinguishing many larger and slower - breeding prey .
Under this theory , the atlatl or spear - throwing stick was invented 18,000 years ago as a response to a Malthusian crisis , not just because it seemed like a good idea .
Soon collecting wild grass seeds evolved into planting and reaping crops , which meant fewer proteins and vitamins but ample calories
What 's more , the famously “ affluent society ” of hunter - gatherers , with plenty of time to gossip by the fire between hunts and gathers , turns out to be a bit of a myth , or at least an artefact of modern life .
The measurements of time spent getting food by the !
Kung omitted food - processing time and travel time , partly because the anthropologists gave their subjects lifts in their vehicles and lent them metal knives to process food .
Agriculture was presumably just another response to demographic pressure .
A new threat of starvation — probably during the millennium - long dry , cold “ snap ” known as the Younger Dryas about 13,000 years ago — prompted some hunter - gatherers in the Levant to turn much more vegetarian .
Soon collecting wild grass seeds evolved into planting and reaping crops , which reduced people 's intake of proteins and vitamins , but brought ample calories , survival and fertility .
The fact that something similar happened six more times in human history over the next few thousand years — in Asia , New Guinea , at least three places in the Americas and one in Africa — supports the notion of invention as a response to demographic pressure .
In each case the early farmers , though they might be short , sick and subjugated , could at least survive and breed , enabling them eventually to overwhelm the remaining hunter - gatherers of their respective continents .
It is irrelevant to ask whether we would have been better off to stay as hunter - gatherers .
Being a niche - shifting species , we could not help moving on .
Willingly or not , humanity had embarked 50,000 years ago on the road called “ progress ” with constant change in habits driven by invention mothered by necessity .
Even 40,000 years ago , technology and lifestyle were in a state of continuous change , especially in western Eurasia .
By 34,000 years ago people were making bone points for spears , and by 26,000 years ago they were making needles .
Harpoons and other fishing tackle appear at 18,000 years ago , as do bone spear throwers , or atlatls .
String was almost certainly in use then — how do you catch rabbits except in nets and snares ?
Nor was this virtuosity confined to practicalities .
A horse , carved from mammoth - ivory and worn smooth by being used as a pendant , dates from 32,000 years ago in Germany .
By the time of Sungir , an open - air settlement from 28,000 years ago at a spot near the city of Vladimir , north - east of Moscow , people were being buried with thousands of laboriously carved ivory beads and even little wheel - shaped bone ornaments .
Incessant innovation is a characteristic of human beings .
Agriculture , the domestication of animals and plants , must be seen in the context of this progressive change .
It was just another step : hunter - gatherers may have been using fire to encourage the growth of root plants in southern Africa 80,000 years ago .
At 15,000 years ago people first domesticated another species — the wolf ( though it was probably the wolves that took the initiative ) .
After 12,000 years ago came crops .
The internet and the mobile phone were in some vague sense almost predestined 50,000 years ago to appear eventually .
There is a modern moral in this story .
We have been creating ecological crises for ourselves and our habitats for tens of thousands of years .
We have been solving them , too .
Pessimists will point out that each solution only brings us face to face with the next crisis , optimists that no crisis has proved insoluble yet .
Just as we rebounded from the extinction of the megafauna and became even more numerous by eating first rabbits then grass seeds , so in the early 20th century we faced starvation for lack of fertiliser when the population was a billion people , but can now look forward with confidence to feeding 10 billion on less land using synthetic nitrogen , genetically high - yield crops and tractors .
When we eventually reverse the build - up in carbon dioxide , there will be another issue waiting for us .
The Food Revolution
( Excerpt ) By John Robbins
7-3-3
These [ * genetically engineered ] products are absolutely safe .
For the most part you would n't know [ if you were eating them ] but the point being that you would n't need to know .
- Bryan Hurley , Monsanto spokesperson
http://jahtruth.net/genet.htm
There is a great deal of controversy about the safety of genetically engineered foods .
Advocates of biotechnology often say that the risks are overblown .
" There have been 25,000 trials of genetically modified crops in the world , now , and not a single incident , or anything dangerous in these releases , " said a spokesman for Adventa Holdings , a UK biotech firm .
During the 2000 presidential campaign , then - candidate George W. Bush said that " study after study has shown no evidence of danger . "
And * Clinton Administration Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said that " test after rigorous scientific test " had proven the safety of genetically engineered products .
* http://jahtruth.net/clint.htm
Is this the case ?
Unfortunately not , according to a senior researcher from the Union of Concerned Scientists , Dr. Jane Rissler .
With a Ph.D. in plant pathology , four years of shaping biotechnology regulations at the EPA , she is one of the nation 's leading authorities on the environmental risks of genetically engineered foods .
Dr. Rissler has been closely monitoring the trials and studies .
" The observations that ' nothing happened ' in these ... tests do not say much , " she and her colleague Dr. Margaret Mellon ( a member of the USDA Advisory Committee on Agricultural Biotechnology ) write .
" The field tests do not provide a track record of safety , but a case of ' do n't look , do n't find . ' "
When scientists actually look , what they see can be terrifying .
A few years ago , a German biotech company engineered a common soil bacterium , Klebsiella planticola , to help break down wood chips , corn stalks , wastes from lumber businesses and agriculture , and to produce ethanol in the process .
It seemed like a great achievement .
The genetically engineered Klebsiella bacterium could help break down rotting organic material and in the process produce a fuel that could be used instead of gasoline , thus lessening the production of greenhouse gases .
It was assumed that the post - process waste could be added to soil as an amendment , like compost .
Everybody would win .
With the approval of the EPA , the company field tested the bacterium at Oregon State University .
As far as the intended goals were concerned - eliminating rotting organic waste and producing ethanol - the genetically engineered bacterium was a success .
But when a doctoral student named Michael Holmes decided to add the post - processed waste to actual living soil , something happened that no one expected .
The seeds that were planted in soil mixed with the engineered Klebsiella sprouted , but then every single one of them died .
What killed them ?
The genetically engineered Klebsiella turned out to be highly competitive with native soil micro-organisms .
Plants are only able to take nitrogen and other nourishment from the soil with the help of fungi called mycorrhizae .
These fungi live in the soil and help make nutrients available to plant roots .
But when the genetically engineered Klebsiella was introduced into living soils , it greatly reduced the population of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil .
And without healthy mycorrhizal fungi in soils , no plants can survive .
It is testimony to the amazing powers of science that researchers were able to track the mechanism by which the genetically engineered Klebsiella prevented plants from growing .
There are thousands of different species of microorganisms in every teaspoon of fertile soil , and they interact in trillions of ways .
But the scientists discovered something else in these experiments , something that sent chills down their spines .
They found that the genetically modified bacteria were able to persist in the soil , raising the possibility that , had it been released , the genetically engineered Klebsiella could have become established - and virtually impossible to eradicate .
" When the data first started coming in , " says Elaine Ingham , the soil pathologist at Oregon State University who directed Michael Holmes ' research on Klebsiella , " the EPA charged that we could n't have performed the research correctly .
They went through everything with a fine tooth comb , and they could n't find anything wrong with the experimental design - but they tried as hard as they could ...
If we had n't done this research , the Klebsiella would have passed the approval process for commercial release . "
Geneticist David Suzuki understands that what took place was truly ominous .
" The genetically engineered Klebsiella , " he says , " could have ended all plant life on this continent .
The implications of this single case are nothing short of terrifying . "
Meanwhile Monsanto and the other biotech companies are eagerly developing all kinds of genetically modified organisms , hoping to bring them to market .
How do we know if they 're safe ?
According to Suzuki : " We do n't , and wo n't for years after they are being widely used . ''
It 's not a prospect that helps calm the nerves and restore confidence in our collective future .
Surely , I 've wanted to believe , when the chips are down , scientists and researchers would never do anything that would jeopardize life on Earth .
Surely , the people who run these companies - and the government officials who oversee them - would never allow something that dangerous to occur .
But then again , this would n't be the first time that corporations like Monsanto have brought us new products they promised would make life better for everybody and that turned out to do something very different .
This is the same company , after all , that brought us PCBs and Agent Orange .
Even the product the company was originally formed to produce , the artificial sweetener saccharin , was later found to be carcinogenic .
Of course , Monsanto tells us that this time we do n't have to worry .
GE Crops Can't Be Contained
A test conducted by the Wall Street Journal found that 16 of 20 vegetarian foods labeled as being " free " of genetically engineered products actually contained GE soybeans .
As Arran Stephens , president of Nature 's Path Foods , noted : " You can not build a wall high enough " to prevent genetic pollution of wild and organic crops .
In August , a team of Belgian researchers were surprised to discover that Monsanto 's GE soybeans contained " a DNA segment ... for which no sequence homology could be detected . "
" No one knows what this extra gene sequence is [ or ] ... what its effects will be , " said Greenpeace - UK's Doug Parr .
" If Monsanto did not even get this most basic information right , what should we think about the validity of all their safety tests ? "

Gore warns against ' mutually assured destruction , ' compares global warming to nuclear war David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 10 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Accepting his Nobel Peace Prize Monday , former Vice President Al Gore warned that global warming 's consequences could exceed the dangers of global nuclear war , and the environmental activists warned world leaders to act now to lessen pollution or face " mutually assured destruction . "
" More than two decades ago , scientists calculated that nuclear war could throw so much debris and smoke into the air it would block life - giving sunlight from our atmosphere , causing a ' nuclear winter . '
Their eloquent warnings here in Oslo helped galvanize the world 's resolve to halt the nuclear arms race , " Gore told dignitaries at the Nobel ceremony in Norway .
" Now science is warning us that if we do not quickly reduce the global warming pollution ... we are in danger of creating a permanent ' carbon summer . ' "
Gore recalled reading his " political obituary " written after his bid for the presidency fell short in 2000 and said his expulsion from US politics gave him the opportunity to address global warming and press for immediate actions that have so far gone largely ignored .
" Despite a growing number of honorable exceptions , too many of the world 's leaders are still best described in the words Winston Churchill applied to those who ignored Adolf Hitler 's threat : ' They go on in strange paradox , decided only to be undecided , resolved to be irresolute , adamant for drift , solid for fluidity , all powerful to be impotent , ' " Gore charged .
Supporters have begged Gore to re-enter the political sphere with a run for the Democratic nomination in 2008 , but the man who came within a few hundred votes of the Oval Office has said he does n't plan another campaign .
In his speech Monday , Gore aimed his harshest criticism at the US and China for failing to step up efforts to reduce pollution , while praising anti-global warming campaigns in Europe , Japan and Australia .
" It should be absolutely clear that it is the two largest CO2 emitters  most of all , my own country  that will need to make the boldest moves , or stand accountable before history for their failure to act , " Gore said .
" Both countries should stop using the other 's behavior as an excuse for stalemate and instead develop an agenda for mutual survival in a shared global environment . "

American bison are one of the species most affected by humans
By examining records dating back to AD1500 , US researchers found that at least 35 % of mammals over 20kg had seen their range cut by more than half .
They said urgent action was needed to protect the animals , which were being hunted or suffering habitat loss .
The findings have been published in the Journal of Mammalogy .
The research , carried out by a team of scientists from Princeton University and conservation group WWF - US , has been described as the first " measurement of human impacts on biodiversity based on the absence of native , large mammals " .
" Perhaps the most striking result of our study is that [ the ] 109 places that still retain the same roster of large mammals as in AD1500 are either small , intensively managed reserved or places of extremes , " revealed lead author John Morrison , WWF - US 's director of conservation measures .
" Remote areas are either too hot , dry , wet , frozen [ or ] swampy to support intensive activities . "
' Eco-engineering '
The researchers compared the current ranges of the world 's largest 263 land mammals with their distribution 500 years ago .
We can now pinpoint places where large mammals assemblages still play important roles in terrestrial ecosystems
Eric Dinerstein ,
WWF chief scientist
The species that suffered the greatest loss were " habitat generalists " , including tigers , leopards , lions , American bison , elk and wolves .
Geographically , Australasia fared best , holding on to 68 % of its large mammals .
At the other end of the scale , South - East Asia only had 1 % of the mega fauna that roamed the region in AD1500 .
In their paper , the scientists explained why large mammals were so important for maintaining the ecological equilibrium .
" Large carnivores frequently shape the number , distribution and behaviour of their prey , " the researchers wrote .
" Large herbivores function as ecological engineers by changing the structure and species composition of surrounding vegetation .
" Furthermore , both sets of mammals profoundly influence the environment beyond direct species interactions , such as through [ the food chain ] . "
WWF chief scientist Eric Dinerstein said he hoped the findings would help focus conservation efforts .
" We can now pinpoint places where large mammal assemblages still play important roles in terrestrial ecosystems , " he explained .
" Through strategic re-introductions - such as returning wolves to Yellowstone - we can restore ... places missing one or two species and recover the ecological fabric of these important conservation landscapes . "
“ Political language has to consist largely of euphemisms . . . and sheer cloudy vagueness . ”
- George Orwell -
H.R 1955 : the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention
Act of 2007 recently passed by the House — a companion bill is in the Senate — is barely one sentence old before its Orwellian moment :
It begins , “ AN ACT - To prevent homegrown terrorism , and for other purposes . ”
Those whose pulse did not quicken at “ other purposes ” have probably not read George Orwell ’s essay , “ Politics and the English Language , ” or they voted for the other George both times .
Orwell ’s jeremiad on the corruption of the English language and its corrosive effect on a democracy was written two years before his novel 1984 spelled out in chilling detail the danger of Newspeak , which renders citizens incapable of independent thought by depriving them of the words necessary to form ideas other than those promulgated by the state .
After its opening “ tribute ” to Orwell , H.R 1955 is strategically peppered with Newspeak regarding the establishment of a National Commission and university - based Centers of Excellence to “ examine and report upon the fact and causes of violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence in the United States ” and to make legislative recommendations for combating it .
The “ sheer cloudy vagueness ” of H.R 1955 , as well as its terror factor , may account for its bipartisan 404 - 6
House vote but how , in an era informed by the Bush - Cheney administration ’s egregious assault on the Bill of Rights , can the phrase “ other purposes ” fail to raise the “ National Terror Alert ” from its current threat level of “ elevated ” to “ severe . ”
Future “ other purposes ” will undoubtedly be justified by the Act ’s use of the term “ violent radicalization , ” which it defines as “ the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence . . . ” or by the folksy , Lake Wobegonesque “ homegrown terrorism , ” defined as “ the use , planned use , or threatened use , of force or violence by a group or individual born [ or ] raised . . . within the United States . . . to intimidate or coerce the United States , the civilian population . . . or any segment thereof . . . [ italics added ] . ”
In the service of some self - serving “ other purposes , ” will “ extremist beliefs ” become any belief the temporary occupants of the White House consider antithetical and threatening to their political agenda ?
Will “ ideologically based violence ” or the use of “ force ” become little more than the mayhem resulting after a peaceful protest , daring to move beyond the barbed wire of the free speech zone , is attacked by a truncheon - wielding riot squad armed with tear gas , German Shepard dogs and water cannons ?
Will the unarmed , constitutionally protected dissenters who are fending off blows or dog bites , or who are striking back in self - defense become “ homegrown terrorists ” and suffer draconian sentences for their attempt to “ intimidate or coerce ” the state with free thought and free speech ?
A clue to future “ other purposes ” may lie in the Act ’s parentage .
The proud House “ mother ” of the Patriot Act ’s evil twin is Rep. Jane Harmon ( D - CA ) , chair of the Homeland Security Intelligence Subcommittee .
Rep. Harmon has admitted to a long and productive relationship with the RAND Corporation , a California based think - tank with close ties to the military - industrial - intelligence complex .
RAND ’s 2005 study , “ Trends in Terrorism , ” contains a chapter titled , “ Homegrown Terrorist Threats to the United States . ”
Keep in mind that the RAND Corporation was set up in 1946 by Army Air Force General Henry “ Hap ” Arnold as “ Project RAND ” sponsored by the Douglas Aircraft Company .
Keep in mind also that Donald Rumsfeld was its chairman from 1981 to 1986 and Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Dick Cheney ’s felonious former chief of staff , and Condoleezza Rice were trustees .
Enough said !
RAND maintains that “ homegrown terrorism ” will not be the result of jihadist sleeper cells .
Rather , it will result from anti-globalists and radical environmentalists who “ challenge the intrinsic qualities of capitalism , charging that in the insatiable quest for growth and profit , the philosophy is serving to destroy the world ’s ecology , indigenous cultures , and individual welfare . ”
Further , RAND claims that anti-globalists and radical environmentalists “ exist in much the same operational environment as al Qaida ” and pose “ a clear threat to private - sector corporate interests , especially large multinational business . ”
Therein lies the real “ other purposes . ”
Predictably then , H.R. 1955 is not about protecting homegrown Americans .
That protection is only incidental to its “ other purposes ” of protecting homegrown corporate interest and its unconscionable manipulation of the American political process to fill its coffers .
Any thought or speech or action — however protected it might be by the Bill of Rights — that threatens corporate hegemony and profit will no doubt suffer the “ other purposes ” clause of the Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act .
Anyone doubting the Orwellian nature of an Act that equates anti-globalists and environmentalists with al Qaida terrorists will do well to read Orwell ’s “ Politics and the English Language ” and to acquaint themselves with the fate of Winston Smith in 1984 .
Ecologists have long observed that when food becomes scarce , animal populations exploit a wider range of food sources .
So scientists studying southern sea otters at different sites in California 's coastal waters were not surprised to find that the dietary diversity of the population is higher where food is limited .
But this diversity was not reflected in the diets of individual sea otters , which instead showed dietary specialization in response to limited food .
The new findings by researchers at the University of California , Santa Cruz , will be published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of January 14 .
The study found that all sea otters in an area with abundant food resources share the same dietary preferences .
Where food is limited , however , a diverse array of feeding strategies emerges , with individual sea otters specializing on particular types of prey .
Tim Tinker , a UCSC research biologist and first author of the paper , said the study has both theoretical implications for the science of ecology and practical implications for wildlife management .
" The traditional way of viewing the relationships between predators and prey and how food webs are structured may be oversimplified , " Tinker said .
" When you look at the population as a whole , you may see a diversification of the diet in response to limited food resources .
But when you look at individuals , you see dietary specialization . "
One implication of this dietary specialization for California sea otters is that some otters may be exposed to certain food - borne pathogens much more frequently than otters with different diets .
" A lot of sea otters in the Central Coast population are dying from infectious diseases , and this could help us to better understand that disease mortality by allowing us to pinpoint the specific vectors of disease transmission , " Tinker said .
Tinker 's coauthors on the paper are Gena Bentall , who worked on the study as a UCSC graduate student and is now with the Monterey Bay Aquarium 's sea otter research and conservation group ; and James Estes , an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and a wildlife ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey .
The study compared sea otters on the Central Coast , which has the largest population of southern sea otters , to those in a much smaller population around San Nicolas Island off the coast of Southern California .
The San Nicolas population is the result of an effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reduce the vulnerability of California sea otters to oil spills by establishing a separate population from the main one on the Central Coast .
In the late 1980s , about 140 sea otters were relocated to San Nicolas Island .
Most of them soon returned to the mainland , but the few that remained have prospered .
With plenty of food to go around , the San Nicolas otters are in better shape than their mainland counterparts , and their population is now growing much faster than the Central Coast population .
" The San Nicolas otters are much bigger than the mainland animals , their body condition is better , and they spend less time feeding , " Tinker said .
" When we looked at individual diets , a few key prey types dominated , and each otter 's diet looked pretty much like every other otter 's diet . "
The otters ' preferred prey are the large , energy - rich red sea urchins , which are abundant around San Nicolas Island .
On the Central Coast , red sea urchins are much less common than the smaller purple sea urchins .
The San Nicolas otters also eat marine snails and crabs , but there is little difference between the population as a whole and individual otters in terms of dietary diversity .
Each otter is a generalist , with the same preferences as other otters .
The mainland population is dramatically different .
While the diet of the population as a whole is much more diversified than at San Nicolas , individual diets are more specialized .
Estes said it is not surprising that animals are highly individual in the way they feed , but the link between individual specialization and resource availability is new .
" What 's new in this paper is that individuality is a plastic characteristic that emerges when resources become limited , " Estes said .
" We 're seeing this in sea otters , but it probably occurs broadly in nature .
It may apply to people , too .
When there were just a few people running around on the face of the Earth , they were probably all doing pretty much the same thing . "
Individuality in feeding behavior adds a new level of complexity to the dynamics of food webs .
For wildlife managers , it means that each animal has to be considered as an individual and may not be representative of the whole population .
But the findings also suggest a potentially useful tool for assessing the status of wildlife populations , Estes said .
" It 's very hard to know where a population stands with respect to resource limitation -- we 're always asking if a population is limited by the availability of food , " he said .
" We could conceivably look for individuality in foraging behavior as an indication that food limitation is an important factor . "
According to Estes , scientists were already convinced before this study was completed that the availability of food is limiting the Central Coast sea otter population .
He said the same situation probably prevailed throughout California before fur traders began hunting sea otters in the 18th century , eventually driving them to the brink of extinction .
But it is not clear why sea otters are not spreading out into other areas along the California coast where they would find more food than on the Central Coast .
" Why this population does not expand into food rich areas is one of the perplexing challenges we have not been able to figure out , " Estes said .

Benchmarking Parallel Python Against Jython Threading ( Benchmarks Take 3 )
Follow - up to Benchmarking Parallel Python Against Threading from The Utovsky Bolshevik Show
Having had it pointed out to me that benchmarking against CPython threading is pointless , I am now going to do what I should have done originally ( third time 's the charm , right ? ) and benchmark Parallel CPython against threaded Java , in the hopes I will fail less at producing something useful .
Each of these results is the time it takes to sum the prime numbers below each multiple of 10000 between 100000 and 1000000 ( i.e. perform the operation 90 times on numbers increasing by 10000 each time ) .
I 'm reusing the Parallel Python results from previously .
I decided to use Tim Lesher 's cookbook recipe to test threads , as I already have a script which does n't require a great deal of rewriting to make it Jython ( i.e. CPython 2.2 or so ) compatible .
Now , the results :
1 Worker 2 Workers 4 Workers Vanilla CPython 1195s N/A N/ A Parallel CPython 1153s 601s 582s Jython Threads
442s 241s 254s
As can be seen here , Jython threads by far and away beat Parallel CPython .
This does not , however , take into account the fact that Parallel Python can use several machines at once , which Jython threading obviously cannot do .
What 's interesting to note is that Parallel CPython on one worker is roughly the same as standard GIL'd CPython ( slightly faster , in fact , in this case ) .
If you need to write and deploy CPython as opposed to Jython , then there 's no performance cost in writing parallelisable code to use Parallel Python regardless of end user ( as PP , by default , spawns a number of workers equal to the available CPUs ) .
These statistics were taken on an IBM Thinkpad T60 with a Core Duo T2400 running Ubuntu Feisty GNU / Linux ( using the standard packages where available ) using the scripts found under http://oddbloke.uwcs.co.uk/parallel_benchmarks/ .
Hopefully these are useful statistics and conclusions , as opposed to my previous efforts to produce such . :)

A study by Norwich 's University of East Anglia ( UEA ) into leadership styles found the use of " taboo language " boosted team spirit .
Professor Yehuda Baruch , professor of management , warned that attempts to prevent workers from swearing could have a negative impact .
But Professor Baruch discouraged swearing in front of customers .
' Maintaining solidarity '
He said : " In most scenarios , in particular in the presence of customers or senior staff , profanity must be seriously discouraged or banned .
" However , our study suggested that , in many cases , taboo language serves the needs of people for developing and maintaining solidarity , and as a mechanism to cope with stress .
Banning it could backfire .
" Managers need to understand how their staff feel about swearing .
" The challenge is to master the art of knowing when to turn a blind eye to communication that does not meet with their own standards . "

The discovery of four fossil skeletons of early human ancestors in Georgia , the former Soviet republic , has given scientists a revealing glimpse of a species in transition , primitive in its skull and upper body but with more advanced spines and lower limbs for greater mobility .
The findings , being reported today in the journal Nature , are considered a significant step toward understanding who were some of the first ancestors to migrate out of Africa some 1.8 million years ago .
They may also yield insights into the first members of the human genus , Homo .
Until now , scientists had found only the skulls of small - brain individuals at the Georgian site of Dmanisi .
They said the new evidence apparently showed the anatomical capability of this extinct population for long - distance migrations .
“ We still do n’t know exactly what we have got here , ” David O. Lordkipanidze , the excavation leader , said Monday in an interview on a visit to New York .
“ We ’re only beginning to describe the nature of the early Dmanisi population . ”
The model reportedly demanded euros for a Pantene advert
Gisele Bündchen is said to be keen to avoid the US currency because of uncertainty over its strength .
The Brazilian , thought to have earned about $ 30 m in the year to June , prefers to be paid in euros , her sister and manager told the Bloomberg news agency .
However , Ms Bündchen , 27 , declined to comment on her pay arrangements .
Last week the dollar hit long - term lows against the euro , the British pound and the Canadian dollar .
According to Brazil 's weekly magazine Veja , when Ms Bündchen signed a deal to represent Pantene hair products , she demanded that the brand owner , Procter & Gamble ( P&G ) , paid her in euros .
P&G was reported as saying that it could not comment on details of the contract .
More attractive
There are also reports that she will be paid in euros for a deal with Dolce & Gabanna to promote its The One fragrance .
" Contracts starting now are more attractive in euros because we do n't know what will happen to the dollar , " Patricia Bündchen told Bloomberg in September .
But the supermodel 's agent in New York , Anne Nelson , denied that there are any special currency arrangements .
" When she works in Europe she gets paid in euros , when she works in the US she gets paid in dollars , when she works in Brazil she gets paid in reais and so on , " she said .
She also pointed out that Ms Bündchen lives in New York and so needs US dollars .
' Still negative '
Last month , billionaire investor Warren Buffett said that he was not confident about the strength of the dollar .
" We are still negative on the dollar relative to most other currencies so we bought stocks in companies that earn their money in other currencies , " he said of his Berkshire Hathaway investment vehicle .
And Jim Rogers , a former investor partner of George Soros , told the BBC that if he was buying currency now it would be the Chinese renminbi , the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc and not the US dollar .
The dollar has slipped amid US interest rate cuts which have been trimmed to 4.5 % after standing at 5.25 % in September .
This means that investors are looking to buy other currencies that will give a higher rate of return .
Brokaw : Iraq can handle its own destiny RAW STORY

This NBC alumnus Tom Brokaw tells CNN's Howard Kurtz that there must be a " truer measure " of " success " in Iraq besides a recent reduction in body counts and IED explosions , given that the Iraqi government has had four years and billions of dollars at its disposal .
This video is from CNN's Reliable Source , broadcast on November 25 , 2007 .
Transcript of this exchange can be viewed below , and the entire interview is available at CNN.com .
# TRANSCRIPT : KURTZ : Vietnam , one of your friends from the University of South Dakota went there and did not come back .
You write that you were disillusioned with the deceptions of Johnson and Nixon .
Talk a little bit about that .
BROKAW : Well , the Johnson tapes just enraged me when I read them later , the private conversations he was having very early on with Richard Russell .
KURTZ : His own doubts about the war that he was prosecuting .
BROKAW : His own deep doubts about the war .
And the man that he really counted on in the Senate to be his military affairs expert , Richard Russell , said , he just does n't believe that this makes any sense at all .
That he at one point says , it will all be settled missiles if it is settled at all .
And but Johnson keep pouring people in .
He was terrified , obviously , the political effect that it might have if the right would come after him .
He even talks in one exchange about impeachment .
He was protecting his political ass -- excuse my language -- but that is what he was doing while young people were dying over there .
Nixon made more of an effort to try to find peace in Vietnam .
He did make several overtures to the north .
But he kept pouring people in there as well because he believed he was the last person who should lose a war and that he thought it was important to stand up to the communists .
He came into office if not actually saying , I have a secret plan for making peace ...
KURTZ : Right .
BROKAW : ... giving the impression that he could bring the war to an end .
KURTZ : In terms of the coverage , do you see certain parallels here to Iraq ?
Most people would say , and I would agree , the media did a pretty poor job during the run-up to the Iraq War in terms of the way that President Bush was selling it , and now , of course , the coverage in recent years has been more critical .
BROKAW : Yes .
The one thing I would disagree with you about , a lot of what happened on the run-up was unknowable .
People did believe he had weapons of mass destruction .
People who were critical of the war and the idea of going to war did in fact think that he had weapons of mass destruction , which was one of the bases for ...
KURTZ : But should n't journalists have been more skeptical toward the line the administration was selling , even if they could n't disprove it and given it more ...
BROKAW : I think on the execution ... ( CROSSTALK ) BROKAW : I think on the war plan they should have been a lot more skeptical .
KURTZ : And given more space , more air time to opposition voices ?
There was a feeling ... ( CROSSTALK ) BROKAW : Yes , but remember -- you have to remember , the opposition voices were not that many in this town , for example , in Washington .
There just were n't that many .
We put Brent Scowcroft on " Nightly News . "
I did a two - way with him .
And I was one of the few places where he would go where he would do that .
We did have Senator Bob Byrd on the air and Ted Kennedy on the air , but it passed by a pretty considerable margin .
KURTZ : Oh , within the Democratic Party there were n't that many anti-war voices .
BROKAW : Yes , that 's right .
KURTZ : There were some outside .
In recent months , though , casualties are down in Iraq .
Some would say that the surge is having some modest success .
Yet conservatives say that is not getting enough coverage .
Is that because of Iraq fatigue ?
Is that because only bad news is news ?
BROKAW : No , I think it is time to take a look at it again .
You know , what , Howie ?
These are small signs of some progress four years later .
KURTZ : Sure .
BROKAW : And the Iraqi government still does n't have it together .
And after four years , if the Iraqis can't take care of themselves with all of the money that has been poured in there , all of the help that they have been given , that 's a truer measurement , I think , of what is going on in Iraq .
It does not mean that we ought not to take notice of the fact that the attacks are down , that the insurgency has been hurt .
I had a briefing the other day about what is going on with IEDs .
After billions of dollars , we have finally found a way to be more effective at protecting our troops from them and detonating them early .
But it has taken a long time .
That wo n't solve the political issue about whether Iraq can handle its own destiny . #

For years , now , Pentagon - backed researchers have been trying to create cyborg insects that could serve as living , remote - controlled spies .
The problem is , those modified bugs never survived long enough to be useful .
Now , Georgia
Tech professor Robert Michelson says he ’s managed to get the bug ‘ borgs to live into adulthood .
DARPA ’s Hi-MEMS program aims to implant place micro-mechanical systems [ MEMS ] “ inside the insects during the early stages of metamorphosis , ” the agency explains .
That way , as the bugs get older , tissues grow around — and fuse together with — the tiny machines .
Flight International reports that , in his latest work , Michelson truncated a Manduca moth ’s thorax “ to reduce its mass . ”
Then he put in “ a MEMS component … where abdominal segments would have been , during the larval stage . ”

The total cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could balloon to $ 3.5 trillion over the next decade because of such “ hidden ” costs as oil market disruptions , forgone investments , long - term healthcare for veterans and interest payments on borrowed war funding , according to a report released by congressional Democrats on Tuesday .
The projection , by the Democratic majority on the Joint Economic Committee , is more than $ 1 trillion higher than a recent forecast by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , which accounted only for direct spending and interest payments and assumed a moderate withdrawal of troops between now and 2017 .
“ The full costs of this war to our economy are manifested in ways that have never been accounted for by this administration :
We are funding this war with borrowed money , Americans are paying more at the gas pump , and it will take years for our military to recover from the damage of the president ’s failed war strategy , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said at a news conference Tuesday .
For the Iraq and Afghanistan wars so far , those costs total about $ 1.6 trillion , the report found -- almost double the direct appropriations of $ 804 billion in fiscal years 2002 to 2008 .
Of that , $ 1.3 trillion , or more than twice the $ 607 billion appropriated , is for Iraq alone .
The report by the Joint Economic Committee Democrats -- Republicans on the panel did not participate -- comes as the House and the Senate prepare to vote , probably this week , on a $ 50 - billion spending bill for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The bill would provide the funding on the condition that the Bush administration begins immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops , with a goal of complete withdrawal by Dec. 15 , 2008 .
If Bush does not agree to the conditions and vetoes the bill , then he “ wo n’t get his $ 50 billion , ” Reid said , and the Pentagon would have to use its own budget to cover the costs of the conflicts .
On Tuesday Bush signed a $ 470 - billion Defense Department appropriations bill that mainly covers costs unrelated to the wars .
At the White House , Press Secretary Dana Perino defended the administration ’s Iraq policies , pointing to reduced violence and improvements in the Iraqi economy .
She said the Joint Economic Committee report had “ obvious motivations ” behind it .
“ This committee is known for being partisan and political , ” Perino said .
“ They did not consult or cooperate with the Republicans on the committee .
And so I think it is an attempt to muddy the waters on what has been some positive developments being reported out of Iraq . ”
Aside from the obvious costs of direct appropriations and the interest on borrowed funds , the report said , the war takes money from such “ productive investments ” as education , law enforcement and healthcare .
The report noted that more than 30,000 U.S. troops had been wounded so far in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It did not specify how many had been significantly disabled , but it found that costs related to soldiers ’ inability to return to productive work and to their need for care could total more than $ 30 billion .
The price of oil has also been affected by the war , the report said , with the cost of a barrel peaking at more than $ 98 last week , almost triple the $ 37 price the week before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Although it is difficult to quantify the war ’s effect on prices , the report said , it has “ been one factor contributing to a generally unsettled state of oil markets over the past several years . ”
The problems in Iraq , particularly the loss of production , contributed to at least a $ 5 increase in the cost of a barrel of oil , said the report , which can be found at jec.senate.gov .

Watch an orang - utan solve the floating peanut problem
Orang - utans are clever enough to use water as a problem - solving tool , an experiment inspired by Aesop ’s fables has demonstrated .
When presented with a peanut floating deep down inside a transparent tube , the animals spat their drinking water into the tube to raise the treat to the top , where they could grab it ( see video , right ) .
Researchers say that the study is novel because it shows the insightful use of a liquid tool by a non-human primate .
Natacha Mendes at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , recalls that the idea for the study came out of a discussion with her colleagues about Aesop ’s fables .
Advertisement
The team focused on one particular story , in which a clever crow throws stones into a pitcher to elevate the water to a level where the bird can access it for drinking .
Mendes and her fellow researchers wondered whether the orang - utans they worked with could have a similarly smart insight .
Speedy learning
To test this out , the scientists presented five orang - utans ( Pongo abelii ) with clear plastic tubes , each containing a small amount of water along with a peanut .
But , to the orang - utans ’ great dismay , the peanuts floated too far down the tube for them to reach .
The frustrated apes tried everything they could to get to the peanuts – including biting , hitting , and kicking the tube .
It only took them about nine minutes on average , though , to figure out that a little bit of extra water could do the trick .
At this point the orang - utans began taking mouthfuls of water from their drink dispenser and spitting the liquid into the tube , a trick that elevated the peanuts to an accessible point .
“ This seems to be insightful behaviour because they have n’t seen this test before , ” Mendes explains .
“ And as soon as they got the idea they continued to do it . ”
And do it faster , Mendes adds .
She presented each orang - utan with the peanut - containing tube 10 times .
By the tenth attempt , it took the animals only 30 seconds before they started spitting water into the tube .
Intelligent spitting
Researchers also conducted control experiments , including one in which they taped the peanut to the top of the tube .
The orang - utans did not spit into the tube , but instead simply grabbed the treat with their hands .
Mendes notes that archer fish ( Toxotes jaculatrix ) can spit water at flies to knock them into the water for eating ( see Fast food for fish with perfect aim ) .
But she says the orang - utans ’ use of water represents a more sophisticated behaviour .
“ There ’s no comparison , ” she says , pointing out that the apes have a conscious idea of what they are doing and consider other options , such as kicking the tube .
“ With orang - utans we are talking about a flexible strategy – that ’s the big difference . ”
Journal reference : Biology Letters ( DOI : 10.1098/rsbl.2007.0198 )
As I noted yesterday , Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch wrote in yesterday ’s Washington Post about the rise of a libertarian voting bloc , most notably found in the movement that has grown around the Ron Paul campaign .
The more interesting question , though , is whether the American public really is becoming more libertarian , and what that means for the country ’s political future .
At Liberal Values , Ron Chusid argues that the ideas that are taking hold with the public resemble libertarianism , but are n’t of the doctrinaire variety that seems to motivate those attracted to Ron Paul ’s campaign :
Libertarianism , especially as advocated by Ron Paul , is not the only pro-freedom philosophy and in some cases does not advocate freedom as seen by most Americans .
Most see freedom in terms of how government impacts their lives , not whether the Federal Reserve is ended or American returns to the gold standard .
Americans who reject the social policies of the religious right will find many of the same faults in Ron Paul , who denies that the founding fathers envisioned a secular society characterized by separation of church and state and who claims that the founding fathers envisioned the United States as a Christian nation .
Paul ’s support for federal legislation banning so - called partial birth abortions and legislation to eliminate the legal distinction between a zygote and a fully developed human contradict his claims of both supporting freedom and supporting state ’s rights .
Chusid also makes point that I ’ve made myself several times , that Federalism and individual liberty are not necessarily the same thing :
The stress for state ’s rights is also not what most Americans are looking for when seeking freedom .
What matters is the relationship between the individual and government , regardless of level of government .
Turning duties performed by the federal government over to the states might sometimes be good , but this is not necessarily a matter of greater freedom .
Often it is the reverse .
Paul ’s lack of acceptance of the 14th Amendment , which extended Constitutional liberties from the federal government to the states , could result in less freedom .
It is often necessary to protect the rights of the minority from the majority .
It is far easier to gain a majority to restrict liberties in a state or local area as opposed to nationally
As I noted in the comments to this post , the post -Reconstruction history of the South , dominated as it was by Jim Crow and the often brutal suppression of the individual liberties of black Americans , was by it ’s very nature entirely a creation of state law and the reluctance of the Federal Government to do what needed to be done to enforce the 14th Amendment .
That ’s why , for people who want to restrict the role of government in their lives , the idea of simply transferring power from Washington to , say , Trenton , is n’t entirely attractive .
Additionally , with the Civil War now 140 years in the past , most Americans no longer think of themselves primarily as residents of the state in which they happen to reside but as citizens of the United States — the idea that their home state , assuming they even still live in their home state , deserves some special loyalty is alien to most Americans .
Therefore , a political movement based primarily on “ states rights ” is unlikely to have the appeal that it did even back in the 1950s .
Chusid also notes that Americans have n’t fully accepting the libertarian message because they have come to believe that there are some areas where government is necessary .
While I do n’t agree with him entirely on this point , it ’s hard to deny that this is at least partially true .
Chusid ’s argument is similar to the one advance by Cato Institute scholar Brink Lindsey , who has argued that America ’s creation of a mass affluence society has established trend that , on the whole , will lead to a political environment that is more skeptical of state intervention but accepts the role of government in the economy at some level .
It ’s not a libertarian utopia , but it ’s also not another Sweden and that , at least , is a start .
Congressional Democrats are likely to seize on Mr. Buffett ’s comments to bolster their argument that repeal of the estate tax amounts to a windfall for a few wealthy families .
Republicans have pushed to eliminate the tax permanently or reduce the rate and exempt more estates by raising the value at which the tax takes effect .

Mr. Buffett said that in the last 20 years , tax laws have allowed the “ superrich ” to become richer .
“ Tax law changes have benefited this group , including me , in a huge way , ” he said .
“ During that time the average American went exactly nowhere on the economic scale : he ’s been on a treadmill while the superrich have been on a spaceship . ”
Lawmakers are under pressure to reach some agreement on the future of the tax because a law enacted by Congress in 2001 gradually phases it out through 2010 , when it will be fully repealed for one year .
The tax is scheduled to return in 2011 with a top rate of 55 percent on estates worth more than $ 1 million .
For this year , individual estates valued at more than $ 2 million are taxed at a top rate of 45 percent .
The chairman of the finance committee , Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat , said yesterday that fewer than 1 percent of United States households currently pay the tax .
He said repeal lacked support in the Senate and the purpose of the hearing was to solicit ideas for replacing the shifting rules and uncertainty of the current system .
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the panel , said the estate tax should be repealed because “ death should not be a taxable event . ”

Wait ... I 'm confused ... two democrats ( Bowen and Brunner ) are gonna dismantle the system that got them elected legitimately .... so we can go back to a time when voter fraud and mistakes disenfranchised their party ?
Hip hip Hoooray !!!
I 'm starting to like this plan .
{ ED NOTE : OMSmedia is the far - rightwing Don Haas , the brother of San Diego 's far - rightwing former Registrar of Voters ( and one of the county 's worst , as he'd never met a Diebold system he did n't love , nor a voting system he was n't willing to make LESS transparent by shutting out voters from the ability to have any accountability at all . )
Also please note that Brunner 's study was a bi-partisan study and she was joined in her announcement today by the Republican speaker of the Ohio Legislature .
Don , since you have a conflict of interest in discussing these items , it would be nice if you mentioned it when making such comments , so I do n't have to .
Transparency , ya know ?
I realize the Haas ' bros .
are not big fans of that , however .

The Ohio SoS needs to do more than release the umpteen - millionth study proving the machines are hackable .
We already knew that .
No one can take her seriously when she proposes " remedies " that take exactly the steps needed to open up the most powerful attack vectors for optical scan voting .
No one should take her seriously until she holds the Ohio elections officials accountable in Warren County ( and she needs to do as tough - minded Kentucky auditor Crit Luallen does , and turn them over to every level of prosecution she can find , in order to bypass their crony army ) .
No more excuses .
If Kentucky can clean up its mess , Ohio is certainly sophisticated enough to clean up its corruption problem .
I have lost count of how many Kentucky officials , including elections officials , have gone to jail after Crit Luallen 's audit / turn 'em over to multiple agency prosecutors approach .
Even more have had to resign .
Brunner is a former judge .
She certainly knows what it means when records are destroyed in violation of a court order ( presumption of a crime ) .
After looking at the characters she proposed bringing in for the study ( including Scott Konopasek 's outfit , hello ! ) and watching her refuse to even meet with citizens carrying armloads of hard evidence that election laws were broken , I 'm no fan of Brunner .

WTF !
Why would citizens just sit back and say , " Ok , just count our elections in the back room , we 'll believe anything you say about the outcome " ?
What has the world come to .
It is that the vendors are so intertwined with the ROV and the SOSs that NO ONE , NO LOGIC , NO SENSE OF DECENCY , NO CARING FOR TRANSPARENCY AND HONESTY can be found in SOSs and ROVs ?
Is that where we are ?
Pulling scanners out of the precincts ( which I 'm not a fan of having them there in the first place but if they wo n't do hand counts in the precincts either ) means we have NOTHING to compare the results coming out of the central tabulator to .
Thus there is no " check and balance " , the very concept that the constitution envisioned in establishing this republic .

Hey , we are observing the legacy of imperialists and nationalists , the major part and parcel of our national fantasy since the embryonic advent of the military industrial complex at the dawn of the industrial age .
The brand of psychology nurturing it to this day believes that what we do is ipso facto valid , because as the head of the civil rights division of the Department of Justice Just Us puts it , good imperialist nationalistic white folk live longer than underlings .
America does pure and upright elections as a beacon to the world is the doctrinal talking point .
But as we know we are not in America any longer Toto , we are living in AmurKKKa , the land of the free fee takers and the home of the brave grave makers .
Like the song says :
They ’ve all gone to look for america
All gone to look for america
All gone to look for america ( America , by Paul Simon ) .
Only problem is , America has been replaced by " AmurKKKa " , and so the lost will not be found .

How will this affect spending as one way to improve the election machine fiasco ?
Start with California where SoS Bowen started this type of action :
California ranks among the top ten largest economies in the world , and were it a separate country ... it would be ... the 6th World 's largest economy .
( Wikipedia ) .
And that 6th largest economy in the world has some problems :
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Friday he will declare a " fiscal emergency " in January to give him and the Legislature more power to deal with the state 's growing deficit .
Schwarzenegger made the announcement Friday after meeting with lawmakers and interest groups this week to tell them California 's budget deficit is worse --- far worse --- than economists predicted just a few weeks ago .
( NBC 11 News , emphasis added ) .
Meanwhile a bank the size of California or so is in emergency mode too :
The world 's biggest bank Citigroup is taking on board 49 billion dollars ' ( 34 billion euros ) worth of hugely devalued subprime loans to reassure markets amid a credit downgrading on concern about its capital base .
( Breitbart , emphasis added ) .
Is it about time for somebody to tell these experts that they are " doin a heckuva job " ?
Voting machine improvement by extravagant expenditures may have been dealt a death blow by all this fiscal wonderfulness , because it was not too long ago that houses in parts of Ohio where sold off cheaper than automobiles !
And that was at the beginning of this fiscal emergency .
Hunker down and hang on .

( What did you loose yesterday ?
4000 ?
5000 ?
6000 ? 10,000 ? )
Or did you just pump and dump AAPL ?
With the mainstream corporate media pushing candidates , I predict .... ( note this is my opinion as of 15 DEC 2007 ) 1 . I predict , Hillary Clinton will be the next president ( regardless of the nasty disenfranchisement tricks and secret electronic tabulation of actual votes )
I hate to say that , I 'd RATHER Kucinich win , but I do n't see Dennis Kucinich getting any public debate or airtime like the other Corporate Owned players candidates .
I personally like and will vote for Kicinich .
If your republican I hope your alternative is Ron Paul .
But I do n't think Paul is as much as a leader as Kucinich is - just my opinion .
2 . I predict , we are already in a recession and that it 's not made apparent yet .
( maybe they 're shredding the books still ? )
I believe the motive is to destroy the dollar completely and move on to the Amero .
I am thinking the only protection is to hold physical gold .
Cause chaos has broke loose with trading .
It will take DECADES to fix .
3 . I predict , that these electronic voting machines that " tabulate votes electronically " will continue to grow and completely replace our ideal of " paper ballots hand counted under the sun with public oversight . "
All our fighting will be for nothing , because the powers that be do n't care , they are drunk on power , and if allowed to continue down their path will destroy all life on earth .
4 . I predict , that now that most of our civil rights have been removed from the oath breakers shredding the US Constitution ; the powers that be will start destroying people by using their new gained power .
This will be as simple as oiling the squeaky wheels or completely destroying those of us who would shine a bright light on the cracks of this impenetrable dark fortress .
Furthermore slowly over time more and more rights will be removed until we are in Martial Law under these fascists .
5 . I predict , oil goes to $ 300 a barrel no matter who is in charge of the USA .
For those that can remember the fist fights at the filling stations , it will be worse and this will happen before oil hits $ 300 .
People will die in the streets for stealing or protecting oil .
I do n't know the exact price that this will happen .
But it also does n't need to happen if vehicles were converted to burn steam using special electronics , plasma timing and the resonant frequency of atoms beneficially .
( note : screw electrolysis !!)
6 . Technology goes way beyond what we are being told .
7 . The Media will consolidate into a horrible singular voice , net neutrality will be an asterisk With communications already screwed up thing are going to get much worse , those who own the electronics and the networks will profit at the suffering of the people .
8 . Death will be real bad .
Not sure when it happens but if our unsustainable course continues it will be worse than ever in known history .
Very few or nothing at all will survive .

Ohio : Further confirmation of a Kerry landslide
TruthIsAll http://us.share.geocitie...sAllFAQResponse.htm#Ohio On December 14 , 2007 , Bob Fitrakis & Harvey Wasserman reported that the Ohio Secretary of State confirmed that the 2004 election could have been stolen : “ Ohio 's Secretary of State announced this morning that a $ 1.9 million official study shows that " critical security failures " are embedded throughout the voting systems in the state that decided the 2004 election .
Those failures , she says , " could impact the integrity of elections in the Buckeye State . "
They have rendered Ohio's vote counts " vulnerable " to manipulation and theft by " fairly simple techniques . "
Indeed , she says , " the tools needed to compromise an accurate vote count could be as simple as tampering with the paper audit trail connector or using a magnet and a personal digital assistant . "
In other words , Ohio's top election official has finally confirmed that the 2004 election could have been easily stolen ” .
-----
“ The final official tally for Bush --- less than 119,000 votes out of 5.4 million cast --- varied by 6.7 % from exit poll results , which showed a Kerry victory .
Exit polls in 2004 were designed to have a margin of error of about 1 % .
In various polling stations in Democrat - rich inner city precincts in Youngstown and Columbus , voters who pushed touch screens for Kerry saw Bush 's name light up .
A wide range of discrepancies on both electronic and paper balloting systems leaned almost uniformly toward the Bush camp .
Voting procedures regularly broke down in inner city and campus areas known to be heavily Democratic .
In direct violation of standing federal election law , 56 of 88 counties have since destroyed all or part of their 2004 election data . ”
__________________________________________
The Implausible Final Ohio Exit Poll – matched to an official corrupt vote Kerry won the unadjusted ( WPE ) Ohio Exit Poll by 54.4 - 45.6 % and the 12:22 am Composite ( adjusted ) by 52.1 - 47.9 % .
Bush won the 2:06 pm Final ( 2020 respondents ) by 50.9 - 49.1 % in which vote shares and weights were adjusted to force a match to the recorded Ohio vote .
Of course , the Final 2 pm National Exit poll was forced to match the recorded National vote .
It ’s Standard Operating Procedure .
Using preliminary 12:22 am
Ohio exit poll weightings in the Final , it would have been necessary to inflate the Bush vote shares to implausible levels to match the recorded vote .
So the weights were adjusted in favor of Bush to minimize the vote share inflation : First - time Voters
Of the 14 % who were first - time voters , 55 % were for Kerry .
Are we to believe that he won just 47 % of the other 86 % ?
When Decided
Of the 21 % who decided in the month prior to the election , 62 % voted for Kerry .
Are we to believe that he won just 45 % of the 79 % who decided earlier ?
Did Bush lead by 10 % in any of the pre-October polls ?
Party ID
The weights changed from 38D /35 R to 35D/40 R , a 7.9 % shift .
With the original weights , Bush needed 17 % of Democrats to match the recorded vote .
He had 8 % .
Ideology
Liberal / Conservative weights changed from 21/32 to 19 /34 , a 9.5 % shift .
With the original weights , Bush needed 23 % of Liberals to match the recorded vote .
He had 13 % .
Voted for Senate
Democratic / Republican weights changed from 43 /57 to 36 /64 , a 16.3 % shift .
With the original weights , Bush needed 14 % of those who voted for the
Democratic Senate candidate .
He had 7 % .
Election Models : calculating the True Vote 1 ) The Election Calculator determined that Kerry won by 54.1 - 45.9 % ( 1.22 % annual voter mortality , 5 % of votes uncounted in 2000 )
2) The True Vote Model had Kerry winning by 51.5 - 48.5 % ( 0.87 % total mortality ) .
3 ) Based on 3 % of total votes cast were uncounted and a 6.8 % switched vote rate , Kerry won by 53.3-46.7 % .

There was also a Secretary of State directive not to destroy them .
She 's the secretary of state .
It was a directive of the office she runs that was violated .
She can do something about that .
When a Chinese company sells a defective toy in America , we can't pull it off the shelves fast enough !
We want to know how those toys got into the country in the first place !
But when study after study after study after study show that we 've purchased defective voting machines by manufacturers who seem to lie more than they truth , we keep using the SAME testing labs ( or personnel ; Ciber 's guy just moved over to Wyle ) , we have the SAME people that certified the NASED stuff on the EAC technical guidelines committee , we keep buying from the SAME companies .
We know what it looks like to take a problem seriously .
You recall all the Tylenol bottles .
You pull the Chinese toys off the shelf .
You ban imports of beef from countries that had infected stock .
You call in all the Ford Pintos .
Yes , the report does add more to the pile of information about defective voting machines .
But the procedural recommendations roll out the red carpet for wholesale fraud with the optical scans .
And we can see that Jennifer Brunner is n't about to topple this house of cards .
Kevin Shelley had the same position , and at least he did refer Diebold for criminal prosecution .
She could do the same .

Since this report on voting machines has been issued by the Ohio secretary of state , we can assume that voting results from counties in Ohio using these machines is suspect .
Given that , how can anyone have faith in the recent congressional election results on Dec. 11 in OH - 05 ?
Are there plans for a manual recount ?
A new election on paper ballots ?
Or does the secretary of state have no plans for ensuring fair and accurate ballot counting in Ohio during actual elections ?
I guess we can all assume that the newest Republican congressman was appointed regardless of whether he was elected or not .

Attacked Bev ’s character ?
When ?
Where ?
The only character assassination I ’ve seen has been of Secretary Brunner and the entire bipartisan statewide group of election officials and citizen poll workers who have been lumped together and treated with contempt .
Bev ’s character is not for me to judge any more that the character of Secretary Brunner , both of whom I believe are committed to election integrity .
However , I do question Bev ’s logic and grasp of the particulars .
And I do n’t think that the many incredibly important things she has done to promote election integrity entitle to immunity from questioning of her false statements or non-sequitur criticisms .
I question the relevance of 2004 to the specific issues of the voting system risk assessment conducted by numerous independent scientists who all agreed that there were serious problems with the voting systems .
Whatever merit there is to criticism about 2004 , it has nothing to do with the study .
I question if such a thorough review had ever been conducted of Ohio ’s CURRENT set of voting systems ( of which how many were used in 2004 ?
anyone ?
anyone ? ) including ES&S and the Diebold GEMS system being used with Digital Guardian .
I question why Bev does n’t know that all but one of the counties who intentionally destroyed 2004 election materials did so after the previous SOS told the counties that they were able to legally destroy such materials and before Marbley or the SOS ordered the materials preserved .
I question the value of focusing on irrelevant falsehoods instead of addressing Ohio ’s many REAL problems and challenges .

Let me draw a line for you : Brunner 's report concludes with recommendations that centralize control over chain of custody , handing it over to insiders .
Counting in secret and using a non-public chain of custody for ballots invites tampering .
Here 's what 2004 has to do with it :
She already knows that some Ohio elections insiders in 2004 participated in violations of election law and vote theft .
Or , if she does not know this , she should .
Perhaps it would help if she would stop refusing to meet with the citizens who gathered photographic evidence .
Human nature is such that you cannot design a credible public election system that depends on trusting insiders .
Ohio elections history is such that it is outright crazy to centralize counting and chain of custody even more , giving over more control to insiders and blocking public counting , public chain of custody .
Brunner 's report is n't just about voting machine issues --- its grand finale is a set of recommendations that IRRETRIEVABLY BREAK CHAIN OF CUSTODY AND CENTRALIZE INSIDER CONTROL , handing it over to a set of insiders who were involved in violations of election law in 2004 .
REGARDING CONTEMPT : MY CONTEMPT IS FOR THE " TRUST ME " ELECTIONS MODEL .
I happen to believe that poll workers are the salt of the earth .
It is Brunner who treats them with contempt when she recommends doing away with polling places and bringing all the ballots to a central location to count .
The " Trust Me " elections model was inappropriate in the first place because it fails to protect and secure our rights as citizens to retain sovereignty over our government .
The " Trust Me " model has collapsed altogether .
If you doubt this please read the collection of over 4 dozen mainstream media reports and audit reports on election officials showing them committing felonies , like identity theft , forgery , and grand larceny , which I have compiled here : http://www.blackboxvoting.org/moonshine3.pdf
( I limited the report to 8 pages ; I found so many examples of elections workers committing felonies I could have done a 40 - page report , but who could endure reading it ? )
Obviously we have many honest elections officials , but The Trust Me model requires 100 % of them , along with their employees , technicians and vendors to be honest at all times .
That 's never going to happen , we already know it is n't happening , again , please read the evidence in the above report .
The " Trust Me " model means that citizens are only sovereign over the instruments of government they have created IF THE INSIDERS ARE HONEST --- the " Trust Me " model will therefore produce a progressively more corrupt government .
The remedy is to make sure THE PUBLIC is able to view chain of custody and the counting .
I sometimes hear officials touting the " Trust Me " model saying " all models can be corrupted . "
Well , not very easily , if you simplify , keep chain of custody of the votes public at all times , and count them in public while still at the polling place .
The Trust Me elections model is dead .
Stick a fork in it .
Any public official still saying we have to base elections on trust of insiders should have a laugh track accompany their statements .

Bev ,
First let me say I 'm sorry if my disagreement comes across as inflamatory or disrespectful .
Your statements are rife with inaccuracies and falsehoods that are not helpful to addressing the real issues .
There is no “ trust me ” model anywhere in the report , either literally or figuratively .
This is entirely your own gross mischaracterization .
Nothing that would “ centralize control over chain of custody . ”
No “ counting in secret . ”
She has met personally with countless citizens who have presented her with evidence ( e.g. , Richard Phillips Hayes and “ Honest ” Paddy Shaffer ) .
No “ CENTRALIZED INSIDER CONTROL . ”
She most certainly does not recommend “ doing away with polling places ”

to BevOHio - whoever - you - are :
There is no “ trust me ” model anywhere in the report , either literally or figuratively .
Where in her recommendations does the public get to view the chain of custody from start to finish ?
If that 's in there , I certainly missed it .
Nothing that would “ centralize control over chain of custody . ”
So your premise is that bringing all the ballots in to one central location is an equally public chain of custody to counting them at the polling place after the ballot box has been sitting in full public view all day ?
No “ counting in secret . ”
In what way does the public get to view the counting --- and I do n't mean " the scanning " , I mean " the counting " ?
Does the public even get to capture evidence of what went into the scanner vs what results came out ?
That would be simple enough .
( did n't think so ) .
You may be confusing " scanning in public " with " counting in public " .
You are certainly confusing " public chain of custody " with consolidated chain of custody viewed by a much smaller group of people .
And what 's this all about :
You write " honest " Paddy Shaffer
Do you have evidence that Paddy Shaffer is dishonest ?
If not , a retraction of that inappropriate innuendo would be the proper thing to do .
She [ Brunner ] most certainly does not recommend “ doing away with polling places ” Lessee now .
How do you reduce , say , 500 polling places into 87 and not do away with some polling places ?
Do you have the dates you say Brunner met personally with Paddy Shaffer and Richard Hayes Phillips to review their evidence ?
It is possible this happened after I last spoke directly to Paddy or Richard .
And when you said , earlier , that the materials were destroyed BEFORE the court order , in some cases that was true , they were destroyed DURING the 22 month prohibition for destroying them , is that not correct ?
Since 55 counties were involved in destruction of records , are you saying every one of them destroyed the records before the court order ?
Not a single one of them after the court order ?
Do you have the dates each of the 55 counties destroyed their records ?
Do you concur that some counties destroyed them before the 22 - month retention period expired ?
If so , that is violating elections law , is it not ?
The extreme importance of that is , of course , that Ohio forbade citizens from examining the ballots during the 22 - month retention period .
That 's why a court order was sought and obtained , to block destruction before citizens could examine them .
But , when they attempted to review the ballots after the retention period had expired , many of the records had already been destroyed , had n't they ?
This leaves a very small window .
If you are saying that all 55 counties destroyed records by exploiting that small window , can you elaborate or provide details , dates and sources to buttress such a claim ?
I have had the opportunity to review the pre-publication copy of Richard Hayes Phillips book " Witness to a Crime " along with photos and public records supporting his conclusions .
Frankly , I am humbled by his research and the magnitude of the truth it tells .
I do n't consider myself uninformed , but perhaps you can provide public records , photos , and dates that counter what Hayes Phillips and Shaffer uncovered .
I hope so .
While you 're at it , can you explain how spilling coffee on sealed boxes of ballots can destroy ALL BALLOTS , and why there would be a hot pot of coffee in a locked ballot vault to begin with ?
I was also wondering how a recycler picked up ballots by accident and shredded them .
Did the recycling company have keys to the ballot box ?
Goodness , if you can help me get more " informed " on the coffee spill , the accidental recycling , and the dates of destruction of the documents by each of the 55 counties by providing the facts and supporting documentation , I will build fire , get a cuppa hot chocolate , and settle in for a great read .

So in other words , Shaffer and Phillips met with Brunner BEFORE they had completed their study and obtained the public records and photographs documenting violations of elections law .
After they had obtained these documents , Brunner has indeed declined to meet with either of them , according to those dates , so my statement stands .
If the best you can do to sully up Paddy Shaffer is to imply that some people did n't show up for a speaking event as promised , it might be best to stop implying that she is not honest .
I do n't know how many events you have organized , but most of us who have done events know that it 's not unusual for people to confirm their attendance at an event and then not show up .
Sometimes you have to call them 2 - 3 times to remind , sometimes a confirmed speaker cancels after the announcement went out .
Sometimes they confirm , you remind , they still do n't show up .
I do n't think you can use that example to throw dirt on Shaffer unless you have evidence that she deliberately perpetrated a fraud , which I doubt very much .
But speaking of fraud ...
Hey , did n't a whole lot of counties destroy records during the federally mandated retention period ?
Please do correct me if I 'm wrong on that .
What about that coffee spill ?
I am dying to know why a locked ballot vault featured ready - to - drink hot coffee .
Lotta visitors in there ?
Are the people who used a bogus Homeland Security Alert to hide what they were doing with ballots in Warren County still running elections ?
Gosh !
And why is that ?

You ask , “ Where in her recommendations does the public get to view the chain of custody from start to finish ? ”
But what you claimed was that she was “ blocking public counting , public chain of custody ”
Where does she prohibit or even mention public viewing of chain - of - custody procedures ?
Are you saying that by not mentioning it she was banning it ?
You said there were “ recommendations that IRRETRIEVABLY BREAK CHAIN OF CUSTODY AND CENTRALIZE INSIDER CONTROL ”
You quote her saying , “ Eliminating points of entry creating unnecessary voting system risk by moving to Central Counting of Ballots ” and “ Requiring all ballots be Optical Scan Ballots for central tabulation and effective voter verification ”
If the difference between your claim and what she said is not immediately apparent , I do n’t know what more can be said .
************************************
You said “ she recommends doing away with polling places ”
She said “ eliminating voting at individual precincts or polling places of less than 5 precincts ”
The critical difference being “ less than 5 precincts . ”
A bit different than eliminating all polling places as you stated .
************************************
You said , “ Since 55 counties were involved in destruction of records , are you saying every one of them destroyed the records before the court order ?
Not a single one of them after the court order ? ”
No , I said , “ I question why Bev does n’t know that all but one of the counties who intentionally destroyed 2004 election materials did so after the previous SOS told the counties that they were able to legally destroy such materials and before Marbury or the SOS ordered the materials preserved . ”
You said , “ The extreme importance of that is , of course , that Ohio forbade citizens from examining the ballots during the 22 - month retention period .
So if all access to ballots was banned , where did all of the “ photographic evidence ” come from ?

It is possible this happened after I last spoke directly to Paddy or Richard . ”
I said , “ Richard Hayes Phillips met with Secretary Brunner on May 3 , 2007 .

Sorry , but I ca n’t accept excuses for fraudulent statements no matter how well - intentioned , especially when they come from a holier - than - thou , cast - the - first - stone # $ (* % like Paddy Shaffer .
If you can , that is telling about your regard for the truth .
I have organized plenty of envts and know of the problems withat may come up .
I happened to have contacted many of the people from the list that Paddy had promoted and was disgusted to learn that none of them had even heard of what she was talking about .
To be VERY clear , over 50 % of the people she listed as “ confirmed ” including yourself either NEVER knew about her misrepresentations or NEVER intended to come .
If you think that is fine , then where exactly do you draw your lines about honesty ?
Second , I said “ off the top of my head ” and not the “ best I can do ” by way of example .
Paddy Shaffer has little regard for truth or fact , although she often advocates positions that are correct .
I believe that it is not ok to prevaricate to promote a good idea ; you and Paddy obviously may differ .

John Dean ,
Your command of the facts and the issues are one of the reasons that people do n't take election integrity advocates seriously .
Bev said " How do you reduce , say , 500 polling places into 87 and not do away with some polling places ? "
Ohio has 88 counties !
This kind of sloppiness is a liability .

Okay ... Sheriff here .
The rules for commenting are clear that there are to be no personal attacks on other commenters .
As they also note , public figures " your humble host " included , unfortunately , are a different matter .
Bev Harris is a public figure , and thus , rules are somewhat different for attacks on her , though the management retains the right to remove inappropriate and uncalled for remarks .
That said , Bev seems to be handling herself just fine here in reply to BevOhio .
Unfortunately , John Dean did make some direct , personal attacks on BevOhio .
And 99 allowed many of them to stand beyond , perhaps , when they should have been , and ended up deleting some comments near the end that perhaps should n't have been deleted , out of her understandable frustration ( yes , she too is , unfortunately fair game , since she has access to the delete button , unlike most commenters here ) BevOhio , please try to temper your attacks on Bev Harris , and keep them as constructive criticisms where you can , as you were wrong in a number of cases above ( though correct on a few others ) .
You also called Bev Harris a liar and / or other uncalled for attacks in light of some comments from Bev Harris that are , in fact , on the money and very legitimate concerns about Brunner 's recommendations .
Bev Harris , you seem to be doing fine making your case as you see fit .
If you feel you 've had unfair treatment here somehow , let me know , and I 'll be happy to review appropriately .
John Dean , accusations that someone is a " troll " is a personal attack when there is not substance , but rather just suspicion to back it up .
You made some other attacks that were not appropriate .
Please do not do so .
99 , remember the Zen .
Let 's see where we can back off the assaults all around , and focus on legitimate points of concern .
And , there are plenty here , many of which I pointed out in my original coverage of Brunner 's study and her subsequent recommendations .
Thank you .

People keep rediscovering the article Don Norman posted a few months ago criticizing what he thinks of as Google 's faux simplicity :
" Oh , " people rush to object , " the Google search page is so spare , clean , elegant , not crowded with other stuff . "
True , but that 's because you can only do one thing from their home page : search .
Of course , I do n't agree .
Philipp Lenssen notes that Don completely ignored the search results page UI :
The second point I disagree with in Donald Norman 's article is that Google only does one thing .
Apparently , Donald does n't understand Google oneboxes Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ the query - specific boxes on top of organic search results , interfacing services Google News , Google Maps and so on Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ or he purposely omits them .
While a Google onebox is not a solution to all needs ( for one thing , it does n't allow me to explore , because I need to know what I want in order to form a search query ) , there 's also the " more " link leading to a Google sitemap with an overview of additional services .
But Bill de hra expands the argument in an intriguing direction :
Perhaps the hunt and peck approach of searching ( along with gaming ) is becoming the dominant computing metaphor , replacing nearly 3 decades of user interfaces based on the metaphor of an office desktop ( ironically the metaphor itself being pushed into irrelevancy by desktop computing ) .
If so , usability experts will need to reconsider what they deem to be best and appropriate .
The Google search box could be viewed as the ultimate command prompt ; you type what you want , and it provides the answer .
Eventually .
Once you realize that the Google search box is really a type of command prompt , the criticism that Google " only does one thing " is .. well , downright hilarious .
Search is the beginning of every command .
You can go anywhere and do anything from there .
I 've never been a huge fan of the desktop metaphor .
It 's easier to see the problems if you take it to an extreme , as General Magic 's defunct Magic Cap operating system did :
As much as I dislike the limitations of the desktop metaphor , I 'm a little uneasy about the idea that the ultimate user interface we end up with in the next ten years will bear more resemblance to a command prompt ..
.. than to the point and click GUI interfaces pioneered at PARC .
Still , there 's a lot to be said for typing stuff to quickly get to what you want .
For example , I often bail out when attempting to visually point and click my way around crowded web pages ; instead , I search for a relevant word on the page using incremental search .
It 's nearly always faster than visually scanning the entire page for the right content or link .
I have a minor personal triumph to relate today .
So , I try to have several cute , quick math puzzles / facts on hand to bust out at parties , because I am cool like that .
The most popular of these is a participation - based trick that goes as follows ( feel free to play along at home ) :
Take a pen and paper and draw a quadrilateral .
There are no restrictions ( it can be concave or self - intersecting ) , but do n’t make it too close to the sides of the paper .
Now , for each edge , draw the square containing that edge that is outside the quadrilateral .
Put a dot in the center of each of the four squares , and draw a line connecting opposite dots , ie , those that came from opposite edges .
The Punchline :
The lines you just drew are the same length , and perpendicular .
( If you lack pen and paper , theres an applet here )
It works pretty well because it is n’t very sensitive to sloppy geometry on the part of the artist ; so you will pretty consistantly get ‘ perpendicular - looking ’ lines .
Also , I often bend the truth a bit and attribute it to Napolean Bonaparte , even though he proved something different but closely related .
The usual attribution of this result is to van Aubel , who to my knowledge conquered very little of Europe .
I ’ve been using this for a couple of years now , and periodically I attempt to find a nice geometric proof without passing to coordinates .
Such a proof eluded me up to last night , when I came up with a reasonably nice vector - based proof .
Its a little cheap since using vectors is n’t totally different from passing to coordinates , but in my mind a geometric proof is one which can be done only with pictures ( though I will use words for laziness ’ sake ) .
For the record , I was unaware of van Aubel ’s proof until this morning , which is a more traditional geometric proof , but a little bit more indirect .
The first step is to notice that the vector connecting the midpoints of opposite sides is the average of the vectors composing the other two sides :
So , in the picture , the red vector is the average of the two purple vectors .
Of course , instead of averaging them , we can cut each of them in half and then add them .
Now , the red vector is the sum of the two purple ones .
Next , lets rotate the purple vectors 90 degrees to the right , and position them so they go from the midpoint of the squares to the midpoints of the edges :
We have n’t changed the length of the vectors at all , and we ’ve rotated them both the same amount , so their sum is still the same length as the red vector but perpedicular .
We can apply identical logic to the other vector connecting opposite midpoints :
We have that the sum of the purple vectors is the same length and perpendicular to the red vector , and that the sum of the pink vectors is the same length and perpendicular to the blue vector .
Hence , the purple vectors plus the blue vector is the same length and perpendicular to the pink vectors plus the red vector .
QED
Its not hard to see the coordinate - based version of this proof beneath the surface , especially if one use complex coordinates , where rotation by 90 degrees is multiplication by .
In fact , I think this theorem is a pretty good illustration of the power and usefulness of cartesian coordinates .

OSLO , Dec. 10  He has said it again and again , with increasing urgency , to anyone who will listen .
And on Monday , former Vice President Al Gore used the occasion of his 2007 Nobel Peace Prize lecture here to tell the world in powerful , stark language : Climate change is a “ real , rising , imminent and universal ” threat to the future of the Earth .
Saying that “ our world is spinning out of kilter ” and that “ the very web of life on which we depend is being ripped and frayed , ” Mr. Gore warned that “ we , the human species , are confronting a planetary emergency  a threat to the survival of our civilization that is gathering ominous and destructive potential even as we gather here . ”
But , he added , “ there is hopeful news as well : we have the ability to solve this crisis and avoid the worst  not all  of its consequences , if we act boldly , decisively and quickly . ”
The ceremony marking the 2007 prize , given to Mr. Gore and to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , comes as representatives of the world ’s governments are meeting on the Indonesian island of Bali to negotiate a new international agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
The new treaty would replace the Kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
At the ceremony in the city hall in Oslo , Mr. Gore called on the negotiators to establish a universal global cap on emissions and to ratify and enact a new treaty by the beginning of 2010 , two years early .
And he singled out the United States and China  the world ’s largest emitters of carbon dioxide  for failing to meet their obligations in mitigating emissions .
They should “ stop using each other ’s behavior as an excuse for stalemate , ” he said .
GAINESVILLE , Fla . --
With powerful instruments scouring the heavens , astronomers have found more than 240 planets in the past two decades , none likely to support Earth - like life .
But what if aliens were hunting life outside their own planet "
Armed with telescopes only a bit bigger and more powerful than our own , could they peer through the vastness of space and lock in onto Earth as a likely home to life "
That 's the question at the heart of paper co-authored by a University of Florida astronomer that appeared this week in the online edition of Astrophysical Journal .
The answer , the authors say , is a qualified " yes . "
With a space telescope larger than the Hubble Space Telescope pointed directly at our sun , they say , " hypothetical observers " could measure Earth 's 24 - hour rotation period , leading to observations of oceans and the chance of life .
" They would only be able to see Earth as a single pixel , rather than resolving it to take a picture , " said Eric Ford , a UF assistant professor of astronomy and one of five authors of the paper .
" But that could be enough for them to identify our planet as one that likely contains clouds and oceans of liquid water . "
This research may sound whimsical , but it has a serious goal : to provide a road map for Earth - bound astronomers trying to study Earth - like planets -- a task expected to become possible in coming decades as more powerful telescopes come on line , said Enric Palle , the lead author of the paper and an astronomer with the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias .
For humans or curious aliens , observing planets is challenging for a number of reasons - habitable planets all the more so .
The planet can't be too close or too far away from its star , or its surface would scald or freeze .
And , it must have a protective atmosphere like Earth's .
Most planets found so far are much larger than Earth , which means they are likely hot gas planets similar to Jupiter , a profoundly uninhabitable place with no solid surface and atmosphere composed largely of hydrogen and helium .
But astronomers are beginning to plan how future space telescopes could directly detect planets much closer to Earth 's size and proximity to the sun .
One challenge :
To figure out how to use a planet 's light to recognize if its surface and atmosphere are Earth - like .
For Ford and his colleagues , the answer lies in probing how the Earth would appear to outside or alien observers .
Astronomers have long recognized that even a large telescope would need to observe Earth for several weeks to collect enough light to identify chemicals in the planet 's atmosphere .
During these observations , the brightness of the Earth would change , primarily because of clouds rotating into and out of view .
If astronomers could measure Earth 's rotation period , then they would know when a given part of the planet was in view .
The hitch was that astronomers were unsure whether Earth 's seemingly chaotically changing cloud patterns would make it impossible for alien observers to determine this rotation rate .
Based on data retrieved from satellite observations of Earth , Ford and his colleagues created a computer model for the brightness of the Earth , revealing that on the global scale Earth 's cloud cover is remarkably consistent -- with rain forests usually turning up cloudy , arid regions clear , and so on .
As a result , extraterrestrial astronomers who watched Earth for a period of several months would notice repeating patterns - a bit like watching the spots on a spinning ball come into view and then disappear .
From those repeating patterns , they could then deduce Earth 's 24 - hour rotation period , Ford said .
That done , the " E.T. " astronomers could infer that anomalies in the pattern were caused by changing weather patterns , most prominently , clouds , he said .
Although some uninhabitable planets are extremely cloudy , the repeated presence and absence of clouds indicates active weather .
On Earth , this variability results in water turning from gas to a vapor and back again , so finding similar variability on another planet would be a reasonable indication of liquid water .
" Venus is always covered in clouds .
The brightness never changes , " Ford said .
" Mars has virtually no clouds .
Earth , on the other hand , has a lot of variation . "
Not only that , but observers could likely also infer the presence of continents and oceans from Earth 's changing light pattern .
The research will be useful to astronomers designing the next generation of space telescopes because it provides an outline of the capabilities required for studying the surfaces of Earth - like planets , Ford said .
He said it appears that zeroing in on Earth - like planets orbiting the nearest stars would require a telescope at least twice the size of the Hubble Space Telescope .
Ford said he hopes that his research will help to motivate an ever larger space telescope that could search for Earth - like planets around many stars .

For a Californian like me who is used to a straightforward party primary , the Iowa caucus process is confusing .
And I 'm sure I 'm not the only one .
On Wednesday 's Countdown , Keith Olbermann spoke to David Shuster who tries to make sense of the maneuvering and tactics being taken by the candidates to best position themselves in what remains one of the -- if not THE - - closest race in recent memory .
On a related note , in my hunt for information about the Iowa caucus process , I found this blogger 's experience to be revealing .
The pundits have been making this a " Hillary is the candidate to beat " story , but in Iowa , this blogger found that Hillary Clinton just has n't captured the spirit of caucusing as much as Barack Obama has .
This past November , EU regulators in the European Parliament 's Committee on Culture and Education began looking in earnest at Europe 's cultural products and heritage as an engine for economic growth .
The idea behind this investigation , which took its original impetus from a 2006 study on " The economy of culture in Europe " and culminated in a draft report submitted by French socialist MEP Guy Bono entitled " On cultural industries in the context of the Lisbon strategy , " is to consider ways that EU regulation might give a boost to the so - called " cultural and creative sector . "
The draft report contained language that the caused alarm among European music and movie business trade groups , so Europe 's version of Big Content immediately set about lobbying to not only " fix " the offending point ( number 9 , quoted below ) , but to convert it into a power grab by proposing alternative language supporting ISP - level copyright filtering ( c.f. similar efforts in the US ) and the extension of copyright terms .
Here 's point 9 from the draft report ; see if you can spot the language that made Europe 's content industry nervous :
9 . [ The European Parliament ] urges the Commission to rethink the critical issue of intellectual property from the cultural and economic point of view and to invite all those active in the sector to join forces and seek solutions equitable to all , in the interest of a balance between the opportunities for access to cultural events and content and intellectual property ; draws Member States ' attention on this point to the fact that criminalising consumers so as to combat digital piracy is not the right solution ;
All that talk of striking a " balance " between access and intellectual property , and the negative reference to industry tactics that " criminalize " consumers spawned a flurry of lobbying activity , and by the time the dust settled lobbyists had succeeded in getting the European Parliament 's Committee on Industry , Research , and Energy ( ITRE ) to submit an amendment to the draft report urging European ISPs to implement filtering mechanisms for the purpose of copyright enforcement .
The European recording industry followed up this move with another amendment , proposed last week , to extend EU copyright terms to match those of the US ( the author 's life plus 70 years ) .
The EFF 's Danny O'Brien sent a heads - up to BoingBoing that , as of today , the Culture and Education Committee rejected all of the proposed filtering and copyright extension amendments .
Clearly , they 're not going to let the ITRE or the European recording industry push them around , which is great news for Europeans .
Now if we could only get the US Congress to show as much spine as the French ( ouch ) .
In the six years of compromising our principles since 9/11 , our democracy has so steadily been defined down that it now can resemble the supposedly aspiring democracies we ’ve propped up in places like Islamabad .
Time has taken its toll .
We ’ve become inured to democracy - lite .
That ’s why a Mukasey can be elevated to power with bipartisan support and we barely shrug .
This is a signal difference from the Vietnam era , and not necessarily for the better .
During that unpopular war , disaffected Americans took to the streets and sometimes broke laws in an angry assault on American governmental institutions .
The Bush years have brought an even more effective assault on those institutions from within .
While the public has not erupted in riots , the executive branch has subverted the rule of law in often secretive increments .
The results amount to a quiet coup , ultimately more insidious than a blatant putsch like General Musharraf’s .
More Machiavellian still , Mr. Bush has constantly told the world he ’s championing democracy even as he strangles it .
Mr. Bush repeated the word “ freedom ” 27 times in roughly 20 minutes at his 2005 inauguration , and even presided over a “ Celebration of Freedom ” concert on the Ellipse hosted by Ryan Seacrest .
It was an Orwellian exercise in branding , nothing more .
The sole point was to give cover to our habitual practice of cozying up to despots ( especially those who control the oil spigots ) and to our own government ’s embrace of warrantless wiretapping and torture , among other policies that invert our values .
Even if Mr. Bush had the guts to condemn General Musharraf , there is no longer any moral high ground left for him to stand on .
Quite the contrary .
Rather than set a democratic example , our president has instead served as a model of unconstitutional behavior , eagerly emulated by his Pakistani acolyte .
Take the Musharraf assault on human - rights lawyers .
Our president would not be so unsubtle as to jail them en masse .
But earlier this year a senior Pentagon official , since departed , threatened America ’s major white - shoe law firms by implying that corporate clients should fire any firm whose partners volunteer to defend detainees in Guantánamo and elsewhere .
For its part , Alberto Gonzales ’s Justice Department did not round up independent - minded United States attorneys and toss them in prison .
It merely purged them without cause to serve Karl Rove ’s political agenda .

Tipping his hat in appreciation of Mr. Bush ’s example , General Musharraf justified his dismantling of Pakistan ’s Supreme Court with language mimicking the president ’s diatribes against activist judges .
The Pakistani leader further echoed Mr. Bush by expressing a kinship with Abraham Lincoln , citing Lincoln ’s Civil War suspension of a prisoner ’s fundamental legal right to a hearing in court , habeas corpus , as a precedent for his own excesses .
( That ’s like praising F.D.R. for setting up internment camps . )
Actually , the Bush administration has outdone both Lincoln and Musharraf on this score : Last January , Mr. Gonzales testified before Congress that “ there is no express grant of habeas in the Constitution . ”
A Swedish feminist group has launched a new campaign called " Just Breasts " to fight for the rights of women to swim topless at the nation 's beaches and public pools .
The feminists ' ire was raised in September when two young , topless women were asked to cover up by a lifeguard at a public pool in Uppsala , near Stockholm .
After refusing to don tops the women were asked to leave the pool .
Ragnhild Karlsson , 22 , spoke to the Swedish English language website The Local last week explaining her reasons for going topless .
Sometimes I 'll be lying in bed and I can hear my 4 - year - old and 7 - year - old having a conversation in another room .
It 's an odd feeling when you 've made some humans and then the humans start to communicate on their own .
My typical reaction is : " Listen to them having their own thoughts .
How DARE they ?! "
Walking down the hall the other day , I overheard the following conversation -- and it froze me in my tracks ...
4 : What does it mean to die ?
7 : ... 4 : HEY , what does it mean to die ?!
Does it mean you fall down ?
I was tempted to go in but I wanted to hear what his big brother would say .
7 : It means you stop living .
4 : ( A STUNNED BEAT ) I DON'T WANT THAT !
7 : It 's not going to happen until you 're like a hundred .
4 : When is that ??
7 : You 're only four .
It wo n't happen for a long time .
4 : ( TAKING THIS IN , THEN ) Okay .
I can't tell you how proud I was of my 7 - year - old .
Hearing them be there for each other like that , I 'm confident they 'll both lead long , happy , productive lives .
That is , until the robots attack .

Update ( December 3 , 2007 ) – I have posted a newly updated version of what you can do in light of the forthcoming Canadian DMCA .
The posting includes a YouTube video , a Facebook group , and updated contact information .
Update ( November 29/07 ) : With a Canadian DMCA seemingly imminent , the importance of speaking out has never been more important .
Some details on the likely new bill can be found here .
I 've updated the 30 Things You Can Do to reflect the new Ministers .
The House of Commons is back in session and , as I promised last month , the 30 Days of DRM project has now concluded .
The postings remain accessible via the 30 Days of DRM page , the wiki , and a new PDF version that incorporates all postings into a single document .
The project generated considerable commentary online and lots of email offline .
The most frequently asked question provides reason for optimism as many people simply asked " what can I do ? "
I typically responded that the best starting point was to write to their local Member of Parliament .
Upon reflection , there is more that can be done and to that end , I offer up 30 things you can do about the issues raised by the 30 days of DRM project .
Write to your local Member of Parliament .
Letters ( which are better than email ) from just a handful of constituents is enough to get the attention of your local MP .
Contact information for all MPs is available here .
Online Rights Canada also provides an easy way to write to your local MP .
Write to the Prime Minister of Canada .
Contact information here .
Write to Bev Oda Josee Verner , the Minister of Canadian Heritage .
Minister Verner is one of the two ministers responsible for copyright policy in Canada .
Prior Canadian Heritage Ministers have been perceived to be close to U.S. copyright lobby groups and copyright collectives .
Ministry contact information here .
Minister Oda 's contact information here .
Minister Verner 's contact information is here .
Write to Maxime Bernier , Jim Prentice , the Minister of Industry .
Minister Prentice is responsible for the Copyright Act in Canada .
Despite the fact that Minister Prentice trumpeted his pro-consumer approach on the spectrum auction issue , the rumour mill suggests that he supports DMCA - style reforms .
Minister Bernier 's contact information here .
Minister Prentice 's contact information is here .
Ask each political party where it stands on copyright .
Copyright policy could prove to be a divisive issue in the months ahead – ask each political party for their views on the issue .
Write to Canadian Heritage 's Copyright Policy Branch .
The Copyright Policy Branch is home to a large contingent of bureaucrats focused on copyright matters .
Contact information here .
Write to Industry Canada 's Intellectual Property Policy Directorate .
The IPPD is Industry Canada 's counterpart on copyright policy , though it addresses a broader range of IP issues .
Contact information here ( scroll to the bottom ) .
Write to your local Member of Provincial Parliament or Member of the Legislative Assembly .
There is a strong provincial dimension to copyright reform , particularly given its impact on education , privacy , consumer issues , and property rights .
The provinces have remained largely silent on copyright , yet they may be forced to address many of the unintended consequences that arise from federal Copyright Act reform .
Contact information for Ontario MPPs here .
Write to your Provincial Minister of Education .
Earlier this month , I wrote about the troubling advocacy of Canada 's Ministers of Education , who are seemingly willing to trade an unnecessary Internet exception for anti-circumvention legislation .
Contact information for Ontario Minister of Education Kathleen
Wynne is here .
Sandra Pupatello here .
For the other Ministers of Education here .
Write to your local school board .
Local school boards can play an important role in the copyright reform process by engaging teachers , parents , and students ( witness the recent reaction of several boards to the Captain Copyright issue ) .
Contact information for Ontario school boards here .
Write a letter to the Department of Foreign Affairs on Canada 's international copyright position .
Canada has remained disappointingly silent on important international copyright issues at WIPO ( for example , see my recent column on the WIPO Broadcast Treaty ) .
DFAIT should be standing up for Canadian interests at such international meetings as well as during bi-lateral trade negotiations with the United States .
Contact information here .
Write to Library and Archives Canada to ask that it support the preservation of Canadian heritage .
The LAC should be a leading voice against the use of DRM that could lock Canadians out of their own heritage .
It could advocate for DRM - free deposits , reforms to facilitate Canadian digitization programs , and the preservation of all user rights .
Contact information here .
Write to the Competition Bureau of Canada .
The combination of DRM and anti-circumvention legislation raises significant marketplace competition concerns .
The Competition Bureau must become engaged on this issue by advocating pro-competitive reforms .
Moreover , it should be investigating cases of alleged abusive use of DRM .
Contact information here .
Write the Office of Consumer Affairs or your provincial consumer protection ministry .
The use of DRM raises numerous consumer concerns , potentially requiring specific consumer protection provisions and labeling requirements .
The federal OCA can be contacted here .
Provincial contacts here .
Write to your federal or provincial privacy commissioner to ask for their support in protecting your personal privacy against DRM .
Several of Canada 's privacy commissioners have publicly called on the government to address the privacy concerns associated with copyright reform , a position which deserves public support .
Privacy commissioner contacts here .
Raise the issue with your local library .
The library community has been very engaged on copyright and will undoubtedly be a vocal stakeholder for any future reforms .
At the local level , libraries can be encouraged to establish copyright policies that fully support user rights and to educate the local community on important access issues .
Ontario public library directory here .
Raise the issue with your local school .
If you are in school or have children currently in school , inquire how the school addresses copyright issues .
Does it take full advantage of user rights ?
Is it aware of how the education exceptions may be limited by anti-circumvention legislation ?
Sign a petition .
There are petitions calling on the Canadian government to adopt a balanced approach to copyright here and here .
Add your name to the Online Rights Canada mailing list .
Online Rights Canada is a grassroots advocacy group that brings together EFF and CIPPIC to focus on online rights issues .
Mailing list information here .
Buy online DRM - free alternatives .
The copyright lobby argues that DRM is a pre-requisite to offering digital content online , yet there are many DRM - free online music services .
For example , eMusic , the largest such service , is now the second largest online music service worldwide .
Support music labels that offer their music without DRM or copy - controls .
This one is easy since virtually every Canadian label does not use copy - control technologies .
The exceptions are the foreign labels represented by CRIA such as Sony BMG .
Ensure that your local retailer will accept returns on DRM'd products .
Many retailers sell DRM'd products without altering return policies to account for the fact that the products may not function as expected .
Raise this with your local retailer and encourage them to adopt liberal return policies for DRM 'd products .
Ask your ISP what it is doing to stand up for your rights .
Canada 's Internet service providers play an important role in defending user rights by only disclosing subscriber personal information with a court order , informing subscribers of requests for their personal information , and by lobbying for an expanded fair dealing provision .
Ask your ISP for its policies on these issues .
Participate in a local meeting on copyright .
There are a growing number of local " meetup " style meetings that bring together citizens concerned with balanced copyright .
If there is a meeting group in your area , go .
If not , get one started .
Support more balanced copyright positions from artists and creator groups .
Many artists and creators are increasingly abandoning policy positions that favour U.S. style reforms and instead embracing a more balanced approach .
If you are a musician , consider joining the CMCC .
If you are an artist , consider joining the Appropriation Art coalition .
If you are a writer , consider pushing for change within Access Copyright .
Use Creative Commons licensing .
Creative Commons , which adopts a " some rights reserved " approach to copyright provides an exceptional ( and exceptionally easy ) method of supporting both copyright and access .
More information on the Canadian licenses here .
Read license terms .
Day 30 of the project focused on the increasing use of contract to limit or eliminate user rights .
Until legislation blocks the use of such terms , consumers should proactively read license terms and reject those that unfairly limit their user rights .
Track media coverage of copyright .
Until recently , media coverage on copyright rarely questioned the sound bites from the copyright lobby .
That is changing , but Canada 's media should be challenged when it fails to do so .
Letters to the editor or a op - eds are a great place to start .
Educate yourself .
The 30 Days of DRM project should be a beginning , not the end .
There are lots of great sources on the implications of copyright reform , many of which are listed on my blogroll .
One useful source is In the Public Interest : The Future of Canadian Copyright Law , a book published last year by Irwin Law under a Creative Commons license .
The book , which I edited , features contributions from 19 professors from across Canada .
You can also listen to a podcast version of my Hart House lecture from earlier this year which also touched on these issues .
Educate others .
Once you know more about copyright reform issues , tell others .
Educate friends , family , and co-workers .
Copyright impacts us all .
Update : Many people have written to ask for specific advice about letters to their MP .
I am very reluctant to tell anyone what they should say to their elected representative or other groups with a voice on copyright reform .
Rather , my hope is that the 30 Days of DRM series provides some of the background materials needed for people to form their own opinions on the issue .
However , it should be noted that Online Rights Canada 's letter writing feature provides some customizable advice on the letter 's content .
Neighbouring Palestinians are cut off from Atarot by Israel 's barrier
Housing minister Zeev Boim said it was a preliminary look at possible housing development in the Atarot area .
He played down its significance , saying such checks were done year round on areas with building potential .
Palestinians say the Har Homa expansion announced this month threatened to derail re-launched peace negotiations .
" This is a preliminary examination of an initial construction plan .
Such feasibility checks are done all year round on all areas with building potential in Jerusalem , " Mr Boim said in a statement .
" The ministry has to offer a solution to the housing problem in Jerusalem . "
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said such plans would destroy the peace process and must be stopped .
" We consider these steps as threatening the beginning of the final negotiations between the two sides . "
The Haaretz newspaper said the Atarot plan - south of Qalandia checkpoint which controls access to East Jerusalem from Ramallah - envisaged construction of 10,000 flats , making it the largest housing project for Jews .
But Israel considers East Jerusalem outside the debate , as it annexed the area soon after the war , although the move has not been recognised internationally .
The Palestinians want it as the capital of their future state , whose formation is the goal of the nascent peace talks .
Separately , the Israeli transport minister suggested that Israel might be willing to talk to the Palestinian militant group which controls Gaza , Hamas , through a third party .
Shaul Mofaz said such mediation would be aimed at halting Palestinian rocket fire from the Gaza Strip .
Israel says the move is in response to an offer made on Israeli TV by Hamas leader Ismail Haniya , although Hamas has since denied that it intends opening negotiations with the Israelis .
Hamas refuses to recognise Israel , and the Israelis have sealed off the Gaza Strip since it seized control there in June .

More than two million Muslims from around the globe have gathered around Mount Arafat near Mecca in Saudi Arabia , the high point of their annual pilgrimage .
The day - long station at Arafat symbolises Muslims ' wait for the day of judgement .
They spend the day praying .
Male pilgrims wear a simple uniform of seamless , two - piece , white garments called the Ihram , which also signify their state of purity .
The pilgrims make a sea of white as they stream in their thousands onto the plain of Arafat .
For many , the pilgrimage is the fulfilment of a life - long ambition .
All Muslims capable of making the journey are duty - bound to do so .
One of the VIPs invited by the Saudi government this year is the controversial Iranian President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , on his first pilgrimage .

What are these ?
Revisiting " Programming as if Performance Mattered "
In 2004 I wrote Programming as if Performance Mattered , which became one of my most widely read articles .
( If you have n't read it yet , go ahead ; the rest of this entry wo n't make a lot of sense otherwise .
Plus there are spoilers , something that does n't affect most tech articles . )
In addition to all the usual aggregator sites , it made Slashdot which resulted in a flood of email , both complimentary and bitter .
Most of those who disagreed with me can be divided into two groups .
The first group flat - out did n't get it .
They lectured me about how my results were an anomaly , that interpreted languages are dog slow , and that performance comes from hardcore devotion to low - level optimization .
This is even though my entire point was about avoiding knee - jerk definitions of fast and slow .
The mention of game programming at the end was a particular sore point for these people .
" You obviously know nothing about writing games , " they raved , " or else you 'd know that every line of every game is carefully crafted for the utmost performance . "
The amusing part is that I 've spent almost my entire professional career -- and a fairly unprofessional freelance stint before that -- writing games .
The second group was more savvy .
These people had experience writing image decoders and knew that my timings , from an absolute point of view , were nowhere near the theoretical limit .
I talked of decoding the sample image in under 1/60th of a second , and they claimed significantly better numbers .
And they 're completely correct .
In most cases 1/60th of a second is plenty fast for decoding an image .
But if a web page has 30 images on it , we 're now up to half a second just for the raw decoding time .
Good C code to do the same thing will win by a large margin .
So the members of this group , like the first , dismissed my overall point .
What surprised me about the second group was the assumption that my Erlang code is as fast as it could possibly get , when in fact there are easy ways of speeding it up .
First , just to keep the shock value high , I kept my code in pure , interpreted Erlang .
But there 's a true compiler as part of the standard Erlang distribution , and simply compiling the tga module will halve execution time , if not decrease it by a larger factor .
Second , I completely ignored concurrent solutions , both within the decoding of a single image and potentially spinning each image into its own process .
The latter solution would n't improve execution time of my test case , but could be a big win if many images are decoded .
Then there 's perhaps the most obvious thing to do , the first step when it comes to understanding the performance of real code .
Perhaps my detailed optimization account made it appear that I had reached the end of the road , that no more performance could be eked out of the Erlang code .
In any case , no one suggested profiling the code to see if there are any obvious bottlenecks .
And there is such a bottleneck .
( There 's one more issue too : in the end , the image decoder was sped - up enough that it was executing below the precision threshold of the wall clock timings of timer : tc / 3 .
I could go in and remove parts of the decoder - - obviously giving incorrect results -- and still get back the same timings of 15,000 microseconds .
The key point is that my reported timings were likely higher than they really were . )
Here 's the output of the eprof profiler on tga:test_compressed ( ) :
FUNCTION CALLS TIME ****** Process < 0.46.0 > -- 100 % of profiled time *** tga:decode_rgb1/1 54329 78 % lists : duplicate /3 11790 7 % tga:reduce_rle_row/3 2878 3 % tga:split/1 2878 3 % tga:combine/1 2874 3 % erlang:list_to_binary /1 1051 2 % tga : expand/3 1995 1 % tga:continue_rle_row/7 2709 1 % lists : reverse/1 638 0 ...
Sure enough , most of the execution time is spent in decode_rgb1 , which is part of decode_rgb .
The final version of this function last time around was this :
decode_rgb ( Pixels ) -> list_to_binary ( decode_rgb1(binary_to_list( Pixels ) ) ) .
decode_rgb1([255,0,255 | Rest ] ) -> [ 0,0,0,0 | decode_rgb1 ( Rest ) ] ; decode_rgb1 ( [ R , G, B | Rest ] ) -> [ R, G,B,255 | decode_rgb1 ( Rest ) ] ; decode_rgb1 ( [ ] ) -> [ ] .
This is short , but contrived .
The binary blob of pixels is turned into a list , then the new pixels are built - up in reverse order as a list , and finally that list is reversed and turned back into a binary .
There are two reasons for the contrivance .
At the time , pattern matching was much faster on lists than binaries , so it was quicker to turn the pixels into a list up front ( I timed it ) .
Also , repeatedly appending to a binary was a huge no - no , so it was better to create a new list and turn it into a binary at the end .
In Erlang R12B both of these issues have been addressed , so decode_rgb can be written in the straightforward way , operating on binaries the whole time :
decode_rgb ( Pixels ) -> decode_rgb ( Pixels , <<>>) .
decode_rgb (<<255,0,255 , Rest / binary >> , Result ) -> decode_rgb ( Rest , << Result / binary , 0, 0,0,0 > > ) ; decode_rgb (<< R, G,B , Rest / binary >> , Result ) -> decode_rgb ( Rest , << Result / binary , R, G,B,255 >> ) ; decode_rgb (<<>> , Result ) ->
Result .
This eliminates the memory pressure caused by expanding each byte of the binary to eight bytes ( the cost of an element in a list ) .
But we can do better with a small change to the specification .
Remember , decode_rgb is a translation from 24 - bit to 32 - bit pixels .
When the initial pixel is a magic number -- 255,0,255 -- the alpha channel of the output is set to zero , indicating transparency .
All other pixels have the alpha set to 255 , which is fully opaque .
If you look at the code , you 'll see that the 255,0,255 pixels actually get turned into 0,0,0,0 instead of 255,0,255,0 .
There 's no real reason for that .
In fact , if we go with the simpler approach of only changing the alpha value , then decode_rgb can be written using in an amazingly clean way :
decode_rgb ( Pixels ) ->
[ << R, G , B, ( alpha( R , G, B ) ) >> || << R, G, B >> <= Pixels ] .
alpha( 255 , 0 , 255 ) -> 0 ; alpha(_ , _ , _ ) -> 255 .
This version uses bitstring comprehensions , a new feature added in Erlang R12B .
It 's hard to imagine writing this with any less code .

The proposal was delivered in a speech to mark Earth Day .
Pledging to make New York " a brighter , healthier and more economically prosperous city " , Mr Bloomberg couched the charge in terms of climate change .
" The science is there , " he said .
" It 's time to stop debating it and start dealing with it . "
The initiative comes as Mr Bloomberg attempts to address what one report he commissioned declared was the growing cultural , financial and commercial dominance of London .
New York 's plans were introduced by Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor of California , who presented himself as an " environmental warrior " , a term he used to describe Mr Bloomberg .
With the proposals , said Mr Schwarzenegger , " New York leaps to the forefront of cities dedicated to attacking climate change and protecting our environment " .
The announcement came with a video endorsement from Tony Blair .
" Your announcement will mark out New York as a global leader in the fight against climate change , " he said , describing it as " a great act of leadership " .
Mr Bloomberg 's plans include measures to encourage home building , plant 250,000 trees in the city , invest in public transport and reduce air pollution .
The proposals , known as PlaNYC , are expected to cost tens of billions of dollars .
Mr Bloomberg , in the final three years of his administration , is seeking to cement his legacy by positioning New York City at the forefront of civic environmentalism .
Opponents , though , say the billionaire mayor is penalising the city 's poor by introducing a regressive tax .
" This is another tax for New York City folks , " Walter McCaffrey , a lobbyist with Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free , a group representing local business and labour groups , told the New York Times .
" If you 're riding in a limo you can afford it .
But this city is also made up of working - class people who would be hurt by it . "
In comments before his speech , Mr Bloomberg did not shy away from the suggestion that the charge was a tax , a position generally shunned in American politics .
" Using economics to influence public behaviour is something this country is built on , it 's called capitalism , " he said in his weekly radio address .
He went on to outline subsidies to accompany the proposed charge , as well as pledging to spend the expected $ 400 m it raises each year on public transport .
In 1987 , then New York mayor Ed Koch proposed a $ 10 fee to drive into Manhattan , but withdrew the plan amid opposition from business leaders .
Five years ago , in the wake of 9/11 , Mr Bloomberg proposed new tolls for road bridges to Manhattan to raise money for mass transport .
Those proposals too were withdrawn .
Now the mayor 's camp has judged that the political climate is more sympathetic to charging .
On Monday the Partnership for New York City , a prominent business group , will announce its support for the charge .
The proposal comes as the city faces population growth of 1 million over the next 20 years .
Mr Bloomberg aims to encourage the building of 250,000 new homes with the introduction of tax incentives and new planning regulations .
The C zone
London moved to congestion charging in February 2003 .
The zone was extended into west London and doubled in size last month .
Observers will be keen to see what kind of system Mayor Bloomberg seeks to implement .
The London scheme , which relies on cameras and the identification of vehicles through their number plates , relies on old technology .
Any renewal of congestion charging in London is likely to feature modern satellite tracking .
A major issue will be the impact of the charge on business .
Ken Livingstone has been forced to defend his charge amid recurring complaints from shops , restaurants and theatres that the charge damages trade .
Cities like Olso and Singapore already use congestion charging .

Summary
Joint Task Force Guantanamo ( JTF - GTMO ) standard operating procedures ( SOP ) for Camp Delta ( Guantanamo Bay prison ) .
This is the primary document for the operation of Guantanamo bay , including the securing and treatment of detainees .
The document is extensive and includes , in addition to text various forms , identity cards and even Muslim burial instructions .
It is signed by Major General Miller , who Donald Rumsfeld later sent to Abu Ghraib to " Gitmoize it " .
The document is also the subject of an ongoing legal action between the ACLU , which has been trying to obtain it , and the Department of Defense , which has withheld it in full ( see http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/20070110/dod_vaughn_r_denied_in_full_section_6_interim.pdf).

Dec. 12 , 2007  --
Over the last few months , I 've heard from hundreds of viewers who said that I should interview unconventional Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul .
So I did .
In our interview , published exclusively on ABCNEWS.com , we talk about the Iraq war , when war is justified , the proper role of government , health care , drug use , prostitution , gay marriage , and more .
In this segment , we discuss illegal immigration .
You can watch the full video by clicking here .
Opposing Amnesty , Denying Benefits
Paul , R - Texas , strongly opposes granting " amnesty " to the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States today .
So I asked him what he'd do with all those immigrants .
Would he try to arrest all of them ?
" I do n't think anybody could find 'em .
I do n't think anybody knows where they are , " he said .
" But if they come for welfare benefits , and you know they 're illegal , deny them the benefits . "
That 's the crux of Paul 's approach &3151 ; deny the immigrants the welfare and social services that many of them now receive .
" Get rid of the subsidies , " he said .
" You subsidize illegal immigration , you get more of it . "
Paul wants to make the United States a far less attractive destination for illegal immigrants looking for free things .
" You promise 'em amnesty , promise 'em , that , no sweat , you can get medical care and free education , automatic citizenship , food stamps and Social Security — you 're gonna get more of it , " he said .
Rejecting the Birthright Law
Paul also objects to the so - called birthright law , which grants automatic U.S. citizenship to children born to illegal immigrants in this country .
" I do n't like to reward people who sneak in for that purpose , and get on the welfare rolls , " he said .
But , I asked , is n't that a right spelled out in the U.S. Constitution ?
The 14th Amendment says that " all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States . "
Paul thinks we 're getting the Constitution wrong .
" I think there 's confusion on interpreting the 14th Amendment , " he said .
" It says that if you 're under the jurisdiction of the United States , you have a right to citizenship if you 're born here .
If you step over the border and you 're illegal , are you really under the jurisdiction ?
There 's a question on that , and I want to clarify it . "
Paul 's opponents for the GOP nomination have accused each other of going easy on illegal immigration .
Former Gov. Mitt Romney , R - Mass. , accuses former Republican Mayor Rudy Giulian of New York . of having presided over a " sanctuary city " when he was New York 's mayor , while Giuliani accuses Romney of employing illegal immigrants at his home .
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , came under enormous criticism from many in his party when he co-sponsored an immigration reform bill with Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Mass .
Paul has a tough stance on immigration , but that does n't mean he wants to seal off this country from the outside world .
He said he 's not opposed to immigration at all , just illegal immigration , and that we should let in more immigrants legally .
" I think we could be much more generous with our immigration , " he told me .
But , he added , " we do n't need illegal immigration .
We do n't need to reward people who get in front of the line . "
Paul also told me he opposes building a 700 - mile fence along the U.S. - Mexico border .
He said he only voted for a bill that included a fence , because it also took on the amnesty issue .
" I voted for that bill to stop the amnesty , but I did n't like the fence .
I do n't think the fence can solve a problem .
I find it rather offensive . "

But fuel crops also hold the potential for considerable environmental harm .
Not only is native vegetation , including tropical rain forest , being chopped down in some cases to plant the crops , but the crops also are often grown using fossil fuels like diesel for tractors  and they demand nitrogen fertilizer made largely with natural gas .
Moreover , turning the crops into fuels can demand huge amounts of water .
Experts say certain types of fuels , particularly those made from agricultural wastes , still hold potential to improve the environment .
But it is only now becoming clear that to achieve that goal , governments will have to set and enforce standards for how the fuels are produced .
With its new proposal , Europe appears to be moving ahead of the rest of the world in that task .
In part , that is because biofuels are the main weapon foreseen by the European Union to lower emissions from the transportation sector , which has the fastest growing levels of greenhouse gases among all sectors of its economy .
The increasingly negative image of biofuels has left officials pulled in separate directions  on the one hand trying to clean up the European market for biofuels that cause environmental damage , while on the other hand seeking to rehabilitate biofuels to meet Europe ’s ambitious greenhouse gas emissions targets .
The draft rules by the European Union would probably have the biggest effect on growers of palm oil in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia , according to Matt Drinkwater , a biofuels analyst with New Energy Finance in London .
“ Some proposed developments in Southeast Asia will almost certainly be blocked by these provisions , ” he said , explaining that the rules would make it much harder to plant on recently cleared land or export fuels to Europe that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases produced during the process of manufacturing biodiesel from palm oil .
Growers of crops to produce ethanol  a substitute for gasoline that is more commonly used in the United States than in Europe  also could be affected because the proposed European Union rules include provisions on preserving grasslands , Mr. Drinkwater said .
Crops for ethanol are grown widely in parts of South America , including Brazil .
The Bush Administrations claim today that it has â€ œExecutive Privilegeâ€  in so far as submitting to contempt charges by Federal Attorneys because the Federal Attorneys work for the Executive branch smacks of Soviet style government claims that the State can do no wrong to the people because the people are the state .
The recent story in the Washington Post said that ;
" A U.S. attorney would not be permitted to bring contempt charges or convene a grand jury in an executive privilege case , " said a senior official , who said his remarks reflect a consensus within the administration .
" And a U.S. attorney would n't be permitted to argue against the reasoned legal opinion that the Justice Department provided .
No one should expect that to happen . "
The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly , added : " It has long been understood that , in circumstances like these , the constitutional prerogatives of the president would make it a futile and purely political act for Congress to refer contempt citations to U.S. attorneys . "
So now we have a President that virtually says that he is above the law because he is the law because he hires the lawyers and they work for him .
What chutzpah !
If this is allowed to stand , then Congress could use its â€œinherent contempt powers allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of Congress .
According to the Post this was â€œwidely used during the 19th century , the power has not been invoked since 1934 and Democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice.â€ 
Itâ€™s about time that Congress started using it again .
The old saying that â€œdrastic times call for drastic measuresâ€ could not be as appropriate as they are now .
These indeed are drastic times .
The American people would have no problem with Congress using drastic measures .
In fact they have been calling for Congress to do just that for months now .
The handwriting is on the wall .
This President does not play by pre-ordained rules of civilized behavior .
Itâ€™s time for Congress to play the game as if they want to win , not just act that way .
They might believe that allowing Bush to make a mockery of the Executive branch will open the doors to the White House for them in 2008 , but they may find Bush wonâ€™t leave under some new â€ œPresidential Mandateâ€  when that time comes .
I donâ€™t trust Bush to leave the White House willingly unless Congress starts enforcing the rule of law on this â€œrunaway executive branchâ€ that has already caused such heartbreak and misery on the world .

I ’ve written before about “ made for adware ” ( MFA ) websites — those parts of the web that are created solely to host lots of ( mainly Google ) ads , and thereby make their creators loads of money .
Well , this one “ hallwebhosting.com ” is a little different .
I first came across it a few months back when it was clearly still under development , but it seems to have settled down now — so that it ’s worth looking at exactly what they ’re doing .
The problem that such sites have is that they need to create lots of content really quickly , get indexed by Google so that people can find them , and then wait for the clicks ( and the money ) to roll in .
The people behind hallwebhosting have had a cute idea for this — they take existing content from other sites and do word substitutions on sentences to produce what they clearly intend to be identical in meaning ( so the site will figure in web search results ) , but different enough that the indexing spider wo n’t treat it as identical text .
So , for example , this section from Wikipedia ’s page on Windows Server 2003 :
Released on April 24 , 2003 , Windows Server 2003 ( which carries the version number 5.2 ) is the follow - up to Windows 2000 Server , incorporating compatibility and other features from Windows XP .
Unlike Windows 2000 Server , Windows Server 2003 ’s default installation has none of the server components enabled , to reduce the attack surface of new machines .
Windows Server 2003 includes compatibility modes to allow older applications to run with greater stability .
becomes :
Released on April 24 , 2003 , Windows Server 2003 ( which carries the form quantity 5.2 ) is the follow - up to Windows 2000 Server , incorporating compatibility and other skin from Windows XP .
Unlike Windows 2000 Server , Windows Server 2003 ’s evasion installation has none of the attendant workings enabled , to cut the molest outward of new machines .
Windows Server 2003 includes compatibility modes to allow big applications to gush with larger stability .
I first noticed this site because they rendered a Wikipedia article about my NTP DDoS work , entitled “ NTP server misuse and abuse ” into “ NTP wine waiter knock about and abuse ” … the contents of which almost makes sense :
“ In October 2002 , one of the first known hand baggage of phase wine waiter knock about resulted in troubles for a mess wine waiter at Trinity College , Dublin ”
for doubtless a fine old university has wine waiters to spare , and a mess for them to work in .
Opinions around here differ as to whether this is machine translation ( as in all those old stories about “ Out of sight , out of mind ” being translated to Russian and then back as “ Invisible idiot ” ) or imaginative use of a thesaurus where “ wine waiter ” is a hyponym of “ server ” .
So fas as I can see , this is all potentially lawful — Wikipedia is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License so if there was an acknowledgement of the original article ’s authors then all would be fine .
But there is n’t — so in fact , all is not fine !
However , even if this ( perhaps ) oversight was corrected , some articles are clearly copyright infringements .
For example , this article from shellaccounts .
biz entitled Professional Web Site Hosting Checklist appears to be entirely covered by copyright , yet it has been rendered into this amusement :
In harmony to create sure you get what you ’ve been looking for from a qualified confusion put hosting server , here are a few stuff you should take into tally before deciding on a confusion hosting provider .
where you ’ll see that “ site ” has become “ put ” , “ web ” has become “ confusion ” (! ) and later on “ requirements ” becomes “ food ” which leads to further hilarity .
However , beyond the laughter , this is pretty clearly yet another ham - fisted attempt to clutter up the web with dross in the hopes of making money .
This time it ’s not Google adwords , but banner ads , and other franchised links , but it ’s still essentially “ MFA ” .
These types of site will continue until advertisers get more savvy about the websites that they do n’t wish to be associated with — at which point the flow of money will cease and the sites will disappear .
To finish by being lighthearted again , the funniest page ( so far ) is the reworking of the Wikipedia article on “ Terminal Servers ” … since servers once again becomes “ wine waiters ” , but “ terminal ” naturally enough , becomes “ fatal ” .
The image is clear .
Two of them :
On Wednesday , a man dressed as an armored truck employee with the company AT Systems walked into a BB&T bank in Wheaton about 11 a.m. , was handed more than $ 500,000 in cash and walked out , a source familiar with the case said .
It was n’t until the actual AT Systems employees arrived at the bank , at 11501 Georgia Ave. , the next day that bank officials realized they ’d been had .
[…]
And on Thursday , about 9:30 a.m. , a man dressed as an employee of the security company Brink ’s walked into a Wachovia branch in downtown Washington and walked out with more than $ 350,000 .
The man had a badge and a gun holster on his belt , said Debbie Weierman , a spokeswoman for the FBI ’s Washington field office .
He told officials at the bank , at 801 Pennsylvania Ave. NW , that he was filling in for the regular courier .
About 4 p.m. , when the real guard showed up , a bank official told him that someone had picked up the cash , D.C. police said .
The guard returned to his office and told a supervisor that he did not make the pickup at the bank .
The supervisor called a Wachovia manager , who in turn notified authorities .
Police were called nearly 11 hours after the heist .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Sales of new homes dropped 8.3 % in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 795,000 , the slowest sales pace since June 2000 , the Commerce Department estimated Thursday .
Sales are now down 21.2 % in the past year , with no sign of a bottom in the crippled housing market .
Read the full government report .
" This is just hideous , " wrote Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics .
" This is more evidence that it 's going to be a long and -- for a lot of people -- a painful process , " said Mike Schenk , economist for the Credit Union National Association .
" The soft housing market will be with us for a long time , at least 18 months . "
August 's sales pace was weaker than the 825,000 expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
See Economic Calendar .
In addition , sales in May , June and July were revised lower .
The sales figures do not account for canceled sales contracts .
The median sales price fell 7.5 % to $ 225,700 compared with a year earlier , the largest year - over - year decline in 37 years .
The median price can be affected by the mix of homes sold between and within regions , and the price does not include nonmonetary incentives , such as upgrades , free vacations and new cars .
The inventory of unsold homes fell by 1.5 % to 529,000 , the fifth straight decline as builders struggle to bring their inventories down .
The inventory represents an 8.2 - month supply at the August sales pace , the highest since March .
The number of completed homes that have not yet sold rose 1.1 % to 180,000 , the first increase since May .
Completed homes now represent 34 % of all homes on the market , the highest percentage in this business cycle .
" This could put further pressure on builders and encourage incentives and price cuts , " wrote Adam York , an economist for Wachovia .
On Thursday , KB Home KBH , - 2.45 % reported a quarterly loss and predicted " seriously challenging market conditions " would last into next year .
KB said its cancellation rate rose to 50 % .
See full story .
On Tuesday , the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell to a five - year low in August , while inventories jumped to an 18 - year high .
See full story .
Total home sales -- existing and new -- fell 5 % in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.30 million , the lowest in six years .
New - home sales are reported when a contract is signed , not at the closing of the sale .
Home builders have reported a large increase in cancellations in recent months .
Cancellations are not reflected in the government data , so the reported sales are likely overstated .
The data cover activity through the end of August , after the severe credit squeeze forced additional mortgage lenders out of business and made nonconforming mortgages , including jumbo mortgages , harder to obtain .
Most buyers of new homes obtain a mortgage commitment before signing a contract .
But many buyers have found that their loan has fallen through between the commitment and the closing .
" The bad news is that the August data only partially reflect tighter mortgage credit conditions , " wrote Richard Moody , chief economist for Mission Residential .
The carnage in the mortgage industry in August could affect homes sold months ago , but only closing now as the home is completed .
Those lost sales would still be counted in the government data .
" Sales have further to fall , " Shepherdson said .
" People do n't like borrowing to buy depreciating assets , and lenders do n't like to lend on them either . "
The government cautions that its housing data are subject to large sampling and other statistical errors .
Large revisions are common .
The standard error of 12.4 % is so high , in fact , that the government cannot be sure in most months whether sales rose or fell .
It can take up to five months for a trend in sales to emerge .
New - home sales have averaged 853,000 per month over the past five months , compared with 860,000 in the five months ending in July .
That 's the lowest five - month average in seven years .
Home builders have piled on incentives , including offering free vacations and new cars , to sell homes and reduce inventories .
Such incentives are not subtracted from the sales price reported to the government .
Sales rose 42.3 % in the Northeast to 74,000 annualized and rose 20.5 % in the Midwest to 135,000 .
Sales fell 20.8 % in the West to 179,000 and fell 14.7 % in the South to 407,000 , the lowest in five years .
In other reports , the Labor Department said first - time applications for jobless benefits fell by 15,000 to 298,000 , the lowest since May .
The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew at a 3.8 % annual rate in the second quarter , a slight downward revision to the 4 % reported a month ago .

A new Microsoft patent has the Internet abuzz with tinfoil - hat - like conspiracy theories .
The patent , which covers biometric feedback that can trigger certain features in software , has triggered adverse reactions by bloggers who are convinced that this is all part of a sinister plot by corporations and governments to closely monitor their citizens .
But is it ?
The answer lies in the patent itself , and like all patent documents , it 's long and tedious reading .
Fortunately , you have Ars Technica to do it for you .
The patent document starts out by describing the relationship that typical computer users have with their applications , documents , and daily tasks .
The " application - centric " model dates back to the days of mainframes and was pretty much the only way command - line users could interact with their computers : you typed in the name of the application , then selected the file you wanted to work with ( if you were really advanced , you could do both on one command line input ) .
The " document - centric " model , introduced by Xerox and popularized by Apple , let users interact with documents directly : double - clicking on the document icon would load said document using the application it was created with .
Most GUIs today allow the user to choose between the two approaches , and I 've noticed that most users tend to stick with one or the other , depending on which one they feel most comfortable with .
A third model , which has arisen with the popularity of PDAs , MP3 players , and other gadgets , is " device - centric , " where users manage documents based on the device they are copying them to or from .
The trouble with all these models is that the user is required to keep a mental map of where all the documents they need are stored and also keep track of how these documents are related to their daily tasks .
There have been many proposed solutions for this problem — most notably the increased use of " smart searching " tools like Windows Desktop Search or Apple 's Spotlight — but Microsoft 's patent proposes a quite unusual approach to solving this problem .
Doc , it looks like you 're trying to write a letter !
Test subjects — and I think it 's fair to assume that they would be voluntary — join a program that monitors their computer activities ( both online and offline ) and identifies other users who are currently involved in similar activity .
The software then presents a way that these other users can answer questions for the first user .
For example , a user might be trying to copy new programs to a PDA without success ( I helped a friend of mine do this exact task last weekend , and the software would prompt other users who have had success at the task to answer that user 's questions .
But how could the system tell that the initial user was not successful ?
Here 's where the biometrics come in : if the system monitors certain behaviors tied to frustration ( such as elevated heart rate ) , then it triggers the routine that asks other users for help .
Physical responses are n't the only things that could trigger this event — taking an abnormally long time to complete a task would do so also — but the biometric aspect is certainly the most unusual .
Is this patent a harbinger of a dystopian future where computer users ' biorhythms will be monitored to increase efficiency ?
Unlikely .
The idea , which was birthed at Microsoft Research , is simply a more advanced version of user focus group testing that Microsoft ( and most other software companies ) have been doing for years now .
Still , if your employer asks you to patch on a pair of electrodes before sitting down to work in the morning , my advice is to find another company to work for .
In western Virginia , far from the limelight , United States Attorney John L. Brownlee found himself on the telephone last year with a political and legal superstar , Rudolph W. Giuliani .
For years , Mr. Brownlee and his small team had been building a case that the maker of the painkiller OxyContin had misled the public when it claimed the drug was less prone to abuse than competing narcotics .
The drug was believed to be a factor in hundreds of deaths involving its abuse .
Mr. Giuliani , celebrated for his stewardship of New York City after 9/11 , soon told the prosecutors they were wrong .
In 2002 , the drug maker , Purdue Pharma of Stamford , Conn. , hired Mr. Giuliani and his consulting firm , Giuliani Partners , to help stem the controversy about OxyContin .
Among Mr. Giuliani ’s missions was the job of convincing public officials that they could trust Purdue because they could trust him .
Winter time is upon us , the great white tide has rushed in and , ohhh baby , it ’s cold outside .
You sit there staring out of the window , watching the permafrost form on the glistening glass panes , wondering what to do with your time .
Fret no more , as the solution is here .
We ’ve all seen those fabulous snow sculptures , whether in pictures , at displays or in your exceedingly talented neighbour ’s back yard , but you ’ve probably never considered making one single - handedly , right ?
Why not ?
You ’ve probably been thinking that it ’s far too difficult , or that you lack the skills and require some special form of innate talent , right ?
Wrong .
The truth is that making a snow sculpture need not be any more difficult than building a snowman , and the chances are that , with some imagination , even your four - year - old niece can do it .
So where do you start ?
Well , here ’s to stating the obvious : naturally , the vital ingredient necessary for this project is snow .
However , not every type of snow will do .
No problem , though , because if the type of snowfall is not ideal that can be easily fixed .
The type of snow that is ideal for sculpting is snow that is slightly wet and that has sat around for a few days and sticks together easily when you try roll it into a ball .
A fresh dust - like snowfall just wo n’t do , but do n’t let that dampen your excitement about the first fall .
In this case you have two options : wait a couple of days for the snow to melt a little , or , if your eagerness has you itching to begin as soon as possible , and the idea of waiting is just not bearable , mix the snow with a little bit of water .
OK , now that the snow issue is clear , what next ?
You can use a variety of different tools , depending on what you ’d like to create , how much detail you want to go into and what you have to hand .
We ’ve listed a number of items that we think should form the basics and make the job easier , but these should serve merely as a guideline and are by no means necessary .
You ’ll need a shovel or spade , something to transport or carry your snow ( buggy , wheelbarrow , buckets ) , something to pack the snow in ( moulds , boxes , buckets , coolers ) , and carving and shaping tools ( wooden planks , saws , chainsaws , trowels , blades ) .
Now you ’re set to begin !
Find a spot for your sculpture and start shovelling and bringing in the snow .
You could start with forming a mound , and flattening and shaping it freehand , dampening the snow as and when necessary to make it stick .
However , we ’ve found the best method to go about it is to make ‘ bricks ’ which can be packed down in their moulds / buckets / coolers , turned over and placed on top of each other .
This will make the sculpture more rigid and the snow easier to work with .
Once you ’ve created the base , the final ingredient is a bit of imagination and a little patience , and you can start sculpting !
A New Approach to Censorship
The government of Malaysia has announced what to my knowledge is a hitherto unknown form of censorship : they have prohibited the use of certain words with non-Muslim referents .
The Associated Press reports that the government has informed the The Herald , a Roman Catholic newspaper , that its license to publish will not be renewed if it continues to use the word Allah in reference to God .
The Internal Security Ministry is of the view that the word Allah refers specifically to the Muslim god and may not appropriately be used in reference to the Catholic god .
In addition to allah , the Malaysian government has prohibited the use of three other words by non-Muslims : solat " prayer " , Kaabah " the shrine in Mecca " , and baitulah " the house of god " .
Although the report is not entirely clear on this point , I think that what is prohibited is the application of these words to entities distinct from those to which they are applied by Muslims rather than , strictly speaking , their use by non-Muslims .
That is , it is presumably acceptable for a Catholic to say that Muslims worship Allah .
As far as I know , such restrictions on the use of particular words are novel .
Arabic - speaking Christians and Jews use the word Allah as their word for God.
Muslim countries frequently discriminate against non-Muslims , but so far as I know , no other restricts their choice of religious terms .
The basis for this policy is also curious .
If one believes in the existence of multiple deities , it make sense to distinguish one from the other .
If your favorite deity is Thoth and mine is Isis , it makes sense to keep their names distinct to avoid confusion between the two .
But if , as Muslims believe , you believe that there is only one god , you can believe that other people have false ideas as to what God is like and what she wants but you cannot reasonably believe that the god that someone else worships is different , for that would imply the existence of two gods .
I suspect that the Internal Security Ministry has not thought this out very carefully .

A reader voices a sentiment that is gathering steam :
I hereby call upon President Bush to intervene and bring an end to the strike of the Writers Guild of America .
This is a time of war and national emergency .
With the Iowa caucuses less than a month away , and the choice of our next president in the balance , America desperately needs The Daily Show .
There is precedent .
In 1950 , with the United States involved in the police action war in Korea , President Truman seized the nation 's steel plants after labor negotiations failed between the United Steel Workers of America and the steel industry .
President Truman 's action led to the landmark Supreme Court case of Youngstrown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U.S. 579 ( 1952 ) , in which the opinion of Justice Robert H. Jackson , a former prosecutor of war crimes at Nuremberg , described the limits on executive power in times of war .
Today , as President Bush 's executive branch commits war crimes while denying any limit on its executive power , we again face a national emergency .
The strike - imposed silence of Stephen Colbert and The Daily Show has left America without a crucial source of actual information .
Democracy is at risk !
It 's time -- finally - - for President Bush to act like Truman .
Please , President Bush , end the strike and bring back The Daily Show before it 's too late !
Denver —
A new study led by University of Colorado researchers says federal and state biologists trying to restore the endangered greenback cutthroat trout the last two decades have been using the wrong fish .
Researchers say genetic tests show that five of the nine populations believed to be remnants of the greenback were actually the more common Colorado Rivert cutthroat trout .
The study , published online Aug. 28 in Molecular Ecology , says the results imply that more than two decades of trying to save the greenback from extinction have n’t improved the species ’ status .
Bruce Rosenlund of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Denver says federal and state biologists will allow the scientific process to play out .
Other researchers will review the study and see if the results can be reproduced .
Two proteins known as FHY3 and FAR1 bind to DNA in a plant cell and cause production of two other proteins known as FHY1 and FHL .
When hit with far red light , a light - sensitive protein called phytochrome A ( phyA ) changes its shape .
This shape change allows it to bind to FHY1 and FHL .
FHY1 and FHL then carry the activated phyA into the cell nucleus .
From there , phyA is able to initiate the plant 's developmental responses to light such as growth , flowering and straining towards the light .
Credit : Zina Deretsky , National Science Foundation
Most of us take it for granted that plants respond to light by growing , flowering and straining towards the light , and we never wonder just how plants manage to do so .
But the ordinary , everyday responses of plants to light are deceptively complex , and much about them has long stumped scientists .
Now , a new study " has significantly advanced our understanding of how plant responses to light are regulated , and perhaps even how such responses evolved , " says Michael Mishkind , a program director at the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
This study , which was funded by NSF , will be published in the November 23 , 2007 issue of Science .
By conducting experiments with Arabidopsis - - a small flowering plant widely used as a model organism -- the researchers discovered that the plant prepares to respond to light while it is still in the dark , even before it is exposed to light .
This preparation involves producing a pair of closely related proteins ( known as FHY3 and FAR1 ) that increase production of another pair of closely related proteins ( known as FHY1 and FHL ) that had been identified in previous studies as critical participants in the plant 's light response .
Haiyang Wang , a member of the research team from Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research , says that the plant probably stockpiles these proteins needed for light responses in the dark for the same reason that a traveler fills his car 's gas tank the night before a morning journey : in order to be able to get going , without delay , at first light .
With a plant so primed in the dark , it detects and responds to light via the following steps :
-- Light - sensing pigment proteins known as phytochrome A located in the cytoplasm of plants cells detect the light in the far - red end of the spectrum .
--
The phytochrome A is activated through a change in shape that allows it to bind to FHY1 and FHL .
--
The binding of FHY1 and FHL to phytochrome A results in the accumulation of phytochrome A in the cell nucleus , possibly by helping to import phytochrome A into the nucleus .
--
The activated phytochrome A changes the activity of genes located in the cell nucleus that govern plant growth and development .
-- Resulting changes in gene expression produce the plant 's developmental responses to light , such as growth , flowering and straining towards the light .
Although these steps had been identified in previous studies , the discovery of how FHY3 and FAR1 regulate plant responses to light adds an important new dimension to our understanding of them .
Moreover , the researchers also discovered the existence of a negative feedback loop between accumulations of phytochrome A in the cell nucleus and the FHY3 and FAR1 proteins that prime the plant 's light response system : the more phytochrome A accumulates in the nucleus , the less FHY3 and FAR1 proteins are produced , and so less phytochrome A is imported into the nucleus .
" This feedback loop serves as a built - in brake that limits the flow of light responses , " says Wang .
" I can't explain why nature created such a complex process to trigger a plant 's light responses , " says Wang with a sigh .
Among the process 's complexities is a resemblance between FHY3 and FAR1 proteins and certain enzymes produced by some mobile DNA elements or so - called " jumping genes . "
( Jumping genes are so named because they can move between various positions in a cell 's genetic code . )
" This resemblance initially puzzled the research team when we were trying to identify the molecular function of the proteins , " says Wang .
Nevertheless , the resemblance between the FHY3 and FAR1 proteins and jumping gene enzymes may represent a biological blessing in disguise .
Why ?
Because the researchers now believe that they have built a convincing case that FHY3 and FAR1 may have evolved from the jumping gene material .
If indeed the proteins did so , this important chapter in evolution may have helped make possible the establishment of flowering plants on earth , says Wang .

British media confirms FBI whistleblower Edmonds ' account of secret file
The Sunday Times has obtained a document that confirms that a file , which the FBI denied existed , could contain information about American officials stealing nuclear secrets for Turkish and Israeli spies , who would then sell the secrets to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia .
Earlier , FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds , 37 , approached the Times about " explosive " communications she discovered between high - up American officials and Turkish and Israeli spies .
A FOIA request to the FBI , for case number 203A - WF - 210023 , was answered with a claim that the case number did not exist .
" I can tell you that that file and the operations it refers to did exist from 1996 to February 2002 , " says Edmonds .
One high - ranking official , identified by RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna as Marc Grossman , Ambassador to Turkey from 1994 to 1997 .
Grossman is said to have warned his cohorts not to do business with Brewster Jennings , a front company set up by the CIA .
Brewster Jennings was also the " employer " of CIA operative Valerie Plame , whose cover , with Grossman 's help , was blown in what is widely believed to be a political hit job by the Bush Administration on her husband , Ambassador and Iraq war critic Joseph C. Wilson .

Many of today 's crime dramas owe a debt to Dragnet and its creator , Jack Webb .
This week , let 's take a closer look at the man , the legend .
1 . It started with a documentary ( sort of )
John Rudolph " Jack "
Webb became fascinated by the intricate , behind - the - scenes details of police investigations while working on the 1948 film - noir He Walked by Night .
The movie was based on a real - life murder case , and Webb was cast as a crime lab technician .
The quasi - documentary style of the film gave him an idea for a police drama series with a similar feel .
With the cooperation of Chief William H. Parker of the Los Angeles Police Department , he created Dragnet and its protagonist , Sergeant Joe Friday .
2 . There was no time to memorize lines
Have you ever wondered why nearly every Dragnet actor recited their dialog in the same clipped , rat - a - tat fashion ?
As producer of the series , Webb cut costs where he could , and one of those money - saving measures was limited rehearsal time .
He preferred to just have his actors read their lines off teleprompters rather than memorizing them .
Of course , in scenes where Sgt. Friday is questioning a witness , this robotic delivery of lines made the show more authentic ; would n't you have a deer - in - the - headlights expression while being interrogated by Joe ?
3. Jack Webb turned down Animal House
Jack Webb was the first choice for the role of Dean Wormer in the 1978 film Animal House , but he turned it down because he thought it poked fun at authority .
That 's not to say that ol '
Jack did n't have a sense of humor about himself and the character that he had created .
Check out the skit he did with Johnny Carson below .
Johnny Carson - Copper Clappers
4 . There were visual punches ( without special effects )
Jack Webb did n't need a myriad of special effects to create a gruesome scenario .
His matter - of - fact narration and a series of black - and - white photos succinctly paint a picture of what happens during the first second of a head - on auto collision .
It still makes the viewer cringe in pain , even in these days of airbags and shoulder restraints .
And if this analysis of one fatal second does n't prompt you to buckle up while behind the wheel , nothing will .
5 . The first color version of the show tackled LSD
Dragnet actually had two different runs on television .
The color version that is syndicated today is the second incarnation of the series , and it took full advantage of the medium by premiering in 1967 with the deliciously campy " Blue Boy "  episode .
Modern viewers should keep in mind that LSD was still legal in the early part of 1967 , and its effects were n't completely understood .
Of course , history has since shown us that acid can make you pretty high and far out .
In 1997 , TV Guide ranked the " Blue Boy "  episode of Dragnet at number 85 on its " 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time " list .
6 . The strange prevalence of cigarettes
It 's interesting to watch Dragnet from a 21st century viewpoint and note the cultural differences between " then and now . "
Sure , the clothes , the hairstyles , and even the cars are hopelessly dated , but one aspect that truly stands out is the prevalence of smoking .
No one ever bothers to ask " mind if I smoke ? " before lighting up , and both airports and hospitals came equipped with pedestal ashtrays in their corridors .
Jack Webb promoted cigarettes in both TV commercials and print advertisments , first for L&M , and then Chesterfield .
Sadly , his three - pack - a - day habit most likely contributed to his fatal heart attack at age 62 .
7. America learned what it meant to be a cop
No one ever summarized the pitfalls of the profession as well as Webb :
It 's awkward having a policeman around the house .
Friends drop in , a man with a badge answers the door , the temperature drops 20 degrees .
You throw a party and that badge gets in the way .
All of a sudden there is n't a straight man in the crowd .
Everybody 's a comedian .
" Do n't drink too much , " somebody says , " or the man with a badge 'll run you in . "
Or " How 's it going , Dick Tracy ?
How many jaywalkers did you pinch today ? "
All at once you 've lost your first name .
You 're a cop , a flatfoot , a bull , a dick , John Law .
You 're the fuzz , the heat ; you 're poison , you 're trouble , you 're bad news .
They call you everything , but never a policeman .
A BUNCH OF OTHER FACTS YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY KNOW : Even though it has become a clichÃ© , Sgt. Friday never actually said " Just the Facts , M'am "  on an episode of Dragnet .
Before video teleprompters became standard , dialog was offered to TV actors using a decidely ancient technique : it was handwritten on paper scrolls .
In 1997 , TV Guide ranked the " Blue Boy " episode of Dragnet as number 85 on its " 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time " list .
Friday and Gannon wore the same color suits , shirts and ties in every episode of Dragnet for continuity purposes , per Webb 's direction .
Establishing camera shots could thus be used from one episode to another .
Jack Webb was the first civilian buried with full police honors .
Upon his death , his badge number ( 714 ) was officially retired by the LAPD .

Love him or hate him — and the polls show that around a third of Americans do at least still approve of him — George Bush will be president for the whole of 2008 and the first 20 days of 2009 .
But with a Democrat - controlled Congress ( not to mention a Republican Party that increasingly wants to distance itself from Mr Bush ) and the distraction of the most open presidential race for 80 years , 2008 is likely to be a year of profound stasis .
On the domestic front , where nothing can be done unless White House and Congress agree , the gridlock will be almost total .
On the foreign - policy side , where the president has more freedom to act alone , the chances for progress ought to be better .
But this particular president is so weakened , and the problems he faces are so intractable , that there will be little room for progress here either .
It could have been very different .
History is full of examples of divided government producing powerful results , because only when political risk is shared equally by both parties can the boldest reforms be made .
But 2007 was a dismal year for domestic policy : an attempt to reform immigration policy was killed by attacks from right and left ; the president 's plans to reform health care were pronounced “ dead on arrival ” in the House of Representatives ; the budget was negotiated amid acrimonious talk of vetoes and veto overrides .
It will be better in 2008 only in that , in the absence of serious attempts at policymaking , there will be fewer clashes .
One possible area for co-operation ( though do n't hold your breath ) may yet come over global warming .
The White House has moved a long way towards accepting the man -made nature of the problem .
Although the administration is most unlikely to endorse Democratic plans for capping carbon emissions , there may be ground for agreement on some incremental changes , such as somewhat tighter standards for car emissions .
But the other big domestic issues that urgently need reform — immigration , health and social security — must all wait for the arrival of a new administration .
Iraq will be the most emotive subject of the campaign .
But the most significant issue could well be health care
American foreign policy could potentially be more interesting .
Mr Bush and his secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , have tried hard to rebuild bridges to American allies in Europe and Asia , and Ms Rice 's charm offensive is sure to continue in 2008 .
The task of improving transatlantic relations has been hugely helped by the advent of Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France , just as Angela Merkel has overseen a transformation in relations between Germany and America .
European diplomats hope that the gradual coaxing of America back towards full engagement in multilateral bodies like the United Nations will continue .
Progress in “ denuclearising ” North Korea could lead to a more fruitful period in American - Asian relations , too .
But Iraq and Iran will overhang all other areas of foreign policy .
In Iraq , the president has made it clear that he is determined to maintain a large number of troops ( probably more than 100,000 ) until the end of his presidency , barring either a catastrophic deterioration or a marked improvement there .
The Democrats in Congress , who tried and failed to end the war in the summer of 2007 , are unlikely to devote more than token energy towards trying again in 2008 .
This means that Mr Bush 's successor , whoever she or he is , will inherit the business of disengagement from Iraq as their most awkward first - term problem .
But it is Iran ( see article ) that may hold the key to how the last Bush year will unfold .
The administration has worked hard on a multilateral diplomatic approach that has borne no fruit .
It remains quite plausible that America will attempt unilateral military action in 2008 , which would set back its relations with most of its allies significantly .
First personalities , then policies
But few people , in America at least , will be paying much attention to any of the sterile arguments that will rattle up and down Pennsylvania Avenue .
The year 's political oxygen will be wholly consumed by the 2008 presidential race , and to a lesser extent by the Democrats ' bid to secure a proper working majority in the Senate rather than the measly one they have now .
And it will be a fascinating ride , falling into two quite different stages .
The first few months of the year will be taken up by the primaries , which will be more about personalities than policies .
But once the party nominations are settled , a profound argument about policy will begin .
This is because there is a striking degree of agreement within the parties , but very clear differences between them .
All the main Democrats , for instance , but none of the Republicans , favour remarkably similar plans to introduce universal health care to an America that badly needs it .
All the Democrats , and none of the Republicans , want to rescind Mr Bush 's tax cuts .
And so on .
Voters may be hard - pressed to see much difference between Hillary Clinton 's views and those of Barack Obama on anything ( though Mrs Clinton is more cautious than Mr Obama when it comes to withdrawing from Iraq and more hawkish about Iran ) ; but there will be profound differences between whichever of them wins and the eventual Republican nominee .
The Republican candidates , it is true , are deeply divided over moral matters such as abortion and gay marriage , but these are matters for the states , not the federal government .
Iraq will obviously be the most emotive subject in the campaign .
But the most significant issue could well be health care — unless there is a major new terrorist attack on America in 2008 ( in which case security will become the dominant issue and the Republican candidate will probably win ) , or else a serious recession ( which would help the Democrat ) .
On health , American voters will get a real choice .
They will be asked to say whether they are prepared to see a significant amount of federal money — anything from $ 100 billion to $ 200 billion — spent on the almost 50 m people who lack health insurance and are not covered by the Medicaid and Medicare government programmes , and who consequently live in fear of serious illness which can ruin them even if they fully recover .
And beyond the 50 m are tens of millions more who fear that losing their jobs and the health insurance that goes with them will expose them to the same risk .
It may not sound glamorous .
But the absence of a universal health - care system is a main driver of the feeling of economic insecurity that will be a big feature of the 2008 campaign .

What is a snowflake , you may ask ?
I ’m not talking about the fluffy white stuff outside right now for many of us ( although I think they ’re rather pretty ) , I ’m talking about small amounts of money saved or earned that are applied directly to debt or into savings before they melt away into who knows where .
If you are new to the concept , I invite you to read my snowflaking primer to learn all about how snowflaking works .
Basically , any extra money that you can come up with from earning more or spending less can be a snowflake .
I earn money for snowflaking from doing online contracting work , surveys , and this blog , for example , and I also try to spend as little as I can and apply the savings to pay down our debt one snowflake at a time .
Here are my Five Golden Rules for Snowflaking :
1. Snowflake early and often
This is really the overarching theme to snowflaking success .
Snowflake whatever you can whenever you can .
The more often you snowflake , the more it will become a habit to look for snowflakes .
Identify them wherever you can and keep making those snowflake payments .
The more ingrained the habit , the more you will find .
2 . No amount is too small to be a snowflake
I have snowflaked as little as $ 1.04 and as much as $ 1313.74 and everything inbetween .
Any amount can be a snowflake , and any amount can make a difference .
Especially when you are dealing with a debt that has interest charged to it ( which most are ) or putting money into savings earning interest , do n’t wait to get to a certain amount before applying that snowflake .
Whatever the amount – snowflake it .
3 . Anything can be a snowflake
Did you just save $ 3.40 at the grocery store using coupons ?
Did you just spend $ 5 less on shoes than you budgeted ?
Snowflake it .
Just like any amount can be a snowflake , snowflakes can come from any source .
They do n’t have to be from a specific income stream or a specific budget item .
Find them wherever you can .
4. Snowflake as immediately as possible
When you save or earn money to snowflake , do it immediately .
Transfer it to your savings account or make an immediate payment to debt .
If you ca n’t do it immediately , keep very careful track of the exact amounts and pay them or save them as soon as possible .
Right now , I am limited to 4 electronic payments a month on my credit card , so I keep track of all my snowflakes each week and make a payment once a week from my checking account .
My past credit card , I could pay as often as I wanted , so I would send an electronic payment as soon as I could get to the computer after finding a snowflake .
Do n’t give yourself a chance to spend the snowflake on something else .
5 . Keep track of your snowflakes to use for motivation
A lot of small amounts may not seem like a whole lot if you do n’t keep track of them .
As well as watching your debt total shrink or your savings total rise , keep track of the snowflakes themselves .
Keep a running total once a month to see how much all those small amounts add up to .
You may be surprised , I sure was .
It may not seem like much while you are doing it but a lot of little bits add up to one big chunk of debt demolished or savings achieved .
These five rules sum up the secrets to my snowflaking success .
Since really committing to and implementing this strategy in June , I ’ve paid off over $ 7000 to the principal on my debts , close to $ 5000 of that to my credit card debt alone ( my snowflake target ) , almost as much progress as I made the 3 years before that combined .
Snowflaking really works , and I hope you ’ve picked up a tip or two !
If you have any questions or tips of your own , please share them in the comments !

VIEWPOINT
Hugh Warwick
A marked decline in the number of the UK's hedgehogs has led to wildlife experts to add them to the Biodiversity Action Plan for threatened species .
In this week 's Green Room , Hugh Warwick argues that we have become bad hosts to the once frequent garden visitor .
As we manicure our green space ... we drive hedgehogs and their food out into a wilderness with little sign of comfort
Hedgehogs are pretty robust critters .
In some form or other they have been around since the beginning of mammals ; early versions were nipping at the heels of the departing dinosaurs .
They have survived ice ages , outlasted mammoths and sabre - toothed tigers and even managed to form a symbiotic relationship with their arch - predator , humans .
So why do we suddenly have to worry about the plummeting number of hedgehogs in the UK ?
Each year there is a slightly ironic research project to determine the population of animals , called Mammals on Roads .
It uses volunteers to drive stretches of highways , counting the number of corpses along the roadsides .
Co-ordinated by the People 's Trust for Endangered Species ( PTES ) , it has obvious benefits as far as gathering data on hedgehogs is concerned .
By comparing year - on - year figures , this technique has revealed a staggering drop in hedgehog numbers .
Over the UK as a whole there was a 20 % decline , and in some regions , it was as big as 50 % .
In response to this , the PTES and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society launched HogWatch .
Using some of the best brains in the business - namely Dr Paul Bright and his colleague Anouschka Hof from Royal Holloway , University of London - we set about trying to find answers to the problems presented by the road kill data ; primarily , what was causing this dramatic decline ?
The first part of the project was to build a map , employing a host of amateur naturalists .
Nearly 20,000 people answered our call for sightings , and more importantly absence of sightings , because in order to build a useful map we needed to know not just where the hedgehogs were , but also where they were not .
The great response confirmed the place of hedgehogs in the nation 's affection .
It also showed that there was an unexpected split down the country with more hedgehogs being seen in the east .
City limits
So what are the reasons for the decline ?
Although the project is only half way through , we are already beginning to get an idea as to some of the main causes .
Principal among these is habitat fragmentation .
As developments get denser , the wildlife corridors vanish .
A happy hedgehog habitat is one in which there is just the right combination of shelter and food .
Despite the defensive prickles , hogs do like to keep to the edges .
In fact their natural home is woodland edge - something that we have recreated in abundance - hedges .
Or at least there used to be plenty of hedges until the lunatic fashion of ecological destruction took hold .
But here is an interesting thought .
There used to be no hedges .
When the UK was largely forest , hedgehogs would have had to make do with clearings for their favoured climes .
They must have loved it as agriculture set in and hedges became the norm .
But nothing stays the same ; when the hedge - killers did their worst , the hogs sought refuge in suburbia as their homes were grubbed up and the farmers were paid for the havoc they wreaked .
In suburbia , humanity had created hedgehog heaven , a network of green spaces , complete with cover and food .
This is one of the reasons why hedgehogs are so popular ; they are like the perfect house guest .
We know they are there , but they make no fuss ; they also help out around the place , cleaning up the lettuce , chomping mini-beasts that infest our beds and borders .
So what is making our guests feel so unwelcome ?
The refuge of suburbia , sanctuary from the ecological desert that so much of our industrialised countryside has become , is also turning hostile .
And this is one of the reasons why hedgehogs are in decline .
Tidy gardens are not a hedgehog 's favourite habitat
As the roads become busier , so they also become impassable .
As developments get denser , the wildlife corridors vanish .
As the gardens get turned into extensions , either literally or through decking and patio heaters , more habitat is lost .
As we manicure our green space , nuking bugs and napalming weeds , we drive hedgehogs and their food out into a wilderness with little sign of comfort .
But it does not need to be like this ; hedgehogs are important - we have proved this time and again .
The Environment Agency wants a new icon and the vote goes to the hedgehog .
Whether it is greetings cards , tea - towels or cuddly toys , hedgehogs are everywhere .
So the hedgehogs can now help us to help them - if we realise the impact that our lifestyles are having on such a charismatic and well - loved beast , perhaps we can halt the out and out destruction of all that is green .
If you want hedgehogs in your garden or park , see that they have what they need : shelter and food .
Learn about hedgehogs so that you can begin to think like them .
The essence of empathy is in that level of understanding .
Start to try and appreciate your local area with the eyes , nose and ears of a hedgehog .
What are going to be the obstacles to a hedgehog haven ?
Then see if you can start to remove them .
Hugh Warwick is a freelance writer and ecologist .
His book , The Hedgehog 's Dilemma , will be published in October 2008
As part of the book , Hugh is collecting anecdotes about hedgehogs from all over the world .

The Green Room is a series of opinion pieces on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Hugh Warwick ?
Are we driving hedgehogs out of urban areas ?
Are new developments and tidier gardens depriving them of valuable food ?
Or are they little more than pests that eat the eggs of threatened birds ?
I think that hedgehogs are amazing animals .
The other day I was walking along a quite but sometimes dangerous road , and I found a hedgehog asleep .
We made sure that he was alive and OK then rolled him into a nearby bush .
Charlotte Cook , Durham , UK I am fortunate enough to live in a beautiful and unspoilt area of the U.K.
Cornwall , in fact on the edge of Bodmin Moor .
You would think that with all the woodland & hedgerows and large tracts of wild undisturbed countryside hear we would have abundance of hedgehogs .
But sadly thats not the case .
I have not seen one in years , & I spent a lot of time out early and late fishing .
where have they all gone ?.
David Wood , Liskeard
A scientific study about 4 or 5 years ago concluded that through a process of natural selection Hedgehogs had evolved there own green cross code .
Hedgehogs that were naturally cautious across roads had a longer lifespan and so were more successful at breeding so surely this study just backs this up ?
There are loads of Hedgehogs around me but then there are lots of hedges in my garden and the veggie patch provides a constant source of slugs for them ( they also get some cat food if I hear one rustling about in a hedge ) .
Andrew , Northampton I wholeheartedly agree with Hugh Warwick .
I would also like to see a ban on the sale of slug pellets .

We have been visited by hedgehogs for some years , and gave a home to an injured one for a while .
Our garden has lots of cover - and loads of slugs !
It 's suburban , but not so tidy that a hedgehog can't find what it needs .
Trouble is , there are fast roads and too many cars around , so they are killed when they leave .
Do n't think there is a solution to this aspect of the problem ; wish there were .
Althea Stevens , Newquay , Cornwall UK Judging by the daily roadkill , we must have thousands of them here .
Warren Davies , Ramsey , IOM During the 1950's and 60's we lived in houses with walled gardens ; high brick walls , and garden doors that came down to earth level .
My mother always had a hedgehog or two as Assistant Gardeners ; they were a great help at consuming slugs , and they were soon ' tamed ' to come when she took them a treat of a Egg Yolk mixed with a little milk .
For some reason I can still remember some of their names ; Quinton Hogg , Spike Milligan , and Simon de Bretton .
My mother always did have a magical touch with any animal ; she'd hold them in her hand and rub their soft belly fur and they 'd lie there blissfully .

I 've only ever seen 2 hedgehogs in my city , the first was in the middle of the road so i parked my bike to block traffic and walked next to it while it crossed the road , the other was lost in an urban area so I got a box and took it to the park , if their decline is to be stopped people need to stop thinking their superior to animals and go to the effort to make sure they cross our tarmac jungle safely .
Dale Morgan , Swansea , Wales I 'm dubious of estimating a population by road kills .
Are we sure hedgehog mums are n't teaching their kids the Green X Code ?
Ian , Ilford
It is not the hedgehogs ' fault that they have been eating birds ' eggs on the Uist islands .
I understand that humans introduced them .
I am so thankful that Uist Hedgehog Rescue has managed to save many from being killed by moving them to the mainland .
We are now into our fourth summer without seeing any hedgehogs in our garden and we miss them so much .
They used to be regular visitors but suddenly vanished - not a gradual reduction in numbers but total disappearance .
Jane Tyler , Bath , England
We have a very un-manicured suburban garden and are currently seeing hedgehogs several times most evenings ( not the all same one as they are different sizes and we sometimes see two at a time ... )
We have lived here over 20 years and had never seen any hedgehogs at all until last year , though I suppose they might have been there without our noticing .
We always put food and water out in the hope that they will keep coming back .

How come the science page is always full of British ecology ?
Before it was Birds in Britain this or Birds in Britain that , now it is Britian critters this or that .
Do n't you have more important world science news to report , or are some people sleeping over there ?

The big problem as I see it is the redevelopment of ' brownfield ' sites in towns : these places , often overgrown and unkempt , were the unsung nature - reserves of the country .
Now with the stupid pressure towards ever - higher housing density they 're being flattened and built on .
I know of several such sites that had once housed populations of slow - worms and lizards - now all they house is another tranche of prototype - slum ' affordable homes ' for chavs .
Tanuki , Wiltshire , UK My husband and I visited Scotland in 2000 , staying at Boleskine House on the east side of Loch Ness .
At the time we were individual travelers , driving around to see the ancient sites which took us hours away , simply exploring by following our map of the area .
We were looking forward to perhaps coming upon ( live ) hedgehogs as we do n't have them in California , but instead were sorely disappointed to find only a few dead ones on the roads .
We thought that we would see them alive , all over the place .
What a shame that hedgehogs are in such decline !
There definitely should be more serious localized , suburban , conservation measures in place to keep such an iconic and loved animal from going extinct .
May , Rancho Palos Verdes , CA Yes , I agree we need Hedgehogs .
They are yet another ecological indicator we would be stupid to ignore .
What is good for them is good for us .
My garden is a mess , but it has masses of wildlife .
The occasional hedgehog included .
The grubbing up of greenery in towns is disgraceful , and only adds to flooding , pollution and a bleak vista which encourages lack of respect for the neighbourhood .
The authorities need to remedy this fast .
A greener neighbourhood is a far more pleasant neighbourhood .

In the late 1970's I lived in a house in Rotterdam that was being overrun by mice .
It was that bad that my two cats did n't bother chasing them anymore .. they just let the mice play with them .
So I brought in the ultimate weapon in urban warfare against mice : a hedgehog .
Within two weeks my house was clear of mice ; whether he / she ate them or chased them out I did n't know or care .. it worked .
The only problem was that , being nocturnal , it found a place to sleep during the day : inside my bed pillow case , which I promptly forgot most nights .
And as I usually went to bed before it got up ... ouch ..
Small price to pay for a mouse - free house though .

What are these ?
Firefighters checked no one was inside and made the area safe
Luckily no one was using the Automated Public Convenience at the time but it was badly damaged and remained closed on Wednesday while engineers worked at the site .
Energy bosses blamed a fault in high voltage cables underneath the toilet , in Hanley town centre , Stoke - on - Trent , and said an investigation was under way .
Police were called to reports of an explosion in Hanley town centre , Stoke - on - Trent , at 0445 GMT on Wednesday .
Officers found the roof ripped off and smoke coming from inside .
This could have been quite distressing if not dangerous if someone had been in there and we are taking it very seriously

Parts of the surrounding pavement had also been lifted .
A spokesman said there were also unconfirmed reports that nearby traffic lights had been affected .
' Technical problem '
Rebecca Jackson , from Aquila , said they had isolated the cable but were investigating the fault and the siting of the toilet .
" This could have been quite distressing if not dangerous if someone had been in there and we are taking it very seriously , " she said .
" We would like to reassure domestic customers this is n't something that is likely to happen in their own homes .
" They have low voltage cables and lines going into their properties , their homes should not be sited over high voltage cables . "
The toilet , an Automated Public Convenience , was operated for the city council by JC Decaux .
The council 's spokesman , Terry James said : " The toilets have been there for around two or three years .
" It does n't appear to be vandalism or terrorism , it does appear to have been a technical problem . "
National surveys indicate that marijuana use is up , but the increase is not nearly as steep as the surge in arrests .
According to a University of Michigan study last year , half the high - school seniors surveyed nationwide said they had tried the drug , up from a third who said they had used it six years ago .
In New York , the increase in arrests grew out of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani 's pledge last year to make the fight on drugs , including marijuana , a major goal of his second term .
The city 's efforts have been particularly visible in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village .
The park once resembled a farmer 's market for marijuana sales , but now has its own police command post and is monitored by closed - circuit cameras .
'' The community in general is tired of walking through the park and being hassled by having someone yelling ' Smoke , smoke ' at them , '' said Arthur Strickler , district manager of Community Board 2 in the Village .
So far this year , marijuana arrests have surpassed the previous record of 27,264 people in 1997 , the police said .
'' We have changed the traditional strategy , '' said Chief Martin O'Boyle , commander of the Organized Crime Control Bureau , which oversees drug enforcement efforts .
He said officers now concentrate more on sting operations against buyers and less on having undercover officers buy from marijuana dealers , who even when caught do little jail time .
'' Now we try to discourage the customers , '' Chief O'Boyle said .
Although the arrest numbers are way up , those charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana do not face more severe penalties .
First offenders caught with as much as several ounces of the drug -- which sells for roughly $ 125 per ounce depending on the strength -- are eligible for a probation program known as adjournment contemplating dismissal , in which charges are dismissed if a defendant stays out of trouble for a set period of time .
During the last six months , for example , the Manhattan District Attorney 's office said that of 4,866 defendants whose low - level - possession cases were disposed of at arraignment , 63 percent were adjourned contemplating dismissal .
But by the time the defendants were arraigned , several criminal defense lawyers said , their clients had already spent half a day or more in custody , being fingerprinted , strip - searched and checked for possible outstanding arrest warrants .
DI --- Expelled for Plagiarism November 20 , 2007 19:47 MST
By SA Smith
It is one thing to correct Michael Behe , some structure guy with zero research experience on HIV - 1 evolution .
But considering the sheer number of DI “ fellows ” who are lawyers , and the fact I ’m just a biology student with zero experience in law , I found it rather strange that I caught something the DI lawyers evidently had no problem with :
Original : Long Original with Narration : DI manipulation with * Narration * :
Now , I have brought this to the attention of Harvard and XVIVO , and I do n’t know what they ’re going to do .
( They ’re Harvard .
— They can do whatever they want . )
I do know that they are not happy campers .
Now , IANAL , I am a virologist , but here ’s why I would be upset .
This is n’t a case of naive copyright infringement on Dembski ’s part , ie “ Hey !
I found this cool video on YouTube , lets use it ! ”
Though Dembski is pictured here , others have reported multiple DI “ fellows ” presenting this manipulated animation .
The Discovery Institute does not have a license to use this animation , so they downloaded it illegally .
Maybe they think it is “ okay ” to use it anyway because they stripped off Harvard / XVIVOs copyright and credits .
Maybe they think it is “ okay ” because they gave the animation a new title —
“ Inner life of a cell ” became “ The cell as an automated city ” — and an extraordinarily unprofessional new narration — alternate alternate title : “ Big Gay Al takes a tour of a cell ! ” .
Harvard / XVIVOs narration , all of the science , is whisked away and replaced with a “ surrealistic lilliputian realm ” — “ robots ” , “ manufacturing ” , “ circuitry ” , “ nanomotor ” , “ UPS labels ” .
Maybe they think it is “ okay ” because they turned all of Harvard ’s science into “ Magic ” !
Hmm .
From my point of view , as a virologist and former teaching assistant , this is n’t just copyright infringement .
This is theft and plagiarism .
Taking someone else ’s work without their consent , manipulating it without their consent , pretending it supports ID creationist ’s absurd views of reality , and presenting it as DI ’s work .
Shrug
The DI fellows would be expelled from my university for this .

Google Inc. will be placing a detection system on one of its advertising programs in an effort to stamp out a practice used to generate income from domain names without paying for them .
The practice , called " domain kiting , " takes advantage of a five - day grace period that exists when registering domain names with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , the group that oversees the registry of domain names .
Originally designed to allow people to rectify mistakes — such as spelling errors — the grace period has since become controversial because automation allows savvy computer users to sample domain names in large numbers and keep those that might generate ad revenue .
This practice is called " domain tasting . "
Repeated registering skirts domain fees
" Domain kiting " takes the practice one step further , with registrants cancelling their domain name before the grace period expires and immediately re-registering it , a process that can continue indefinitely and allow a person to avoid ever paying for the domain name .
The practice can be profitable , particularly if the registrant uses a service like Google Inc. 's AdSense for Domains or Yahoo Inc. 's Domain Match on the website .
This programs allow AdSense advertisements keyed to the domain name to be placed on the otherwise empty website .
When computer users click on those ads , both Google and the domain site owner get a percentage of the ad revenue generated .
While advertisers might not care how traffic is directed to their sites , legitimate websites that rely on Google AdSense ads to generate revenue have long disliked the domain kiting practice .
Google ads wo n't appear on ' kited ' sites
Now , Google is doing something about it , the company said in a statement Friday .
Its new kiting detection system is to take effect Feb. 11 .
" We have long discouraged domain kiting as a practice , " the company said .
" In order to more effectively deter it , we are launching a new domain kiting detection system .
If we determine that a domain is being kited , we will not allow Google ads to appear on the site .
We believe that this policy will have a positive impact for users and domain purchasers across the web . "
Jay Westerdal , president of Name Intelligence Inc. , a company that analyzes domain - name patterns , first reported Google 's plans on his Domain Tools blog on Thursday , citing Google sources that said the company would stop the practice by not allowing registrants to make money from websites that are less than five days old .
Such a policy would also impact domain tasting , not just domain kiting .
Last year , Name Intelligence Inc. released figures suggesting that in December 2006 , 1.2 million domain names were being " tasted " each day , up from 7,200 two years earlier .
The biggest typo in history
At least , it 's got to be the biggest one that I ever saw , in purely quantitative terms .
Today 's NYT Science Section has an article by Dennis Overbye ( " Laws of Nature , Source Unknown " ) that mentions
" ... string theory , the alleged theory of everything , which apparently has 10500 solutions ... "
This is a reference to the so - called string theory " landscape " , which is said to have about 10500 solutions .
Presumably Overbye wrote the number correctly , and it was typeset wrong , at least in the online version .
And 10500 is such a big number that it's hard to explain how big a typo this is .
If memory serves , the number of elementary particles in the known universe is believed to be about 1080 .
So if every elementary particle contained its own individual universe of 1080 particles , and every particle in every one of those sub-universes contained its own sub-sub - universe of the same size , there would be 1080x1080x1080=10240 particles in this three - level hierarachy of meta-universes .
If every one of the elementary particles in this baroque construction met every single one of the others , that would be 10240x10240=10480 pairings ( minus 10240 self - pairings , but never mind ) .
And if every one of these possible pairs of particles went out a quadrillion times , that would be 10495 interactions .
And if the participants posted 10,500 pictures of each of these events on Facebook , there would be about 10500 pictures in all .
[ There are , of course , much bigger numbers out there .
I discussed some of them earlier this year , in a post on MIT 's Independent Activities Period ( " Charm School ( and battling logicians ) " , 2/3/2007 ) .
There 's a somewhat more serious discussion here .
But the current competition is for the ( quantitatively ) largest typographical error in a serious publication .
I wo n't be surprised to learn that Dennis Overbye can be bested in this competition .
Pending documentation of a bigger mistake , though , this is the largest goof that I know about . ]
[ Update -- Andrew Greene writes :
I was just reading that article in my dead - tree edition of the Times , and the 500 was properly superscripted there .
I 've noticed before that when they convert articles to HTML the Times often fails to convert superscripts and subscripts to the appropriate tags .
]
[ Update # 2 -- though I did n't notice it at the time , there 's actually a typo of exactly the same sort , but much larger consequence , in a story that I linked to in my post on the Large Number Competition at MIT last January .
The article in The Tech ( " Professors Duke It Out in Big Number Duel " , 1/31/2007 ) describes the winning effort as follows :
Near the end of the duel , Rayo furiously scribbled on the whiteboard : " The smallest number bigger than any number that can be named by an expression in the language of first order set - theory with less than a googol ( 10100 ) symbols . "
Although this definition took a bit of tweaking , including what Rayo described as his " second order logic trick , " it soon won him the duel .
In this description , the numerical representation of a googol should of course be 10100 rather than 10100 .
No doubt the author was bitten by the same online production bug that lowered the superscript 500 in the case of Dennis Overbye 's article .
The award might still be contested , since The Tech 's error is in parentheses next to a written - out form of the number ... ]
[ Update # 3 -- Brett Altschul writes :
As both a theoretical particle physicist and a former news and production editor at The Tech , I thought I could provide a little more information about how typesetting errors with exponents occur on the Web .
First , when I read the Times article this morning , it was certainly not the first time I 've seen the 10500 number for the number of flux compactification vacua in string theory mangled as 10500 .
A search of the Times archive comes up with two other articles on string theory with the same mistake .
It 's sufficiently common in online information about strings that I barely even notice it now .
As to how it happens , I can tell you exactly how it occurs at The Tech 's Web site .
The Tech uses custom - written scripts to convert the article files into HTML with as little human interaction as possible .
The scripts have evolved and gotten much more sophisticated over the years , but the part that creates the HTML from the article copy was basically unchanged from 1994 ( when The Tech launched the Web 's very first news site ) to 2005 ( when I lasted checked on it ) , and it probably is the same to this day .
The script works by extracting the meta-tags in the article file and creating the corresponding HTML tags .
There are a number of quirks to the process though .
First of all , every type style that we wanted to be able to convert had to be put into the script by hand .
While boldface and italic are supported , most other styles are not , because they were not deemed useful for journalistic prose .
That included superscripts , which do come up occasionally ( and more often in The Tech that in most papers , I would think ) , but not very often .
The software also does n't know how to handle odd typefaces .
In my obituary for Prof. Henry Kendall , I was talking about his and other scientists ' work on quarks .
I mentioned the Omega^ - particle , using the Symbol font and a superscript .
The Web version renders this as W- ( which is a different particle altogether ) .
Another problem was that the style sheets used by the Quark Publishing System software that produced the print pages could do things with its style sheets that just could n't be done in HTML .
The title ( e.g. " NEWS EDITOR " ) in the bylines is supposed to be all capitals and italicized .
Both those functions can be implemented by the style sheets , but there 's no way to specify all caps in HTML .
So we were supposed to type our titles in all caps , so it would appear correctly in the online version , but not everybody did , and this is reflected in the online versions of some articles .
I assume that the problem with the Times ' algorithm is exactly the same as The Tech's .
While it 's possible to implement superscripts in HTML , nobody bothered to do it .

University students are smart .
Otherwise , you wouldnt be here .
But some students can be too smart for their own good , trying to trick professors by using what they consider to be sure - fire techniques for writing essays .
They are techniques that have been tried and tested by generations of university students  including some of your professors during their own college days .
They are all , however , useless .
They are a guaranteed way of receiving less than full points on the essay , and of convincing your professor that you value trying to get a good grade over genuine learning .
Beware of the  Six Evil Geniuses of Essay - Writing ,  and make sure that you avoid their company .
Evil Genius No. 1 : The Sycophant The Sycophant thinks that if he butters up the reader  by commenting positively on the lectures or on the reading assignments  the professor is likely to ignore the content of the essay itself .
For example : QUESTION : Why are political scientists concerned with the concept of political culture ?
ESSAY : In their brilliant , path - breaking work , Almond and Verba address the concept of political culture .
As Professor King demonstrated in his excellent and stimulating lecture , the concept of political culture is important .
By using it , as Professor King cogently argued , political scientists can explain a number of political phenomena .
. . .
Bad idea .
Essays like this read more like the minutes of a Soviet communist party congress than a response to an exam question .
Zero points .
Evil Genius No. 2 : The Rakish Raconteur The Rakish Raconteur is the first cousin of the Sycophant .
He feels that by writing in a conversational style and using the essay as a way of conversing  with the professor , his innate wit and charm will mask his lack of knowledge .
He may have a great career as a used car salesman , but his prospects in academia are definitely limited : QUESTION : Discuss the contrasting views of modernization theory  and dependency theory . 
Which one gives the best account of economic development ?
ESSAY : Well , as I was thinking the other night , modernization and dependency are really two sides of the same coin .
I mean , after all , who can say who is more modern than someone else ?
But seriously ( is this a trick question ? ) , there are a couple of ways that one differs from the other .
Modernizationists think that the world is linear and ordered ( they should see my dorm room ! ) . . .
This style is guaranteed to turn off any professor .
Essay questions are a way of assessing your knowledge and your ability to formulate a clear argument .
They are not intended as a chance for you and that lecture guy to hang out , know what I m saying ?
Zero points .
Evil Genius No. 3 : The Sanitary Engineer The Sanitary Engineer ( known long ago , in a less politically correct age , as a  garbage man ) is an expert at mind - dumping .
He has crammed a huge amount of facts , terms , typologies , and other information into his short - term memory , and nothing  not even the essay question itself  will prevent him from getting it all down on paper : QUESTION :
What did Tocqueville mean when he wrote about the importance of associations  in American civic life ?
ESSAY : Alexis de Tocqueville was a young ( 26 years old ) French traveler and writer who visited America for 9 months in 1831 - 1832 and wrote a book on his travels , published in two volumes in French in 1835 - 1840 , and in its English translation as Democracy in America .
His purpose in coming to the young United States ( in which he visited 17 of the 24 states at the time ) , which had engaged in a revolution with Great Britain over a half century before and had adopted an independent Constitution in 1789 , was actually to write a report on the American prison system .
He traveled with an associate , Gustave Beaumont ( see map and sketch of Beaumont on next page ) , . . . . .
Of course , it is always a good idea to let the reader know that you have full command of the facts .
But throwing in lots of irrelevant information without addressing the question at hand is never helpful .
The Sanitary Engineer has accumulated a great deal of information , and his ability to recall it all is certainly impressive .
But while his skills might be useful in a game of Trivial Pursuit , they wont necessarily help him answer the essay question .
Zero points .
Evil Genius No. 4 : The Jargon - Meister The Jargon - Meister attempts to blind the reader with science .
Using an array of political science terms  most of which he probably doesnt understand  he hopes to lull the reader into a state of social science ecstasy .
In such a state , the Jargon - Meister thinks , the professor will ignore the fact that the essay really doesnt say anything : QUESTION :
What do some theorists mean when they say that humans are rational actors ?
ESSAY : Rationality is an exogenous component of selective incentives .
As such , and in direct contradiction to the concept of endogenizing preferences , actors cannot be truly rational unless they have engaged in side - payments to rotating credit organizations .
This gives Mancur Olson ( 1965 ) a collective action problem from which he cannot reasonably recover .
. . .
The Jargon - Meister appears to make an argument  and a forceful one at that .
But once you peel away the terminology , you realize that there is not much content to the essay at all .
Zero points .
Evil Genius No. 5 : The Bait - and - Switch Artist The Bait - and - Switch Artist is a master of prestidigitation :
He engages in a sleight - of - hand in which he substitutes a new essay question for the one that appears on the page  and poof !
the essay question magically disappears .
His calling card is the word while : QUESTION : Evaluate Theda Skocpols argument on the origins of social revolutions .
ESSAY : While Theda Skocpol makes many interesting and important arguments about the origins of social revolutions , the concept of political culture is also extremely relevant .
Political culture can be defined as the array of beliefs and norms in a given society about the legitimacy of political actors and political institutions .
. . .
The Bait - and - Switch Artist may go on to write a brilliant essay , but it will not answer the question that was originally asked .
Zero points .
Evil Genius No. 6 : The Knee - Jerk Nihilist
The Knee - Jerk Nihilist is the most sophisticated , most dangerous , and most evil of the Six Evil Geniuses .
He has probably taken an introductory course in literary theory or postmodern philosophy , but has forgotten most of what he learned .
The one thing he took away from these courses , though , was a fundamental conviction that the world around us is just too complicated and too contradictory for us to make any sense of .
He also believes that because all our judgments are clouded by our own prejudices , anyones opinion is as good as anyone elses .
The Knee - Jerk Nihilist is often seen wearing black and reading Nietzsche .
He is also fond of quotation marks : QUESTION : What makes a political system democratic ?
ESSAY : Democracy is a relative concept .
In fact , the concept of concept is also relative .
Words mean whatever we want them to mean ,  and that is especially true for democracy . 
For some , it means free elections .
For others , it means keeping your own thugs in power and keeping the enemy thugs out of power . 
No one can ever give a coherent definition , because it always depends on the context . 
And since the context is always shifting , the concept of democracy  also shifts .
. . .
The Knee - Jerk Nihilist is smart .
He has read a great deal and thought seriously about issues .
But he has become so disillusioned about the possibility of our arriving at any real understanding about the world that he has mortgaged his powers of analysis for a modish slavery to intellectual skepticism .
Zero points .
Final Thoughts
If you avoid the Six Evil Geniuses , your chances of writing first - rate exam essays will increase markedly .
Of course , individual professors have their quirks , and part of being a successful college student is learning to work around these idiosyncrasies .
There is no guarantee that every professor will see essay - writing the same way .
But by keeping in mind the points above , you should be able to improve your ability to write clear and powerful essays that will help you organize your thoughts and deepen your understanding of key issues in political science .
And that , after all , is why you signed up for the course in the first place .

Unicycling enthusiast John Drummond , a technical writer at IBM , decided it might be fun to sell a few cycles over the Internet .
Seven months after unicycle.com debuted in 1999 , Drummond , of Marietta , Ga. , was so overwhelmed by demand that he enlisted the help of his wife , Amy .
The pair soon sped sales up from $ 150,000 in 1999 to $ 900,000 this year .
No , there was n't an inexplicable uptick in the clown population .
They attribute their success to a straightforward Internet domain name .
" Customers found us at the top of their Google searches , " he says .
So in 2003 , when Drummond looked to profit from his other hobby , banjos , he naturally sought to pluck banjo.com .
He had paid $ 4,200 for unicycle.com , but the owner of the banjo address wanted $ 150,000 .
Drummond wo n't say how much he ultimately paid , but he 's happy with the deal .
Banjo.com pulled in $ 120,000 in sales in 2003 and is on track to reach $ 450,000 this year .
