Access z / OS batch jobs from Java
Java provides access to z /OS batch jobs from anywhere
You probably know that you can use File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) to transfer files , but the z / OS FTP server is a little different .
Not only can it provide standard access to z / OS UNIX ® System Services files , the server can also provide the following :
z /OS datasets
Job Entry Subsystem ( JES ) spool datasets
SQL result sets
You can access these types of information from any FTP session .
With the help of a Java FTP client , you can put the information to good use .
Naturally , this article makes use of the access to the JES spool .
The FTP server provides access to a number of JES functions , including the following :
Submitting a job
Displaying the status of jobs
Receiving the spool output of a job ( Job Control Language [ JCL ] messages and SYSOUT )
Deleting a job
Submitting a job and automatically receiving output
This article addresses the second and third functions in more detail : displaying job status and receiving spool output .
Basics
Before starting , ensure the following :
Your z/OS machine has the FTP server running
You have a suitably authorized user ID
In addition , you can use any of several configuration parameters to control the behaviour of the JES interface , including the most important configuration parameter JESINTERFACELEVEL .
Table 1 shows a summary of configuration parameters .
Table 1 . JES interface configuration parameters
Parameter Description JESINTERFACELEVEL
Specifies the level of function the JES interface provides .
Set to 2 for the most function .
JESENTRYLIMIT
Limits how many jobs will be returned .
The default is 200 .
JESOWNER
Limits jobs retrieved to jobs with this owner .
If blank , defaults to the current user .
JESJOBNAME
Limits jobs retrieved to jobs with this job name .
If blank , defaults to the current user concatenated with an *.
Use * to retrieve all jobs .
JESSTATUS
Limits jobs retrieved to jobs with this status .
If blank , defaults to all states .
Valid states are OUTPUT , ACTIVE , and INPUT .
You can use the STAT command to verify the settings of the FTP server .
Listing 1 shows an example .
Listing 1 .
Using the STAT command

Simple FTP session
When you finish configuration , start an ordinary FTP session with the server .
After you establish a session , use the SITE FILETYPE subcommand to indicate that you want to obtain JES information rather than normal HFS files .
Listing 2 shows an interactive FTP session from a Windows® client .
Listing 2 . Using the SITE command
C:\>ftp 192.168.152.2 Connected to 192.168.152.2. 220-FTPD1 IBM FTP CS V1R5 at p390.qld.isi.com.au , 04:26:27 on 2006-09-06 .

200 SITE command was accepted ftp >
After you change the filetype to JES , several FTP commands operate differently , as described in Table 2 .
Table 2 . JES interface command differences
Command Description dir Lists jobs on the SYSOUT queue get Returns one or more SYSOUT files put Submits a job to JES delete Removes SYSOUT files
The operation of two of these commands is described below .
Command : dir
JES jobs on the SYSOUT queue are treated as single - level directories .
The dir command works in one of two ways :
The dir command with no arguments returns a list of all jobs that match the current setting of the JESJOBNAME parameter .
command with no arguments returns a list of all jobs that match the current setting of the parameter .
The dir command with an argument of a Jobid returns a list of all SYSOUT files that make up that job .
Listing 3 shows an example using the dir command .
Listing 3 .
Using the dir command
ftp > dir 200 Port request OK .

Note the following about this example :
The jobs match the criteria as specified in the status line 125 .
Job TSU00629 has 3 files , and this is what is reported when using the second command .
Command : get
The get command retrieves the contents of a specified JES job from the SYSOUT queue .
The command works in one of two ways :
Using an argument of jobid.n , the command retrieves the contents of file n from the job jobid .
from the job .
Using an argument of jobid.x , the command retrieves the contents of all files that make up job jobid .
In this case , the files are concatenated with a special separator of !!
END OF JES SPOOL FILE !! .
Listing 4 shows an example using the get command .

Java access
So far , I have given examples of FTP command line access to the JES spool files .
This is fine for simple work , but you can exploit the power of accessing the JES using FTP using a programmatic approach , such as Java .
You can use Java at two levels to access the JES using FTP :
Using Java to gain basic access to FTP services .
To do this , use the Jakarta Commons Net package .
See Related topics to find a link to download the Jakarta Commons Net package .
Exploiting the z / OS enhanced FTP server .
To do this , enhance the Commons Net configuration to adapt to the z / OS FTP server .
The two levels are described below in more detail .
Using the Commons Net library
Using the Commons Net library is easy , and it provides a means to access a number of communication protocols , including FTP .
When using the library for FTP access , use the main class FTPClient .
Refer to the Javadoc for useful getting - started notes about this class .
Listing 5 provides an example to illustrate how easy the library is to use .
Listing 5 . Using the Commons Net library
package evan.org ; import org.apache.commons.net.ftp .* ; import java.io.

length ; i++) { System.out.
println ( " file " + i + " is " + names [ i ] ) ; } } catch ( Exception e ) { e.printStackTrace ( ) ; } finally { try { ftp.quit ( ) ; } catch ( IOException e ) { e.printStackTrace ( ) ; } } } }

Extending use of the Commons Net library
The examples above provide a simple approach to obtaining JES output .
But , how can you get more fine - grained control over what you access and retrieve ?
The Javadoc for the FTPClient describes a list Files method .
This method provides a degree of encapsulation of the files concept , because it returns an array of FTPFile objects rather than simple String objects .
Listing 9 shows the use of the list Files method .
Listing 9 . Using listFiles
FTPFile [ ] result = ftp.listFiles ( " * " ) ; for ( int i=0 ; i < result.
length ; i++) { System.out.println ( " file " + i + " is " + result [i].getName ( ) ) ; }
As the output in Listing 10 shows , the results are not acceptable .
The retrieved filenames do not correspond with the filenames the FTP server is meant to report .
Seemingly , even though the Commons Net library can detect the host type automatically , this does not extend to the z / OS FTP extensions .
Listing 10 .

The good news is you can use the Commons Net library to configure the FTPClient to parse different types of file listings .
All you need to do is to produce a parser that can understand the output from the dir command and create instances of an FTPFile class .
But first , get the most flexibility by extending the FTPFile class .
This enables you to store the special attributes available to describe the JES files .
Listing 11 illustrates the outline of such a class .
Listing 11 .
Extending the FTPFile class
package evan.org ; import org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPFile ; /** * The JesJob class extends the FTPFile class .
This * allows for < code > JES </ code > specific information to * be maintained , in addition to the standard < code > FTPFile </ code > * information . * < p> This allows information for the spool files such as : * < ul > * < li>job name </ li > * < li>job id </li > * < li>job owner </ li > * < li>job status </li > * < li>job class </ li > * < li>job return code </ li > * </ul > */ public class JesJob extends FTPFile { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L ; private String sJobName ; private String sOwner ; private String sStatus ; private String sJobClass ; private String sReturnCode ; private String sNumFiles ; public JesJob ( ) { super ( ) ; sJobName = " " ; sOwner = " " ; sStatus = " " ; sJobClass = " " ; sReturnCode = " " ; sNumFiles = " " ; } public String getJobName ( ) { return sJobName ; } public void setJobName ( String jobname ) { sJobName = jobname ; } ... }
You can configure the FTPClient to use a particular parser by supplying an instance of the FTPClientConfig class , as shown in Listing 12 .
This object is created with the name of a class that implements the FTPFileEntryParse interface .
Listing 12 .
Configuring the FTPClient
ftp = new FTPClient( ) ; FTPClientConfig conf = new FTPClientConfig ( " evan.org.SimpleJesFileParser " ) ; ftp.configure ( conf ) ;
Listing 13 shows a basic implementation of evan.org .

Note the following about the code shown in Figure 13 :

In this case , you actually return an instance of , because you want to provide the extra JES information .
The parsing performed in this code uses a mixture of regular expressions and string comparisons .
This is a simple , functional implementation , though you could use better performing code to do the same thing .
Use the preParse method to filter out extra lines of information from the directory listing .
In the example , the heading line is detected and removed .
Finally , you can invoke the listFiles method , as shown in Listing 14 .
Note that the returned result is cast to the JesJob type .

4 troops abducted , killed in Iraq attack
By STEVEN R. HURST and QASSIM ABDUL - ZAHRA , Associated Press Writers 1 hour , 58 minutes ago
BAGHDAD , Iraq –
In perhaps the boldest and most sophisticated attack in four years of warfare , gunmen speaking English , wearing U.S. military uniforms and carrying American weapons abducted four U.S. soldiers last week at the provincial headquarters in the Shiite holy city of Karbala and then shot them to death .
The U.S. military confirmed a report earlier Friday by The Associated Press that three of the soldiers were dead and one was mortally wounded with a gunshot to the head when they were found in a neighboring province , about 25 miles from the compound where they were captured .
A fifth soldier was killed in the initial attack on the compound .
The new account contradicted a U.S. military statement on Jan. 20 , the day of the raid on an Iraqi governor ’s office , that five soldiers were killed “ repelling ” the attack .
The security breakdown and the dramatic kidnapping and murder of four soldiers leaked out just as
President Bush faces stiffening congressional opposition over his plan to flood Baghdad and surrounding regions with 21,500 more American troops .
Two of Congress ’s most vocal war critics , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( news , bio , voting record ) and Rep. John Murtha ( news , bio , voting record ) , were in the Iraqi capital as the news broke .
In a statement issued late Friday , the military said two of the soldiers were handcuffed together in the back seat of an SUV near the southern Iraqi town of Mahawil .
A third dead soldier was on the ground nearby .
The fourth soldier died on the way to the hospital .
The brazen assault , 50 miles south of Baghdad , was conducted by nine to 12 gunmen posing as an American security team , the military confirmed .
The attackers traveled in black GMC Suburban vehicles ( the type used by U.S. government convoys ) , had American weapons , wore new U.S. military combat fatigues , and spoke English , according to two senior U.S. military officials as well as Iraqi officials .
None of the American or Iraqi officials would allow use of their names because of the sensitive nature of the information .
The confirmation came after nearly a week of inquiries .
The U.S. military in Baghdad initially did not respond to repeated requests for comment on reports that began emerging from Iraqi government and military officials on the abduction and a major breakdown in security at the Karbala site .
Within hours of the AP report that four of the five dead soldiers had been abducted and found dead or dying about 25 miles east of Karbala , the military issued a long account of what took place .
“ The precision of the attack , the equipment used and the possible use of explosives to destroy the military vehicles in the compound suggests that the attack was well rehearsed prior to execution , ” said Lt. Col.
Scott Bleichwehl , spokesman for Multi-National Division - Baghdad .
“ The attackers went straight to where Americans were located in the provincial government facility , bypassing the Iraqi police in the compound , ” he said .
“ We are looking at all the evidence to determine who or what was responsible for the breakdown in security at the compound and the perpetration of the assault . ”
The Karbala raid , as explained by the Iraqi and American officials , began after nightfall on Jan. 20 , while American military officers were meeting with their Iraqi counterparts on the main floor of the Provisional Joint Coordination Center in Karbala .
Iraqi officials said the approaching convoy of black GMC Suburbans was waved through an Iraqi checkpoint at the edge of the city .
The Iraqi soldiers believed it to be American because of the type of vehicles , the distinctive camouflage American uniforms and the fact that they spoke English .
One Iraqi official said the leader of the assault team was blond , but no other official confirmed that .
A top Iraqi security official for Karbala province told the AP that the Iraqi guards at the checkpoint radioed ahead to the governor ’s compound to alert their compatriots that the convoy was on its way .
Iraqi officials said the attackers ’ convoy divided upon arrival , with some vehicles parking at the back of the main building where the meeting was taking place , and others parking in front .
The attackers threw a grenade and opened fire with automatic rifles as they grabbed two soldiers inside the compound .
Then the guerrilla assault team jumped on top of an armored U.S. Humvee and captured two more soldiers , the U.S. military officials said .
In its statement , the U.S. military said one soldier was killed and three were wounded by a “ hand grenade thrown into the center ’s main office which contains the provincial police chief ’s office on an upper floor . ”
The attackers captured four soldiers and fled with them and the computer east toward Mahawil in Babil province , crossing the Euphrates River , the U.S. military officials said .
The Iraqi officials said the four were captured alive and shot just before the vehicles were abandoned .
Police , who became suspicious when the convoy of attackers and their American captives did not stop at a roadblock , chased the vehicles and found the bodies , the gear and the abandoned SUVs .
The military statement said : “ Two soldiers were found handcuffed together in the back of one of the SUVs .
Both had suffered gunshot wounds and were dead .
A third soldier was found shot and dead on the ground .
Nearby , the fourth soldier was still alive , despite a gunshot wound to the head . ”
The wounded soldier was rushed to the hospital by Iraqi police but died on the way , the military said .
The military also said Iraqi police had found five SUVs , U.S. Army - type combat uniforms , boots , radios and a non-U.S. made rifle at the scene .
Three days after the killings , the U.S. military in Baghdad announced the arrest of four suspects in the attack and said they were detained on a tip from a Karbala resident .
No further information was released about the suspects .
Friday ’s military statement referred to the attackers as “ insurgents , ” which usually suggests Sunnis .
Although Karbala province is predominantly Shiite , Babil province is heavily populated by Sunnis in the north , near Baghdad .
Babil ’s central and southern regions are largely Shiite .
A senior Iraqi military official said the sophistication of the attack led him to believe it was the work of Iranian intelligence agents in conjunction with Iraq ’s Shiite Mahdi Army militia , which Iran funds , arms and trains .
The Defense Department has released the names of troops killed Jan. 20 but clearly identified only one as being killed because of the sneak attack .
Capt . Brian S. Freeman , 31 , of Temecula , Calif. , “ died of wounds suffered when his meeting area came under attack by mortar and small arms fire . ”
Freeman was assigned to the 412th Civil Affairs Battalion , Whitehall , Ohio .
The only other troops killed that day in that region of Iraq were four Army soldiers said to have been “ ambushed while conducting dismounted operations ” in Karbala .
The four were identified as 1st Lt. Jacob N. Fritz , 25 , of Verdon , Neb. ; Spc. Johnathan B. Chism , 22 , of Prairieville , La. ; Pfc. Shawn P. Falter , 25 , of Homer , N.Y. , and Pvt. Johnathon M. Millican , 20 , of Trafford , Ala .
All were with the 2nd Battalion , 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment , 4th Brigade Combat Team , 25th Infantry Division , of Fort Richardson , Alaska .
MORE : IRAQ CRASH KILLED KEY U.S. OFFICERS
In the wake of the story above , I decided to take a closer look at other recent U.S. military deaths in Iraq .
What I found was astonishing .
I did n’t know a helicopter could carry so much brass .
Among the dead in this single incident were :
Two colonels – Including the top U.S. Army surgeon in Iraq
One lieutenant colonel
One major
One captain
What the hell is going on over there ?
Is n’t there some standard operating procedure that would prevent so many officers from flying in a single helicopter over a combat zone ?

Iraq crash killed key U.S. officers
The copter went down last weekend .
A missile strike is suspected .
From the Associated Press
January 26 , 2007
BAGHDAD â€ ”
Two colonels , a lieutenant colonel and two command sergeants major were among the 12 U.S. soldiers killed last weekend in the crash of a Black Hawk helicopter northeast of Baghdad , the Pentagon said .
It appeared to be the largest number of key officers and command sergeants killed in a single incident since the Iraq war started nearly four years ago .
The helicopter went down Saturday in Diyala province , one of the volatile regions in the Iraq conflict .
The Army has said the cause of the crash is under investigation .
But a Pentagon official has said debris indicates the helicopter was hit by a surface - to - air missile .
Ten of the dead were members of the National Guard , making the crash the deadliest single combat incident for the Guard since at least the Korean War , said Mark Allen , a National Guard Bureau spokesman .
A Pentagon statement Wednesday said the victims included Col. Brian D. Allgood , 46 , the top Army surgeon in Iraq , and Col. Paul M. Kelly , 45 , assigned to the Joint Force Headquarters of the Virginia Army National Guard in Blackstone , Va .
Also killed were Command Sgt. Maj. Marilyn L. Gabbard , assigned to the Iowa National Guard , and Command Sgt. Maj . Roger W. Haller of the Maryland National Guard .
Command sergeant major is one of the Army ’s highest enlisted ranks .
The other victims were Lt. Col. David C. Canegata of the Virgin Islands National Guard ; Maj. Michael V. Taylor of the Arkansas National Guard ; Capt . Sean E. Lyerly of the Texas National Guard ; 1st Sgt. William T. Warren of the Arkansas National Guard ; Staff Sgt. Darryl D. Booker of the Virginia National Guard ; Sgt. 1st Class John Brown of the Arkansas National Guard ; Staff Sgt. Floyd E. Lake of the Virgin Islands National Guard ; and Cpl. Victor Langarica of the 86th Signal Battalion , Ft. Huachuca , Ariz .

Japan usually just says the bombing was " regrettable "
Shoichi Nakagawa , the policy chief of the governing party , said that the use of atomic weapons was a crime .
Mr Nakagawa has attracted controversy recently , calling for a debate on whether Japan should have nuclear arms .
He raised the possibility that North Koreans might try to attack Japan with their own nuclear weapons .
Speaking in Nagasaki over the weekend , Mr Nakagawa - a right - winger - said that atomic bombings were a crime .
The American decision to drop the atomic bomb was truly impermissible on humanitarian grounds , he said .
He repeated the comments on Monday , telling Reuters news agency : " By dropping two atomic bombs , many people , including ordinary citizens , were killed ...
I believe that such an act can be called a crime . "
Stronger stance
After the nuclear attacks in 1945 , the Japanese wartime government condemned the bombings as crimes against international law .
But later on the authorities gave up any idea of pursuing the issue of criminality .
Today the phrase the government more often uses to describe the attack is " regrettable " .
Mr Nakagawa appears to be going further , saying they were impermissible on humanitarian grounds .
Analysts say that Mr Nakagawa might have made the comments to simply acknowledge the understandable concern there might be in Nagasaki about his calls for a debate about nuclear weapons , and that this was an attempt to allay those fears with a strong condemnation of the use of the atomic bomb .
" Nakagawa must have said what he said in Nagasaki with a desire to ' nuance ' his repeated statements that there was nothing wrong for Japan to have a debate on itself going nuclear - and make it more acceptable , " said Koichi Nakano from Sophia University .
At the same time , though , he points out that Mr Nakagawa 's reference to a war crime by the Americans that was never really prosecuted is a favourite theme of right - wingers in Japan .
The politician 's comments were probably intended simply for a local audience and were not thought likely to be picked up elsewhere .
Mr Nakagawa also used his speech to warn of the threat posed by North Korea .
" There exists a country that appears likely to use them if it does not like something , " he said .
" Japan should do its utmost to ensure that no weapon of mass destruction can be used ever again . "
The women were asked about lifestyle during early pregnancy
A London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine team looked at 600 women who had miscarried and 6,000 whose pregnancies continued past 12 weeks .
They found that eating fruit and vegetables , and also chocolate , daily helped reduce the risk of miscarriage .
Those classed as underweight had a body mass index ( BMI ) under 18.5 .
While we still do n't have all the answers , these findings are going to help women who want to reduce their risk of losing a baby in pregnancy
Miscarriage Association spokeswoman
Calculate your BMI
An estimated one in five pregnancies in the UK will end in miscarriage , affecting around 250,000 women in the UK every year .
There are a number of well - established risk factors , such as increased maternal age , a previous history of miscarriage , and infertility .
But the causes of the majority of miscarriages are not fully understood .
Many supposed risk factors , such as alcohol consumption , smoking and caffeine intake , are deemed controversial or are unconfirmed .
The latest work is published in the journal BJOG .
It looked at the diet and lifestyles of adult women .
All the miscarriages had taken place since 1995 , while the successful pregnancies had occurred since 1980 .
Year of conception and a history of miscarriage were taken into account by the researchers .
Risk factors
Underweight women were 72 % more likely to miscarry in the first trimester , they found .
But the two - thirds of women who took vitamin supplements during early pregnancy reduced their risk by around 50 % .
The effect was most pronounced among those taking folic acid or iron and multivitamins containing these .
Eating fresh fruit and vegetables daily or on most days was also found to halve the odds of miscarriage .
Eating chocolate every day , as half the women did , also appeared to lower the risk .
Single women were at an increased risk of miscarriage , as were women who had had a previous abortion ( 60 % higher risk ) and those who had had IVF ( 40 % higher risk ) .
Those who described their pregnancy as " planned " had 40 % reduced odds of miscarriage .
But out of this group , those who took more than a year to conceive were twice as likely to miscarry as those who had conceived within three months .
The study also confirmed the widely - held belief that morning sickness is an indicator that the pregnancy is progressing well .
Women who suffered from nausea and sickness in the first 12 weeks were almost 70 % less likely to miscarry , and the more severe the sickness , the better the odds of the pregnancy continuing .
Stay positive
The researchers , led by Noreen Maconochie , a senior lecturer in epidemiology and medical statistics , said : " It is likely that advice to encourage a healthy diet and to try and reduce stress and promote emotional well - being might help women in early pregnancy , or those planning a pregnancy , reduce their risk of miscarriage . "
Dr Donald Peebles , of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists said : " I would want to stress , as much as possible , the positive findings .
This is not about castigating women . "
The Miscarriage Association added : " We speak to thousands of women who are desperate to find out why they miscarried and what they can do to prevent it happening again .
" While we still do n't have all the answers , these findings are going to help women who want to reduce their risk of losing a baby in pregnancy . "
Ray Markham said footballs had been flying into his garden for years but when one smashed into his greenhouse last month he refused to return it .
The 68 - year - old , who lives next to a policeman in Cubbington , said he was then arrested by four Warwickshire Police officers for theft of the ball .
Warwickshire Police said it was keen to resolve the matter with Mr Markham .
It 's laughable really , if it was n't serious it would be laughable
Ray Markham
Mr Markham said : " If it had n't been a policeman next door let 's be honest , I would n't have had four policeman on my doorstep , I would n't have seen a policeman .
" They can't come out to burglaries , do you think they would 've come out , four policeman to collect a ball ?
" It 's laughable really , if it was n't serious it would be laughable . "
A Warwickshire Police spokesman said : " It 's our intention to resolve the matter amicably at a local level .
" If Mr Markham is unhappy with the course of action taken he should contact the professional standards department at police headquarters and the matter will be further investigated . "
The National Enquirer 's Mike Walker is reporting that Britney Spears is going to get some much needed parenting help from ABC's " Supernanny , " Jo Frost .
Walker claims that after Britney 's recent mishaps with baby Sean Preston , she rung up Supernanny Jo and asked if she could arrange some private parenting lessons .
Nanny
Jo was thrilled at the chance to help out dear Brit and reportedly did n't hesitate to say yes $ cha- ching ! $ .
Word is that Britney was all ready to pay her the big bucks , but Nanny Jo had other ideas .
Instead , she refused to take any money and in exchange for private lessons , Britney had to agree to have the whole thing filmed for an episode of Supernanny .
Realizing how much her tips will will help her take care of Sean Preston and also show the critical public she is trying to be a better mother , Walker says Britney agreed to Nanny Jo 's conditions .
IMHO , this sounds a little too good to be true , but for everyone 's sake , Britney , Sean Preston , baby currently in Britney 's tummy and the fans ( me ! me ! ) who would love to watch this , I hope that it is .
Plus , the story is so funny , I had to tell you about it .
Weeee !
Supernanny to the rescue !

Deficit halved 2 years early
Three years ago , skeptics scoffed .
Now they 're eating crow .
Three years ago , President Bush established the goal of cutting the federal budget deficit by half in five years , without raising taxes .
At the time , many — including USA TODAY — expressed skepticism .
But it was achieved last year , three years ahead of schedule .
Now is the time to build on that success and work with Congress to balance the budget in the next five years .
On Feb . 5 , the president will propose the customary five - year budget , showing declining deficits every year and a surplus in 2012 .
Getting to balance requires both keeping the economy strong and keeping federal spending under control .
Key to the first is continuing pro-growth policies — including tax relief — that have helped fuel our robust economy .
Since the president 's tax relief became fully effective in 2003 , we 've seen a dramatic increase in business investment , more thanseven million new jobs created and higher wages for American workers .
This stronger economy has also generated record revenues over the past two years , cutting our deficit by more than $ 150 billion .
This is why it is so important to balance the budget without raising taxes and not put our economy at risk .
Key to the second condition is setting budget priorities and stopping unnecessary orwasteful spending .
Fiscal restraint while investing in our national security is equally important to a balanced budget .
The president 's budget will demonstrate how balance can be achieved by using cautious economic and revenue projections in line with forecasts by outside experts .
On spending , the president will propose realistic restraint , while increasing funding for the global war on terror , including all costs of Iraq and Afghanistan over the next two years .
In demonstrating how we can balance the budget in the next five years , the president will continue to call for bipartisan solutions to the longer term challenges posed by unsustainable growth in important entitlement programs .
In fact , a key reason to pursue a balanced budget now is to position us better for that future challenge .
A balanced budget is good for the American taxpayer and for our economy .
There 's plenty of work to be done , but I am optimistic we can do it — across party lines — as the American people expect and deserve .

The world 's first Creationist museum - dedicated to the idea that the creation of the world , as told in Genesis , is factually correct - will soon open .
Stephen Bates is given a sneak preview and asks : was there really a tyrannosaurus in the Bible ?
Just off the interstate , a couple of junctions down from Cincinnati 's international airport , over the state line in rural Kentucky , the finishing touches are being put to an impressive - looking building .
When it is finished and open to the public next summer , it may , quite possibly , be one of the weirdest museums in the world .
The Creation Museum - motto : " Prepare to Believe ! " - will be the first institution in the world whose contents , with the exception of a few turtles swimming in an artificial pond , are entirely fake .
It is dedicated to the proposition that the account of the creation of the world in the Book of Genesis is completely correct , and its mission is to convince visitors through a mixture of animatronic models , tableaux and a strangely Disneyfied version of the Bible story .
Its designer , Patrick Marsh , used to work at Universal Studios in Los Angeles and then in Japan before he saw the light , opened his soul to Jesus , and was born anew .
" The Bible is the only thing that gives you the full picture , " he says .
" Other religions do n't have that , and , as for scientists , so much of what they believe is pretty fuzzy about life and its origins ... oh , this is a great place to work , I will tell you that . "
So this is the Bible story , as truth .
Apart from the dinosaurs , that is .
As you stand in the museum 's lobby - the only part of the building approaching completion - you are surrounded by life - size dinosaur models , some moving and occasionally grunting as they chew the cud .
Beside the turtle pool , two animatronic , brown - complexioned children , demurely dressed in Hiawatha - like buckskin , gravely flutter with movement .
Behind them lurk two small Tyrannosaurus Rexes .
This scene is meant to date from before the Fall of Man and , apparently , dinosaurs .
Theological scholars may have noticed that there are , in fact , no dinosaurs mentioned in the Bible - and here lies the Creationists ' first problem .
Since there are undoubtedly dinosaur bones and since , according to the Creationists , the world is only 6,000 years old - a calculation devised by the 17th - century Bishop Ussher , counting back through the Bible to the Creation , a formula more or less accepted by the museum - dinosaurs must be shoehorned in somewhere , along with the Babylonians , Egyptians and the other ancient civilisations .
As for the Grand Canyon - no problem : that was , of course , created in a few months by Noah 's Flood .
But what , I ask wonderingly , about those fossilised remains of early man -like creatures ?
Marsh knows all about that : " There are no such things .
Humans are basically as you see them today .
Those skeletons they 've found , what 's the word ?
... they could have been deformed , diseased or something .
I 've seen people like that running round the streets of New York . "
Nothing can dent the designer 's zeal as he leads us gingerly through the labyrinth of rooms still under construction , with bits of wood , and the odd dinosaur head occasionally blocking our path .
The light of keenness shines from the faces of the workers , too , as they chisel out mountain sides and work out where to put the Tree of Life .
They greet us cheerily as we pass .
They , too , know they are doing the Lord 's Work , and each has signed a contract saying they believe in the Seven Days of Creation theory .
Mornings on this construction site start with prayer meetings .
Do n't think for a minute that this is some sort of crazy little hole - in - the - corner project .
The museum is costing $ 25 m ( £ 13 m ) and all but $ 3 m has already been raised from private donations .
It is strategically placed , too - not in the middle of nowhere , but within six hours ' drive of two - thirds of the entire population of the US .
And , as we know , up to 50 million of them do believe that the Bible 's account of Creation is literally true .
We pass the site where one day an animatronic Adam will squat beside the Tree .
With this commitment to authenticity , I find myself asking what they are doing about the fig leaf .
Marsh considers this gravely and replies : " He is appropriately positioned , so he can be modest .
There will be a lamb or something there next to him .
We are very careful about that : some of our donors are scared to death about nudity . "
The same will go for the scene where Eve is created out of Adam 's rib , apparently , and parents will be warned that little children may be scared by the authenticity of some of the scenes .
" Absolutely , because we are in there , being faithful to scripture . "
A little licence is allowed , however , where the Bible falls down on the details .
The depiction of a wall - sized section of Noah 's Ark is based , not on the traditional picture of a flat - decked boat , but one designed by navy engineers with a keel and bows , which might , at least , have floated .
" You can surmise , " says Marsh .
When you get inside , there 's nifty computer software telling you how they fitted all the animals in , too .
The museum 's research scientist , Dr Jason Lisle , has a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Colorado at Boulder .
He realised he was a Christian while he was an undergraduate , but did n't spread it around : " People get very emotional about the issue .
I do n't believe we should ever be obnoxious about our faith .
I just kept quiet . "
And how did he pass the exams ?
" I never lied , but if I was asked a question about the age of the universe , I answered from my knowledge of the topic , not my beliefs . "
The museum 's planetarium is his pride and joy .
Lisle writes the commentary .
" Amazing !
God has a name for each star , " it says , and : " The sun 's distance from earth did not happen by chance . "
There is much more in this vein , but not what God thought he was doing when he made Pluto , or why .
Now , we are taken to meet Ken Ham , the museum 's director and its inspiration .
Ham is an Australian , a former science teacher - though not , he is at pains to say , a scientist - and he has been working on the project for much of the past 20 years since moving to the US .
" You 'd never find something like this in Australia , " he says .
" If you want to get the message out , it has to be here . "
Reassuringly , on the wall outside his office , are three framed photographs of the former Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh - " cricket 's never really caught on over here " - and inside , on his bookshelves , is a wooden model of a platypus .
On top of the shelves is an array of fluffy poodle toys , as well as cuddly dinosaurs .
" Poodles are degenerate mutants of dogs .
I say that in my lectures and people present them to me as gifts . "
Ham is a large man with a chin- hugging beard like an Old Testament prophet or an old - fashioned preacher , both of which he is , in a way .
He lectures all over the world and spent a month in Britain earlier in the summer spreading the message to the faithful in parish halls from Cornwall to Scotland .
" We want to try to convince people using observational science , " he says .
" It 's done very gently but forthrightly .
We give both sides , which is more than the Science Museum in London does . "
This is true in that the Creation museum does include an animatronic evolutionist archaeologist , sitting beside a creationist , at one point .
But there 's no space for an animatronic Charles Darwin to fit alongside King David and his harp .
On the shelf behind Ham 's desk lie several surprising books , including Richard Dawkins ' latest .
" I 've skipped through it .
The thing is , Dawkins does not have infinite knowledge or understanding himself .
He 's got a position , too , it 's just a different one from ours .
The Bible makes sense and is overwhelmingly confirmed by observable science .
It does not confirm the belief in evolution . "
But if you believe in the Bible , why do you need to seek scientific credibility , and why are Creationists so reluctant to put their theories to peer review , I ask ?
" I would give the same answer as Dawkins .
He believes there is no God and nothing you could say would convince him otherwise .
You are dealing with an origins issue .
If you do n't have the information , you can not be sure .
Nothing contradicts the Bible 's account of the origins . "
We wander across to the bookshop , which , far from being another biblical epic , is done up like a medieval castle , framed with heraldic shields and filled with images of dragons - dragons , you see , being what dinosaurs became .
It is full of books with titles such as Infallible Proofs , The Lie , The Great Dinosaur Mystery Solved and even a DVD entitled Arguments Creationists Should Not Use .
As we finish the tour , Ham tells us about the museum 's website , AnswersInGenesis.org .
They are expecting 300,000 visitors a year .
" You 've not seen anything yet , " he says with a smile .
Al - Qaeda 's influence and numbers are rapidly growing in Afghanistan , with fighters operating from new havens and mimicking techniques learned on the Iraqi battlefield for use against U.S. and allied troops , the directors of the CIA and defense intelligence told Congress yesterday .
Five years after the United States drove al - Qaeda and the Taliban from Afghanistan , Gen. Michael V. Hayden , director of the CIA , told the Senate Armed Services Committee that both groups are back , waging a " bloody insurgency " in the south and east of the country .
U.S. support for the Kabul government of Hamid Karzai will be needed for " at least a decade " to ensure that the country does not fall again , he said .
Noam Chomsky
Hayden told the Senate panel that the Taliban , aided by al - Qaeda , " has built momentum this year " in Afghanistan and that " the level of violence associated with the insurgency has increased significantly . "
He also noted that Karzai 's government " is nowhere to be seen " in many rural areas where a lack of security is affecting millions of Afghans for whom the quality of life has not advanced since the U.S. military arrived in October 2001 .
. . . .
Hayden said yesterday that " the group 's cadre of seasoned , committed leaders " remains fairly cohesive and focused on strategic objectives , " despite having lost a number of veterans over the years . "
Bin Laden himself , and his deputy Ayman al - Zawahiri , continue to play a crucial role while hiding out somewhere along the Afghan - Pakistani border .
Hayden said the organization had lost a series of leaders since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
But the losses have been " mitigated by what is , frankly , a pretty deep bench of low - ranking personnel capable of stepping up to assume leadership positions . "
Hayden said the lower ranks are dominated by men in their early 40s with two decades of experience fighting .
Ronald E. Neumann , the American ambassador in Kabul , said in a recently that " the United States faced “ stark choices ” in Afghanistan .
Averting failure , he said , would take “ multiple years ” and “ multiple billions . ”
“ We ’re going to have to stay at it , ” he said .
“ Or we ’re going to fail and the country will fall apart again . ”
The American people know the difference between responsible and irresponsible debate when they see it .
They know the difference between honest critics who question the way the war is being prosecuted and partisan critics who claim that we acted in Iraq because of oil , or because of Israel , or because we misled the American people .
And they know the difference between a loyal opposition that points out what is wrong , and defeatists who refuse to see that anything is right .
We 're constantly told that the reason it is so dangerous to leave Iraq prior to the " completion of the mission " -- whatever that might mean today -- is because premature withdrawal will create a " vacuum " that will enable Al - Qaeda to use Iraq as a base for training and other activities .
And it 's probably true that that will happen .
But that ( according to the U.S. military ) is exactly what has already happened in a substantial portion of the country and we seem completely incapable of doing anything about that ( if we were unable to prevent it from happening in the first place , it seems to be a fair inference that -- in the absence of a major change in strategy and a massive increases in resources -- we can't reverse it ) .
But worse than that is the fact that the power vacuum which we are told is so dangerous already exists not only in Iraq , but also in Afghanistan .
Remember Afghanistan -- the one great success of the Bush administration -- where we rid that country of the evil Taliban and denied Al - Qaeda free rein ?
Except for how we have n't done any of that .
Quite the opposite
We 've been inundated with endless happy talk about how we shattered Al - Qaeda 's infrastructure and have them on the run , impotently hiding in caves with no leadership ( with the completely unimportant exceptions of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahri , the group 's two top leaders for the last decade ; but we sure did get their endless army of " number threes " ) .
Yet all of that talk about how much we have crippled Al Qaeda is pure fiction , saysthe President 's hand - picked CIA Director : Shortly before the election , someone leaked a CIA assessment to David Rohde and Jim Risen , who wrote an article in the New York Times describing the CIA 's concerns about the inability of the " Afghan Government " to " exert authority beyond Kabul , " as well as the corruption of its police force and army that is so pervasive that it basically requires them to be re-built from scratch .
Even Bush officials , on the record , are giving extremely grim assessments of Afghanistan : What is the U.S. going to do about all of this ?
The few war advocates left insist that all we need in Iraq is just some more troops and some more time .
Except we do n't have more troops ( according to the military itself ) and the ones we do have are spread thin and exhausted from multiple tours of duty .
And even if we did have some magic troops materialize for Iraq , what would we do about Afghanistan , which -- according to Bush 's own ambassador -- requires a commitment of enormous additional resources over many years just to prevent the country from " fall[ing ] apart again " ?
And even if these severe and dangerous problems could be solved with a massive increase in resources ( money and troops ) -- an extremely precarious premise , to put it mildly -- how would we pay for that ?
The Republican propaganda machine has made even the mere mention of tax increases politically toxic .
Even the suggestion that the Bush tax cuts maybe should n't be made permanent was a weapon that was used by Republicans in an effort to keep themselves in power .
And we are a country that is drowning in deficits and buried by debt .
" Imperial overstretch " does n't even begin to describe the untenability of our predicament .
The real problem is that we do n't actually debate the issues that are the real ones because they are too politically radioactive .
The real choice is whether we want to maintain our presence and controlling influence in the Middle East and , if so , ( a ) why do we want to do that ? ; and ( b ) what are we are going to do to enable us to maintain that dominance ?
But we can't discuss item ( a ) in any constructive way because doing so requires a debate about the role of oil and our commitment to Israel , both of which are strictly off limits , as the President himself told us
It may be the case that we need to preserve our influence in the Middle East .
Perhaps we want to control oil resources or assume primary responsibility for ensuring a steady and orderly world oil market .
Or perhaps we want to commit ourselves to defending Israel as the only real outpost of Middle Eastern democracy and / or an ally of one degree or another in protecting our vital strategic interests in that region ( if any ) .
There are reasonable arguments to be made in support of all of those views ( on both sides ) , but those issues have been cemented with a mandated orthodoxy and no examination of them is allowed ( if one wants to continue to be heard in the mainstream ) .
So we dance around the real questions and are stuck with superficial and contrived " debates " about what we are really doing , all of which obscures our choices and our reality far more than clarifying them .
If preserving our dominance of the Middle East is something we want to make a priority , then we would need to decide what sarifices we are willing to make to do so -- how we will massively expand our military , the increase in indiscriminate force we are willing to accept , and how we are going to pay for our imperial missions .
Because as long as we are committed to dominating that region , we are going to be engaged in a long and likely endless series of wars against religious fanatics and various nationalistis who simply do n't want us there and are willing to fight to the death -- making all sorts of sacrifices -- to prevent us from dominating their countries .
If we want to fight the wars necessary to maintain our dominance in the Middle East , then we should do so .
And if we do n't , then we should n't .
But this middle course -- where we plod along aimlessly , starting wars that we 're not really committed to winning and therefore are losing -- is not only the most incoherent course , but also the most destructive one .
What is indisputably clear is that our current course is totally unsustainable .
That 's just reality .
It is n't that things have progressed too slowly in Afghanistan and Iraq .
It 's that the situation has deteriorated in both countries , to the point where Al Qaeda now has not one but two countries ( not counting a nuclear - armed Pakistan ) in which it is more or less free to operate .
And the stronger they get , the more of our resources are needed to keep up .
Yet we do n't have the resources needed and are n't willing to make the sacrifices necessary to get them .
But we pretend that 's not the case by insisting on our divine entitlement to magical victory and depicting those who claim otherwise as people who hate the troops and do n't want to win .
Incremental changes and some mild limits on this administration are nice and welcomed .
But the damage done to the United States by this administration over the last six years is truly severe .
It 's fundamental damage , and it requires much , much more than some tinkering around the edges .
We need a debate and re-examination of the core premises of our foreign policy and our role in the world .
That , in turn , requires a willingness to call into question the most sacred orthodoxies , which , in turn , requires real political leaders with the courage , credibility and skills to do that .
Does anyone see any of those ?
In the report below , we said that Lu Banglie was so injured in the beating that " his eye [ lay ] out of its socket " and " the ligaments in his neck were broken " .
Subsequent reports have made it clear that Mr Lu's injuries were not as serious as had been stated .
In particular , a report headed Chinese activist vows to continue , despite beating , printed on October 12 , stated , after an interview with Mr Lu , " Although he was in pain from his neck , it was not broken and his eye did not come out of its socket . "
The readers ' editor will write about this in his column on October 17 .
The last time I saw Lu Banglie , he was lying in a ditch on the side of the street - placid , numb and lifeless - the spit , snot and urine of about 20 men mixing with his blood , and running all over his body .
I had only met him that day .
He was to show me the way to Taishi , the hotspot of the growing rural uprisings in China .
It felt like heading into a war .
Taishi is under siege , I was warned .
The day I arrived a French radio journalist and a Hong Kong print journalist were rumoured to have been beaten somewhere around Taishi .
The Taishi election had also been scheduled for that very day , and news of a hunger strike by one of the two most famous figures in Taishi had just come out .
Mr Lu was a very soft - spoken man , one of those skinny guys who looked like he might start tearing at any moment .
Born as a peasant in Baoyuesi village of Bailizhou town in Zhijiang city in Hubei province , he was a people 's representative and had been in the village of Taishi since the start of a democratic movement in the area .
That movement , deeply unpopular with the local authorities , has come to be seen as a weather vane for China 's tentative steps toward a more representative society .
It has led to beatings and mass arrests among its population as well as for observers who ventured into its environs .
Mr Lu was at the forefront of this maelstrom .
And yesterday this was where the problem lay .
We had hired a taxi .
Mr
Lu got in the car to put us on the right road .
As we got closer , I asked him to get out .
He refused .
" If you go , I go , " he insisted .
I told him he would be endangering himself , the driver and maybe us .
He was unfazed , not even listening .
I repeated for a third time that I wanted him to get out of the car .
It did n't work .
The translator was annoyed and asked me to leave it .
Mr
Lu knew the risks better than us , he reasoned .
So I dropped it , and it was this appeasement that determined Mr Lu's fate .
We arrived on the outskirts of Taishi , just as the dirt roads start .
There were 30 to 50 men - angry , inebriated , bored men .
Most looked like thugs .
Some wore military camouflage uniform .
Some wore blue uniforms with badges on the shoulders , and one guy had a greyish - mauve uniform with a walkie - talkie .
Our taxi driver , who we had hired randomly in a neighbouring village , was called out by the thugs .
They screamed at him : " What the fuck are you doing here ? "
He knew nothing .
He came back in and screamed at us .
" Fuck all of you , look now you 've gotten me into trouble . "
We told him to reverse but by that time it was already too late , the car was encircled .
" Do n't go out ! , " I screamed , telling everyone to lock their doors .
I called a colleague on my mobile , asked him to stay on the phone with me .
The men outside shouted among themselves and those in uniform suddenly left .
Those remaining started pushing on the car , screaming at us to get out .
They pointed flashlights at us , and when the light hit Mr Lu's face , it was as if a bomb had gone off .
They completely lost it .
They pulled him out and bashed him to the ground , kicked him , pulverised him , stomped on his head over and over again .
The beating was loud , like the crack of a wooden board , and he was unconscious within 30 seconds .
They continued for 10 minutes .
The body of this skinny little man turned to putty between the kicking legs of the rancorous men .
This was not about teaching a man a lesson , about scaring me , about preventing access to the village ; this was about vengeance - retribution for teaching villagers their legal rights , for agitating , for daring to hide .
They slowed down but never stopped .
He lay there - his eye out of its socket , his tongue cut , a stream of blood dropping from his mouth , his body limp , twisted .
The ligaments in his neck were broken , so his head lay sideways as if connected to the rest of his body by a rubber band .
We were probably in the car another five to eight minutes .
The front windows were open and various men were reaching in to unlock my door .
I held my hand tight to the lock .
They punched me , twisted my wrist , tried everything possible with a quick grab to get me out .
But I would n't let go , and I defended myself while watching Mr Lu get beaten through the window .
Eventually , my translator got out .
I followed .
They opened my pen , searched my pockets , underwear and socks , asked my translator if his watch could record anything .
They asked what we were doing in Taishi .
They found my Chinese press pass .
" You foreigners you are ruining Taishi , " they screamed .
" You write write write so much about what 's happened here that all these businesses have fled the new industrial zone . "
My head was spinning .
I was in a mixed state of shock at what had happened to Mr Lu and utter fear for my life .
I shamelessly begged .
I prayed .
I offered them money .
I tried to smile at them .
Random people came up to Mr Lu and kicked him in the head , clearing their nose of snot on his body , spitting on him , peeing on him , showing off for each other .
I had no idea what to do .
I stood there , sweating , my hands ripping my hair out , just staring at the blood all over the man who had risked his life to help me .
An ambulance came .
The medic got out , checked his pulse and left .
Then it hit me : I 'd done absolutely nothing to save Mr Lu. I stood there watching .
I 'm trained as a medic , and I did nothing to save Mr Lu. Absolutely nothing .
They put us in a car , told us we were being taken for interrogation .
On the way the men joked , laughed and we shook .
Mr Lu spent his adult life working to empower villagers and to get the attention of Beijing and the world .
He was beaten up many times , had scars all over his body .
This , he thought , was part of his work .
Once at the township , they put us at a conference table with flowers and spring water .
About 15 officials sat round it and politely questioned us , videotaping the interaction as if it were a TV show .
" Why did you come to Taishi ?
Why did you meet Lu Banglie ?
How did you meet him ? " they asked .
" We are not interested in the reception of media interviews of any kind at this juncture in time , " one official explained .
His superior arrived : Ms Qi Hong , associate director of the government news office in Guangzhou .
" China is open to foreigners , " she said .
" We welcome any journalists in Guangzhou , but if you do n't follow the proper procedures how can we guarantee your safety ? "
The initiator of Mr Lu's beating sat at the table , eyes bloodshot , arms crossed at an angle , his elbow jutting into the air as if to show his extreme disinterest in us .
They said we had broken the law by coming here without permission .
We apologised .
That is all , that is how the night ended .
We walked out of the government building , still being filmed , across the lawn , past the Chinese flag at high mast , and into the car .
They waved and smiled , filming us as we drove off .
And this is all I can say about the story of Mr Lu because I never saw Taishi from the inside and cannot tell you how it looks , what the people say , how the air feels .
What I can tell you is that what 's going on in Taishi is perhaps the most significant grassroots social movement China has seen since the Cultural Revolution , a rural revolt against corruption , against deterioration of healthcare , against the illegal sale of farmland , and broadly against urban capitalism that has reaped no benefits for these farmers .
The Guardian has been unable to confirm what happened to Mr Lu .
Police said they had received reports that he had been taken to hospital , but that he had been released and was " fine " .
The three nearest hospitals said that no one had been admitted yesterday .
The last words of Mr Lu I wrote down were : " The police cover their arses .
They employ all these thugs whose lives mean nothing to them to kill you .
That 's why once we are in this we can't go out . "
Sweden ’s Lantmäteriverket , the state GIS agency , has been caught camouflaging its censorship of the country ’s spy headquarters on aerial images it makes public , and Google Maps is directly responsible for the find .
It started when Eniro , a mainstream search and mapping site for Sweden , decided to use Lantmäteriverket ’s images to add aerial shots and hybrid maps to its mapping service , much like Google Maps does .
A publication eventually noticed that the aerial data provided by Eniro and Google do n’t match in a special spot on the outskirts of Stockholm .
Here is Eniro ’s image :
Google ’s image :
What ’s even more absurd is that Eniro ’s mapping service actually has the roads and buildings , so the hybrid image looks like this :
( Incidentally , Google Maps and Google Earth do n’t have the same dataset for this location — Google Earth ’s has a random cloud covering the crucial spot . )
It turns out that Lantmäteriverket employs a person whose job it is to camouflage its censorship by painting over buildings with trees and fields .
The story made it to Sweden ’s lagest tabloid on Thursday in mangled form ( of course ) , as blogged by Patrick Strang ( in Swedish ) .
Strang also rightly points out that the only effect of such camouflaging , where you are lied to about the true information content of a map , is to distrust all maps by the same source , in this case Lantmäteriverket .
It makes these maps less than useless , especially when Google Maps and Earth is around .
And it is behaviour unbefitting an open society .
If you need to censor something , fine , but do n’t hide the decision .
That way lies 1984 .
Another interesting tidbit :
The agency said it does not have a problem with Google ’s images , as they are satellite - based , and hence outside the jurisdiction of Sweden , whereas the images it can censor are taken from planes that fly within its jurisdiction .
Countries do indeed have a monopoly on sovereignty in the air , and not in space .
( Early datasets for Google Earth also used images of the White House where censoriship by a US agency was camouflaged , as blogged here . )
[ Update 2006 - 04 - 10 :
There ’s two further updates to the story , in the meantime : Yes , we have no Swedish spy base and Sweden : Watching the watchers ( with Google )
According to this poll , more Germans consider the U.S. to be a danger for world peace than Iran .
45 % of Germans call the U.S. a " greater threat to world peace " than Iran .
28 % think that Iran is a greater threat .
For 16 % , the U.S. and Iran pose identical threats .
The results do n't surprise me at all .
I mean , Iran is economically extremly promising for Germany .
And Iran has made it clear what it expects in return for economic favours :
" The international deputy of Iran 's Chamber of Commerce , Dr. Fereidoun Entezari , believes that business relations will surely improve if the Europeans do not pollute the economic issues with the political ones . "
Germany got the message ...

The most telling detail in The Economist ‘s coverage of Google and YouTube was the subhead : “ Google ’s acquisition of YouTube shows that ‘ Web 2.0 ’ has come of age . ”
A few weeks back , The Economist was calling “ Web 2.0 ” a trend .
Their phrase was , “ hot Web 2.0 trend . ”
The magazine now intends “ Web 2.0 ” to be understood as a sort of second edition :
This week ’s pairing of Google and YouTube may come to be remembered as the moment “ Web 2.0 ″ — ie , the web , version two — came of age .
Clearly “ Web 2.0 ” means different things to different journalists on different days .
Mostly it means nothing — except a bigger paycheck .
But let ’s simplify what The Economist is saying :
Web 1.0 : AOL buys Time Warner .
Web 2.0 : Google buys YouTube .
Put another way :
Web 1.0 : New media company buys old media company .
Web 2.0 : New media company buys new media company .
If we ’re stuck with this meaningless Web 2.0 label , let ’s at least have some fun with it .
Here ’s my new game .
I ’ll start , you finish :
Web 1.0 : Joshua Davis on the cover of Art News .
Web 2.0 : 37signals on the cover of Forbes .
Web 1.0 : Users create the content ( Slashdot ) .
Web 2.0 : Users create the content ( Flickr ) .
Web 1.0 : Crap sites on Geocities .
Web 2.0 : Crap sites on MySpace .

A researcher in Africa has finally spotted the rare white giraffe that he 's been seeking for twelve years , and he 's got a photograph to prove it .
Charles Foley , a Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) researcher , first heard rumors of the white giraffe in 1993 when he was working in Tanzania 's Tarangire National Park doing research on savanna elephants .
Intrigued , Foley set out to find the animal , but by the next year , the sightings had stopped coming in .
" I assumed it had died , either at the hand of man or best , " he said .
" I never stopped looking though . "
Foley 's persistence paid off this summer .
While conducting a routine aerial survey of a group of the park 's elephants , he spotted a white speck in the distance .
" I looked … blinked … looked again … and it was still there , " Foley said .
Foley told his pilot to make another pass over the spot and managed to snap a photograph of the white giraffe just as they flew over the trees .
" The proof is there to see — a mostly white giraffe with small dark blotches on its body , " Foley said .
" Only the bottom half of its legs were the more traditional brown color . "
Foley doubts the giraffe he photographed is the same giraffe sighted in 1993 , and that it is probably not a pure albino animal .
Albino animals lack the pigments that give their skin color .
Rather , Foley thinks the giraffe was probably just lighter than normal .
One of the top scanning systems , Turnitin , is being employed in a study for the Joint Council for Qualifications , the umbrella body for Britain 's examination boards .
From next year , Northumbria Learning will be scanning coursework examined by one of the main boards , Edexcel .
The move to tackle the use of online databanks - providing pre-prepared answers and essays - follows a report yesterday by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority which warned that exam boards are failing to catch cheats .
Most of the websites could not be contacted or declined to respond yesterday .
But Matthew Wilson , managing director of Essaywriter.co.uk , said yesterday : " Copying essays has been going on since time immemorial .
In the middle ages students at Oxford and Cambridge copied from each other . "
He said prices varied from £ 4,674 for an MA dissertation down to , for example , £ 128 for a 2,000 - word history essay .
Much of his business comes from overseas students .
Selling answers has spread rapidly across the internet .
" If you intend to copy the work , " advised one offer on eBay yesterday for material from an Information & Communication Technology AS - level course , " remember to change my names , dates and IDs to yours . "
Scanning technologies have been used for some time in universities .
But they have not been used to check schoolwork until now .
The systems take a computer document and crosscheck it against other files to spot similarities between them .
Most work like souped - up internet search engines , comparing the text of a suspect document against a large database of material to see what matches .
Turnitin already claims more than 7 million subscribers worldwide , and compares submissions with a database of books and journals as well as more than 4.5 bn web pages .
It also checks them against its own library of more than 10 m previously submitted papers .
Courseworkbank , which claims to be the largest UK database of free student written essays , lists A - level and GCSE papers by topic .
" Everything is made available completely free of charge for our users , " it states on its website .
" Please consider contributing your course work and essays in return . "
While universities deal with relatively small numbers of students , examination boards deal with many more pupils each academic year .
Monitoring plagiarism will become more difficult when electronic submissions will be made mandatory for all secondary level coursework by 2009 .

Now that you have a website up and running , how are you going to market it ?
Here we present 10 ways to market your website through optimization .
The 10 Commandments of Website Optimization
Search engine optimization has evolved since the early days of the internet – growing to encompass much more than just optimizing a website ’s code .
For example , Google no longer uses meta description and tags to decide organic search rankings .
Instead , Google ’s algorithm measures severalmarketing elements which determine search rankings .
The first step in every marketing strategy is to create clear goals and determine the best way to meet those goals .
Without a goal for yourmarketing strategy , you will end up wasting time and money .
Selecting a good domain name ( something easy for customers to remember ) is critical to promoting your brand digitally .
Ideally , your domain name should include the name of your company .
However , if you ca n’t use your company ’s name , you need to use something that customers will associate with your brand .
You must have a functional website that is easy for visitors to navigate .
Make sure that you do n’t have any duplicate pages because using the same content in more than one place online will hurt your search engine rankings .
Also , make sure your site does n’t have any broken links .
Mobile searches now make up most online searches .
That means you need a mobile - friendly site .
Unfortunately , many older sites are n’t mobile - friendly – which causes them to miss much of their target audience .
Most of your site ’s visitors will arrive via search engines ( like Google and Bing ) .
That means your site will need to have keywords relevant to what your target audience is looking for online .
Keyword planning and research are essential to attracting your target audience .
Your site must have quality , original content because search engine algorithms place a high importance on it .
Your content must also stay fresh , regularly updated to get the uppermost possible organic search rankings .
A blog can help you maintain new content .
Optimizing your site for local SEO can attract customers near you by promoting your business in Google Maps .
Many mobile users search for local businesses in Google Maps .
Social media does n’t directly impact your site ’s rankings .
However , much of your digital audience wo n’t engage your brand through your website .
Instead , a lot of your audience will connect with your brand on social media .
Therefore , if you end up getting a lot of traffic from social media profiles , it will indirectly boost your search engine rankings .
Off - page marketing elements are essential too .
Even though you might not see something wrong on your site , a search engine might discover an error which will hurt your rankings .
In fact , off - page mistakes can get your site penalized by Google .
Therefore , hiring a professional to look over the technical and off - site SEO features on your site might be a good investment .
Lastly , Google publishes guidelines which cover marketing best practices .
You need to make sure that your site follows the Google guidelines to avoid any penalties .
Severe violations can even get your site banned from search engine results ,
Therefore , hiring an SEO professional can help keep your site stay compliant with Google policies .
In short , yourmarketing strategy should fit into your overall digital marketing strategy .
It needs to increase the value of your brand to your digital audience , which is critical if you expect to stand out from your competition .
Therefore , your strategy must include clear goals and a plan of action on how to meet those goals .
Furthermore , your site must have engaging content , be functional and mobile - friendly , optimized so search engines and visitors will find you .
Finally , your website must meet Google ’s SEO guidelines .
Hiring a professional to improve your site ’s marketing elements can increase your organic search rankings .
Also , a professional will help you avoid potential Google penalties .
Theologians and scientists welcome Intelligent Design ban
-22/12/05
Senior scientists and theologians are among those who have welcomed Tuesdayís landmark decision by a Pennsylvania federal judge that so - called Intelligent Design ( ID ) has no legitimate place in the science classroom .
In one of the biggest courtroom clashes between evolutionary biology and ëcreationismí since the famous1925 Scopes trial , US District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that Dover Area School Board members violated the American Constitution when they ordered that its biology curriculum must include the notion that life on earth may have been produced by an unidentifiable intelligent cause .
The ruling is a major setback for the Christian right , who have been trying to use ID to promote creationism as a legitimate educational alternative to rigorous scientific theory .
Although Intelligent Design proponents last night rushed to condemn the Kitzmiller -v- Dover decision as ëa political rulingí , their cause was immediately undermined by the fact that the presiding judge is a Bush appointee , and by the thoroughness of the 139 - page ruling .
Not only does it say that Intelligent Design has no scientific basis ( a part of the judgement which will be a benchmark in other cases related to ID ) , it also accuses its advocates of falsification and dishonesty in presenting themselves and their views .
Indeed several ID supporters repeatedly lied to cover their motives even while professing religious beliefs , said the judge .
The Dover verdict was especially damaging for leading Intelligent Design advocate Michael Behe of Lehigh University .
The ruling observed : ì [ O ] n cross-examination , Professor Behe was questioned concerning his 1996 claim that science would never find an evolutionary explanation for the immune system .
He was presented with fifty - eight peer - reviewed publications , nine books , and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system ; however , he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution , and that it was not ëgood enough .íî
Among those who testified against ID in Dover was the noted Catholic scholar John F. Haught , Professor of Theology at Georgetown University , and author of ë God After Darwin ?
A Theology of Evolutioní .
Substantive evidence was given by leading science commentators such as Robert Pennock ( Michigan State University ) and Wesley Elsberry ( information project director for the US National Centre for Science Education ) who are - in private life ñ both theists .
Also instrumental to the case was noted biologist Kenneth Miller ( Brown University ) , who has written ë Finding Darwinís Godí .
He demonstrated that Intelligent Design is not a testable theory in scientific terms .
Respected theologians in the science - religion debate have frequently denounced ID as a pseudo - scientific camouflage for long - discredited forms of ë God of the gapsí thought going back to John Ray ( 1628 - 1705 ) and William Paley ( 1743-1805 ) , who argued for a designer deity .
But they say that public understanding of the issues is hampered by widespread ignorance of both religion and science .
ID proponent Michael Behe , whose Dover testimony was criticised by Judge Jones , argues that ìstructures with many complicated , interacting partsî cannot have arisen through evolution because all of the parts of a complex structure ( for example the bacterial flagella ) had to arise all at once .
However his ìirreducible complexityî contention has failed to convince scientists and mathematicians on their own ground , and also finds no favour with established theological specialists like Ian Barbour ( Professor Emeritus of Science , Technology and Society at Carleton College in Northfield , Minnesota ) , because it presupposes a false dichotomy between natural causation and divine presence .
Instead Barbour offers ìa theology of nature in which one asks how nature as understood by science is related to the divine as understood from the religious experience of a historical community . î
What one must not do , he says , is to ignore or twist scientific evidence to fit an existing philosophical prejudice about the nature of God ñ or argue for a ëgodí to fill holes in present knowledge .
Similar approaches are taken by Arthur Peacocke ( winner of Le Conte Du Nouy Prize ) and John Polkinghorne ( former Professor of Mathematical Physics at Cambridge University , and a Fellow of The Royal Society ) , who are respectively seen as liberal and conservative theological thinkers with established scientific pedigrees .
They talk of God not as a deus ex machina who assembled the parts of the universe supernaturally according to a preconceived design , but as transcendent love generating the world in such a way that it generates itself .
To this Anglican view , and in a more guarded way to the position adopted some years ago by the Roman Catholic Church , the accepted theory of evolution is not a threat to theological understanding but a way of enriching it .
A positive evolutionary view is also taken by Anabaptist scholars like Nancey Murphy ( ëReconciling Theology and Science : A Radical Reformation Perspectiveí ) , and Calvinists such as Howard van Till .
Indeed , while the religious right has embraced ID as the last bastion of creationism , a number of mainstream US evangelicals , who were initially excited about it , now say they find its arguments unconvincing , having been persuaded by scientists at their own institutions and elsewhere .
Adds Jonathan Neal of Purdue University , Indiana , in a recent article : ì The ID movement has tried to frame this debate as Religion versus Science .
It is not .
The ID debate is between an ID theology that is anti-science and competing theologies that are capable of incorporating scientific knowledge into their theological framework . î
Asks Dr Neal : ì Do we really want to introduce a controversial , anti-science religious [ ideology ] into our public schools disguised as ëscience ?íî
The ruling from Pennsylvania , which seeks to maintain the required separation of church and state , gives a resounding ënoí to that question .
But the argument will not go away .
In Kansas last month , the board of education voted that students should be taught about alternatives to evolution .
While a Dover appeal was deemed ëunlikely í yesterday , other challenges are probable from the ënew creationistsí , who have much economic and political muscle .
However anti-IDers are cheered that the substantial attention to scientific issues in the Dover case makes it very difficult for them to claim intellectual credibility .
Simon Barrow , co-director of the UK religious think - tank Ekklesia , says he is also pleased by the verdict .
ì Intelligent Design is basically a variant of creationism in pseudo - scientific clothing , î he comments .
ì As such it is an embarrassment to thoughtful Christianity and a threat to good theology as well as scientific integrity . î
Barrow says that the creationist and ID movements have grown in strength in the UK in recent years , and may seek to use the governmentís new education bill ñ which encourages private bodies to run state schools ñ as a way of gaining a further educational foothold .
Back in 2002 Anglican bishops and major scientists wrote to PM Tony Blair to raise concerns about science teaching at Emmanuel City Technology College in Gateshead , run by a conservative Christian group .
Similarly , the Grace Academy , due to open in Solihull this year , with another to come in Coventry , says it will teach creationism , according to press reports .
ì It is extremely important , in the interests of truth , to ensure that we do not go down this route in Britainî , says Barrow .
ì Creationism and ID should no more be taught in science classrooms than astrology and numerology .î

In yesterday ’s New York Times , Tom Zeller writes about Internet access in North Korea , touching on their almost non-existent web presence .
Among the tiny handful of official sites mentioned is the Korea Computer Centre ’s Naenara ( or “ My Country ” ) — the nation ’s official portal .
Hosted in Germany and translated into a number of languages , it ’s a very entertaining glimpse into the public exterior of the DPRK .
In addition to being a mouthpiece for national propaganda and a free e-mail provider , they also have an unusual and quirky web - based store .
Aside from the usual books , CDs , and software ( ? ) , they offer an entire section of both cell phone ringtones ( “ handphone melodies ” ) and wallpaper ( “ characters ” ) .
( Cell phones are banned in North Korea , so these must be designed for sympathizers outside of the country . )
The wallpapers section is particularly good .
For only US$ 0.50 , you could have an animated caricature of George W. Bush as a panting dog with American flag necktie .
Or head to page two for delightful animations of burning American flags , giant fists crushing the White House , or what appears to be an American soldier with a missile embedded in his chest , sulking dejectedly to a graveyard .
They take Mastercard and Visa , so buy now !
I could n’t read the ringtone pages , but let me know if one of them has the melodious voice of Kim Jong Il .
( I ’d take that over Fergie any day . )
Powell Again Blames CIA For Fabrications And Lies - By - Omission
In U.N. Speech
As much criticism as Colin Powell has received for his Iraq presentation at the UN , it has n't been anywhere near what he deserves .
While they 've been little noticed , declassified memos from Powell 's own intelligence staff at the State Department conclusively prove Powell was aware much of what he said was false or shaky .
( I 've previously gone through this in detail here . )
So far Powell has blamed everything on the CIA .
He did it again yesterday when questioned outside Face the Nation by Sam Husseini of the Institute for Public Accuracy .
Here are the details , along with background and the actual video .
#1 : Fabricated electronic intercept
According to some , the most impressive elements of Powell 's speech came when he played intercepted radio conversations between Iraqi soldiers .
According to Powell , this is how one of them went :
" They 're inspecting the ammunition you have , yes . ''
" Yes . "
" For the possibility there are forbidden ammo . "
" For the possibility there is by chance forbidden ammo ? ' '
" Yes . "
" And we sent you a message yesterday to clean out all of the areas , the scrap areas , the abandoned areas .
Make sure there is nothing there . ''
Powell then explained :
This is all part of a system of hiding things and moving things out of the way and making sure they have left nothing behind .
In fact , Powell had simply made up the parts in bold .
According to the official State Department translation , the Iraqi soldier merely said :
" And we sent you a message to inspect the scrap areas and the abandoned areas . "
In other words , Powell took evidence of the Iraqis doing what they were supposed to do — i.e. , searching their ammunition dumps to make sure they were n't accidentally holding onto banned chemical weapons — and doctored it to make it look as if Iraq were hiding banned weapons .
And this is n't just my interpretation ; it was first reported in Bob Woodward 's Plan of Attack .
As Woodward writes :
[ Powell ] had decided to add his personal interpretation of the intercepts to the rehearsed script , taking them substantially further and casting them in the most negative light ... Concerning the intercept about inspecting for the possibility of " forbidden ammo , " Powell took the interpretation further : " Clean out all of the areas ...
Make sure there is nothing there . "
None of this was in the intercept .
When Sam Husseini asked Powell about this yesterday , this was Powell 's barely responsive response :
POWELL : Everything that was in that presentation that I gave —
HUSSEINI : Do you acknowledge that you did that [ i.e. , add words the Iraqi soldier did not say ] ?
POWELL : You 've asked a question .
I 'm about to answer it .
Everything that was in that presentation that I gave was approved and edited by the intelligence community .
The Director of Central Intelligence and the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and all of their principal assistants .
And if there were anything in that the script that they did n't think was appropriate or was not accurate , it was removed .
Thank you .
The video is below .
And here are some obvious follow up questions , if there are any journalists in the D.C. area who feel like practicing journalism :
1 . Do you acknowledge that what you said was inaccurate ?
2 . If you do acknowledge this , you must be furiously angry at George Tenet and the CIA .
What actions have you taken to make sure the people responsible for this fabrication have been held accountable ?
# 2 : Lie-by - omission
This appears in another section of Powell 's presentation :
Iraq 's record on chemical weapons is replete with lies .
It took years for Iraq to finally admit that it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent , VX .
A single drop of VX on the skin will kill in minutes .
Four tons .
The admission only came out after inspectors collected documentation as a result of the defection of Hussein Kamal , Saddam Hussein 's late son - in - law .
This was accurate .
However , Powell left out some extremely important details .
Kamel defected in 1995 .
Iraq had produced this VX before the Gulf War , in 1991 — and according to Kamel , Iraq had secretly destroyed it soon after the war .
Then they lied about ever producing it .
But according to Kamel , they were n't lying when they said they no longer had it .
Indeed , in the U.N. 's notes from Kamel 's debriefing , he says Iraq had no remaining WMD of any kind :
All chemical weapons were destroyed .
I ordered destruction of all chemical weapons .
All weapons -- biological , chemical , missiles , nuclear were destroyed .
And if that were n't enough , Kamel also said this in an interview on CNN :
SADLER : Can you state here and now -- does Iraq still to this day hold weapons of mass destruction ?
KAMEL : No .
Iraq does not possess any weapons of mass destruction .
I am being completely honest about this .
But in 1996 Kamel returned to Iraq , where he was killed by Saddam 's regime .
Thus the U.S. could safely take a witness who truthfully had said Iraq had no remaining banned weapons , and pretend his testimony indicated the exact opposite .
Here 's what Powell said on Sunday .
HUSSEINI : You cited Hussein Kamel in your U.N. testimony .
Did you know he said there were no WMDs ?
POWELL : I only knew what the intelligence community told me .
HUSSEINI : But did you know that fact ?
POWELL : Of course not !
HUSSEINI : You did n't know that , even though it was reported ?
POWELL : I 've answered your question !
The video is below .
And here are some more obvious follow up questions :
1 . When and how did you learn that Hussein Kamel said Iraq had no WMD ?
2 . Have you ever discussed this publicly before ?
3 . Again , you must be furiously angry about this .
What actions have you taken to make sure the people responsible for this have been held accountable ?
And that 's it .
I hope anyone reading this can see the possibilities for better journalism that exist with blogs , YouTube , etc .
All that 's required is effort and organization on our part .
Finally — do n't miss other Washington figures being questioned by Sam Husseini at Washington Stakeout .
Mono Directions Miguel de Icaza
[ email protected ]
We just released Mono 1.1.10 , our best release so far .
The major feature missing from this release to call it Mono 1.2 is the completion of our Windows .
Forms implementation .
In this document I only present the direction of development of the Mono team at Novell ; A more comprehensive view of other Mono developments by the Mono community is something that am working on and will post at a later date .
I also present how our team 's priorities are shifting in response to Novell 's own internal use of Mono and external factors like the final release of .
NET 2.0 .
Index
Code Development Process
Since the Mono 1.1.xx series has got a significant amount of fixes over 1.0.xx we have encouraged users and developers to move to the Mono 1.1.xx series .
To avoid regressions we have done a number of things :
We incorporated all of our tests into our pre-release process `make distcheck ' to ensure that we do not release something with known bugs .
We fixed the bugs that were preventing the NUnit tests to complete or disabled the tests that were specific to an environment ( tests that require Internet access or to contact a specific host ) from the standard test process .
We started development of new features in branches and only when the feature is complete we have " landed " the feature into the main repository .
We have used this separate branch development for the new string collation framework , the ASP.
NET implementation , the new cross platform register allocator and the Cairo 1.0 migration .
And we currently do the same for our VM optimizations , the precise garbage collector work and the C# 2.0 compiler .
The basic idea is that we turned the 1.1.xx series into a release that can be deployed on production as opposed to merely a development release .
This is similar in spirit to the kernel 2.6.xx releases .
As a general rule we try to fix bugs before we write new features .
For details on what has been done in the 1.1.xx development cycle , please see the release notes for each of the releases : 1.1.1 , 1.1.2 , 1.1.3 , 1.1.4 , 1.1.5 , 1.1.6 , 1.1.7 , 1.1.8 , 1.1.9 and 1.1.10 .
Windows .
Forms
Windows .
Forms is the only piece that is holding us from officially renaming Mono to Mono 1.2 , it is still missing a few features .
Our plan is to complete the missing features by the end of this month and then move to bug fixing and testing open source our publicly accessible Windows .
Forms applications .
We are planning on spending three months on bug fixing at this point .
Our aim with Mono 1.2 is to release a Windows .
Forms implementation that implements the .NET 1.1 API , not the 2.0 API .
These are the most visible missing bits from feature completion :
Multiple Document Interface ( MDI ) .
Menu merging in the presence of MDI .
Our RichTextBox is lacking a few features : selection margin , bullets , indentations as well as a few public methods and properties .
Our Windows .
Forms implementation is implemented on top of the GDI +
API for rendering and a relatively small driver to interact with the host windowing system .
Our GDI + implementation on Unix ( Linux and OSX ) uses Cairo as the rendering engine .
As for the windowing system drivers , today we have two complete drivers ( Unix / X11 and Win32 ) and one driver under development ( OSX ) .
Some minor features missing are :
Integrate the artwork from the Tango Project as the default for the Windows .
Forms toolkit .
Complete the MacOS X driver for Windows .
Forms .
Add support for translucency to controls .
Double buffering : although we support double buffering we have it disabled for many controls just to keep compatibility with the settings on the same controls on Microsoft 's implementation .
We will likely change this setting to improve the user experience .
There are a number of features that we have explicitly postponed from this release and will only make it into 1.2 if they are contributed by external contributors , otherwise they will have to wait for Mono 2.0 :
Pango .
Currently Windows .
Forms is limited to render text with the GDI +
API so it lacks all the text rendering capabilities of Pango for international text and complex scripts .
Completing the Gtk+ theme module to have controls match the Gnome look and feel .
Our GDI + implementation lacks support for bezier - based regions ( we only support rectangles ) .
Input methods .
Printing .
Our WinForms page tracks the progress .
2.0 Support
We started work on the foundation for 2.0 in mid-2003 as soon as the early drafts of the new changes were submitted to ECMA .
This gave us plenty of time to work on our C# 2.0 compiler and the changes to our VM to support generics .
Today they are both considered feature complete .
Our IL assembler and IL disassembler are almost complete and should be able to roundtrip our generics - based libraries soon .
The core is complete enough that the latest versions of IronPython and Nermerle work with it .
Developers are starting to use the new features available in 2.0 and they have started to file bugs against our runtime and compiler .
So far our policy was that we supported the 1.1 profile for the libraries .
The 2.0 profile is being developed but is only supported in the " if it breaks , you get to keep both pieces " modality .
Bugs on the 2.0 support in the compiler and runtime were routinely fixed .
With the release of .
NET 2.0 we are shifting some of our development efforts to work on the most important areas of the 2.0 profile .
We are hoping to include the most important bits of the profile in the upcoming release of Mono 1.2 , but we are not making any promises about the completeness of the 2.0 APIs .
Mono 1.2 will release when Windows .
Forms is complete .
The System . Xml 2 is pretty complete , mscorlib and System assemblies still require significant amounts of work .
See also the ASP.
NET section for details on the progress in that area .
Mono Debugger
Martin has been working on our debugger .
Today it is capable of debugging 1.x applications ( 2.0 should be supported as soon as Cecil support for generics is completed ) .
To test the debugger today you must use SVN versions of Mono as well as the debugger as it is still rapidly changing .
We are now accepting feedback on the debugger : limitations and interface .
Since it currently only works as a command line debugger you might want to read the debugger guide in our web site .
If you find problems with the debugger , please file a file a bug report .
MonoDevelop IDE
Lluis has moved from working on ASP .
NET 2.0 to work on the MonoDevelop IDE .
Our most important goal with MonoDevelop is to make it rock solid and eliminate every crashing bug that has been reported .
As for the features , MonoDevelop now sports a plugin architecture similar to Eclipse : components can be downloaded and installed without having to recompile the application ( see here ) .
Integration of a GUI designer is progressing ( currently Glade3 , but we hope to replace it with Stetic when it becomes available ) .
Finally as the debugger interface stabilizes we plan on enabling the debugger interface in MonoDevelop again .
Mono's Virtual Machine : Ports
During the last year the Mono JIT has been ported to three new architectures ( x86-64 , Itanium and Arm processors ) in addition to the platforms it supported before ( x86 , PowerPC , SPARC , SPARC 64 bits and S390 ) .
At this point the Novell team does not have any plans to work on new ports .
Although some members of the community have expressed their interest in adding S390x and MIPS support to Mono .
Precise Garbage Collector
Paolo has been working on a new garbage collector ( GC ) engine .
Currently Mono GC interface is almost pluggable ( the work to plug different GCs was done a few months ago ) .
The new GC engine is a precise , generational , compacting collector .
This means that the Mono GC will be able to return memory to the operating system when it no longer needs it .
We are making a few tradeoffs to ship this version of the collector quickly .
For instance this new GC will treat the stack conservatively has two effects : it makes it easy for embedders of Mono to use the new GC but it also might flag a lot of pinned objects .
We hope that the new GC can be tested in February or March , the code will start landing in December .
Code Generation and Optimization
We have been working for quite some time on various new code optimizations .
The code is getting ready to be submitted to the main Mono repository .
Over the next few weeks expect various patches to be posted .
Currently we are working on the following areas to improve the performance of the generated code
Enabling some stronger optimizations by default ( inlining and fastdce ) .
These require us to avoid any significant regressions ( both in the generated code quality as well as the JIT time ) .
New optimization framework ( HSSA - based platform ) and optimizations built on top of it ( PRE and GVNPRE ) .
Eliminating the tree - based intermediate representation ( IR ) and go directly from the CIL code to the list - of - instructions IR .
Massi has recently posted his Fast Dead Code Elimination and he described it on this blog post .
Massi has also been working on our HSSA - based framework and dead code elimination based on it .
This optimization should be posted for review to the mailing list this week .
Once those two are done , Massi is going to work towards making FastDCE + CopyProp +
Inlining be part of the default optimizations for Mono which will bring some immediate visible results .
After this our plans for HSSA are :
Implement copy propagation .
Full redundancy elimination ( easier to spot than partial ) .
Partial redundancy elimination PRE ( harder to spot and handle ) .
The quality of the code might suffer because removing redundant code introduces new temporary variables .
To fix this we need a feedback mechanism to the register allocator that does not exist today .
To address the previous ( and other problems ) Zoltan is starting work to eliminate the tree - based IR from Mono .
C# Compiler
The C# compiler comes in two editions :
gmcs : supports completely the latest ECMA specification ( 3rd edition ) , produces binaries that reference the 2.0 libraries .
mcs : supports the latest ECMA specification minus the generic extensions ( 3rd edition ) .
This produces binaries that reference the 1.0 libraries .
Our gmcs compiler support as of November 2005 is known to lack one feature : the late changes to nullable types in the specification .
Other than that the compiler is considered feature complete .
As the C# compiler is at the core of much of our work we will continue to focus on bug fixes .
The recent C# 3.0 features although easy to implement will have to wait .
Visual Basic
We had plans last year to complete a free Visual Basic compiler .
Today the compiler exists in beta form and Novell will no longer fund the development of this compiler .
The folks at Mono Brazil have taken over the development and maintenance of the compiler .
The VB compiler is based on an old mcs fork that was originally created by Rafael Texeira .
To upgrade the compiler from its current form to support generics in 2.0 we believe that it might be necessary to start from a fresh copy of `gmcs ' and merge the various changes that make up the VB compiler .
Code Access Security
Code Access Security ( CAS ) has been available in Mono since version 1.1.4 , it is enabled by running `mono ' with the -- security command line option .
Although CAS is in a very advanced stage and it will be available on Mono 1.2 we will not guarantee that CAS is complete until the next major release of Mono .
We are still missing the code verifier and in 2.0 there are new CAS features that we do not implement yet .
Sebastien who maintains the code has been busy adding CAS attributes to our class libraries and creating the associated tests , he discussed the state of CAS here .
As for how the CAS permissions are being set , he discusses that here .
Sebastien has written a general bug finding tool , similar in spirit to FxCop , which we are using to set the proper CAS rules on our libraries .
You can learn more on the Gendarme page .
ASP.NET
We released a fairly updated version of ASP.
NET with Mono 1.1.9 which is much faster and consumes less memory .
Our new implementation uses several tricks to improve the performance which we will blog about later .
In Mono 1.1.10 Gonzalo introduced a new automatic configuration option to the Apache module .
Setting up mod_mono now behaves like other modules for other languages , for instance users and administrators can drop .asmx , .ashx or .aspx files anywhere on their exposed directories and they will automatically be handled by Mono 's ASP.
NET implementation without having to make any changes to the ASP.
NET configuration .
As for the 2.0 support in ASP.
NET we have implemented various controls that do not depend on the new Configuration API ( menus , trees , masterpages , gridviews and anything they require ) .
Chris Toshok has taken over from Lluis on developing ASP .
NET 2.0 and is almost done with the new System .
Configuration namespace which is the foundation for the next batch of features in ASP .
NET ( profiles , portal parts and many others required it ) .
Chris has also done some work on an open source implementation of Atlas .
API stability
As for the stability of the APIs : the System .* ones are set in stone and we verify the compatibility using our " corcompare " tools .
The .NET 1.1.x API has been implemented ( as described in Mono 1.0 Features ) .
The Mono .* namespace on the other hand is still a moving target .
the Mono . Cairo assembly has had to adapt to the changes in the underlying Cairo 1.0 library and we also had to do various changes to cope with early bugs and limitations in our API design .
The Mono . Posix assembly has incorporated a new namespace : Mono .
Unix which offers a more comprehensive binding and also provides a high - level .
NET - ish API for accessing Unix as opposed to Mono .
Posix which only contained raw access to Unix .
Gtk #
Version 2.4 of Gtk# has been released .
The new features on this release are documented here , it binds Gtk 2.4 which is the most commonly available version of Gtk+ at this point .
We have created an upgrade guide for developers moving their code from Gtk# 1 to Gtk# 2 .
On the development side of Gtk# , a new version is available for testing that binds the Gtk+ 2.8 API and exposes a handful of new methods as well as the Cairo properties that are part of Gtk+ 2.8 .
The work to add databinding support to Gtk# is currently on hold until Windows .
Forms is completed .
We expect to work again on a databound - aware Gtk# after Mono 1.2 has shipped .
Integration of Google Summer of Code Projects
We have integrated a few of the projects that were developed thanks to the Google Summer of Code program :
Monodoc improvements ( collaboration , Mozilla integration , CSS ification ) from Mario Sopena .
xbuild : an implementation of msbuild is on our tree , but not compiled by default yet .
By Marek Sieradzki .
DataGridView , by Pedro Martínez .
xaml compiler and helper classes from Iain McCoy .
The Javascript runtime improvements from Florian Gross .
Cecil from JB Evain is being used for Gendarme and Bugfind and we hope to start our linker soon .
We are planning on integrating the ASP.
NET editor work from Michael Hutchinson and Blagovest Dachev as well as the bugfinder engine from Aaron Tomb into Gendarme .
ADO.NET 2
T Senganal will take over the maintenance of ADO.NET and will start working with the developers that are using the new features in ADO.
NET 2 to get their providers working on Mono .
JScript
Cesar is very close to pass all the Mozilla JavaScript tests with our implementation of JScript .
If you want to track the state of the JScript compiler and runtime see the JScript page on the Mono web site .
End
You have reached the end .
Congratulations !
Lo Stato ci ha messo parecchio , ma quando si parla del mondo del gioco d’azzardo e dei casino online legali con bonus gratis senza deposito non è mai abbastanza , per delineare la messa a disposizione del fondo nazionale di 50 milioni di euro per la cura del gioco problematico .
Ci sono voluti “ tempi considerevoli ” affinché qualcuno si rendesse conto che le Regioni avevano necessità di avere fondi per il contrasto di un fenomeno che stava prendendo piede con una escalation che nessuno si attendeva : il gioco d’azzardo patologico , conseguenza dell ’ abuso del gioco , stava toccando parecchi individui e bisognava fare qualcosa per mettere le varie Amministrazioni in condizione di organizzarsi per fronteggiare questa problematica e lo Stato avrebbe dovuto intervenire già da tempo .
Ma a parte questo , si arriva alla decisione del Governo di destinare questi 50 milioni di euro per le Regioni e di ripartirle per ogni Regione , cosi riporta anche twitter che si occupa di casino online e gioco su internet … ma questo non è avvenuto e come sempre si assiste a vari “ proclami ” dell ’Esecutivo che non sono seguiti in pratica da ciò che serve per arrivare ad obbiettivi utili a livello sociale .
Chi lancia strali in questo senso è l ’Assessore al Sociale della Regione Veneto che si lamenta , forte e chiaro , dei ritardi nel riparto del fondo nazionale per la cura del gioco patologico .
Le Regioni , in generale , hanno quasi tutte il dente avvelenato su qualsiasi iniziativa del governo ed il loro atteggiamento nella Conferenza Unificata “ famigerata ” ne è un esempio .
Non vogliono fare alcun passo indietro e vogliono , come si suol dire , “ rendere cara la pelle ” prima di cedere al Governo anche una minima cosa raggiunta negli anni , mentre il Governo , dalla sua parte , si sta rendendo disponibile ad una trattativa “ più morbida ” .
Ma questo poco centra su ciò che si stava “ raccontando ” relativamente al riparto del fondo nazionale di 50 milioni per la cura del gioco problematico .
L’Assessore del Veneto ribadisce l’ulteriore rinvio della Conferenza sui casino online italiani e così pure del riparto del fondo e ne richiama l’urgenza , urgenza di prendersi cura dei giocatori patologici e delle loro famiglie : in Veneto , in realtà , si segnalano in aumento i casi di giocatori problematici , ed il trend di crescita è ormai superiore a quello di eroina e droghe tradizionali .
Un piccolo passo avanti è stato fatto in quanto il gioco d’azzardo ora è inserito nei Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza riconoscendolo come una malattia e di conseguenza istituendo un fondo nazionale da ripartirsi tra le regioni .
Ma questo riparto tarda ad arrivare così come tarda ad arrivare “ su come intervenire e su come normare l’industria del gioco ” .
Veneto , Lombardia , Liguria e Basilicata hanno sottoscritto a marzo il “ Manifesto contro il gioco d’azzardo ” e queste Regioni hanno dichiarato che il Governo si sta dimostrando troppo “ morbido ” nei confronti dell ’ industria del gioco perché non può e non vuole rinunciare agli introiti del Monopolio di Stato e tarda nel regolarizzare l’offerta del gioco in tutto in Paese .
Si sa , aggiunge l’assessore del Veneto , che il fatturato dei giochi supera gli 88 miliardi di euro e questo per uno Stato “ giusto ” dovrebbe rilevare la vera emergenza che questo fenomeno comprende .
Non si può più ritardare ad intervenire in questo settore , per le famiglie , per l’assistenza , per il territorio .
Press Release
19 April 2005
The Maldives | 15 April marks the day that the first ever all - glass undersea restaurant in the world opens its doors for business at the Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa .
Ithaa * will sit five meters below the waves of the Indian Ocean , surrounded by a vibrant coral reef and encased in clear acrylic offering diners 270 - degrees of panoramic underwater views .

“ We have used aquarium technology to put diners face - to - face with the stunning underwater environment of the Maldives ” , says Carsten Schieck , General Manager of Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa .
“ Our guests always comment on being blown away by the colour , clarity , and beauty of the underwater world in the Maldives , so it seemed the perfect idea to build a restaurant where diners can experience fine cuisine and take time to enjoy the views – without ever getting their feet wet . ”
Ithaa * will sit five meters below the waves of the Indian Ocean , surrounded by a vibrant coral reef and encased in clear acrylic offering diners 270 - degrees of panoramic underwater views
Created by MJ Murphy Ltd , a design consultancy based in New Zealand , Ithaa ’s distinctive feature is the use of curved transparent acrylic walls and roof , similar to those used in aquarium attractions .
“ The fact that the entire restaurant except for the floor is made of clear acrylic makes this unique in the world , ” continues Schieck , “ We are currently planting a coral garden on the reef to add to the spectacular views of the rays , sharks and many colourful fish that live around the reef near the restaurant . ”
The five - metre by nine - metre transparent arch , which spans the entire room , seats 14 people and provides a feeling of being completely at one with the underwater world while submerged beneath the surface of the ocean .
Set with the resort ’s renowned house reef one side , and a clear lagoon on the other , diners enjoy their meal within Ithaa ’s translucent shell as the underwater drama unfolds on all sides .
Naturally the food will be as spectacular as the underwater setting , explains Schieck , “ In such a unique restaurant we wanted to create a distinctive cuisine , which is why we ’ve decided to offer ‘ contemporary Maldivian cuisine ’ as a theme .
We take local spices and traditional flavours and give them a western twist to create a fusion cuisine that you could find in the best restaurants in London or New York .
Nobody else has done this before and we ’re very excited about it . ”

While the cuisine is dedicated to the fine balance of western food items with a Maldivian flavour , the wine concept is equally exciting ; offering diners the perfect opportunity to discover the wines of the prestigious Champagne house Louis Roederer .
Ithaa is reached by a wooden walkway from the nearby over - water Sunset Grill Restaurant .
Diners begin their meal with drinks on a specially constructed deck over the ocean and then descend to the restaurant via a spiral staircase where the à la carte menu is served .
Seating only 14 people , Ithaa offers one of the most intimate and exclusive dining experiences in the world .
This innovative restaurant is the first of its kind in the world , and is part of a US $ 25 million re-build of Rangalifinolhu Island , one of the twin islands that make up Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa .
This re-build includes the construction of 79 of the most luxurious Beach Villas in the country as well as the Spa Village , a self - contained , over - water ‘ resort - within - a - resort ’ consisting of a spa , restaurant and 21 villas .
* Ithaa ( pronounced eet - ha ) means ‘ pearl ’ in the language of the Maldives , Dhivehi .
Hilton Worldwide Resorts is an upscale , global resort network with a collection of 47 resorts , located in exotic places , making up the world ’s largest global choice .
Currently , 34 resorts are operated by Hilton International , 11 by Hilton Hotels Corporation and two by Conrad .
The network spans 21 countries and seven regions including the Americas , Arabian Gulf , Asia - Pacific , the Caribbean , Egypt , Europe and the Indian Ocean .
New resort openings are planned in Thailand , Croatia , the Philippines , the Caribbean , Seychelles , Fiji , France , America , Italy , Brazil and Australia .
Antonio Barragan and his colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm were puzzled at first about how Toxoplasma managed this swift journey .
" When we looked for parasites in the blood , we found very few that were just swimming around , " said Dr. Barragan , an associate professor .
But the scientists observed many of the parasites inside immune cells known as dendritic cells .
Dr. Barragan was intrigued .
Dendritic cells , common in the gut , often come into contact with pathogens .
They respond by crawling to the lymph nodes or the spleen , where they communicate with other immune cells .
" That led us to think , what if this parasite is directing these cells to move and to disseminate through the body ? "
Dr. Barragan said .
He and his colleagues put dendritic cells in a dish and injected them with Toxoplasma .
They noticed that the parasites triggered a peculiar change : the dendritic cells became hyperactive , crawling for an entire day .
Next , the scientists observed how Toxoplasma spread through a living animal .
They added a firefly gene to the parasites so that they produced a glow .
When they injected the parasites into mice , a little of the light escaped from the animals .
By putting the mice in a darkened box , Dr. Barragan and his colleagues could track the parasites as they spread .
Injecting dendritic cells carrying Toxoplasma spread the parasites to the brain and other organs far faster than injecting Toxoplasma alone .
The researchers concluded that Toxoplasma was taking charge of the dendritic cells and riding along with them .
Their results are published online in the journal Cellular Microbiology .
As Toxoplasma spreads through the body , it invades cells .
Unlike other pathogens , Toxoplasma can enter almost every type of cell in the bodies of thousands of host species .
The parasite slips into a cell by latching onto its surface and pulling the membrane over itself .
" You can think of it like sticking your finger into a balloon , " said Vernon B. Carruthers of the University of Michigan .
David Sibley , an associate professor of molecular microbiology at Washington University in St. Louis , said , " It just sits there , and the host does n't recognize it as a foreign body it should destroy . "
The best time to buy everything
From televisions and toys to cars and computers , how you can save big by knowing when to spend .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) - Attention tightwads .
Do you spend two hours to save five bucks on airline tickets ?
Still devote half the living room to a rack component stereo system , waiting for just the right time to buy that smaller , better sounding set - up ?
5 Tips Archive : Shopping tips    
Wait no more .
From TV's to travel to a new Toyota , we 've found the best time to get the best deal on just about everything .
Air tickets
For all the seeming complexity that goes into the price of airfare , the answer to when some of the cheapest tickets can be found is surprisingly simple : Wednesday .
That 's when airlines release their available seats for the upcoming weekend and the weekend after , says Travelocity 's Dominique Phillip .
Phillip , along with other travel agents , said it 's still best to book a domestic flight at least two weeks in advance , and even further ahead for international travel .
But if the two - week window is n't an option for you , she advised delaying the purchase even more , to a few days before you fly , as fares from 14 to 7 days ahead of departure tend to be the most expensive .
Televisions
While the blowout sales on electronics tend to cluster around the holidays , even cheaper deals on TVs can be found in the spring beginning in April , according to Stephen Baker , who covers electronics for the marketing and research firm NPD .
That 's because for most Japanese companies the fiscal year ends in March .
Baker says they time new - model year releases with the new fiscal year and offer discounts of up to 20 percent to clear out old sets .
Houses
It 's best to bundle up when looking for the best deal on a house , as reduced demand and lackluster appearance can lead to a better deal in winter .
Because no one wants to pull the kids out of school for a week or haul boxes when it 's 40 below , most homes go on the market in the spring , with sales closing in the summer .
The average home price during these months is higher as well , according to Stephanie Singer of the National Association of Realtors .
Although Singer says the homes sold in the spring tend to be larger , that might not make up for the difference in price .
She says homes sold in the winter lose some " curb appeal " because the landscape is dormant .
Cars
It 's still true that good deals can be found in late summer / early fall , when carmakers release new models and dealers want to get rid of last year 's leftovers .
But a good price may also be wrangled at the end of every month .
That 's because dealers are under pressure to book sales .
If they exceed monthly sales targets set by the manufacturer , they are rewarded by getting more of the hotter , better selling vehicles the next month .
" There 's a benefit to [ dealers ] making their quotas , " said Jack Nerad , editorial director at Kelley Blue Book and author of the " Complete Idiots Guide to Buying or Leasing a Car . "
You can fine - tune your timing even more , said Nerad .
He recommends shopping when the dealerships are n't crowded , like early mornings , midweek or the winter , to avoid " getting short shrifted " from the sales staff .
Video Games
For the best selection , the holiday season is the time to buy , if only because that 's when gamemakers release the bulk of their lineup , according to CNNMoney.com 's game guru Chris Morris .
But to save a few bucks , Morris said to wait a month or three , as " The hysteria has typically died down by then . "
Toys
Before and , especially , after the holidays is obviously a good time for toys .
But August is another promising month , according to Sheliah Gilliland , a spokeswoman for eToys.com .
Gilliland says summer toys , like swimming pools and playground equipment , take up a lot of space and retailers are willing to let some things go for up to 65 percent off to make way for the holiday rush .

Experimental Declarative UI Language
Preface
I recently read a bit about a declarative UI language , using Java / Swing .
The language is now named JavaFX Script Language , previouly F3 , see the getting started page .
The original swing support tutorial is available here .
The official page for the JavaFX language is available at openjfx .
See the language description on Wikipedia .
While I was reading the swing tutorial I started thinking of how close the same declarative could be expressed in Ruby running with JRuby ( a Ruby interpreter written in Java , 100 % pure Java ) .
So I started writing a proof of concept ...
I named swiby ( Swing with Ruby )
I wo n't write a full tutorial here , just a short introduction .
The project is only experimental , I reached a point showing my idea was realistic and I do n't plan to go on right now .
Two things interrested me in F3 : the declarative approach for Swing GUIs and the automatic data binding .
As a reflection on defining the declarative Swing was already made by F3 author ( Chris Oliver ) , I relied on it .
But , while working on it , I found we could go some step further .
I did n't really take any decision but , for this project to go on , a reflection on a very clear definition is required .
Comparison Examples
I followed the F3 tutorial , trying to write the same kind of code .
Here I just give two examples of how close the code written in F3 and the version I named swiby are .
The first example is the dynamic version of Hello , world .
The F3 code is as follows :
class HelloWorldModel { attribute saying : String ; } var model = HelloWorldModel { saying : " Hello World " } ; var win = Frame { title : " Hello World F3 " width : 200 content : Label { text : bind model .
saying } visible : true } ;
While the version I wrote looks like :
require ' swiby ' class HelloWorldModel attr_accessor : saying end model = HelloWorldModel .
new model .
saying = " Hello World " Frame { title " Hello World F3 " width 200 content { Label { text bind ( model , : saying ) } } visible true }
The second example is the one showing tabbed pane , here is the F3 version :
var model = Model { tabPlacement : TOP tabLayout : WRAP selectedTab : 3 tabCount : 5 } ; Frame { height : 300 width : 400 content : TabbedPane { tabPlacement : bind model.
tabPlacement tabLayout : bind model.tabLayout tabs : bind foreach ( i in [ 1..model.tabCount ] )
Tab { title : " Tab {i} " toolTipText : " Tooltip {i} " } selected Index : bind model.selectedTab } visible : true }
And the swiby one :
require ' swiby ' class Model attr_accessor : tabPlacement attr_accessor :tabLayout attr_accessor : selectedTab attr_reader : tabCount def tabCount= ( value ) @tabCount = value .
to_i end end model = Model .
new model .
tabPlacement = TOP model .
tabLayout = WRAP model .
tabCount = 5 model .
selectedTab = 3 Frame { height 300 width 400 content { TabbedPane { tabPlacement bind { model .
tabPlacement } tabLayout bind { model .
tabLayout } tabs bind { ( 1 .. model .
tabCount ) . collect do | i | Tab { title " Tab #{i} " tooltip " Tooltop #{i} " } end } selected Index bind { model .
selectedTab } } } visible true }
I also added a second window to test the demo ( see next image ) .
The control window changes the number of tabs and the tab position .
Next image shows the window with the tabs .
Hereafter , the code of the control window .
class DemoModel attr_reader : layoutIndex attr_reader : placementIndex def initialize ( model ) @model = model end def layoutIndex= ( value ) @model .
tabLayout = [ SCROLL , WRAP ] [ value ] @layoutIndex = value end def placement Index= ( value ) @model .
tabPlacement = [ TOP , LEFT , RIGHT , BOTTOM ][ value ] @placementIndex = value end end demo = DemoModel . new ( model ) demo .
layoutIndex = 1 demo .
placementIndex = 0 Frame { title bind { "
Tab count is #{model.tabCount} " } width 200 content { GridPanel { border { Empty { top 5 left 5 bottom 5 right 5 } } rows 3 columns 2 hgap 10 vgap 5 cells { [ SimpleLabel { text " Number of tabs : " } , Text Field { value bind ( model , : tabCount ) } , SimpleLabel { text " Placement : " } , ComboBox { cells { [ " Top " , " Left " , " Right " , " Bottom " ] } selection bind ( demo , :placementIndex ) } , SimpleLabel { text " Layout : " } , ComboBox { cells { [ " Scroll " , " Wrap " ] } selection bind ( demo , : layoutIndex ) } ] } } } visible true }
How to run the examples ?
To run and test the examples follow next steps , but first you need to install JRuby of course .
Download the code here Unzip the file in some directory , say mydir Open a command line window , navigate to the mydir directory Execute next command : jruby - Iswiby samples / tab_demo.rb
Replace tab_demo.rb with the script you want to test .
All the examples are in the samples subdirectory .
Future ...
As I said above , I just wanted to asses the idea , a lot of things are missing , Swing support is poor .
A big refactoring of swiby is necessary and a better definition of the declarative language is necessary .
Errors are very difficult to track .
An effort to produce helpful and precise messages is top priority !
As a remark , jruby seems to point one line after the actual line .

It 's been a jackpot year for catching reruns of old historical riffs .
For instance , I was tickled to see the Papacy get it together one more time and denounce the legitimacy of secular authority .
That does n't mean I expect to see Helmut Schmidt standing barefoot in the snow at Canossa any time soon , you understand , but it was the sort of thing a Pope is supposed to do .
After that , JP II agreed to re-hear Church v. Galileo at the instigation of a member of the Dominicans ( which again is fitting ) , on account of a slight suspicion that the Catholic Church was in the wrong the last time they tried the case .
And Israel , now , has gone over to the shekel standard in a move to combat inflation .
I was even privileged earlier this month to once more sit in front of the television , getting smashed while watching a President I could wholeheartedly hate -- though the last time I did that , the President in question was resigning to avoid impeachment .
So pick your own anachronism .
Myself , I got hauled up in front of an ecclesiastical court this summer and formally excommunicated .
Really .
A genuine heretic , anathematized by the grace of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints , also known as the Mormons .
( By the way , if you are a Mormon and are reading this , I should warn you that I 've touched all the pages in this issue of Telos and the paper is probably crawling with heretic - microbes .
Do n't let me stop you , but if you suddenly go weak in the knees and develop an irresistible craving to vote the straight Socialist Workers '
Party ticket while drinking a cup of coffee and praying to the Blessed Virgin Mary in a swimming pool on Sunday , you 'll know what 's happened to you .
Sorry . )
I could wish , just for the sake of completeness , that they had dashed the candles to the ground and all , gone the whole route , and that if I were to die without a reconciliation they would hunt up an unsanctified crossroads to bury me under ; but what actually happened - - well , what happened comes in the proper course of this story .
So let me maunder on for a while and then I 'll explain how the deed was done , along with other mysteries like the Holy Underwear of God and the Book of Ether .
You can take your pick of where this story ought to start .
I 'm inclined to favor 1964 , when I was eight years old .
That 's the age when Mormon children are baptized and confirmed and thereafter held accountable for their sins .
Even at that age I 'd already had some difficulties in Sunday School , since I 'd fallen in love with archaeology and fossils , and one day , in all innocence , argued Darwin over Genesis to my teacher .
After that episode my mother took me aside and said that by all means I should believe in evolution , but that I was n't to speak of it in church .
I was confused , but I mostly kept my mouth shut .
I did n't give up on the dinosaurs , though .
But my baptism was a rank failure .
I was duly interviewed by my Bishop and recommended for the ritual -- after all , what sins does an eight - year - old have access to , aside from the milder sloths and avarices ?
They have neither the temptation nor the opportunity for really solid wickedness -- and then I went around for weeks sinning incessantly .
I figured that the sins would shortly be all washed away anyway , and then after that I 'd have to be good .
On the appointed day I fasted and was dressed in white cotton coveralls , by way of ceremonial vestments , and then after some prayers was firmly dunked , head under , in a baptismal font .
It should have worked , but it did n't .
I never felt the least bit saved , or cleansed , or intitiated , or much of anything besides wet all over .
Besides , as soon as I got home I snitched and ate a Tootsie Roll intended for one of my brothers , and only afterward remembered that this constituted theft and was now a sin .
I checked by the clock .
My sinlessness had lasted for something under two hours , and it was all downhill from there .
Further breaches with the Church came when I hit puberty and became the target of much intense propaganda concerning proper young Mormon womanhood .
I went through the normal miserable precocious childhood and by that time had become a scruffy - looking adolescent girl with lank hair , crooked teeth , Clark Kent glasses , and a perpetual armload of books .
I was forcibly given lessons in ballroom dancing and deportment ( I can waltz , foxtrot , two - step , polka , manage cake - napkin - punch - and - fork all at once , and go without dishonor through a formal reception line , none of which things have I ever been called upon to do since ) , told that women have A Very Special And Wonderful Role , and warned that nobody would be responsible for the awful consequences if I wore my skirts so short as to expose my knees .
This was in ' 68 - ' 70 , of course .
All of these gobbets of knowledge were jumbled together , but the business about my knees got the most airing .
You would have thought they were radioactive , from the handling instructions I got concerning them : how to sit , how to stand , how to pick something up gracefully from the floor , all without those two knobby and scarred ( in my case ) lust - objects flashing upon the public view .
The confusing part was that I knew damned well that nobody was watching my knees , or indeed any part of me .
I had all the allure of a bell pepper .
Furthermore , all the things that the ravishing and modest young ladies in the visual aids were doing were things I was bad at , and none of them seemed to involve reading science fiction or collecting rocks or blowing things up .
This was upsetting .
It was bad enough to have to act like a girl ( at which I was so untalented that I became convinced that I was something else unspecified , and was the victim of mistaken identity ) , but doubly and triply so to be told that God wanted me to do it .
I became darkly suspicious of a God that had both created me and required such impossible behavior of me .
After that I quietly slid down into perdition for some years .
Surprisingly , no one ever noticed this , I think because I did n't do anything recognizably awful .
There 's no place in the mythology for an unobtrusive defection from the straight and narrow .
One day you decide to skip Fast & Testimony Meeting to watch the Rolling Stones on the Ed Sullivan Show , and BAM !
the next thing you know you 're dancing the dirty bop at an ill - lit , smoky , unsupervised party , and your date is whispering in your ear that out in the garage the kids have some marijuana woofers going , so how about a little real action ?
After that there 's nothing for it ; you wind up hocking your mother 's kitchen appliances to support your habit until the day when , dazed on drugs , you walk in front of an oncoming cement truck .
Except that I did n't do that , so nobody noticed until I wrote the denunciatory letter last spring .
But I 'm getting ahead of myself .
I still worried , every so often , if maybe the Mormons were n't right , if I was n't maybe a sinner or a pervert or something .
It was a kind of gentle , commonplace worry : " I wonder if I 'm blowing my eternal salvation , or have I just not had enough sleep this week ? "
I wondered if , after my apostate youth , I 'd somehow see through the error of my ways and go back to church , family , and Mesa , Arizona , as my mother did .
It did n't seem likely .
Still , I was idly concerned about it , enough to spend a couple of hours in 1977 in a Howard Johnson 's discussing it with Joe Sheffer .
Phoenix fandom was full of theologians in those days the way that the Wallingford Mob is full of Marxists and old high - school debaters .
Joe was easily the best of them , a Thomist who could argue with wit and subtlety on some odd point -- say , the proposition that evil is good pursued badly -- and then turn around and invent half a dozen new non-contingent being jokes .
( Sample : Why is John Wayne a non-contingent being ?
Because he can't act . )
( Sound of Saint Dominick being hit over the head with a rubber chicken . )
At one point , Joe became convinced that he could reduce the unified field theory to four basic equations with the help of healthy infusions of Thomism .
I was skeptical ( so was he , mostly ) , but I did n't put it past him ; we halfway expected to someday hear a loud knocking from the direction of Tempe and find out later that Joe had invented antigravity .
Lovely fellow .
Anyway , Joe gave me the clinching argument that stopped forever my late - night visions of winding up , in the afterlife , in a court of final judgment presided over by Jehovah flanked by the Osmonds .
However , in order to explain it I first have to talk about the Book of Mormon , the basic revealed text of the Mormon church .
Bear with me ; the Book of Ether is coming right up .
Western New York , in the first half of the nineteenth century , was known as the " Burnt - Over District , " the name alluding to the fires of the spirit that swept over the area repeatedly in that time .
Like Southern California in the second half of the twentieth century , it was an incredibly fertile breeding ground for religious enthusiasms , with constant fundamentalist revival movements , proposed reforms of various ills , and a string of preachers , seers , prophets , and small - time theologians to attend to them .
In 1830 , a young man named Joseph Smith , who had grown up in the middle of this ruckus , announced that he had found some golden plates -- that is , thinly - beaten plates of gold , engraved in an unknown language -- which he had translated with the help of God and a sort of pair of magic spectacles , called by him the Urim and Thummim , which he found along with the plates .
The book so translated he called " The Book of Mormon , " and though the gold plates disappeared fairly soon after the translation was done ( an angel came and took them away again ) , the book is ranked right up with the Bible in the religion that bears its name .
The BofM is largely a long chronicle of the doings of various Semitic migratory groups in the New World .
It divides up into various books written by different authors over a long period of time , all of which were eventually delivered into the hands of one Mormon , who gave them a thorough and even redaction ( which is why it 's called the Book of Mormon , to state the obvious ) .
Mormon gives the book to his son Moroni ( when you see the gold angel on top of a Mormon temple , that 's Moroni ) , and he buries it in what will someday become Joseph Smith 's backyard .
Chronologically , the first book in the BofM is the second - to - last chapter , called the Book of Ether .
Significantly , Ether is the liveliest chapter in the whole work .
( There 's also the Book of Omni , but never mind . )
Ether tells the story of the Jaredites , a group of people involved in the Tower of Babel project , who escaped the confusion of languages in the ensuing catastrophe due to the good offices of their leader Jared and his brother the prophet .
This prophet never does get his own name ; he 's referred to throughout as The Brother of Jared , for some obscure reason .
These two prayed mightily to God , who spared them and theirs .
The group then took off for America in sealed barges , a sort of early precursor of steerage ; in all the pictures , the barges are just rectangular wooden boxes , proportioned like ice cream sandwiches .
Like Noah 's ark , the boxes are God 's idea , and he gives the Jaredites directions for building and provisioning them .
When they 're almost ready to leave it occurs to Jared and Brother that sealing themselves and their people into the barges will mean that they have to do the whole trip in the dark .
So The Brother of Jared goes out and prays to the Lord again , and God obliges him by touching some crystalline rocks with his finger ( in the pictures , the rocks look like rough marbles ) so that they glow in the dark .
And so the Jaredites come to America .
Their story moves pretty rapidly , because the entire history -- much longer in the original - - was compressed by Mormon .
It certainly does n't drag ; kings and prophets and conspiratorial cabals and betrayals go clipping by .
In short , the Jaredites came to America , were godly , prospered , became wicked , and all wiped each other out in one final enormous pitched battle .
The last survivor of all this , their wicked king who precipitated the battle , lives just long enough to see the new chosen people arrive .
He gives them the sacred records that become the Book of Ether , and then expires .
These new people just now coming over the hill are Jews who , at the urging of their patriarch Lehi ( another prophet ) , flee Jerusalem just before its destruction by the Babylonians , somewhere between B.C. 600 and 592 .
Lehi has four sons , Laman and Lemuel and Nephi and Sam. Laman and Lemuel are bad , while Nephi and Sam are good ; the God of the Mormons goes in for a lot of symmetry and repetition .
In addition , Nephi is well in the way of becoming a prophet himself .
Angels come and talk to him a lot .
Lehi takes wife and sons and tents and provisions and flees into the wilderness .
After several days of this he stops and makes camp :
He 's forgotten something .
So he waits there and sends all four of his sons back into the about - to - be - destroyed city of Jerusalem to pick up the family 's genealogical records .
This , by the way , is a thoroughly Mormon thing to do ; it 's a genealogy - obsessed religion .
So Laman and Lemuel and Nephi and Sam go back to Jerusalem and , after various harrowing adventures , come staggering back with the family genealogy , fetchingly engraved on a series of thinly - beaten metal plates .
The Book of Mormon digresses from the narrative for several chapters at this point while everyone in camp has visions , in which are revealed the rise and perfidy of the Catholic Church , the superior status of America as God 's Chosen Land , and the dangers of Freemasonry .
When the story picks up again , Lehi once more smites his forehead with the heel of his hand as he remembers another thing that he and all his sons have forgotten .
So Laman and Lemuel and Nephi and Sam once more journey back to Jerusalem , to recruit another family that Lehi knows of that has four daughters .
After this strategic necessity has been taken care of , the enlarged group builds proper boats , with decks and sails and everything , and embarks for America .
They are guided in this by a magic dingus called the Liahona which God has given to Lehi , a sort of compass - cum - homing device that apparently runs on spiritual energy , since it will only point in the right direction as long as everyone stays right with God .
When the emigrants arrive , they find a strange America whose forests are filled with " beasts of every kind , " including cows , oxen , horses , asses , and both wild and domesticated goats .
After this landfall the narrative breaks off again for a couple of chapters while Nephi discusses the prophecies of Isaiah .
When we get back to the scene of the action , Laman and Lemuel are rebelling violently against Lehi and Nephi and Sam .
Naturally , the godliness faction takes off and flees into the wilderness , where Lehi expires after pronouncing several chapters of blessings on his various offspring .
Laman and Lemuel are cursed for their wickedness and acquire dark skins , with the attached proviso that if they or their offspring ever repent sufficiently , the Lord will bless them and make them white again .
Melanin is a favorite curse of the Mormon God , and two guesses as to which racial group is supposedly descended from Cain .
I wo n't go so tediously through the rest of the book .
Let it suffice that it's a lot like a longer , duller version of the Book of Ether .
The Nephites ( the followers of Nephi , remember ? ) are godly , settled , and agricultural ; they behave themselves , prosper , become wicked , and are all wiped out in one enormous battle that leaves only Lamanites roaming benightedly and aboriginally across the landscape .
Along the way there are a couple of major subplots .
One involves bands of people constantly splintering off from more settled groups that have become wicked , and striking out into the wilderness ( I told you it was a repetitive book ) to seek a more godly life .
One city , in fact , achieves such godliness that it transports bodily up into heaven , presumably leaving behind a big blank spot in the forest .
The other major subplot involves repeated prophecies of the coming of Christ , culminating in a series of earthquakes , tidal waves , tempests , fires , and thunderings and lightnings , followed by three days of palpably thick darkness at the time of Christ 's crucifixion .
Christ then appears in glory for the three days he is supposedly in his tomb in the Old World , and preaches the revealed gospel of the New Testament to the Americas .
For a time then everyone behaves -- but like my baptism , it does n't take , and the wickedness that follows carries the whole pack and passel of Nephites down into oblivion and the necessity for burying gold plates in upstate New York .
When you consider that their scripture is full of America the Land of the Blessed , warnings about evil godless conspiracies , and tales of superpowers squaring off at each other for the last battle , it 's easy to understand why Mormons tend to do things like vote for Ronald Reagan .
So there 's that venerable ( 150 years old now ) book for you , reduced to a pureed caricature of itself for your easy consumption .
But remember Joe Sheffer ?
We left him sitting in the Howard Johnson 's in Tempe several pages ago , drinking coffee and waiting to deliver his clinching argument .
Actually , all he said was that Lehi & Co. would have had to forget the use of the wheel somewhere on the voyage from the Middle East to America , since the invention was widely in use at the time of their departure from Jerusalem but was never used in the Americas until the European conquests .
I thought about that for a moment .
Joe was dead right , of course .
Then I considered it for a couple of minutes more while I waited for the tremors to die down ( no doubt the serpent at the foundations of the earth stirring ) , and then plunged into an orgy of dissection .
For instance , the book is written in very bad King James English that sounds like the language spoken in Mighty Thor comic books ( I say thee , nope ! ) .
This is a little hard to swallow in a manuscript that was theoretically translated by an upstate New York farmboy in the nineteenth century ; harder to swallow is the notion that God really talks like that .
It reads as though someone very familiar with the Bible ( in an unscholarly way ) were trying to write in imitation of the King James Version 's style -- say , the son of a devout Protestant Fundamentalist family , where reading the Bible would have been the order of the day , where more sophisticated Biblical scholarship would have been unknown , and where the most commonly available version of the Bible would have been one in a distinct and peculiar style that included things like verse breaks .
Then there 's the archaeological side of the question .
In the nineteenth century the science had n't really been invented yet ; there was still the possibility that the Amerinds were the Ten Lost Tribes , or something equally fabulous .
Of course , the truth ( current version , who knows ? ) turned out to be just as strange , in a wildly different way , and I 'd no more give up on Olmec heads , the Mound Builders of the eastern United States , and the trek across the Siberian land - bridge , than I would have given up on dinosaurs as a kid .
Moreover , the Amerinds are manifestly not just dark - skinned Semites ; there are some distinct physiological differences besides skin color , the blood type is all wrong , and the indigenous American languages , all God - knows - how - many - dozens of them , are nothing like any known Semitic language .
Another thing , a small thing that peculiarly caught my eye , is that in the Book of Mormon there are many large battles fought with swords .
Now , there are two kinds of swords that could be used in these conflicts .
They could have the all - metal one - or two - edged sort that comes in a hundred shapes and sizes in Old World literature , or they could be using the best New World equivalent , a sort of large club or paddle edged on both sides with inset rows of sharpened obsidian chunks - - a fearsome weapon .
Whichever ; take your pick .
Many men with swords go out to the field of combat and die there , their swords and armor decomposing somewhat more slowly than their bodies .
Now , if they were using metal swords , there ought to be some trace of that much metal left - - its rust in the ground in wetter climates , the artifacts themselves further west .
( In some parts of the Southwest , corncobs and broken sandals are found in caves thousands of years after they were abandoned there , still in perfect shape . )
In either case there 'd be metalworking sites near sources of ore .
There 's nothing of the sort .
So , okay , they were using the Aztec - style wooden paddle with obsidian edges .
In that case there should be , around the old battle sites , innumerable shaped obsidian pieces lying where they came to rest after their wooden cores rotted out .
These should occur frequently at sites extending from Old Mexico to New York .
They do n't , of course ; there was a remarkably widespread trade in Central American obsidian across North America , but the stuff was used for things like ritual implements and jewelry .
I do n't know if anyone else is as interested in all this as I am .
It must sound like I 'm going the long way around to discredit a book that , probably , most of you have at best only heard of , much less read or believed in .
And certainly that whole world of Mormons and Mormonism and the Book of Mormon seems distant .
I 'm sitting here typing in my study in Seattle , trying to write about this very strange subject for the next issue of my fanzine .
But if I were to get on the phone and call home to Mesa , in talking to my sister or grandfather I 'd be talking to a world in which this entire silly - sounding historical romance of a book is the literal truth , the Word of God .
It 's a world in which America will never be conquered by foreign powers as long as it maintains righteousness , where the pioneers of the American frontier were only re-enacting the heroic journeys into the wilderness of a far more ancient time , and where the mind 's eye peoples the Pyramid of the Sun and the ruins of Chichen Itza with fair - skinned Christian women and warriors , prophets and kings .
I spent most of my first twenty years there , in a place where almost everyone was LDS and most of those were my relatives .
As a child , I was genuinely astonished the day I found out that not everyone in the world was a Mormon .
And it 's all still there ; that community , and others like it , scattered thickly up and down the line of the Rocky Mountain states , a little less commonly found elsewhere but still extant almost everywhere in the world .
But I 'm running on -- here , I 'll get back to my narrative .
Sorry to make you wait a few chapters while I have revelations .
It 's a long jump from me sitting in a Howard Johnson 's coffee shop , talking theology and anthropology with a friend , to me three years later getting off the 43 - Ballard bus and walking up to the local Stake House ( a stake is kind of like a diocese , but different ) to stand trial and be excommunicated .
I could have gone on for years ignoring the church and being ignored in return , except that this year they excommunicated Sonia Johnson .
Have you heard of her ?
She 's an organizer of the Mormons for the ERA , a strong , managerial sort of woman who had a fervent belief in her church .
But when she criticized the leadership they excommunicated her , threw her out of the tightly - knit church - centered community , on the grounds that she was not supportive of the leadership and had damaged the missionary effort .
Incidentally , when Spencer W. Kimball , the current President of the Church and head of the Board of Directors of its extensive corporate interests , a man whose full ecclesiastical title is " Prophet , Seer and Revelator , " publicly announced that the ERA was immoral and would destroy the family , he was defended against allegations of undue influence on church members and an improper church - state involvement on the grounds that , like any other private citizen , he had a right to his own opinion .
I got angry .
I 'd known for years that the LDS church was openly working against the women 's rights movement ; when I was working as a page at the Arizona House of Representatives and the anti-ERA groups mustered in force to defeat that legislation in the Judiciary Committee , the women who showed up to protest the ERA were organized by wards ( a ward is kind of like a parish , but different ) .
Mormon women do n't do protest marches on their own get - go .
To hear official spokesmen deny this -- which they have -- and claim that Sonia Johnson was not persecuted for her pro-ERA organizing , but only for criticizing the Presidency -- and then to hear it claimed that the pronouncements of a man who is accounted a prophet and whose word is taken as divine revelation by all believing members represent nothing but off - the - cuff personal opinions -- struck me as rankest hypocrisy , and I was disgusted by it .
I fired off a letter to President Kimball , demanding that my name be taken from the rolls of the church , and seconding Ms. Johnson 's opinions of the church leadership .
I added gratuitously that President Kimball had his nerve talking about women in the church , since he'd never been one , and all his councillors are , to a man , men .
This brought on a flurry of correspondence between the church presidency and my local Bishop and myself and my mother ( whom I 'd imprudently informed of my actions ) , followed by a brief comic interlude as some brethren of the church attempted to serve me a summons to bishop 's court , finally catching me at home as I sat in my bathtub .
I answered the door wrapped only in a towel , thinking that the ringing was Patrick and Alan wanting me to unlock the door , and found instead three dour - looking elders of the church who handed me an envelope and left as soon as possible .
And so I wound up presenting myself at the appointed time and place .
It was easier to go into church this time , since I had Jerry Kaufman with me .
The last time I 'd gone in was a couple of weeks earlier for preliminary negotiations with Bishop Lee after the presidency wrote him and asked him to please talk me out of my protests .
I was thrown badly off balance then , since it turned out that the church building not only looked exactly like all the churches of my youth back in Mesa , but smelled just like them too , an indistinct faint sweet smell with no known source which I 've never smelled anywhere else .
Worse , Bishop Lee turned out to be from Safford , Arizona , a man of my grandparents ' generation , which means that I 'd comfortably bet a month 's rent on the proposition that he 's a relative of mine .
I wo n't explain all that here , since it would involve matters like my mother 's seventy - five first cousins ( a story alternately subtitled " Why I Left Mesa " or " Why My Father Is Still Referred To As Barbara Crandall 's Husband " ) ; let it suffice that we immediately spent fifteen minutes in a ritual discussion of our mutual kin .
I was completely disarmed .
This time , though , as I said , I had Jerry with me .
He 'd come on the spur of the moment ; I 'd been over at his house running off Telos 2 and trying to soothe my jangling nerves by talking to him , and somehow he'd wound up telling me about his cousin 's Bar Mitzvah , with the band and the hired hall and the swans made out of chopped liver and everything .
I found this oddly comforting , and so persuaded him to come along .
We found ourselves waiting in the building foyer for a good twenty minutes in the company of some six or eight teenage Mormon male louts .
Jerry wandered around looking at all the thick carpeting and new paint ( good but durable , the way Mormon churches always are ; temples are furnished in Serious Luxury ) , in through the door of the chapel where a dozen or so members of the ladies ' auxiliary were rehearsing an ensemble version of " O My Father , " and over to where a large portrait of the current prophet hung on the wall ( Prez Kimball , looking very much like a pink and earless Yoda ) , and said " It 's weird !
It 's all so Anglo ! " -- in his nice Cleveland / New York Eastern Urban Degenerate accent .
Call it perspective .
It was much easier to stand waiting to be called into the court session in the company of Jerry , a representative representative of the normal Delanyesque world where everyone publishes small mimeographed magazines and writes for The Rocket .
Then suddenly there was Bishop Lee , smiling and white - haired and kindly , asking me to please come in now .
I think he thought Jerry was my husband ; he shook his hand firmly and said hello .
" This is my friend Jerry Kaufman , " I said .
" He 's come along for moral support .
My husband is busy running a mimeograph . "
Bishop
Lee just looked at me , profoundly confused .
Then it struck me : I 'd been away from the home continuum too long .
Back there , grown married ladies simply do not have male friends who are not their husbands , particularly friends who show up on important occasions when their husband does not .
Some seconds passed .
Finally , I smiled brightly at the Bishop and said " Jerry is n't coming to the trial , he just came to wait with me . "
I 'm not sure how this allowed the matter to be resolved , but Bishop Lee affably showed Jerry to a chair in the Ward Clerk 's office , on the other side of a door from where I was being tried .
I went in .
The Bishop 's office was a long , somewhat narrow room , furnished with a very long , narrow , highly polished wooden table with a much smaller table set crossways at its head .
The gentlemen of the court clustered tightly up there , while I had a solitary chair down at its foot , and the length of that table stretched between us .
There were four of them : the Bishop , his Second Counselor ( the First Counselor ought to have been there too , but he had some other urgent business ) , the Ward Executive Secretary , and somebody else official .
I forget .
They were nice older men , like Rotarians , and none of them had the slightest idea what to do on this occasion .
So they all smiled and shook hands with me and said that they were pleased to meet me there , which considering the circumstances cannot have been true , but which was apparently the only thing they knew to say when meeting someone .
The next order of business was an opening prayer .
Now , Mormonism has a lay ministry , which means that there is no professionally trained clergy ; for instance , I think that Bishop Lee is a builder or contractor or some such thing .
And though services are generally heartfelt , they are not graceful .
One peculiarity this breeds is that everyone learns to pray by listening to everyone else , and certain phrases get repeated over and over , prayer after prayer , until they lose their sense .
So , sure enough , when the Ward Secretary stood up to pray , he started with " We thank Thee , O Lord , for bringing us together on this occasion --" and down at the foot of the table I almost lost my composure .
It was so dumb and familiar , and so completely inappropriate .
Then we proceeded to read off all the correspondence , from me to the church , the church to me , the church to Bishop Lee , the Bishop to me , and the summons to my trial in full , for all the world as though we were reading the minutes of the previous meeting .
Then Bishop Lee took out a three - ring binder which turned out to contain the looseleaf manual of instructions for bishops , and read me off the terms of excommunication .
As I understand them , they amount to a complete severance of myself from the church , denying me all privileges of membership .
I am barred from the temple , of course ; also , the church will not permit me to pay any tithing or make other offerings of any sort .
On the other hand , I can attend meetings and am encouraged to repent , though if I want to re-enter the church I 'll have to be re-tried and recommended by the same ward in which I was excommunicated .
And there 's one other thing , the official action that really and truly made me excommunicate :
When the central organization of the church received word that I was out , someone formally went to the filing cabinet where my membership file was kept .
And that someone , specifically and officially using red ink , took my folder and stamped across the face of it EXCOMMUNICATED .
And do you know what ?
If I repent and am once more received into the church and my sins are washed away again , I will triumphantly be issued a new file folder .
I thought this was wonderful , a sort of bureaucrat 's revenge and redemption .
The court asked me if I had anything to say .
I did ; in fact , I had a dozen copies of my typed statement in hand .
I stood up and read it off .
I accused the church of profound sexism , of both covert and overt opposition to the women 's rights movement , and of giving moral sanction to the continuing social and economic subjugation of women .
Right off , that was enough to get me excommunicated ; it was no more than what Sonia Johnson had been saying -- in politer language , too -- when they kicked her the hell out .
I went on .
I said that if any institution -- church , family , whatever -- required the continuing systematized oppression of some group for its continued survival , then it ought to be brought down with no regrets ; and I charged " the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints , its elders and leaders and the Prophet himself , with the guilt and burden of this injustice they knowingly perpetuate . "
That was fun , so I went still further .
I denied the validity of the Book of Mormon and all church doctrine , said that they were not inspired of God , said that the Prophet and the Council of Twelve are not in direct communion with God , and repudiated my baptism , confirmation , and reception of the sacraments .
As a sort of grand final hurrah , I denied the authority of the court to sit in judgement on me , and said that I had only appeared before it in order to separate myself from the church as thoroughly as possible .
There was silence for a few moments after I finished .
Then Bishop Lee asked if I had anything more to say .
" Have n't I said enough ? " I asked plaintively .
" I think you have . "
He fumbled around with his three - ring binder , and I passed out copies of my statement to the people there .
The Ward Secretary was grateful - - he'd have had to copy the thing out longhand , otherwise -- and complimented me on my organization .
I thanked him .
I went to wait outside while they made their decision , and sat down in the chair next to Jerry's .
" Do you think they 'll do it ? " he asked .
I told him that there was n't much room for question .
All told , I was out in the hall for maybe five minutes before the door opened again and I resumed my place at the foot of the table .
Bishop Lee looked sober .
" It is the judgment of this court that you should be excommunicated from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints , " he said .
" I 'm not surprised . "
" Do you have any further statements to make ? "
" No . "
The Bishop stared at me authoritatively down the length of the table , trying hard to look awesome , so I stared back at him and put my chin up : Mammalian Politics 101 , pretty basic stuff .
" I think you will find that your life will be very different now - " he began .
I interrupted him .
" I expect it will . "
" Your life will be very different now , " he continued sternly , " for you will find that the gift of the Holy Spirit , which was conferred upon you when you were baptized , has now been taken away from you , and you will no longer have the promptings of the Spirit to guide you in your decisions . "
It was a little startling , after the complete mundanity of the proceedings thus far , to find myself on the receiving end of an authoritarian and rather acrimonious casting - out .
I took a deep breath and said , " I do n't think the gift of the Holy Spirit is yours to either give or take away . "
All he came back with was " I think you 'll find that saying a thing is so does not necessarily make it so , " which I thought was a disappointingly pale finish to his melodramatic beginning .
That over with , he asked one of the brethren to close the meeting with a prayer .
And darned if the fellow did n't stand up , address the Almighty , and say " We thank Thee , O Lord , for bringing us together on this occasion --. "
I nearly swallowed my tongue trying to keep from laughing .
I think I may have let out a couple of choked noises , but those would have been allowable signs of remorse in a newly - excommunicated viper .
And then , since it was time to go , all the brethren smiled and vigorously shook my hand again and said " It 's been a pleasure to meet you , Sister Hayden . "
So -- why not , the evening had been strange enough already -- I shook hands with them all and said thank you thank you thank you , then grabbed my coat and purse and headed out the door , picking up Jerry as I went .
When we got back to Jerry & Suzle 's house , I tried to go down into the basement to tell Patrick the news , but he was collating the first copy of Telos 2 to surprise me , and was n't finished yet .
" Go away , get out of here , do n't come in , " he yelled up the stairs .
" I do n't want you down here . "
" Funny , " I yelled back down , " that 's what the Bishop said . "
The evening turned into an impromptu party ; people dropped by to hear about what happened , and there were copies of the new Telos to pass around , and then in the middle of it Jane Hawkins and Ole Kvern and Vonda McIntyre phoned to say did we want a Frederick & Nelson chocolate cake to celebrate with ?
Because there was one left over from a party for Jane earlier that evening .
So we made a pretty good time of it , and the cake was great .
When Vonda arrived she gave me a congratulatory hug and asked if I felt any different .
I thought about it a minute , the grinned ; I did feel different .
After seventeen years , I finally felt washed clean .
It 's a very nice feeling , and I recommend it .
And here , where I ought to end this , I 'm obliged to tell one more story , since I promised Vonda a long time ago and you somewhat more recently that I would explain the holy underwear of the Lord .
I thought that it would fit somewhere into this narrative , but really , it does n't touch on the matter of my excommunication ; it 's just a very odd facet of Mormonism that I do n't understand .
One night we were sitting around talking about Mormonism and someone -- I do n't remember who -- repeated a rumor that she 'd heard as a child , that married Mormons wear strange long underwear ( with strategically - placed holes in it ) that they can never take off , in the shower or anywhere else , and that when one set of underwear wears out they just put another one on top of it and let the first set rot off .
" Is n't that strange ? " she said .
" Of course , it ca n't be true . "
" Well , " I said , " not precisely . "
You have to understand that there are different levels of initiation in the LDS church .
I was baptized and confirmed in a normal church setting , and that made me a member , but there are other rituals that take place in the temple , usually just before the initiate member gets married or goes on a mission , called " receiving your endowments . "
I do n't know what that 's all about , since it is n't spoken of and I fell from grace before I was eligible to find out .
( In my early teens I did take part in a temple ritual - baptism for the dead - that involved my getting dunked thirty times in an afternoon , in a great circular baptismal font supported on the backs of twelve life - size bronze oxen , on behalf of the inhabitants of a seventeenth - century Bavarian village ; but that 's another story entirely . )
The only thing that I know for sure about the receiving of endowments is that afterward the endowed member wears special underclothes called garments .
These are like lightweight long underwear , short - sleeved , and end just above the knee .
The really peculiar thing about them is that they have little marks stitched into them at nipple and belly button .
These little things are technically known as " marks , " and Mean Something , but I 'm not sure what .
My only other real datum is that my mother and father did n't shower in their underwear any more than I shower in mine , and changed theirs just as frequently .
I have one odd memory from childhood that may or may not relate to this .
My parents were married secularly for years before they married in the temple , and so when they had their second marriage all five of us children attended .
I remember being dressed all in white ( mandatory in temple ) , and being left with my siblings in a variety of waiting rooms while my parents were off doing whatever - it - is .
But at one point they briefly rejoined us , and I remember that what they were wearing was very strange .
They had on white coveralls , like the clothing I wore at my baptism , but with the marks stitched into them .
In addition , they had on little squarish white caps , like Masons ' caps , and green silk loincloth - aprons appliqued in a fig leaf pattern .
One other thing : I once visited the ruins of Nauvoo , Illinois , the site of an early , intense church settlement that was abandoned because of mob violence .
Some of the foundations there had Masonic symbols carved into them , and I know that Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum Smith were Freemasons .
Taken together with the odd ritual clothing and caps and aprons makes me wonder , but really , I do n't know .
Okay , Vonda ?
That 's all I can tell you .
If there 's a moral I 'd derive from this whole long ramble , it would be this : next time you think of dismissing the person next to you on the bus or at the office as a polyester - suited mundane schmuck , remember that he or she could be a Mormon .
Or something even stranger , that neither you nor I have ever heard of .

When the 47 - year - old woman from Ohio got back results of her breast biopsy from Magee - Womens Hospital in 1999 , she faced few medical options .
The lab found invasive cancer requiring immediate surgery .
She promptly underwent a mastectomy , followed by two months of painful radiation treatments , unaware that there had been a mistake .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Wednesday December 07 , 2005 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 2 inches ; 58 words Type of Material : Correction
Lab problems -- An article in Friday ’s Section A about deficient pathology laboratories said East Los Angeles Doctors Hospital was operating under conditional approval pending appeal to the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations .
A spokesman for the national agency , which had issued a preliminary denial of accreditation , said the lab ’s certification was fully restored Oct. 24 .
It turned out that the hospital lab had mistakenly switched biopsy specimens .
She had no cancer .
The positive reading belonged to a 64 - year - old Pennsylvania woman .
Both women have since accepted undisclosed damage settlements in cases sealed by the courts .
In the years since , allegations of serious laboratory errors have continued to mount .
At least 10 cases are pending in state courts claiming harm from lab mistakes at Magee , a prominent regional hospital for women and part of the highly regarded University of Pittsburgh Medical Center .

Physician whistle - blowers have complained about chronic lab problems and patterns of errors and sloppy record - keeping .
Magee officials strenuously deny such allegations .
And the lab has continued to be accredited by federal inspectors .
Such conflicts are not restricted to the Pittsburgh hospital .
Lawsuits and complaints citing faulty lab operations are accumulating nationwide , naming some of the country ’s top medical centers .
The number of problem labs facing threats that their accreditations could be revoked also is growing , authorities say .
Some of those are in Southern California .
In Needles , for example , the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations denied certification to the Colorado River Medical Center ’s lab this year .
Three other area labs were cited for deficiencies , including Kindred Hospital in La Mirada and City of Angels Medical Center in Los Angeles .
The East Los Angeles Doctors Hospital was denied certification but operates under conditional accreditation granted on appeal , according to the commission .

The faulty lab operations have raised alarm among medical experts about federal oversight and inspections of hospital laboratories across the country .
Magee passed inspections by a federal accreditation agency , the College of American Pathologists , even as litigation mounted against it in the Pennsylvania courts .
And there are other examples :
* In Maryland , a hospital lab sent out hundreds of HIV and hepatitis test results despite data showing that the results might be invalid and mistakenly lead infected patients to believe they were disease - free .
The same laboratory had just received a top rating from CAP inspectors .
Advertisement
* In Yakima , Wash. , eight emergency room doctors walked off their jobs to protest hospital deficiencies they said included lab mistakes , such as mixed - up blood samples .
CAP had declared the lab “ in good standing ” the year before .
* At the famed Mayo Clinic in Minnesota , an allegedly misdiagnosed gall bladder cancer case led to revelations of a close relationship between the clinic and CAP .
A Mayo pathologist serving on a CAP advisory panel twice sought and obtained accreditation renewals despite unacceptable lab practices cited by CAP inspectors .
Such cases underscore concerns that lab mistakes are a growing national problem .
At a symposium on hospital lab quality in suburban Washington , D.C. , in October , experts from around the country considered calls for improvement and closer scrutiny .

“ We have problems with quality everywhere , ” James Westgard , from the University of Wisconsin , told the gathering .
“ Our problems are systemwide . ”
Meanwhile , the number of problem labs officially cited with failing grades by accreditation agencies has increased .
As recently as last spring , 10 medical labs had either lost accreditation or were “ on the edge ” of losing theirs , said Dennis O’Leary , president of the joint commission .
He said that number had grown to 15 .
“ Things are not going well , ” O’Leary said .
“ It ’s a cause for urgent concern . ”

At Magee , a group of whistle - blowers , including two former staff doctors , is alleging a pattern of lab shortcomings and inadequate regulatory pressure to fix it .
The Inspectors
The College of American Pathologists , based in Illinois , is one of a handful of organizations authorized by the federal government to inspect medical laboratories across the country .
It oversees about 6,000 laboratories , making inspections every two years .
It also can perform unscheduled or emergency inspections .
Advertisement
CAP ’s funding comes from the same labs and hospitals that it inspects , each of them billed for the costs of those inspections .
Such direct financial ties have encountered criticism .
In 2004 , CAP declared that its annual revenue was $ 115.5 million , which exceeded its expenses by about $ 15 million .
The head of CAP collects about $ 470,000 in annual salary and benefits , federal tax records show .
Its teams of inspectors also come from the ranks of pathologists and lab technicians at the hospitals they inspect .
One doctor who attended a CAP inspection training session in 2003 said questions about how to deal with violations or misconduct seemed unwelcome .
She recalled being told that the “ whole purpose ” of inspections was to educate , not to expose misconduct .
Advertisement
“ The message I got was : ‘ Everyone is acting in good faith , ’ ” said Dr. Susan A. Silver , one of the whistle - blowers who says she lost her job after reporting Magee ’s lab problems to CAP .
She is suing the hospital .
Dr. R. Bruce Williams , chairman of the CAP panel that oversees lab inspections , defended the agency .
He said in an interview that although education was one of the organization ’s purposes , CAP “ performs a very good inspection .
I really think we do a good job . ”
He denied that inspectors “ go easy ” on flaws or misconduct .
But Westgard , the lab quality expert from Wisconsin , said the nation ’s lab inspection system was fundamentally flawed .
Advertisement
It is set up to assure compliance with regulations , but not to encourage high - quality work , Westgard said .
As a result , hospital administrators under economic pressures strive for meeting the minimum standards .
“ Doing the minimum to get by does not lead to quality , ” he said , adding that recent changes in regulations might allow some laboratories to perform fewer checks on the accuracy of testing equipment .
The Whistle - Blowers
In December 1999 , Silver , a Johns Hopkins University - trained pathologist and one of the newest members of the Magee staff , complained to a colleague about an unusual practice she encountered in the lab .
Advertisement
Her electronic signature had been inscribed on two pathology reports she had never seen .
Pathology specimens for one patient were getting mixed up with those of another patient .
Subsequent internal hospital records , reviewed by The Times , show that patient identity errors were occurring in 7 % of the lab ’s Pap smear samples .
The records did not show how many , if any , resulted in false diagnoses .
Silver complained that one lab staff member seemed distracted by unrelated duties , “ doubling as a travel agency . ”
Hospital officials said the staff member was allowed to assist hospital personnel “ in coordinating travel plans , ” but that she did not run a travel agency out of the lab .
Veteran pathologist Dr. Kenneth S. McCarty Jr. said he looked into Silver ’s complaints and found a widespread quality - control problem in the Magee lab .
Advertisement
He was troubled by patterns of mistakes .
Sometimes test results on lab work such as Pap smears were mixed up or read improperly , he said , and patient identification errors were too common .
They reported their concerns to the hospital .
Months later , McCarty and Silver got tired of waiting for the hospital to take corrective action , they said .
They turned to CAP , anonymously at first , and disclosed their identities privately to the inspection agency in the summer of 2001 .
Inspectors arrived to review the lab in the fall of 2001 .
However , CAP had called ahead .
The whistle - blowers contend that the advance notice compromised the inspection , allowing lab personnel to conceal problems .
Internal e-mails filed in court show that Magee hospital officials not only knew that the inspection was coming but that it was triggered by “ repeated accusations and concerns about laboratory malfunction from Magee faculty . ”
Advertisement
The whistle - blowers contend that their identities also were compromised by the inspection agency .
“ All the evidence indicates that CAP did not maintain their commitment for confidentiality , ” McCarty said .
McCarty and Silver were fired just before the inspectors arrived .
In one e-mail , a hospital official referred to them as “ terrorists . ”
Another e-mail from a hospital official boasted after the inspection about how well it had gone .
“ A few minor citations .... [ The CAP team leader said ] he would not hesitate for a moment to send his family members to Magee for care , ” the hospital official wrote on Oct. 31 , 2001 .
Inspectors reported “ no credible verification of any of the allegations , ” CAP ’s Williams said .
He acknowledged informing Magee in advance of the inspection but said it was simply intended to make the visit seem more routine .
He denied revealing the identities of whistle - blowers , calling their protection “ our first priority . ”

Williams , who heads the committee overseeing lab inspections , said CAP recently changed its policy and would conduct inspections unannounced , beginning next year .
Silver filed suit over her dismissal a year after the inspection , saying the hospital destroyed her “ career and reputation . ”
McCarty , who retained his tenured faculty position at the University of Pittsburgh , filed suit in 2003 .
Their cases are pending .
In his suit , McCarty alleges that at the time he was forced out for raising questions about lab practices , Magee administrators and their lawyers were aware “ that some patients received the wrong diagnosis ; some received the wrong or unnecessary surgery and treatment , including radiation . ”
Both suits also cite incidents of the doctors ’ signatures being electronically applied to pathology reports they did not review .
Advertisement
Hospital lawyers denied retaliation and said McCarty was reassigned due to “ disruptive behavior . ”
They dismissed the false electronic signatures as “ a computer glitch . ”
The hospital also defends its lab as “ exemplary . ”
Officials cite CAP ’s continuing accreditation of the lab as proof that deficiency claims are unfounded .
Internal complaints have continued since Silver and McCarty were dismissed in 2001 .
Donna Kovacs , an employee of Magee ’s pathology department , said she and other employees were threatened for pointing out lab mistakes , including specimen slides being mixed up or sent to the wrong doctors .
Advertisement
She said she went to Pennsylvania state health authorities with her complaints because she was “ looking out for the patients . ”
One of those patients was Kovacs herself .
She discovered her own Pap smear reports had been signed by a staff pathologist who never read her tests , she said .
Kovacs was fired .
She filed suit against Magee under a state law protecting whistle - blowers .
The hospital said she was dismissed for improperly accessing confidential patient records .
Magee in Court

Since it opened in 1915 , Magee - Womens Hospital has grown to become a major regional and national center for women ’s and infants ’ healthcare , according to its website .
Its reputation attracted some of the patients who are suing the hospital , including one who recited Magee ’s onetime slogan : “ Nobody treats women like we do . ”
But documented warnings from its staff and years of litigation have produced a library of potentially damaging internal records in the case files of Allegheny Common Pleas Court .
Some of those records show that Magee has struggled for years with increasing workloads at its laboratory .
Advertisement
In one “ self - assessment report ” dated April 9 , 1999 , hospital officials said , “ Due to the inadequate staff , quality improvement has taken a back seat to completion of patient tests , which has been the priority and necessarily so . ”
Records also show that the volume of Pap smear specimens submitted to the lab jumped from 77,319 in 1995 to 131,383 in 2000 , an increase of 80 % , while staffing increased only slightly .
Meanwhile , federally mandated reviews of past test results for cervical cancer were delayed for some patients as long as six years .
In deposition testimony , a hospital official blamed a department manager ’s long commute after his marriage -- from Cleveland , 135 miles away .
In another internal memo , a Magee supervisor said too many misidentified patients and erroneous Pap smear reports were being processed .

“ Imagine being told that you have a negative report and then being called a week later for a [ biopsy ] because of a clerical error , ” said a Sept. 26 , 2000 , memo .
“ We have to correct this problem . ”
It was a case of switched specimens that cost the 47 - year - old Ohio woman an unnecessary mastectomy a year earlier .
Tests performed immediately after surgery showed no trace of cancer , but she underwent radiation treatments anyway .
Meanwhile , the cancer - stricken Pennsylvania woman waited seven months for the treatment she needed .
In a deposition , a pathologist involved in the case testified that in her 26 years at the hospital , she knew of no similar error .

“ This has never , never happened , OK , ” said Dr. Anisa Kanbour .
“ Magee - Womens Hospital is above the standard of any other hospital , and every pathologist and every physician take pride in themselves and their work . ”
A similar mix - up occurred three years ago , when a Magee lab technician was interrupted while preparing a breast biopsy specimen and returned to find that someone else had completed the task .
But two specimens were mixed in the process .
One had cancer ; the other did not .
“ The problem was discovered by serendipity , ” said an internal report on the incident , luckily before unnecessary surgery was performed .

Among other legal actions pending against Magee is the case of a woman whose advanced cervical cancer diagnosis was delayed , she alleges , by misread and tardy lab results .
In her suit , Bobbi Jo Brooks charged that Magee officials issued an erroneous report indicating she did not have cancer , and then made it appear that her test had been reviewed by a licensed pathologist .
Her test review , performed by a lab technician , was attributed to a fictitious Doctor D , she said .
In another case , Dona Lischner charges that faulty lab work resulted in an avoidable hysterectomy .
Her lawyer says that she was the victim of “ systemic negligence ” and that , like her , “ numerous other ” Magee patients had multiple Pap smears misread .
She sued the hospital , Lischner said , to warn other women about what could happen to them .
“ It ’s not [ for ] the money , ” she said in an interview .
“ I was lucky .
I ’m here to talk about it .
There are other women out there with lives at stake . ”

Attorneys for the hospital denied that any Magee actions or inactions contributed to Lischner ’s medical problems .
In a more recent case , Magee paid $ 1.3 million to the estate of a woman who died of cervical cancer in June 2004 .
She blamed the lab for misread Pap smear results that delayed treatment .
Her family ’s lawsuit was settled out of court , records show .
Trouble in Maryland
Two years ago , a whistle - blower focused state attention on Maryland General Hospital .
The medical center had sent out hundreds of test results for HIV and hepatitis despite questions about lab equipment reliability .
Advertisement
CAP , which had accredited the lab , refused the state health secretary ’s request for its inspection reports , prompting a showdown .
Then - Secretary Nelson Sabatini threatened to revoke the accreditations of all Maryland labs certified by CAP .
CAP relented .
But the organization still regards its inspection reports as “ proprietary ” and refused a Times requests for its inspection reports .
Officials also refused a request to identify laboratories placed on probation .
“ In a way , Maryland General was a distraction , ” Sabatini said .
“ The problem is a flawed regulatory system . ”
Advertisement
He cited studies showing that hospital medical errors could account for as many as 100,000 deaths per year .
“ The hospitals say , ‘ Leave us alone , and we ’ll fix it .
Oh , and by the way , protect us from malpractice suits , ’ ” Sabatini said .
“ How can you tell people to give up their right to sue with those numbers of mistakes ? ”
Sabatini recommends that the federal government contract directly with an agency like CAP to cut out financial ties between hospitals and inspectors .
The Yakima Walkout
Advertisement
Last June , eight emergency room physicians at Yakima Regional Medical and Cardiac Center resigned as a group over what they called unresolved patient safety concerns .
Among complaints detailed in their 13 - page report to state health officials were allegations of “ laboratory mix-ups , ” including several cases “ where the blood of two patients has been switched . ”
One such case involved a small child who was “ apprehensive about having his blood drawn . ”
A mix - up required doctors to take a second sample .
An off - year CAP inspection found “ systemic problems ” in the hospital ’s lab services , and it has been placed on probation .
Advertisement
Sean Richardson , chief operating officer of the central Washington hospital , minimized the deficiencies as technical , saying that “ certainly no patients were adversely affected . ”
He said allegations made by the doctors were unfounded .
Mayo Clinic Conflicts
For years , the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota has used a unique freezing and processing method to analyze tissues immediately during surgery .
The trouble is that Mayo ’s slides last three days , not the 10 years required by federal regulation .
The clinic has been cited repeatedly by CAP inspectors for failing to meet federal standards , yet it has received full accreditation .
Advertisement
That accreditation has been renewed in recent years following appeals to CAP by a Mayo official with close ties to the accrediting agency .
Records show that Lawrence J. Burgart , a Mayo pathologist , twice wrote to CAP contesting inspection deficiency notices .
At the same time , Burgart was serving as a CAP advisor , heading its surgical pathology committee .
The dual roles were disclosed in a malpractice case filed by the daughter of a longtime Mayo employee who became a cancer patient at the clinic .
The suit accused Mayo of misreading pathology slides , a claim leading to the discovery that the slides were not retained in accordance with federal regulations .
While CAP continued to accredit the Mayo lab , agency officials denied that Mayo received special treatment .
Advertisement
“ That does n’t happen , ” said CAP ’s Williams .
“ That ’s not the way we operate .
If anything , we would be tougher on them . ”
CAP has taken a tougher line this year .
On Aug. 8 , the agency advised Mayo in a letter that it must comply with the more stringent retention rules “ effective at the time of your next on - site inspection . ”
Mayo spokesman Lee Aase said the clinic was adopting stricter specimen retention rules and would meet CAP ’s deadline .
Times researchers Janet Lundblad and Nona Yates in Los Angeles contributed to this report .

So go ahead ... tell me what you read in some obscure book about privacy .
Tell me loud and long .
Because I 'm never going to have to hear that shit again .
Hi guys , I ’m Jonathan .
I work at the Dekker PR company , and I have lost thirty pounds in the last four months .
This started when my office started keeping some coupons from Nutrisystem at the reception for interested employees .
I will tell you about their promo codes after I tell you about the agency ’s weight loss journey with Nutrisystem .
Dekker PR Company is a public relations firm which has been in business for the past fifteen years .
There are 105 employees in the office and all of us work to serve our clients , who are usually top athletes and movie stars .
The company first started the idea of the Nutrisystem deals to help the employees maintain a healthy lifestyle to be a positive impact on our clients .
I , frankly , was very skeptical about this .
I had been fat my whole life , and setting as an example to our clients about living a healthy lifestyle was something that seemed to be out of reach .
After talking to Mr. Dekker , our boss , about this , he suggested I give it a try , especially because it would save me money as well .
Nutrisystem expanding in our office …
All thanks to its affordability !
Out of the 105 employees at Dekker PR , now , about 85 employees follow the Nutrisystem program ; some follow the entire program , while many follow only a meal or two a day .
Whichever plan you choose to follow , Nutrisystem makes you feel like your body is eating healthy and that you ’re getting fitter .
Keeping aside the fact that Nutrisystem is so amazing , I think the reason why such a huge percentage of employees at the office decided to follow the diet because of its affordability .
The maximum it is going to cost you a day is $ 12 .
This is almost nothing compared to the cost of fast food .
A plus point to all the employees is that there are coupons in the office itself .
There is no need to spend hours searching for Nutrisystem coupons online even though you can find them on ( Debra Moorhead ) .
These coupons are really a blessing ; a $ 12 meal plan per day costs only $ 10 with Nutrisystem .
At just $ 3 or $ 4 , all the employees were having tasty and healthy lunch at the office with the program .
When the codes were first introduced , none of the employees knew very much about the program , yet about 30 people were picking up the discount codes on the very first day .
This was n’t because they had heard of Nutrisystem earlier ; this was solely because Nutrisystem meals would cost them so much less than what average fast food would .
The already inexpensive program was made so much cheaper with their deals .
In the first month , there were about 50 people who were following the Nutrisystem program .
The rest seemed extremely skeptical about the program back then .
But all of this changed when in just about three months , everyone started seeing the changes in the ones who were having Nutrisystem meals .
Now , in four months , there are 35 more employees interested in the program .
And the good news is , there is n’t anyone in the office who ca n’t afford Nutrisystem ; most are even saving money with the Nutrisystem meals .
Great food with balanced nutrition
After paying only a few dollars a day , we expected Nutrisystem meals to be just okay , not tasty or special or anything .
But Nutrisystem managed to shock us again !
The meals were n’t just okay ; they were delicious !
I personally , had never felt so good eating healthy , because the meals were n’t full of salads and almonds , it was actually good food .
Our menus actually included muffins , cupcakes and granola bars .
It ’s amazing how these foodstuffs are what you can have six times a day with control portions , and you still get all the balanced nutrients that your body requires .
All the meals are said to have low - glycemic carbs , high fiber , high protein , no preservatives , sweeteners , colors or flavors .
Call them up for motivation
All our employees , when they felt like they needed the motivation to continue the meal plan , would call up the Nutrisystem office .
There , they have trained weight loss counselors who help remember why we actually started , and how a healthy lifestyle can be so much better if we continue .
Also , they would remind about how much money we ’re saving .
Whatever they would say , at the end of the phone call , quitting the meal plan did n’t even cross our minds !
Here are a few pros and cons our office employees came up with after using Nutrisystem :
Pros :
Affordability
Delicious meals
Provide motivation through your computer / phone
Cons :
Having to microwave every meal
Fast food cravings
Difficult to continue in the first month
Now , all our clients stop our employees to ask how we ’re getting fitter , and everyone replies with “ Nutrisystem . ”
Mr. Dekker is extremely proud of our progress , and he confidently tells our clients about how it started , and how we ’ve all stayed motivated to eat healthy .
Some of the employees , including me , were a little overweight , but now , we ’re all losing weight .
The skinny ones are getting turbo shakes and working out to stay fit .
Even outside of work , everyone recommends Nutrisystem to others , giving them discount codes to begin with .
If every office could do something as inspiring as our office , America would actually be living a great healthy lifestyle !

Tech t- shirts are n't sexy enough
I 've been to seven JavaOne conferences .
I 've paid more than $ 10,000 of my own money , just for the attendance fee .
You 'd think -- just once -- they 'd give me a show shirt that did n't hide the fact that I have , say , breasts .
You 'd think -- just once -- they'd take part of the $ 2000 entrance fee and spend , oh , .1 % extra to print up some shirts that sub - 6 - foot folks can wear .
And it 's not just Sun's JavaOne show , of course -- practically every tech company out there is guilty .
If I had a dime for every booth vendor who 's smiled and said , " Here , you can sleep in it ! " , I 'd be typing this from my ocean - front villa .
( Pssst - - tech companies : most of us women do n't sleep in anything , but I digress ... )
The formula we 've done to death on this blog is pretty simple :
How are you helping your users kick ass ?
I put " helping them look good " in the " kicking ass " category .
But that 's not even the point .
The point is showing us that you care about more than just saving a few bucks on a t - shirt print run .
That you care about ALL your users , not just the Big Burly Men .
And even if you do not care , you 'd think the marketers would get a clue that people are n't going to be wearing your logo around giving you free advertising if the shirt does n't fit .
The bar 's been set pretty low on this , so even a MEN'S SMALL would make me happy .
But Webstock went all the way to give the gals women 's shirts .
I actually wear mine all the time .
I 've even been photographed wearing it at another conference .
I so do n't want a lecture on logistics or saving money by making shirts for the largest common denominator .
And I do n't want to hear that , after all , it IS mostly men at these things .
So what if you have some leftover shirts ?
Give them out at other tech events .
Send them to user groups .
Donate them to a homeless shelter .
Yes , you could argue that as a web - focused show rather than a pure programming event , Webstock was likely to have more women than JavaOne , so it made sense .
And that 's true , but does n't explain why I also got a fitted , flattering , rather sexy blue tee at GUADEC ( the GNOME user 's and developer 's european conference ) which was not expecting but a very few women attendees .
But they treated us like we mattered too .
Like we were n't the tacked - on not - really - target - audience people .
Besides , this is n't even a gender thing ... it 's a SIZE thing .
There are plenty of men who do n't look that much better in an XXL Hanes Beefy T than I do .
This is partly tongue - in - cheek , but still ... the t- shirts are a metaphor for -- or at least a reflection of -- the way the company feels about users as individual people .
The shirts matter , and they speak volumes about your company .
And hey , tech companies , I AM available to beta test your freshly - minted women 's T's ( size small or x - small ) .
In fact , for any tech company that tells me they 'll be keeping plenty of women 's shirts on hand for trade shows , user groups , etc. , I 'll post a picture of the shirt on this blog .
But it better make me look good . ; )

Yeah , that XXL Tee might be too big for most , but at 6 ' 7 " and being built more like a football player than basketball player , an XXL -- if they even offer it -- is a " wear once , wash once " garment .
By the time it comes out of the dryer , it becomes a paint shirt for the Mrs .
Since your average * store * does n't even carry my size clothing , a vendor 's unusable schwag at a trade show rarely burns my shorts is when my * employer * does n't think to supply shirts for everyone .
My current employer supplied a big - enough button down shirt for me at a trade show ( although a much smaller colleague called hers a " tarp " for is huge size and plastic -y feel ) , but at a previous company 's project completion celebration , they tried to foist an XL on me .
The conversation went like this :
Me : " Do you have any XXXL or XXL - Tall ? "
Them : " You should try the Extra Large -- it 's really big ! "
Me : " That 's what Extra Large means .
I 'm really , really , really big ... and tall .
I was last merely really big when I was 13 . "
Way to make your employees feel valued -- exclude some of them from the commonality of sharing a T - shirt .

Meebo sent me a shirt .
I was expecting the usual superlame tech T , but instead received a ( sweatshop free ! )
American Apparel shirt , with a tasteful logo placed in the middle of the chest , and a small URL towards the neckline of the shirt .
Instantly I knew why these people have a great product .
They care about quality .

Ok ,
perhaps you 'll allow me , as a long time reader to shamelessly plug skreened .com for these tech shirts .
As it is my company .
But i also have something to add to the discussion .
A fitted tee is the very least conferences can do for their female attendees .
Also , from an environmental point of view a well designs shirt not only gets ' impressions ' but they also do n't need to be turned into something to wash the car with when people get home .
oh , and responding to the comments , I print almost exclusivly on american apparel , and my process is great for people who want small quantities .

Joel , I never thought about it from the perspective of an employee -- but that 's even MORE important .
What you said here is a really important idea :
" Way to make your employees feel valued -- exclude some of them from the commonality of sharing a T - shirt . "
Aaron : thanks for that example !
It really does seem like there 's a mapping between the t- shirt and the products / service .
And even when there 's not , we still THINK there is .
Daniel :
Thank you for stepping in to let us know you have a company that can help !
I 'm going to check out skreened ...
I 'm just not happy with what you can do Cafepress style , great as it is .

Well , just so happens I 'm wearing my small men's Webstock t- shirt right now .
It 's the first time I 've worn it since the conference ( I usually do n't like t- shirts much ) , but yeah , it looks damn good !
And not many conferences offer you anything smaller than medium , so I was pleasantly surprised when I did have the option for a smaller mens size .
The Webstock design and logo placement is very cool too !

Oh so true ...
I have a drawer full of exceedingly nerdy huge t- shirts from when I used to go to trade shows , and a bunch of DEC Alpha stuff .
They were useful in college when I got them .

Oddly enough , a Sun booth once gave me a men's small .

Swag shirts are generally cheap and as one - size - fits - all as possible , to cut down on costs .
I like how women are all into equality until it comes time to put on something that does n't highlight their brain containers .
Posted by : Idiot | Dec 16 , 2006 1:03:06 AM
Hey Kathy ,
Ryan back finally .
As you know , my previous company we originally met when you spoke at , they do not do t- shirts at all .
Now , I have a new company - one making all the news .
Google of course .
Now , in terms of local swag , Google does runs of both girl t- shirts and guy t- shirts in a variety of sizes .
Staff are pretty good about supplying as many sizes of each as possible , EVEN for swag type things .
Of course you can always spend your own hard earned cash ( look for ' google store ' ) and get properly sized google ts .
Although just attend enough google - sponsored events and you 'll get one for free anyways .
Going from no - tshirt land to uber - tshirt land ( my GF is wearing a girl -t that I grabbed because no guy ts were left ) , I must say the change is ... wonderful .
It 's a whole culture shift , but it 's really kind of like the employer version of your blog .
" Creating Passionate Employees " - maybe I need to start that blog ?
Or maybe you need a new sub-section , I 'll guest write :-)
I went from total polar opposites of the spectrum and I am pretty pissed that I spent so many years in the suck .

I 'm wondering what you think about the idea of protective camouflage ?
Surely that 's not what the organizers of JavaOne were thinking , but I have noticed a trend in what people wear .
Me ?
I just skip on the free T - shirts altogether and pack clothes that I know are flattering .

In the good old days of bubble 1.0 I attended to a game publisher event and they arranged some kind of " beach party " including the ability for some swimming and surfing an artificial wave .
They were giving away both robes , towels and so on .
The boys were getting blue shorts for swimming and the girls got a HUGE selection ( like a small shop they created ) of various bikinis and swimsuits .
The event obviously got managed by a girl knowing how bad a non-fitting top can be ( not that I could imagine ) .
Nevertheless some female press members left in protest for this being a sexist event .
Interestingly particulary the skinny - blond type who would look great in it - most of the " have - some - pounds - too - much " girls had no problem with it .
So sometimes " helping them look good " can backfire if it turns into " forcing them into something " .

If you 're going to do T shirts that fit both ends of the bell curve , you 're going to have to ask people to pre-order their size - AND STATE THE INCH MEASUREMENT .
Which means not using cheap - ass T shirt blanks .
Even Threadless ' women's T in the largest size does n't fit me - when I can happily wear far less than the equivalent size from any normal US outlet like Old Navy .
You need to pay for something properly sized , which costs more so you need to check how many of which you need .
As a journalist I 'm not that agitated ; I have a ton of T shirts from events but I wea clothes I 've bought because they look good .
I also have a project for when I next have some spare time , to turn 3 or 4 badly sized shirts with spiffy designs into one very spiffy shirt .
The other thing is - why just T shirts ?
UK firm Dr Solomon 's made great play with giving away socks - would you wear Alan Solomon 's socks ?
He could take a couple of pairs in his pockets and give them out , say when he won an award and handed a pair to the Prince of Wales ...
A nice Hawaiin shirt ?
A fleece jacket .
A scarf - something I 've never seen .
Something that really embodies your brand .
But it 's easy for the company T shirt thing to go creepy .
The idea of all the Google folk wearing their free T Google shirts and drinking their free Google soda and eating their free Google barbecue makes me look for the bottle of free Google coolaid ..

I have ranted to my poor husband about this very topic many times before !
The latest bad move I saw at a conference was SIGGRAPH , where there are just as many artsy - types as techie - types in attendance , maybe more .
Although the population is still male - heavy , there are certainly plenty of women .
So what did they sell for T - shirts ?
The standard male - sized shirts AND kids ' shirts !
Really now -- if you 're spending money to make kids ' shirts for a conference where there might be ONE kid in attendance and maybe a handful of parents who'll buy them as souvenirs , would n't that money be better spent on providing WOMEN something good to wear ?
These T - shirts were n't even free -- you had to buy them .
Argh !
So , I did what I 've previously done in these situations ...
I bought the largest kid-sized T - shirt they had .
Unfortunately , the neck was so tight that I could barely breathe , but at least it was something that looked halfway decent .

I think this is the shirt you 're looking for .
Plus , I hear they 'll be handing out these at the next RailsConf .

You are right on , Kathy .
A generic sized shirt is ok but something just a little step above is so much better - as long as the folks creating the shirt keep as many different types of people in mind , as possible .
The tiny elexa tshirts at blogher were horrid and fit almost nobody in attendance but the more generic sized style - feeder shirts were excellent because they were more fitted than a normal fits all shirt AND they had v-necks .
Posted by : Denise | Dec 16 , 2006 6:30:57 AM
As long as everybody 's getting a shirt that fits her or him , let me put in a word for another segment of the population :
In case you have n't noticed , a lot of IT people are ... er , " big . "
I am not only " big " but " tall . "
This leads me to two gripes :
1 ) Most XXL short - sleeve shirts fit pretty well , but believe it or not , I find shows often run out of them .
This is especially galling if the show asked for my t- shirt size on the registration form ( which , really , every show should if they 're handing out shirts . )
2 ) There 's no way to say this and not make it sound like a flame , so I 'm just going to say it :
Those American Apparel shirts everybody likes now suck if you 're not dangerously skinny .
They make one feel like a sausage .
Giving me one of these is a good way to guarantee I wo n't wear it .
Actually , the most comfortable t- shirts I 've worn over the years come from , believe it or not , naturist ( nudist ) conventions .
Why ?
Well , since they do n't like wearing clothes at all , they make the stuff they actually do wear as comfortable as possible .
Somewhat like programmers scratching their own itches in writing code , no ?
Posted by : Mark | Dec 16 , 2006 7:45:17 AM
Oh Kathy -- Certainly nobody could be said to be more in favor of breasts than I .
The problem is that if you try to produce a flattering shirt you will almost certainly fail for 90 % of the women at the conference .
Each year I produce between 1500 and 2100 shirts on behalf of a dozen or so sponsors .
We give the shirts away at the Lotusphere event in Orlando .
We buy regular sizes and shapes - nothing contoured or curve hugging because frankly it raises the cost too high and would force me to consider what an appropriate amount of sexiness in a conference t- shirt is .
I have a wife and three daughters , yet womens ' sizes remain a complete and utter mystery to me .
Perhaps if you created a " Head First Womens ' Clothing Sizes " book it might help .
Here 's how I handle sizes :
I have all the shirts bagged in lots of 30 .
Each bag of 30 contains 4 Small , 5 Medium , 9 Large , 10 Extra Large , and 2 Extra Extra Large .
Each sponsor gets 4 bags .
We also give each sponsor a bag of high quality rubber bands with enough of each color that they can roll the shirts and wrap the small with red , medium with orange , large with yellow , xl with green , and xxl with blue .
The order matches the colors in the rainbow .
That allows a sponsor to reach down and grab a shirt knowing what size he or she is handing out without wasting time looking at the label .
I also order 5 shirts in the 4 x or 5 x size .
There are a few people at the show who need these and can see me directly ( sponsors are aware of them ) .
These people ( all men , so far as I know ) are enormously grateful as are the ( mostly women ) who get the small and medium shirts .
These are not cheap shirts to make - we buy good quality shirts and do 4 color screening on both front and back as well as both sleeves .
I can tell you then , that there is no additional cost to vary the sizes except for the 4 x and 5 x ones which cost an extra dollar each .
I 've gone on with way too much detail to make the simple point that there is no valid reason not to vary the sizes at a conference according to an easily figured out demographic distribution of sizes .

I should add one more comment about sizes .
Sizes are n't the same .
Aside from being a geek programmer type , I 'm also a firefighter .
In any other venue , for any other product , I wear XL .
I 'm a 5 ' 9 " 200 # man with a 48 " jacket size and 34 " waist .
That 's XL pretty much all the way around .
In firefighter gear -- gloves , turnout coat , etc..
I 'm a Medium .
These are big boys .
Even my size 13 shoes are right in the middle of the road when it comes to fire boots .

Well , I say " T - shirts are underwear . "
This is one of my pet peeves .
What 's with the T - shirt culture ?
Pseudo - egalitarian dress at best .

Damn !
That shirt looks good on you !
Another bonus is that if all the women look that great at conferences , more men will want to show up !
I 'm not saying , I 'm just saying ...

Kathy , I so feel this .
I have n't gotten a tee that fits from any company these past 10 years of being in the ' net space .
The closest I came was when I was at ELNK back in 2000 - I was able to get a mens medium .
I can't even think of the last time I wore a branded tee .
I now ask : do you have a baseball hat ?
You would think that companies would understand that I 'll only wear it and provide you with free branding if you make me look good .
Great post .

Completely agree as a small female geek myself .
Fitted
Ts are not hard to make , as Jinx sells quite alot of them ( I have more than a dozen myself from Jinx ) .
They 're called baby Ts and women look darn good in them .
For a $ 2 K conf fee , I 'd think making a shirt that can fit , say women , would be worth the extra effort .

Having been in charge of schwag for corporate events , I can say with resignation that you can make EVERY effort - men 's shirts , women 's shirts , t- shirts , dressier shirts , asking sizes , providing approximate measurements ... and you will still get people who will bitch .
Ordered the wrong size , delusional about the size they think they are and ending up with a shirt that does n't fit , women who decide they want a men's shirt , do n't like the colour / style / logo , and people who simply do not fit on the available spectrum ( sorry , within the limitations of our suppliers , 3 - 4X is often the best we can do ...)
Speaking as a woman who does NOT fit a small or x - small shirt ( which is the majority of us ) , and who has been burned trying to buy women 's American Apparel ( which is made for dolls , though , oddly , the unisex is well within the normal clothing size spectrum ) , while making an effort to provide women 's shirts is nice , much like you 're often out of luck looking for a men's small , you 're also out of luck looking for a women 's XL or larger .
Having breasts and acknowledging that is one thing , having someone 's logo stretched obscenely across them so people become apparently incapable of looking me in the eye is something else .

Wellesley College senior Hadley Smith began the night of April 12 with her hands full of rainbow - colored chalk and ended it in the town police station .
As part of the Wellesley College Peace Coalition , Smith , 22 , and other students spent the early evening scrawling onto the town center 's sidewalks peace signs and quotations from Mohandas K. Gandhi .
Someone followed them back to their dormitory , copied down the license plate number of the car Smith was driving , and contacted Wellesley police , according to the police report .
That led to an evening in jail for Smith and her fellow students , an experience that has led to misgivings on the campus of 2,300 students about the way police handled the incident .
A spokesman for Wellesley police said the students were not mistreated .
Smith , a senior history major , said she was back in her dormitory room the night of April 12 when she got a call on her cellphone about the chalk from a detective on the town police force .
'' He said I better get back there and that the faster I did that , the better off we would be , " Smith said .
Smith , of Rochester , N.H. , along with students Justine Parker , 21 , of Chicago , and Kate Recchia , 20 , of New Haven , returned to the town center , where they were met by Detective Peter McLaughlin .
According to Smith , McLaughlin gave the women a choice between arrest and cleaning up the chalk .
Smith says when they asked for clarification of their offense ''he said it was not up for discussion .
We told him , ' We 're going to clean it , but we 're trying to understand why we'd be arrested . '
And he was like , ' Nope , you 've lost your chance . ' "
McLaughlin did not return phone calls .
But Marie Cleary , public information officer for the Wellesley police , said the women were informed by police why their actions were illegal .
They were charged with '' defacement and tagging public property . "
'' I 'm not sure which of the young women disagreed and began to debate the issue , " said Cleary .
'' But at that point , the officer determined that he would place them in custody . "
The next morning , after several hours in a holding cell before being released on $ 40 bail -- a friend bailed them out -- the three women were arraigned in Dedham District Court .
In exchange for three months probation , 12 hours of community service , and a $ 63 fine , all three will have their records expunged .
Parker , a junior who is president of the campus Peace Coalition , said word of the students ' encounter with police traveled fast .
Soon after , college officials held an open meeting for students and faculty to discuss the incident .
Janis Vogel , 21 , a Wellesley senior who said she was troubled by the arrest , estimated that about 30 students and professors attended .
'' That 's big for the kind of crowd you usually get at Wellesley , " she said .
'' A lot of professors expressed their concern . "
With a month to go until she graduates , Smith said the incident was an intimidating introduction to a criminal justice system she had previously experienced only through books .
Smith said that students are able to write messages in chalk on their campus and that she did n't think their sidewalk writing was against the law .
She says she now understands that chalking is illegal .
Parker said college administrators suggested that students start up a dialogue with local police , but she has not followed up on the idea and has encouraged angry students to put their energies toward peace activism instead .
'' Our encounter with them demonstrated that they 're not interested in dialogue , " she said .
'' I 'm not giving up on them , but it was a very intimidating experience . "

Even if in past years everyone has associated strenuous regular exercise with a healthy life and , implicitly , better looks , it seems that too much high - intensity physical activity can become harmful for an individual and even shorten his / her lifespan .
Could the myth of ' the more you exercise , the healthier and fit you become ' be destroyed ?
With so many adepts of the myth , who have made a second religion out of going to the gym and training strenuously almost every day ?
it would be difficult to make the population worldwide become aware of the fact that too much physical activity can become harmful for one 's health .
Staying active is a must for a healthy life , we all agree on that , but no one should exaggerate with any type of activity , including exercising .
Whether too much exercise is harmful or not for an individual 's general health and wellbeing is a very controversial subject nowadays .
There are scientists who strongly claim that the effects of physical activity can only be beneficial for humans and , on the other hand , there are experts who firmly back up the idea that exaggerated levels of physical activity may lead to health disorders in convinced adepts .
However , people worldwide should not get the wrong idea that sport and moderate exercise is bad for the health .
Physical activity within normal limits is great for our health , keeping us fit and in shape .
Previous studies also showed that physical exercise is also beneficial for the brain , not only for the body .
But we should not become sports fanatics , because this can only bring about negative outcomes .
Balance and equilibrium in one 's life is everything , experts say .
We should also keep to this rule when it comes to physical effort : try exercising moderately , but do not overestimate the benefits of physical activity .
For instance , Professor Greg Whyte , known for having trained David Walliams for his Channel swim , has recently warned that too much physical effort and exercising can do more bad than good for one 's health .
He spoke about the advantages and disadvantages of strenuous exercising at the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences ' ( Bases ) annual conference held at the Wolverhampton University last month .
Besides personal trainer for the famous swimmer , Prof .
Whyte is Director of Science and Research at the English Institute of Sport in Manchester .
Prof .
Whyte 's report was entitled " Exercise :
Is it really good for you ? " and he presented mainly the negative aspects of being an exercise fanatic .
He warned that physical effort taken to extremes can be extremely dangerous for an individual 's health and can eventually lead to severe injuries , conditions and even death .
" I know that I am being extremely contentious by concentrating on the negative consequences of exercise but the research that has been done provides some startling findings .
From club level to elite athletes , there are a lot of incidents to suggest that sport is very dangerous .
You only have to go down to your local A&E to see the place packed out with ' weekend warriors ' who are suffering breaks , joint injuries and trauma injuries to their head and face .
If exercise is taken to extremes by people then exercise can do more harm than good , " concluded Professor Greg Whyte .
On the other hand , a recent study conducted by researchers at the University of California and presented at the American Physiological Society conference held in Virginia Beach last week showed that the famous ' rate - of - living ' theory is completely wrong .
According to the ' rate - of - living ' theory , strenuous and repeated physical activity is not beneficial for and individual because too much exercise may lead to a shorter lifespan of the particular person .
This may happen because every living creature has a certain amount of energy to spend throughout his / her life - and if he spends his energy in daily high - intense trainings at the gym , he will not have enough energy to hit the century .
The study which contradicts the ' rate - of - living ' theory was only carried out on rats so far , but results are relevant and ' strong ' enough to provide evidence for the fact that a living creature has an infinite amount of energy within its / his / her own body .
Theodore Garland Jr. , Biology Professor at the University of California , Riverside who co-authored the report stated : " We 've found further proof , which adds to a growing body of evidence , that the rate - of - living theory is not valid . "
Even if there are different opinions on physical effort and how much people should regularly exercise in order to prevent unwanted effects of being ' too active ' , all medical experts agree on one aspect : moderate physical activity does not harm anyone .
On the contrary , every single individual should go to the gym and train on a regular basis , but moderately .
" The bottom line is that moderate physical activity is good for you but exercise of the kind done by elite sportsmen and women can be detrimental to your health .
There is no doubt that moderate physical exercise can be beneficial and not doing any is detrimental to health " , Prof .
Whyte explained .
In his statement , he also gives some examples of how bad extreme exercising - like the one adopted by elite sportsmen and women - can be for one 's health : " There are cases of elite female athletes who restrict the calories they take , then lose their menstrual function and get low bone density which can have a profound effect on their health .
There are numerous examples of spinal injuries amongst rugby players , as well as data on osteoarthritis and footballers suffering problems from long periods of playing , which can later reduce their quality of life .
Then there are the incidents of sudden deaths associated with cardio - vascular problems and asthma .
The bottom line is that moderate physical activity is good for you but exercise of the kind done by elite sportsmen and women can be detrimental to your health . "
Also , Theodore Garland Jr. , co-lead researcher of the second study on the amount of physical activity one can / should do stated : " Aside from any possible benefits for lifespan , exercise in moderation has been shown to have many positive effects , including on health span , immune function , heart disease and mental health .

カエル・ツボカビ症の特徴
世界各地でカエルなどの両生類に壊滅的な打撃を与えてきたカエル・ツボカビ症が、日本でも見つかった。アジアでは初の確認だ。人間などには感染しないが、野外に広がると根絶できず、生態系に深刻な影響を及ぼす恐れがある。日本野生動物医学会、日本爬虫（はちゅう）両棲（りょうせい）類学会、世界自然保護基金（ＷＷＦ）ジャパンなどは１２日に、検疫の強化や販売・流通の監視などを訴える緊急事態宣言を共同で出した。
ツボカビ症が見つかったのは、東京都内で個人がペットとして飼っていた中南米産のカエル。昨年１１〜１２月に、１１種３５匹中１４匹が次々と死んだ。麻布大学での検査で、１２月２５日にツボカビ症と確認された。１０月末に購入したカエルから感染した可能性が高い。今年に入り、関東地方のペット小売店でも中南米産のカエルが陽性と分かった。
ツボカビ症は、９０年代に豪州でカエルの激減を招いた病気として、９８年に初めて報告された。以後、米国や中南米、アフリカ、欧州などで相次いで流行が確認された。食物連鎖を通じて、確実に生態系に打撃を与えていると考えられている。
中米パナマでは両生類４８種が感染し、個体数が９割減った。９５年に侵入し年平均２８キロの速さで西から東に広がったことが後の調査で分かった。２カ月で野生のカエルが絶滅した地域もあり、二十数種のカエルを動物園などで保護する「両生類箱船計画」が始まった。
ツボカビは水の中で数週間生き続け、野外へ広がってしまうと根絶は不可能だ。渓流が多い日本では繁殖しやすいとも指摘される。また、ペット飼育で感染が広がる可能性も高く、関係者は危機感を強めている。
関係学会など１６団体の緊急事態宣言は「死んだカエルを飼育していた水を、野外に排水することは禁物」と訴え、輸入・販売業者にも「カエルが感染していないことを確認してほしい」と呼び掛ける。
宇根有美・麻布大助教授（獣医学）は「飼っているカエルに少しでも異状を感じたら、獣医師に相談してほしい。消毒法や治療法があり、人にはうつらない。飼育を放棄して、屋外に放すことだけはしないで」と言う。
Encouraging Japan to build nuclear weapons , shipping food aid via submarines , and running secret sabotage operations inside North Korea ’s borders are among a raft of policy prescriptions pushed by prominent U.S. neoconservatives in the wake of Pyongyang ’s nuclear test .
Writing in publications from National Review online ( NRO ) to the New York Times , neoconservatives claim , contrary to the lessons drawn by “ realist ” and other critics of the George W. Bush administration , that Monday ’s test vindicates their long - held view that negotiations with “ rogue ” states like North Korea are useless and that “ regime change ”  by military means , if necessary  is the only answer .
“ With our intelligence on North Korea so uneven , the doctrine of preemption must return to the fore , ” wrote Dan Blumenthal , an Asia specialist at the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) who worked for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld during Bush ’s first term , at NRO Tuesday .
“ Any talk of renewed six - party talks [ involving China , Japan , Russia , the U.S. , and the two Koreas ] must be resisted . ”
The North Korean test “ has stripped any plausibility to arguments that engaging dictators works , ” according to Michael Rubin , a Middle East specialist at AEI , who added that the Bush administration now faces a “ watershed ” in its relations with other states that have defied Washington in recent years .
“ This crisis is not just about North Korea , but about Iran , Syria , Venezuela , and Cuba as well , ” according to Rubin .
“ Bush now has two choices : to respond forcefully and show that defiance has consequence , or affirm that defiance pays and that international will is illusionary . ”
“ [ He ] must now choose whether his legacy will be one of inaction or leadership , Chamberlain or Churchill , ” he added in a reference to the pre-World War II debate between the “ appeasement ” of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the war policy of his successor , Winston Churchill .
The neoconservatives , whose influence on the Bush administration has generally been on the wane since late 2003 when it became clear that the Iraq war that they had done so much to champion was going badly , nonetheless retain some clout , particularly through the offices of Vice President Dick Cheney and Pentagon chief Rumsfeld .
They are opposed by the “ realists ” who are concentrated in the State Department and also include former secretary of state Colin Powell ; his chief deputy , Richard Armitage ; and a number of top national security officials in the administration of former President George H.W. Bush , such as former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft , and former secretary of state James Baker , who just last weekend publicly called for Washington to directly engage its “ enemies , ” including North Korea , Syria , and Iran .
That stance is anathema to the neoconservatives and their right - wing allies , such as Cheney , who , at one national security council meeting on North Korea several years ago , was reported to have said , “ We do n’t negotiate with evil ; we defeat it . ”
The neoconservatives ’ main area of concern has historically been the Middle East  indeed , their central focus in recent months has been publicizing the threats to the U.S. and Israel allegedly posed by Iran and Hezbollah and opposing any realist appeals to engage Tehran and Damascus in direct talks .
But they have also been warning for some time against “ the appeasement ” of North Korea and its chief source of material aid and support , China .
In their view , Beijing has always had the power to force Pyongyang to give up its nuclear arms programs , and the fact that it has not done so demonstrates that China sees itself as a “ strategic rival ” of Washington , a phrase much favored by administration hawks during Bush ’s first year in office .
Indeed , in the most prominent neoconservative reaction to the North Korean test to date , former Bush speechwriter David Frum called in a column published by the New York Times for the administration to take a series of measures designed to “ punish China ” for its failure to bring Pyongyang to heel .
Among them , Frum , who is also based at AEI and is sometimes credited with inventing the phrase “ axis of evil , ” in which North Korea , Iran , and Iraq were lumped together , for Bush ’s 2002 State of the Union address , urged the administration to cut off all humanitarian aid to North Korea , pressure South Korea to do the same , and thus force China to “ shoulder the cost of helping to avert ” North Korea ’s economic collapse .
Frum , who is also based at AEI , urged that Japan , South Korea , Australia , New Zealand , and Singapore to be invited to join NATO and that Taiwan , which China regards as a renegade province , to send observers to NATO meetings .
Frum , who in 2003 co-authored An End to Evil with former Defense Policy Board chairman Richard Perle , also suggested that Washington “ encourage Japan to renounce the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and create its own nuclear deterrent . ”
“ A nuclear Japan is the thing China and North Korea dread most ( after , perhaps , a nuclear South Korea or Taiwan ) , ” he asserted .
“ Not only would the nuclearization of Japan be a punishment of China and North Korea , ” he wrote , “ but it would also go far to meet our goal of dissuading Iran [ from trying to obtain a nuclear weapons ] .
The analogue for Iran , of course , would be the threat of American aid to improve Israel ’s capacity to hit targets with nuclear weapons , ” according to Frum .
Other neoconservatives echoed Blumenthal ’s position that the Six - Party Talks should be abandoned and called for the administration to resist any further appeals for bilateral talks between Washington and Pyongyang  repeatedly made by China , South Korea , and Russia , as well as by realists in the U.S. , over the past several years .
“ There will be renewed calls for bilateral talks between Washington and Pyongyang .
That would be a mistake . ” according to the lead editorial in the neoconservative Wall Street Journal , which also urged the U.S. to “ make clear that a military response is not off the table . ”
Other commentators called for strong efforts to achieve regime change .
James Robbins , senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council , called for covert action , including “ sabotage , espionage , information operations , subversion , deception  the works .
A highly paranoid totalitarian regime like Kim [ Jong - Il ’s ] will be highly susceptible to these methods , ” he predicted .
At the same time , former House Speaker and DPB member Newt Gingrich , who is also based at AEI , said he favored continuing shipments of U.S. food aid but through a covert delivery system “ consciously designed to undermine the dictatorship . ”
“ Food might be parachuted into the country , delivered from submarines and small boats by clandestine services , shipped in from China and Russia through anti-regime middlemen , and delivered in every way possible to divert energy and authority away from the government and toward an alternative organizing system of individuals dedicated to a better , more prosperous life , ” he wrote .
Like his fellow neoconservatives , Frank Gaffney , the president of the Center for Security Policy , called for accelerated development and deployment of Washington ’s embryonic but extraordinarily costly missile - defense system , including a ship - launched system that can shoot down ballistic missiles of various ranges “ whether launched from places like North Korea or from tramp steamers off our coasts . ”
He also urged Washington to resume periodic underground nuclear tests of its own , ending a moratorium on such testing announced by former President George H.W. Bush in 1992 .

“ Based on my understanding of the connections and equipment at issue , it appears the NSA ( National Security Agency ) is capable of conducting what amounts to vacuum - cleaner surveillance of all the data crossing the Internet , ” Klein said .
“ This potential spying appears to be applied wholesale to all sorts of Internet communications of countless citizens . ”
In 2003 , the National Security Agency set up a secret room inside the phone company ’s San Francisco office building that was not accessible to AT&T ; technicians , Klein said .
The former employee ’s statement , as well as several documents saved by him after he left the company in 2004 , shows further evidence of domestic spying initiatives by the federal government .
Klein ’s statement is being incorporated into a class action filed in San Francisco federal court , in which lawyers with the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins , and Traber & Voorhees in Pasadena claim that AT&T ; illegally allowed the NSA taps .
“ Despite what we are hearing , and considering the public track record of this administration , I simply do not believe their claims that the NSA ’s spying program is really limited to foreign communications or is otherwise consistent with the NSA ’s charter or with FISA [ the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ] , ” Klein said .
News that the NSA was working with major telecommunications companies first surfaced shortly before Christmas .
The Bush administration has acknowledged the existence of a domestic spying program , but claims the executive order was limited to those individuals with known terrorist ties .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a class- action lawsuit against AT&T ; on January 31 , 2006 , accusing the telecom giant of violating the law and the privacy of its customers by collaborating with the National Security Agency in its massive program to wiretap and data - mine Americans ’ communications .
“ The evidence that we are filing supports our claim that AT&T ; is diverting Internet traffic into the hands of the NSA wholesale , in violation of federal wiretapping laws and the Fourth Amendment , ” EFF Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston said in a statement .
On Wednesday , the EFF asked the court to issue an injunction prohibiting AT&T ; from continuing the alleged wiretapping , and filed a number of documents under seal , including three AT&T ; documents that purportedly explain how the wiretapping system works .
After asking for a preview copy of the documents last week , the government did not object to the EFF filing the paper under seal , although the EFF asked the court Wednesday to make the documents public .
One of the documents is titled “ Study Group 3 , LGX / Splitter Wiring , San Francisco , ” and is dated 2002 .
The others are allegedly a design document instructing technicians how to wire up the taps , and a document that lists the equipment installed in the secret room .
The list includes a Narus STA 6400 , which is a semantic traffic analyzer .
The Narus STA technology is known to be used particularly by government intelligence agencies because of its ability to sift through large amounts of data looking for preprogrammed targets .
In a letter to the EFF , AT&T ; objected to the filing of the documents , arguing that they contain sensitive trade secrets , Wired magazine reports .
According to court rules , AT&T ; has until Thursday to file a motion to keep the documents sealed .
The government could also step in to the case and request that the documents not be made public , or even that the entire lawsuit be barred under the seldom - used State Secrets Privilege , says Wired .
AT&T ; Corp. ( which was recently acquired by the new AT&T ; , Inc , . formerly known as SBC Communications ) maintains domestic telecommunications facilities over which millions of Americans ’ telephone and Internet communications pass every day .
It also manages some of the largest databases in the world , containing records of most or all communications made through its myriad telecommunications services .
Q . Are the terrorists trying to influence our election in your view ?
THE VICE PRESIDENT : I think they 're very much aware of our political calendar here , I really do .
. . .
So I think they are very conscious of the electoral timetable in the United States .
I can't say that they make a specific decision for a particular act , but there 's no doubt in my mind that it's a factor that enters into their thinking .
Q I have a Pentagon source that tells me there are websites out there that they 've just recently translated that actually refer to the election and ask for an up - tick in violence to try and influence the election , is that accurate ?
THE VICE PRESIDENT : I would n't be surprised .
It sounds right to me .
Senior U.S. government officials and military officers have suggested that Iraqi insurgents are trying to influence the U.S. midterm elections .
A U.S. military spokesman in Iraq last week attributed the increase in violence at least partly to terrorists who want to influence the American vote .
His comments Thursday echoed those made by U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney two days earlier on conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh 's radio show , which is carried on the Armed Force Radio network in Iraq .
There ’s certainly a stepped up level of violence , and we ’re heading into an election .
Here they are , getting up every day saying , “ We ’ve got an election in two weeks in America , gang , and we want to change horses over there because we do n’t like the folks we ’re having to deal with now ; they ’re a little tough on us .
So let ’s get out there and let ’s make some noise . “
I do n't think there is any doubt about the fact that the terrorists , world - wide , were hoping for a Democratic victory .
See , for example , this article by Aaron Klein .
And the spike in violence in Iraq prior to the election was generally understood as an effort by the terrorists to help Democratic candidates .
In the deadliest sectarian attack in Baghdad since the American - led invasion , explosions from five powerful car bombs and a mortar shell tore through crowded intersections and marketplaces in the teeming Shiite district of Sadr City on Thursday afternoon , killing at least 144 people and wounding 206 , the police said .
. . . The attacks were the worst in an intensifying series of revenge killings in recent months , in a cycle that has increasingly paralyzed the political process and segregated the capital into Sunni and Shiite enclaves , and threatened to drag Iraq into an all - out civil war .
Yesterday was no different : About 100 people were killed in the country .
Among them was a bodyguard to the speaker of Iraq 's parliament , Mahmoud al - Mashhadani , who himself escaped an apparent assassination attempt the day before .
A journalist for the state - run al - Sabah newspaper was also killed , gunned down as he drove through the capital .
More than 1,000 Iraqis a day are being displaced by the sectarian violence that began on Feb. 22 with the bombing of the Shiite Askariya shrine in Samarra , according to a report released this week by the Geneva - based International Organization for Migration , a U.N. - associated group .
This increasing movement of Iraqi families , caused by the lack of security and by the growth of armed local militias and criminal gangs , is adding to the already chaotic governmental situation in Baghdad , according to U.N. , U.S. and non-governmental reports released over the past weeks .
UPDATE
So , to recap
Everything they accuse others of doing -- exploiting national security for domestic political gain , being ' unserious ' about war matters , playing games with the mission of the troops -- is what they do as transparently as possible .
And note how they used a senior military official to make the disgusting claim that the violence in Iraq was related to a desire to help Democrats win the midterm election : " A U.S. military spokesman in Iraq last week attributed the increase in violence at least partly to terrorists who want to influence the American vote .
"
The idea that the sectarian violence in Iraq , which has been spiraling out of control since the beginning of the year , had anything to do with trying to make Democrats win the election was always as transparently false -- stupid even -- as it was repugnant .
Yet they say anything , and the media largely lets them get away with it .
And now the incontrovertible proof is here that what they said was a lie designed to manipulate Americans into voting Republican out of a desire to punish the Democrat - favoring terrorists in Iraq , and what are the consequences ?
They lie and manipulate like this not only because they lack any shred of integrity and character -- although that 's true -- but also because they know they can do so with impunity .
Ponder how corrupt and misleading their coordinated pre-election claim was :
All the increased violence in Iraq was just about the midterm election , not a sign of a spiraling civil war .
It was just The Terrorists who hate Bush , because he is so tough with them , trying to help the Democrats .
Nothing was really that bad in Iraq .
Once the elections are over , it will all subside , because it 's only about that .
The only thing worse than government leaders lying to their citizens so blatantly about a war is lying in order to benefit themselves politically for cheap electoral gain , so that 's exactly what Bush officials and Bush followers do . : Nobody glorifies the power of the Islamic Terrorists more than Bush followers do .
As The Heretik says in comments : " What 's so impressive about the terrorists and the insurgents and the Shiites and the Sunnis who yearn so for the inevitable caliphate that will stretch from Spain to Pluto and beyond is that even as they fight amongst themselves , they have time to sit down and figure out how to influence our politics here .
" And he says over at his own blog : " Our midterm elections are over and the violence that was raised to influence those results has spiked even higher " ( The Heretik also has an extremely satisfying illustration of what Pat Leahy is doing to the White House ) .
And as James Raven notes , some Bush followers are blaming Nancy Pelosi for this increased violence ( because her desire to withdraw from Iraq is galvanizing The Terrorists ) . : when insurgents engage in violence before the elections , that 's the fault of Democrats because it 's done to help them win ( and credit to Republicans because it shows how tough they are on The Terrorists ) .
When the insurgents engage in violence after the elections , that 's also the fault of Democrats because they are excited by the Democrats ' success ( and credit to Republicans because Republicans want to stay forever , which makes the insurgents sad and listless ) .
And when there is no violence , all credit to Republicans because it shows how great their war plan is .
Put another way , no matter what happens in Iraq ( violence increases , violence decreases ) , and no matter when it happens ( before the election , after the election ) , it is the fault of Democrats and it reflects well on the Republicans .
Is n't it fair to say that that 's the very definition of the mindset of a cultist ?

Chicago , IL - A group of bored students in Chicago overclocked Jesus so that he now performs miracles nearly twice as fast as before .
Goran Radovich and Trey Gafney managed to overclock Jesus and keep him stable at a record 3.69 GHz .
" We were just sitting around the other day and Goran says ' Hey , do n't you have a spare Jesus around here ?
Let 's see if we can overclock him ' , " said Gafney , " So we got out the Jesus and cranked up the clock .
He started sweating pretty profusely at about 2.5 GHz so we went out and got the hose and started spraying him down . "
The boys then fitted Jesus with some spare heatsinks they had and tried for the Jesus overclocking record .
" When we got him up to about 3.75 GHz that was when we started having some problems like that hole in Tommy 's abdomen and the sudden change of seasons , " said Radovich .
" After that we clocked him down and he was stable most of the time at 3.69 GHz . "
" We had all the bread and fish and wine that we ever needed , " continued Radovich , " and we both had straight A's so we took him down to the hospital to do some more miracles there .
We turned him on and his arms were flying around and deaf people could hear , the crippled could walk .
Of course , a couple of times he got going too fast and a couple of blind guys got an extra eye . "
Donna Samson was one of the cured , " Jesus came walking down the hall and he looked like he had drank about 10 cups of coffee .
He laid his hands on me and said my cancer was cured .
It was and as a bonus I got this extra leg too ! "
The young men explained that they expect to get Jesus saving people even faster when they figure out how to safely immerse him in liquid nitrogen .
Gafney and Radovich broke the previous record of 3.43 GHz set by a group in Norway last month .

1/26(水) 放送のトリビアの泉で、「トリビアの種」がなかなか興味深い内容だった。いろいろと
考えることがあったので、忘れないうちにメモ。
… … … …
■種
「 ファミリーレストランの呼び出しベルは、どれくらいの距離まで店員さんを呼べる？」
（呼び出しベルで一番普及しているのがベルスターという商品だそうで、無線（電波）でボタンが
押されたことを店に通知する。この電波が、どの距離まで届くのかを調べようという趣旨）
■結論
「ファミリーレストランの呼び出しベルを外に持ち出した時、117mまで店員さんを呼べる 」 九分咲き
… … … …
番組での調査のやり方はこうだ。
まず店外にテーブル席を設け、そこで呼び出しボタンを押す。店員が注文を受けに来るようであれば
電波が届いていると判断し、テーブルをファミレスからさらに5m離して同じ手順で試行する。
0 m 5 m 10 m … 115 m 120 m ← 調査ポイン ト
┃ ┃ ┃ … ┃ ┃
↑ ↑ ↑ … ↑ ↑
(1) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 24 ) ( 25 ) ← 試行回 数
OK OK OK OK * NG !* ← 試行結果
0 m , 5 m , 10 m , ... 115 m ( OK ) , 120m (*NG !*)
120mで電波が届かないと判明するまでに試行回数は25回。
正確なポイントを突き止めるため、ここから調査ポイントを1m刻みで減らしていく。
115 m 116 m 117 m 118 m 119 m 120m
┃ │ │ │ │ ┃
↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑
( 24 ) ( 28 ) ( 27 ) ( 26 ) ( 25 )
OK *OK !* NG NG NG
119 m ( NG ) , 118 m ( NG ) , 117m ( * OK !*) ときて、結 論「 117mまで届く」となるまでに28回試行している。
# 事前のタモリの予想 は「30mくらいではないか」。私も100m以上届くことにびっくりした。
# ベルスターの性能としては、もともと120mくらいまで到達するらしい。
試行回数が多く、終盤は、店員さんが来ても注文するものが紅茶ばかりになっていた。(笑)
店員さんも大変だし、ボタンを押す担当の外人さんもずっと店外で寒そうだった。番組的には
面白いのでこのやり方でOKだが、より試行回数を減らしたい場合はどうすればよいだろう。
… … … …
「 電波が届くかどうかは、距離の大小によってのみ決定する」という理想的な条件で実験が
行われたとすると、これはソートされたデータ列から目的のデータを探す問題に等しい。
「 ある地点で電波が届く」かどうかは、「あるポイントのデータが目的のデータより小さい」
かどうか、ということに置き換えできる。
これが、ある決まった区間内で電波が届くかどうかのポイントを見つける問題であれば、
二分探索でよい。n個の区間から二分探索するときの計算量（試行量？）は
O( log 2 n ) という
オーダーになる。具体的には、log 2 n +1回の試行で十分だ。例えば、100mの区間から1mの精度で
ポイントを探すなら、log 2 ( 100 ) =6.6なので、最悪でも7回の試行で目的のポイントを見つけられる。
しかし、今回のトリビアの種では、どこまで電波が届くのか全く不明という前提で実験していた。
この場合は、単純な二分探索ではできない。
そこで、二分探索を拡張してみる。探索範囲を大まかに調べる第1段階と、正確な場所を割り出す
第2段階に分ける。第1段階では、調べる範囲を倍々に増やしていく。あるところで範囲が確定する
ので、そこからは通常の二分探索に切り替える。
実際にトリビアと同じ条件でやってみよう。（簡単にするために、1mからスタートとする）
1m( OK ) , 2 m ( OK ) , 4 m ( OK ) ... 64 m( OK ) , 128m (* NG !*) となるので、8回目で「128mで電波が届かない」
ということが分かる。ここからは普通の二分探索に切り替えるが、探索範囲は全体の半分の65～127m
なので、最悪でも6回の試行で見つかる。つまり、今回の場合はトータルで14回以下の試行で117m
というポイントを見つけられるということで、番組のやり方の半分ちょっとの試行回数で済む。
トリビアの種で行っていた「 一定間隔」刻みだと、距離に比例して試行回数が増える。もし電波の
到達距離が2倍であれば、試行回数も2倍になる。
ここで挙げた拡張二分探索の場合は、距離が2倍になっても試行回数は2回増えるだけで済む。
この場合の計算量 (? ) としてはやはり O ( log 2 n ) のオーダーで、具体的な試行回数にすると
最悪でも log 2 n * 2 +1 回となる 。
なんとエキサイティングなアルゴリズムでしょう！
**素晴らしい！**

似たような遊びで、数当てゲームがある。
相手に、1～1000までの数で1つ思い浮かべてもらう。こちらが言った数に対し、思い浮かべた数が
大きいか小さいかを答えてもらい、ある回数以内で当てるというものだ。
トリビアの種は、この数当てゲームで範囲制限なし、自然数全体に広がったケースと思えばよい。
アラビア数字として紙に書き出せるようなサイズの数であれば、拡張二分探索なら現実的な時間で
正解を見つけ出せる 。
相手が思いついた数が、既知の最大のメルセンヌ素数だったとしても、拡張二分検索なら試行回数は
1億回に満たない。人間にはムリだろうが、コンピュータならどうにか回答にたどり着けるだろう。
# 二分検索で1億回の試行を要求するメルセンヌ素数の巨大さも、ある意味すさまじいのだが。
… … … …
ところで、せっかく思いついたこの拡張二分探索、どこかに応用できる分野はありませんかね。
純粋数学ならともかく、アルゴリズムで応用分野がないと、ホントにtrivia（ムダ知識）で
終わってしまうんですが。
Story Highlights • Sen. Barack Obama says he will create a presidential exploratory committee
• Illinois Democrat says final decision to run in 2008 will be made by February 10
• The first - term lawmaker was elected to the Senate in 2004
• Exploratory committees allow candidates to accept political donations legally
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. Sen. Barack Obama said Tuesday he is taking a first step toward running for president next year .
" I will be filing papers today to create a presidential exploratory committee , " the Illinois Democrat said , adding that he will announce his final decision February 10 from his hometown of Chicago .
He made the announcement in a video posted on his Web site -- www.barackobama.com .
" The decisions that have been made in Washington over the past six years and the problems that have been ignored have put our country in a precarious place , " he said in the video .
In addition to citing " the tragic and costly war that should never have been waged , " Obama mentioned health care , pensions , college tuition and " our continued dependence on oil " as issues that need work .
But he said it is the " smallness of our politics " that most bothers him .
( Watch Obama try to turn a potential negative into a positive )
" Today , our leaders in Washington seem incapable of working together in a practical , common - sense way .
Politics has become so bitter and partisan and gummed up by money and influence that we can't tackle the big problems that demand solutions , and that 's what we have to change . "
Obama said his final decision will be made based on what he learns over the next several weeks as he travels the country " listening and learning about the challenges we face as a nation . "
However , Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said that the senator will not travel to the first four states on the Democrats ' nomination calendar -- Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada or South Carolina -- before his announcement next month .
The Federal Election Commission confirmed that it received Obama 's paperwork .
Forming an exploratory committee is an initial -- but not a required step -- in running for president or any federal office .
Such committees allow potential candidates to begin quietly raising funds and " testing the waters " on whether they should run for office .
Funds raised in exploratory committees only need to be disclosed if potential candidates decide to run for office , at which point they must go back and disclose any " exploratory " money raised thus far .
If Obama runs , he will join an already crowded field of candidates who either have declared their intentions to seek the 2008 Democratic nomination or who are widely expected to run .
Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York is the perceived front - runner , but she has not officially declared her candidacy .
Former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina , the party 's 2004 vice presidential nominee , declared his candidacy late last year , as did Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio , a liberal critic of the war in Iraq , and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack .
Sens .
Joe Biden of Delaware and Chris Dodd of Connecticut also have said they will seek the nomination .
Other Democrats mentioned as possible candidates include the party 's 2004 presidential candidate , Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts ; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson ; retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark ; and the Rev. Al Sharpton .
According to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted on December 5 - 7 , Obama trailed only Clinton when registered Democrats were asked who their top choice for the party 's presidential nominee would be .
Clinton was the No. 1 pick for 37 percent of the Democrats polled , while Obama was the choice of 15 percent of those surveyed .
Former Vice President Al Gore was the only other potential candidate who enjoyed double - digit numbers , with 14 percent .
Gore has said he does not plan to seek the 2008 nomination .
The poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points .
CNN 's Dana Bash contributed to this report .
Oilseed rape : the modified plants have scorpion and moth genesChinese scientists have inserted scorpion and moth genes into oilseed rape ( canola ) plants to make them poisonous to insects feeding on them .
The researchers say that using two foreign genes at the same time means insect pests will be less likely to develop resistance to the genetically modified ( GM ) plants .
The findings were published online in Plant Cell Report on 19 July .
The researchers tested the GM plants by exposing them to caterpillars of the diamondback moth ( Plutella maculipenis ) .
All of the plants showed some defense against the caterpillars , although the extent of this varied from plant to plant .
The caterpillars , which are major crop pests in parts of Africa , Asia and Latin America , have developed resistance to several available pesticides .
There are also reports they are becoming resistant to ' Bt ' plants , which are genetically modified to produce a toxin that kills insects but is harmless to birds and mammals .
The Chinese team , led by Jingxue Wang of the Agri-Biotechnology Research Centre of Shanxi Province , inserted two genes at once to overcome this problem .
The gene from the Asian scorpion ( Buthus martensii ) produces a poison that specifically affects insect nervous systems , leading to paralysis .
The gene from the tobacco hawkmoth ( Manduca sexta ) produces a chemical that breaks down chitin , a major component of insects ' outer surface and gut lining .
Because it is unlikely that a caterpillar would be able to resist both toxins at once , the researchers say their approach could slow down and minimise the chance of an insect developing resistance to the plants .
They also suggest using their approach in combination with the Bt toxin genes already widely used .
Lead researcher Wang , told SciDev .
Net the team is trying the same combination of genes in GM cotton .
Eric Messens , a professor of plant molecular genetics at Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology at Ghent University , Belgium , warns however that some scorpion toxins previously thought to affect only insects can also affect mammals .
He told SciDev .
Net that detailed studies must be conducted to see whether the toxins produced by the GM plants affect human health .
Another concern about GM oilseed rape is that insects or the wind could carry pollen with foreign genes into non-GM oilseed rape crops or related species .
" Discussions about biosafety should be based on the results of practical case studies and not on worst case scenarios , " says Gerhard Schwarz , a researcher at the Germany - based EpiGene company .
Schwarz and colleagues published a two - year field study of GM oilseed rape online in the European Journal of Agronomy on 21 June .
The team found that genetic contamination of non-GM plants with GM genes could be kept below the 0.9 per cent level required by European food labelling rules , without limiting the distance between the two sets of crops .
" Our results showed that the gene flow by pollen dispersal can be brought under control and does not lead to a biological catastrophe , " Schwarz told SciDev .
Net .
GM crops can therefore co-exist with conventional and organic farming , he added .

Video : Colin Powell claims he was fired by President Bush David Edwards
Published : Sunday October 1 , 2006 Print This Email This Colin Powell claims he was fired by the Bush Administration , according to his official biography , which was excerpted in the Washington Post 's Sunday magazine .
After his termination , Powell and the Bush Administration had used the cover story that Powell resigned of his own accord from his position as Secretary of State .
The following is the relevant text of Powell 's official biography as published in the Washington Post : " The president would like to make a change , " Card said , using a time - honored formulation that avoided the words " resign " or " fire . "
He noted briskly that there had been some discussion of having Powell remain until after Iraqi elections scheduled for the end of January , but that the president had decided to take care of all Cabinet changes sooner rather than later .
Bush wanted Powells resignation letter dated two days hence , on Friday , November 12 , Card said , although the White House expected him to stay at the State Department until his successor was confirmed by the Senate .
After four long years , Powell had anticipated the end of his service and sometimes even longed for it .
He had never directly told the president but thought he had made clear to him during the summer of 2004 that he did not intend to stay into a second term .
There had been public speculation as the election drew near that the president might ask the secretary of state to reenlist , at least temporarily .
Powell was still the most popular member of Bushs team , far more popular with the public than the president himself .
Senior Powell aides were convinced that the secretary anticipated an invitation to stay , and they were equally certain that he intended to accept .
The approaching elections in Iraq , hints of progress in the Israeli - Palestinian peace process and the rumored departure of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , a principal Powell nemesis , made the next six months look like a rare period of promise for diplomacy .
John Harwood of the Wall Street Journal provides analysis of Powell 's admission in the following MSNBC video report .

What is XUL ?
XUL is the user interface description language for the open source browser Mozilla .
The acronym stands for ' ' XML - based User interface Language " , and is pronounced " zool " , to rhyme with '' cool ' ' .
XUL is one component of XPToolkit , Mozilla 's Application Object Model ( AOM ) that can be used for constructing fairly complex network transparent applications .
'' Network transparent ' ' in this case means that the same application can be accessed via a LAN , the Internet , or any other network transport that can speak HTTP .
Why XUL ?
XUL was conceived when the programmers at Netscape realised that supporting three different architectures in many different variants would make code maintenance a nightmare , and slow development of Mozilla to a crawl .
To quote Peter Trudelle , a Netscape manager :
In the beginning , there were 3 front ends ( FE's ) : Mac , Windows , UNIX .
Each took a suite of developers to maintain .
Adding a new feature ( even just a button ) required 3 engineers to waste at least a day ( more often a week ) slaving away until the feature was complete .
This had to change .
And thus XPToolkit was written , and Mozilla 's browser , mail , news and chat applications were then written using XPToolkit .
XPToolkit 's development was one of the main reason 's for the two year delay that ultimately caused Netscape to lose the browser wars .
Now the effort has paid off , however - Mozilla officially compiles and runs on more than seventeen platforms , and has allegedly been built successfully on another ten , including obscure systems like GNU / Hurd , BeOS , and OpenVMS .
How it works
At the end of this writeup is a basic interface for the E2 user search written in XUL , plus instructions for viewing it .
It 's completely static and very basic .
Right now I 'm just going to explain parts of it bit at a time .
As with all XML - based formats , XUL starts with the good ' ole < ?xml version = " 1.0 " ?> .
For the sake of brevity I 'm going to skip things like stylesheets , and focus on the explainable parts .
Thus , the next significant element is the root element :
< window id =" usersearch " title= " Everything User Search " orient= " vertical "
xmlns= " http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul " >
So far so simple .
If there was any associated code , it would refer to the window object by the '' id '' attribute .
The title is the window title .
The '' orient '' attribute defines in what direction the child elements are to be arranged .
For example , if this form consisted of nothing but two buttons , they'd be displayed on top of each other .
If we had orient = " horizontal " , they 'd be side by side .
The ' ' xmlns ' ' attribute sets the default namespace for this document .
'' xmlns ' ' stands for ' ' XML NameSpace ' ' .
You can see a similar attribute in the HTML source of standards - compliant web - pages such as http://w3.org.
Their equivalent runs as follows :
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " >
It tells XML parsers what type of XML it 's processing , what version it is , etc .
In the above example , it tells the parser that it 's parsing the XHTML .
It 's basically a unique identifier .
For a more coherent explanation , see spiregrain 's writeup in namespace .
The attribute value in the < window > element above is a play on the line from GhostBusters , '' there is no Dana , only Zuul . ''
In Mozilla , there is no data , only XUL .
Those wacky developers .
Like in Swing , layout is not literal - you can leave the positioning of buttons and other widgets to Mozilla .
You can do per -pixel positioning if you wish , but there 's rarely a need for it .
The various < hbox > and < vbox > elements set the layout mode for their child elements .
This is a simple label - textbox pair :
< label control=" username " value = " User name " / >
< textbox id =" username " value= " anonymous noder " / >
This is the equivalent HTML :
< label for =" username " > User name </ label >
< input name = " username " id =" username " value= " anonymous noder " />
You can see the two are very similar , and this is n't too surprising given that the developers are writing a browser with this stuff .
The input following this one , a < menulist > , is roughly equivalent to a < select > .
However XUL can get considerably more complex than this , as a look at the XML starting with < tree flex = " 1 " ... /> will tell you .
The < tree > component is a general component .
It can do trees , but it also does tables , and hybrid '' treebles ' ' .
If you have Mozilla installed , you can see one of these in the top - left quarter of the DOM Inspector .
If you had it installed , it 's at :
( menu ) Tools -->( menu item ) Web Development -->( menu item ) DOM Inspector .
XUL 's native language is ECMAScript v3 , aka JavaScript 1.3 , although XUL libraries are in the works for Python and Java .
Scripts are imported using a < script src= " ... " /> tag just like in web - pages .
XUL can display embedded HTML as well as MathML , and hopefully one day SVG .
XUL has bindings to XML - serialized RDF ( Resource Description Framework ) .
RDF is a data / metadata description language that uses predicate logic .
The bindings between XUL and RDF mean that you can tell an XUL form to populate itself with RDF taken from either a local repository ( i.e. a client 's hard - drive ) or from a web server via HTTP .
Because XUL can be loaded from a web - server via HTTP , this implies that you can write dynamic XUL .
And because web scripting languages such as ASP and JSP work just as well in XML as they do in HTML , you could , technically speaking , serve XUL forms generated on the fly .
Other cool stuff
If written correctly , making your application usable in more than one language is easy , due to ground - up support for localisation packages .
The nightmare often associated with localisation is one of the reasons that a lot of software - such as the Mac version of MS Office - are n't available in Hebrew or Arabic .
Highly nontrivial investment is required for converting an application to display right - to - left and top - to - bottom languages .
In Mozilla , this work has been done once , and all you need to do is provide text in a supported character set of your choice .
Since Mozilla is skinnable , XUL is displayed in whatever skin the user chooses .
Skins in Mozilla are written in a dialect of CSS designed for adjusting the look and feel of widgets , as opposed to that of HTML .
XUL forms can bring along their own CSS if they want .
Since XUL is a type of XML , you can use XSLT to transform it into other document types , XML - based or otherwise .
This means that you could hypothetically transform XUL into HTML , or generate xforms XML 3 or xDocs InfoPath 4 , UIML , or Sun 's J2EE - related XML - based method for describing Swing interfaces that I 've forgotten the name of .
As you 'd expect from any widget toolkit , things like drag - and - drop , clipboard operations and widget construction 5 are all supported .
Given that XUL is easy to write 1 , and that the whole XPToolkit shebang is probably the most widely ported platform - transparent widget toolkit ever , and that there is support for almost all web - and XML - related protocols , you 'd think that this is exactly what the open source community would use to give Microsoft .NET a sound butt - kicking .
Would that this were so .
... and tripping over the sidewalk .
There are a number of things about XUL that make developing web applications quite a bit harder than it should be .
They 're all fairly trivial , but together they 're a right pain in the ass .
Sorry to get your hopes up with all the above evangelism .
Before I go into all the things that are wrong with XUL at time of writing : I know Mozilla is open source .
And that if it mattered enough to me I would learn C++ and code these features / fixes myself , instead of bitching about them .
But I do n't believe that saying '' get off your butt and fix it yourself ' ' automatically provides you with immunity from criticism .
Mozilla the browser does rock my little cotton socks from tip to top .
That said :
Masks
If you 've ever used an IDE , one of the things you 'll be familiar with is input masks .
Fairly essential to UI development , they can be used to control or filter user input .
Mozilla has no native support for masking .
This means that basic input validation has to take place in imported JavaScript , instead of in the native binary format 2 .
Plumbing
As stated above , XUL has bindings with RDF , i.e. you can automatically populate forms .
However , you cannot automatically construct RDF from an XUL window and ( for example ) POST it to the server from whence it came via HTTP .
This has to be done by constructing RDF using DOM in JavaScript - not the ideal solution , as RDF construction is done better using a higher - level object model representing resources , properties , etc .
In other words , anything other than server --> client communication is annoying , repetitive and leads to unwanted extra code executing client - side .
Ideally more extensive bindings would be added for XML - SOAP that would allow for bidirectional communication .
See below .
Priorities XUL was created to ease the cross-platform development of Mozilla , and it does this admirably .
However , problems with XPToolkit not directly affecting the development of Mozilla itself tend to get put on the backburner .
The caveat here is that the Mozilla developers are few in number , the bugs are legion , and time is money .
And that 's me done whining .
The first two are probably me being lazy , and spoilt rotten with crunchy Java goodness .
Despite these obstacles , building applications using XUL is most certainly possible , and has been done repeatedly - see http://www.mozdev.org/projects.html
If you want to peek under the hood of Mozilla itself , take a jar file with an interesting sounding name from the chrome directory of your Mozilla installation , and extract it to a spare directory .
You can change the extension to ' ' zip ' ' and use Winzip , or use a DOS prompt / CLI and type jar - xvf filename .
jar , assuming you have the JDK installed .
( If anyone spots mistakes , please / msg . )
Footnotes
1 : There are no IDE 's currently available however .
Most people would consider a UI - description language to be incomplete until it can be used to construct it 's own IDE .
Mozilla is n't quite there yet .
2 : I 'm referring to client - side validation here , which would ( hypothetically ) save on communication of bad data to the server , etc .
Server - side validation is absolutely required when dealing with untrusted input ( e.g. input that arrives via the Internet ) , no matter how it 's displayed or entered .
3 : xforms is the W3 C 's attempt to replace HTML forms .
4 : InfoPath is Microsoft 's attempt to obsolete xforms , HTML forms , and PDF forms .
It 's pretty cool .
5 : By widget construction , I 'm referring to building a ' ' navbar ' ' object from already available components .
Building custom widgets is n't possible in XUL as far as I 'm aware .

Now YOU know how it feels :-P
昨日のエントリに関しまして、高市氏の公式サイトの中にある「手をつないでゴールインする徒競争が全国各地の運動会で大流行」という文章に反応をいただきましたので、ちょっとググってみました。
「 徒競走 ゴール 平等 」 や「 徒競走 順位」 などで検索をかけたところ大量に引っかかったのですが、その多くは「らしい 」「そうだ 」
「と聞いた」など、伝聞をもとにしたもので、それらの前後に「うちの学校は違うけど」といった言葉がついているものも多くありました。一方、そういう事実が「ある」という前提で書かれている文章も多くあったのですが、実際に自分が見たとか、具体的な自治体名が挙げられているということはなく、伝聞を鵜呑みにして書かれているのではないかという感は否めませんでした。
では、そういう事実が 「まったく」ないのかというと、そうでもないらしい。
こちらの掲示板では 「こういう説があるが、実際にみた人はいませんか」という質問があり、「地元の幼稚園の運動会で実際にやっている」という回答があります。とはいえ、他の回答はいずれも「リレーの選手を足の速い順に選ばない」といったもので、「手をつないで一斉にゴール」目撃談は上の1件だけでした。
それからこちらのブログのブログ主さんの母校で実際になされていたという話もありました。けれども、ブログ主さんのご卒業後の話のようで、直接に目撃したということではないようです。
こちらのブログのコメント欄では子どもをも持つ親御さんに取材したところ実際にあった、というコメントがあります。
というわけで、実際にないわけではない、が、いわれているほど行われているわけでもない、という感じではないでしょうか。
ではなぜこれほどまことしやかにこの話が広まったのか、なのですが、数年間に読売が記事にしているようです。読売のサイトではもう当該記事を読むことはできないので、こちらのブログで一部の引用を知ることができるだけなのですが、
実は、運動会でリボンなどを与えて順位を明確にする学校は少数派だ。東京都小学校体育連盟の調査（１９９７年）では、都内の小学校の約８割は、運動会で子どもたちの順位をつけないようにしている。ゴール前で手をつないで一緒にテープを切らせたり、足の遅い子には距離の短いコースを走らせるなどの工夫もしている。
ということです。東京都の８割も！と一瞬ビックリするのですが、これは「順位を明確に示すことをしていない小学校が８割」ということだと思われ、その多くはリボンを与えたり等旗の前に座らせることをしない、という程度なのではないかという気がします。例えばこちらの市議さんは等旗を使わないことを「行き過ぎた平等教育」と批判しているようです。
けれども順位を明確にしない、というのは走り終わった後まで誰が一番で誰がビリだったかを分からないようにする、ということであって、ゴールした時点では順位は明確につくわけですよね。個人的にはそれで別にいいじゃん、と思うのですが。
というわけで、 「 手をつないで一斉にゴール」という現象は、事実としてないわけではない。けれども「大流行」というほど広まっているわけではない。というか実数としてはかなり少ないのではないか、まあこれが「大流行」といえるのならば、「邪神デビューボが世界中で大ブレイク！！」といってもいいんじゃね？という程度ではないか、というのが調べてみての印象です。それがこれほどまでに広がったのは、前のエントリのコメント欄でid:kmizusawaさんが書いておられたように、これが多くの場合左翼批判、平等教育批判に用いられることによるのではないかと思われます。「行き過ぎた平等」とやらを批判するために最も極端な事例を挙げる、それが「リボンを配らない」「等旗をつかわない」といったより一般的な事例とゴッチャになって、「全国各地で大流行！（でも目撃談は少ないよ）」ってなことになったのではないかと推測します。あくまでも推測ですが。
ところで 、 「行き過ぎた平等教育」の事例として「手をつないで一斉にゴール」と並んでよく言及され、また批判されているものに「タイムが近い生徒を一緒に走らせ差がつきにくいようにする」というのがありました。「遅い子が目立たないようにする」という理由づけがいわれている通りならば個人的は「なんだかなー」と思いますが、タイムの近いもの同士走らせるってそんなに悪いことですか？
力の拮抗したもの同士で走った方が子ども達もより競争心を燃やすと思うんですが…。
余談ですが、うちの小学校は等旗もリボンもありましたが、トラックを半周するのにスタートラインとゴールラインは一緒（つまりアウトコースの人は不利）でした。これは子ども心に「不平等だ」と思ったものです。あと体力テストの斜懸垂も（背が高いので）。
追記：あ、もしかして 「手をつないでゴールインする徒競争が全国各地の運動会で大流行」って「30人31脚」のことだったりして。いや、あれは肩を組むのか。

Mr Abe became prime minister in September
Shinzo Abe interview
In a BBC interview , Mr Abe also defended his plans for Japan to develop a more assertive foreign policy .
He made clear he believes North Korea poses a very grave threat to the world .
Mr Abe begins a trip to Europe in London where he is due to hold discussions with the British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
" If the North Koreans are to possess nuclear weapons that may lead to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , " he said .
" That could fundamentally undermine the non-proliferation regime , which may then lead to more problems regarding Iran for example . "
Mr Abe 's visit to Europe is an opportunity for a prime minister who is just a few months into the job to start to build closer relationships with Western leaders .
Japan cannot tolerate North Korea owning nuclear weapons nor the means to deliver them
Shinzo Abe
Transcript of interview Political ' blue blood '
It comes as he presses ahead at home with plans to re-write the country 's pacifist constitution , a move that is causing some concern .
Mr Abe sought to reassure his critics , pointing out that Japan had upheld freedom and democracy for six decades , and saying he plans to discuss with Nato officials what the country can do to promote global peace and stability .
Kidnap issue
Significantly , Mr Abe used the interview - at his offices near the National Diet building in Tokyo - to raise the issue of the abduction of foreign nationals by North Korea .
It was his campaigning on this issue that helped to bring him to prominence in Japanese politics and he takes every opportunity he can to press the point .
JAPAN'S MISSING
Snatched in the ' 70s and ' 80s Used as cultural trainers for N Korean spies Five allowed home in 2002 Five children now freed from N Korea Eight said to be dead , others missing
Heartbreak over Japan 's missing
" We believe that this abduction issue is a grave infringement of basic human rights , " he said , insisting that " all countries around the world need to address it " .
He also said that according to testimonies provided by abductees , who were kidnapped by the North in the 1970's and 80's to train its spies , there are some Europeans .
This has not been verified .
North Korea returned five Japanese nationals in 2002 but claimed that others who had been abducted had died .
After visiting London , Mr Abe will also make stops in Berlin , Paris and Brussels .
There he will hold discussions with Nato leaders about closer co-operation between Japan and the alliance .
" By deepening the partnership between Japan and Nato member countries we shall be able to address various problems , conflicts and also peace - building , " the prime minister said .
Japan is already working with Nato , supporting operations in Afghanistan for example .
But Mr
Abe insists that other nations have nothing to fear from a more assertive Japan .
" I believe we will be able to gain the understanding as well as the confidence of the world regarding Japan 's assertiveness " he said .
Comedy Central Back on YouTube
The Daily Show sums up Bush speeches .
After suing YouTube , NBC signed a deal with YouTube .
Now after having their clips pulled off YouTube over the weekend , Comedy Central ’s owner Viacom signs a deal with YouTube .
Do you see a pattern emerging here ?
You gotta love YouTube ’s data retention practices .
Pulled clips just magically reappeared , stats and all .
Here ’s what Viacom had to say about it .
We want our audiences to be able to access our programming on every platform and we ’re interested in having it live on all forms of distribution in ways that protect our talented artists , our loyal customers and our passionate audiences .
Of course , Viacom asserting copyright right after Google ’s purchase of YouTube raises questions of sincerity .
A YouTube user questions Comedy Central ’s motives .
Greed aside , it ’s good to see Viacom gets this video thing .
For a moment there , I was gonna bash them for having their clips pulled off .
In the words of VC Paul Graham :
The big media companies shouldnâ€™t worry that people will post their copyrighted material on YouTube .
They should worry that people will post their own stuff on YouTube , and audiences will watch that instead .
In celebration of this landmark deal , enjoy a few of my favorite Comedy Central YouTube clips , supersized for your pleasure .

In Hamburgs Süden gibt es unbestreitbar einige Stadtviertel mit hohem Ausländeranteil .
Als Beispiel für Ghettoisierung hat sich die “ Bild ” - Zeitung in ihrem aufrüttelnden und “ ehrlichen ” Aufmacher “ 7 Wahrheiten über Ausländer - Politik ” allerdings ausgerechnet Steinwerder ausgeguckt :
Die Suche nach all den Ausländern , die sich hier abschotten und “ oft nach ihren eigenen Gesetzen ” leben , dürfte etwas länger dauern .
Verstecken sie sich vielleicht zwischen den zehntausenden Containern am Terminal Tollerort ?
Im riesigen Trockendock Elbe 17 ?
Oder auf dem Gelände des Klärwerks Köhlbrandhöft ?
Offensichtlich , denn die Statistiker haben 2004 ( siehe Ausriss ) gerade einmal 16 Ausländer auf Steinwerder entdecken können ( von 57 gemeldeten Einwohnern insgesamt ) .
Und die deutschsprachige Wikipedia weiß noch mehr über das neu entdeckte Ghetto :
I ’m tired of mass media perpetuating a culture of fear under the scapegoat of informing the public .
Nowhere is this more apparent than how they discuss youth culture and use scare tactics to warn parents of the safety risks about the Internet .
The choice to perpetually report on the possibility or rare occurrence of kidnapping / stalking / violence because of Internet sociability is not a neutral position – it is a position of power that the media chooses to take because it ’s a story that sells .
There ’s something innately human about rubbernecking , about looking for fears , about reveling in the possibilities of demise .
Mainstream media capitalizes on this , manipulating the public and magnifying the culture of fear .
It sells horror films and it sells newspapers .
A few days ago , i started laying out how youth create a public in digital environments because their physical publics are so restricted .
Since then , i was utterly horrified to see that some school officials are requiring students to dismantle their MySpace and Xanga accounts or risk suspension .
The reason is stated simply in the article : “ If this protects one child from being near - abducted or harassed or preyed upon , I make no apologies for this stance . ”
OMG , this is insane .
In some ways , i wish that the press had never heard of these sites … i wish that i had never participated in helping them know of its value to youth culture .
I wish that it remained an obscure teenage site .
Because i’m infuriated at how my own participation in information has been manipulated to magnify the culture of fear .
The culture of fear is devastating ; it is not the same as safety .
Let ’s step back a few years .
Remember Columbine ?
I was living in Amsterdam at the time and the coverage was brilliant – the Dutch press talked about how there was a school shooting by kids who felt alienated from their community .
And then the US coverage started pouring in .
Goths ( or anyone wearing black , especially black trench coats ) were marked as the devil incarnate .
Video games were evil and were promoting killing .
Everything was blamed except the root cause : alienation .
There were exceptions though .
I remember crying the first time i read Jon Katz ’s Voices from the Hellmouth where numerous youth poured out their souls about how they were treated in American education systems .
Through his articles , he was able to capture the devastation of the culture of fear .
My professor Henry Jenkins testified in Washington about how dangerous our culture has become , not because there are tools of rage , but an unchecked systematic creation of youth alienation .
He pleaded with Congress : “ Listen to our children .
Do n’t fear them . ”
And yet , we have n’t .
In response , youth went underground .
Following one of his talks , a woman came up to him dressed in an array of chaotic pink .
She explained to Henry that she was a goth , but had to go underground .
What kind of world do we live in where a color symbolizes a violent act ?
We fear our children .
We fear what they might do in collectives .
We ban them from public spaces ( see “ Mall wo n’t allow teens without parents ” ) .
We think that we are protecting them , but we ’re really feeding the media industry and guaranteeing the need for uncountable psychiatrists .
Imagine the weight that this places on youth culture .
Imagine what it ’s like to grow up under media scrutiny , parental protectionism and formalist educational systems .
During the summer of 1999 , i was driving cross-country and ended up at an outdoor rave outside of Denver , Colorado .
I was sitting in my tent , writing in my diary when a group of teens wrapped at my door asking if they could come in and smoke because it was too windy outside to light the damn thing .
I invited them in and we started talking .
They were all from Littleton and had all dropped out of school shortly following Columbine and were now at a loss for what to do .
I asked them why they dropped out , expecting that they would tell me about how eerie the school was or how they were afraid of being next .
No .
They dropped out because the media was hounding them everywhere they went .
They could n’t get into the school without being pestered ; they could n’t go to the mall or hang out and play basketball .
They found underground venues for socialization .
Here we were , in the middle of a field outside town at a rave , the only place that they felt safe to be themselves .
The underground rave scene flourished in the summer of 1999 outside Denver because it was a safe haven for teens needing to get away from adult surveillance and pressure .
Shortly later , the cops busted the party .
I went and pleaded with them , asking them to let the kids camp there without the music ; they had the permits for camping .
No ; they had heard that there were kids doing ecstasy .
Let ’s say they are – you want them to drive on drugs ?
Why not let them just camp ?
The cops ignored me and turned on bright lights and told the kids that they needed to leave in 10 minutes or they would be arrested .
Argh !
I ’m not going to condone teenage drug use , but i also know that it comes from a need to find one ’s identity , to make sense of the world removed from adult rules .
These kids need a safe space to be themselves ; overzealous police do n’t help a damn thing .
How do youth come of age in this society ?
What good is it to restrict every social space that they have ?
Does anyone actually think that this is a good idea ?
Protectionist actions tends to create hatred , resentment .
It destroys families by failing to value trust and responsibility .
Ageist rhetoric alienates the younger generation .
And for what purpose ?
The effects are devastating .
Ever wonder why young people do n’t vote ?
Why should they ?
They ’ve been told for so damn long that their voices do n’t matter , have been the victims of an oppressive regime .
What is motivating about that ?
How do you learn to use your voice to change power when you ’ve been surveilled and controlled for so long , when you ’ve made an art out of subversive engagement with peers ?
When you ’ve been put on drugs like Strattera that control your behavior to the point of utter obedience ?
We drug our children the whole way through school as a mechanism of control and wonder why drug abuse and alcoholism is rampant when they come of age .
I ’ve never seen as many drugs as i did at pristine prestigious boarding schools .
The wealthy kids in our society are so protected , pampered .
When given an ounce of freedom , they go from one extreme to the other instead of having healthy exploratory developments .
Many of the most unstable , neurotic and addicted humans i have met in this lifetime come from a position of privilege and protectionism .
That can not be good .
We need to break this culture of fear in order to have a healthy society .
Please , please … whenever you interact with youth culture ( whether you ’re a parent , a schoolteacher or a cafe owner ) , learn from them .
Hear them from their perspectives and stop trying to project your own fears onto them .
Allow them to flourish by giving them the freedom to make sense of their identity and culture .
It does n’t mean that there are n’t risks – there are .
But they are not as grandiose as the press makes them out to be .
And besides , youth need to do stupid things in order to learn from their own mistakes .
Never get caught up in the “ i told you so ” commentary that comes after that “ when i was your age ” bullshit .
People do n’t learn this way – they learn by putting their hand in the fire and realizing it really is hot and then stepping back .
Post - Columbine , we decided to regulate the symptoms of alienation rather than solve the problem .
Today , we are trying to regulate youth efforts to have agency and public space .
Both are products of a culture of fear and completely miss the point .
We need to figure out how to support youth culture , exploration and efforts to make sense of the social world .
The more we try to bottle it into a cookie - cutter model , the more we will destroy that generation .
In line with Henry ’s claim to Congress , i want to plead to you ( and ask you to plead to those you know ) :
Listen to the youth generation – do n’t fear them and do n’t project your fear onto them .
( Note : my use of the term “ kids ” references the broader youth population using a slang very familiar to subcultures where an infantilized generation reclaimed the term for personal use .
I am 27 and i still talk about my friends as kids .
What i’m referencing is youth culture broadly , not children and not just teens . )
It is wellknown that recursion is one of the main techniques associated with the functional programming style and this goes hand - in - hand with the principles that variables are immutable and once defined their values cannot be reassigned .
Using recursion is elegant and beautiful most of the time , but it can have its drawbacks , too .
One is that processing a long ( with length N ) list of items the system may crash due to call - stack overflow .
Depending on the available amount of memory and the specific language / runtime parameters this may happen at different recursion depths , but as a rule on a typical computer call - stack overflow is most often observed when N >= 1000 .
Thus , for any practical functional programming applications it is of paramount importance to be able to avoid call - stack overflows .
There are two main ways of solving this problem : tail - recursion optimization and the DVC ( Divide and Conquer ) principle .
Today I ’d discuss tail - recursion optimization and the state of this technique in some existing and wellknown XSLT ( 2.0 or 1.0 ) processors .
Definition ( Wikipedia ) : " Tail recursion ( or tail - end recursion ) is a special case of recursion that can be easily transformed into an iteration .
Such a transformation is possible if the recursive call is the last thing that happens in a function " .
Transforming recursion into iteration ( similar to a C - like " for " or " while " loop ) not only completely eliminates the possibility of call - stack overflow , but also often leads to lightning - fast resulting code .
This month I have been playing with an XSLT 2.0 implementation of a simple general LR parser as described in the Wikipedia .
The implementation was straightforward and simple enough and the code was very short and compact .
What was best , I had a tail - recursive variant of my code !
Tested with Saxon 8.7.3 it also ran extremely fast , dispelling any doubts that XSLT Might not be the best language to use for such kind of processing .
Before starting to implement my XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 parsers written in XSLT 2.0 ( : oO ) )
I needed to run a simple experiment just to be sure I was on the safe side from the very start .
I needed to verify that Saxon will indeed recognize the tail - recursion and optimize it , so that it would always be possible to parse very long " sentences " described by a particular grammar .
I started doubling the length ( number of terminal symbols ) of the input and unfortunately !
and completely to my horror Saxon crashed with the dreaded " stack overflow " exception when the length reached 1600 .
Imagine my ( " mixed " to put it mildly ) feelings .
I reported the issue to the saxon - help mailing list .
Got assurances from Dr. Kay that he would look into the issue .
Sent him the tail - recursive variant of my code .
Then waited .
As of today , the issue is not listed in the tracker for the Saxon project .
I know that Dr. Kay is a busy person and during this time period he had been involved in the final stages of making the XSLT 2.0 spec an official W3C Recommendation — something really a lot more important .
I believe that sooner or later this issue will be fixed in Saxon .
Anyway , I did try the other two known XSLT 2.0 implementations — Altova and Gexslt .
Both failed the same way as Saxon .
Then I decided to test a much more simple XSLT tail - recursive application — both on available XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 processors .
The code to produce the sum of the numbers 1,2,3 , … , N
where N=1000000 ( one million ) is listed below :
< xsl:stylesheet version = " 2.0 "
xmlns:xsl= " http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform "
xmlns:xs= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema "
xmlns:f= " http://fxsl.sf.net/ "
>
< xsl:output method = " text " / >
< xsl:template match= " / " >
< xsl:sequence select= " f:sum( 0 , 1 , 1000000 ) " />
</xsl:template >
< xsl:function name= " f:sum " >
< xsl: param name= " pAccumulated " as = " xs:integer " / >
< xsl : param name = " pFrom " as = " xs:integer " / >
< xsl : param name = " pTo " as = " xs:integer " / >
< xsl : sequence select=
" if ($ pFrom gt $ pTo )
then $ pAccumulated
else
f:sum($ pAccumulated + $ pFrom , $ pFrom + 1 , $ pTo )
"
/>
</xsl:function >
</xsl:stylesheet >
This transformation runs with Saxon 8.7.3 ( J ) for about 2.5 to 3 seconds .
Altova crashes with stack overflow again .
The case with Gexslt was more complicated — it was processing this transformation for a very long time ( more than 2 minutes CPU ) and was gradually consuming all the memory of the computer .
I tried a similar , template - based transformation with a number of XSLT 1.0 processors .
As it happens , .NET 2.0 XslCompiled Transform is the champion in this group , producing the correct result almost instantaneously .
I want to finish this story in an optimistic tone .
I contacted Colin - Paul Adams — the author / developer of Gexslt and he responded very quickly .
Both the LR - parsing tail - recursion and the sum ( ) tail recursion problem were fixed in a couple of days .
So , it appears that right at this moment Gexslt handles correctly and much better some kinds of tail - recursive transformations ( such as of the LR - parsing type ) than any other available XSLT 2.0 processor .
This is the beauty of having more than one competing products .
Many thanks to Colin !
Below is the latest The Pain -- When Will It End ?
Updated 02/15/06 Artist 's Statement I remain painfully jealous over the international cartoon furor , but I ’m also secretly thrilled to see cartoons making the news for the first time since Boss Tweed .
It ’s surreal to read headlines like : “ Cartoon Riots Continue for Fifth Day . ”
And of course it ’s always hilarious and endearing to see the entire Arab world being manipulated into a hateful frenzy over nothing .
I know this is not quite the incendiary Muhammadan - baiting cartoon I promised last week , but since I was a week behind the news I wanted to think up something that was n’t obvious , that was subtler , more intelligent and inspired than any other cartoonist would be doing .
I was blocked until my humor consultant Aaron e-mailed from Seattle with the suggestion that I should imagine some other , unlikelier group rioting in protest of a cartoon — perhaps fans of Bill Keane ’s Family Circus .
Aaron got lost in an ill - considered tangent about little Billy taking over for Bill one day and drawing something offensive , but I immediately realized that the unlikeliest possible group of outragees should be scientists , traditionally the most rational and even - tempered of factions .
Certainly , scientists have their biases and blind spots and heated disputes , but in the end their rigorous , peer - reviewed methodology enforces a kind of superhuman objectivity and fair - mindedness .
Ultimately this cartoon is still at fundamentalist Islam ’s expense , presenting a tacit contrast to the more civilized response of empiricism to controversy .
Notice how these things do n’t seem happen so much in the West -- the angry chanting in the streets and setting of things on fire and the attacking of embassies and kidnapping of innocent aid workers ?
It is not just because we are a Godless people who believe in nothing fervently enough to lacerate ourselves and trample each other and behead foreigners for it .
It ’s also because we are not completely batshit .
There ’s something kind of poignant and pathetic about the footage of furious Arabs whapping American and Danish flags with shoes and setting them on fire , as though this could hurt us in the same way that the cartoons of Mohammed have hurt them .
They have , as the saying goes , obviously mistaken us for someone who gives a shit .
They seem to be operating on a whole different cognitive level of development , imbuing concrete symbols with life and real meaning , seeing images as reality .
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m not indulging some racist theory that Arabs are less evolved than Westerners -- most of my fellow Americans are operating at about the same level , far more concerned with the actual cloth ( or decal )
Flag than with the liberties it represents , believing that what they see on TV is real .
Alas , here at Winter H.Q. I am away from my copy of John Ralston Saul ’s indispensable book Voltaire ’s Bastards , or I would quote its chapter “ Images of Immortality ” on the decline of imagery ’s power in the West coterminus with the rise of photography .
The bemused incomprehension I feel for those outraged rioters is that of a culture that no longer believes in the image contemplating one that still does , passionately and literally .
Of course it ’s also that of someone who ’s enjoyed relative safety , privilege , and luxury his whole life rolling his eyes at the paranoia and rage of people who ’ve always been threatened , oppressed , and impoverished .
However , although this may make their reaction more understandable , I am not sure it makes it any less stupid or wrong .
Jack Chick is the author and illustrator of those little religious pamphlets you find lying around in bus stations and laundromats , horizontal in format , crude in execution , frequently condemning the evils of abortion , evolution , and Roman Catholicism , and extolling the acceptance of Jesus Christ as your personal savior as the only sure means to eternal salvation .
Learn more at http://www.chick.com and repent , you idolatrous baby - killing Papists .
Thanks to my physicist pal Chris for help on the precise rhetorical terms for various logical and scientific fallacies in panel # 2 .
I had to look up a Klingon translation program online at an internet café for panel # 3 .
The threat of anyone seeing this over my shoulder made me as nervous and embarrassed as the prospects of being caught looking at fuckingmachines.com in public .
For those not fluent in the galaxy ’s most hostile tongue , the characters in this panel are saying , “ Death before dishonor ! ’ and “ Shut up !
Your struggles only make it more painful ! ”
Do not worry , xenophobes and jingoists ; I still intend to draw a cartoon in the near future all about Islam ’s , and Arabic culture ’s , many invaluable contributions to our civilization .
But first another , more urgent matter commands my immediate attention : colleague Emily Flake informed me over lunch last week that an Iranian newspaper is sponsoring a “ Funniest Cartoon About the Holocaust ” contest .
To any cartoonist with gumption , this is clearly a challenge .
The Persians have thrown down the gauntlet .
I am entering .
And I intend to win .

Be on the lookout for a ‘ platoon of lesbians ’
I ’m delighted to see that Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D - N.Y . ) and I are on the same page about reaching out to the government - trained military linguists , removed from duty because of their sexual orientation .
( Carpetbagger regular Michael W already mentioned this in comments , but I wanted to give it a post of its own . )
Condoleezza Rice got a grilling Wednesday [ before the House Foreign Affairs Committee ] when she bemoaned “ the foreign language deficit that we have ” and how much the government needs Farsi and Arabic speakers during an appearance on Capitol Hill … .
After she complained several times that the department was facing a problem finding translators an exasperated Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D - NY ) asked why the department had not hired any of the translators fired by the Pentagon because they are gay and lesbian .
Under “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” more than two dozen Arabic translators have been dropped since the war in Iraq began .
“ It seems that the Defense Department has a ‘ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ’ when it comes to homosexuals .
You do n’t have such a prohibition in your agency , do you ? ” Ackerman asked Rice .
“ No , we do not , ” Rice replied .
“ Well , it seems that the military has gone around and fired a whole bunch of people who speak foreign languages — Farsi and Arabic , etc. , ” Ackerman told her .
He added , “ For some reason , the military seems more afraid of gay people than they are against terrorists , but they ’re very brave with the terrorists , ” Ackerman said .
“ If the terrorists ever got a hold of this information , they ’d get a platoon of lesbians to chase us out of Baghdad . ”
Rice was reportedly not amused by the comment , and refused to make any commitments , other than to say that she “ will look [ at ] what we are doing right now . ”
( I think the answer is “ not much . ” )
The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network noted that “ our government could go a long way in addressing the shortage of language expertise by doing just as Congressman Ackerman suggests .
SLDN would be happy to introduce Secretary Rice to our many clients who speak Arabic but have been dismissed because of the ban . ”
See how easy this would be , Secretary Rice ?
In related news , on the heels of two new polls showing broad support for allowing gay Americans to serve in the military , Rep. Marty Meehan ( D - Mass . ) , who helped write the “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” policy 14 years ago , is poised to unveil legislation to undo the policy .
Meehan , who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee subcommittee on oversight and investigation , introduced a similar bill in the last Congress that garnered 122 co-sponsors , including now Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif .
Meehan ’s bill was bottled up by Republicans and never got out of committee .
So far , roughly 70 lawmakers have signed on as co-sponsors of the legislation , and Meehan is continuing to seek additional backers and wants to get to at least 100 before he drops his new bill . [… ]
“ Our military is stretched to the breaking point , ” Meehan wrote in a “ Dear Colleague ” letter he circulated on Monday seeking backers for his bill .
“ Extended deployments and frequent redeployments are the norm for our Armed Forces right now .
Everyone from the new Democratic leadership in Congress to Senator [ John ] McCain to President Bush has recognized that our military is not large enough to handle all of the demands placed upon it . ”
Meehan added : “ Yet , because of the discriminatory policy set up in the 1993 more than 11,000 able - bodied , capable and willing soldiers , sailors , and airmen and women have been kicked out of the military for no other reason than their sexual orientation . ”
Meehan is now looking for Republican co-sponsors — and a senator who ’ll champion a similar measure in the other chamber .
Notwithstanding the inconveniences , my wife , Ginger , is as enamored of this experiment as I am .
She has claimed the Jetta as her own , but has volunteered to help with the mechanical work to convert another car for me .
She calls the experience the “ Noah project , ” named after our 11 - month - old grandson , who she hopes will benefit from a better world if others do the same thing .
Despite the obvious benefits of using a fuel that contributes to the nation ’s energy independence , that is relatively cheap and that can be burned after having already served its original purpose — cooking food — it is worth noting that vegetable oil is unlikely to replace petroleum anytime soon .
As the number of conversions rises , users will eventually soak up the supply of used cooking oil .
As with ethanol and other agriculture - based fuels , it remains to be seen whether growing soybeans is an efficient way to produce nonpetroleum fuels , since the farming process consumes large amounts of fuel and chemical - rich fertilizers .
Also , growing crops for use as fuels could have unforeseen effects on the prices and supplies of food .
The territory is uncharted in other ways , as well , as seen in the comments posted in an online forum sponsored by Greasecar.com .
Take the case of “ Chase , ” a Massachusetts resident who was perhaps not as careful as he might have been in the storage of his cache of oil .
“ No BooBoo to be seen , ” Chase wrote , “ but this AM there was a really big black bear with its snout in an opened and overturned 5 gal .
Luckily the grease spilled onto my gravel driveway , so it should soak in soon enough .
Also lucky she did not get into the 12 other buckets !
Some arm waving and yelling sent it packing . ”
A frequent question about vegetable oil is whether cars run more sluggishly on it .
Consider “ TDIGuy , ” who sought advice on whether a blown head gasket could have resulted from “ running a VW too fast for too long ” and “ hitting the gas pretty hard . ”
After receiving some helpful comments , TDIGuy came clean : “ When I said speeding a little , and a little hard on the gas , I was actually trying to hit 140 in the car .
Managed to get 130 , but I think I put too much stress on the engine . ”

A common concern about converting a car for vegetable oil is that it could harm the engine .
But some people who have done conversions say they ’ve seen no damage , even after many miles .
Phil Gibbs , a New York City firefighter who makes a 75 - mile commute twice a week from his Putnam County home , said he had driven his 2002 Jetta 75,000 miles on vegetable oil with no trouble .

Brain tissues wax and wane during childhood
The US National Institute of Mental Health used scans to study development of the cortex , which is responsible for thinking , in 307 children .
They found smarter youngsters tended to have a thin cortex aged seven , but this thickened rapidly by the age of 12 .
Average children had an initially thick cortex which peaked in size aged eight .
In both cases , the cortex thinned after reaching this peak but this was more gradual in children of average IQ as their cortex had reached peak thickness at an earlier age .
The body 's development is intimately linked to interactions with its environment
Professor Richard Passingham
The researchers believe the extended period of thickening during the early years of the brighter children may give the brain more time to develop high - level thinking circuitry .
Then , the rapid thinning out of the cortex later on may be due to withering of unused neural connections as the brain streamlines its operations .
Researcher Dr Elias Zerhouni said : " Studies of brains have taught us that people with higher IQs do not have larger brains .
" Thanks to brain imaging technology , we can now see that the difference may be in the way the brain develops . "
Long - term study
Dr Judith Rapoport , who also worked on the study , said : " Brainy children are not cleverer solely by virtue of having more or less grey matter at any one age .
" Rather , IQ is related to the dynamics of cortex maturation . "
The researchers are now searching for genetic variations which might be linked to differential brain maturation rates .
In a commentary piece on the study , Professor Richard Passingham , of the University of Oxford , said variations in general intelligence were thought to depend to a great extent on genetic differences .
" It is tempting to assume that this developmental change in brain structure is determined by a person 's genes , " he said .
" But one should be very wary of such a conclusion .
The body 's development is intimately linked to interactions with its environment .
" It could be that people with superior intelligence also live in a richer social and linguistic environment , and that it is this that accounts for the sharp increase in the thickness of their prefrontal cortex in late childhood . "
Jack bought a pink Nissan on an internet site
Jack Neal 's parents only discovered their son's successful bid when they received a message from eBay about the Barbie pink Nissan Figaro .
Rachael Neal , 36 , said her son was quite good at using the computer .
Mrs Neal , of Sleaford , Lincolnshire , said she had left her eBay password in her computer and her son had used the " buy it now " button .
She said : " Jack 's a whizz on the PC and just pressed all the right buttons .
The car was a £ 9,000 pink Nissan Figaro
" I was just horrified .
" We now have the parental locks on - and we make sure we sign out of eBay ! "
She said her husband John , 37 , had called the seller of the car and explained the mistake .
" Luckily he saw the funny side and said he would re-advertise , " Mrs Neal added .
The seller of the soft - top second - hand car , Paul Jones , co-director of Worcester Road Motors in Stourport - on - Severn , near Kidderminster , Worcestershire , said he had been " amused " by the bid .
It is the first time the car dealership has sold a car on the site , Mr Jones said .
Saudi King Abdullah has pledged to boost his citizens ' prosperity
Saudi citizens will be able to invest up to 500,000 riyals ( $ 133,000 ; £ 70,600 ) , in the bourse - buying and selling on the market for two years .
The individuals can keep any gains but the state will absorb losses .
King Abdullah did not give a starting date for the scheme - which could attract up to 3 million investors .
However he said he was " determined " to implement it .
" The fund will be for people of limited income , employees and others ... this group matter most to me , " he said .
" If they win then this is their luck , with God 's will , and if they lose , then their capital is preserved with us , " the monarch said .
Raise standards
The Saudi stock market has lost more than half its value in the last two months , denting confidence in the government as hundreds of thousands of ordinary Saudis lost money .
The king has blamed wealthy speculators for manipulating the market and hopes the fund will bring more moderation to the bourse .
The plan fits in with King Abdullah 's aim of raising living standards , analyst Dawoud al - Shiryan said .
" Poverty and unemployment affect terrorism and instability and the king knows the result of this decision , which has important political significance , " he added .

Thanks to reader
Heather , I have a new favorite real estate guru : Tom Vu .
I guess I was too young to know about this guy when he was in his prime .
His bluntness and blatant disrespect for our intelligence is so refreshing .
You simply must watch .
My Personal Favorite Quotes
“ Today I ’m gonna show you how to drive a sports car .
First , you need a lot of money ! ”
“ Your friends are loser ! ”
“ What if you bought a house worth $ 300,000 for $ 200,000 .
Think of the profit you could make ! ”
“ Do you think these girls like me ?
No , they like my money ! ”
Seminar Details
After some internet research , it appears that most of Mr. Vu ’s tactics were very similar to the ones taught by Robert Allen .
That ’s is , you buy a house from a “ motivated seller ” at a below market price , and then find another buyer at a higher price for an easy profit .
Here are some excerpts from a letter written by a seminar attendee :
Vu ’s main strategy was to “ control , ” rather than own , real estate .
So you would go out looking for distressed properties , ( foreclosures and such ) and offer to buy these houses at incredible discounts .
He claimed to never offer more than 50 % of market value , but said it would depend on whether it was a buyer ’s or a seller ’s market how much your discounted offer would be .
The desperate owner would be happy to just get out of the property without ruining his credit , so he takes your offer happily .
In your offer , you write that the agreement is between the seller and you “ or assigns ” .
Then you offer ten bucks as a down payment to make the contract legal ( “ exchange of consideration ” ) .
Your closing date is a couple of months hence .
In addition , you tack on a whole pile of whim - and - fancy clauses , such as “ this deal is subject to the final inspection and approval of the buyer before closing . ”
During the time before closing , you find a buyer to assign your interest in the contract to .
Selling the place will be easy , since after all , you got it at a huge discount in the first place .
You walk away at closing with a hefty profit .
Unlike the vast majority of seminar attendees , I actually tried for a long time to do this in my neck of the woods , British Columbia , Canada .
I failed miserably .
I encountered the following realities : 1 . Even with distressed properties , offering to buy a property that far below market value was a joke ( I was trying 80 % ) .
I was laughed out of most negotiations …
2 . Many of these properties were over financed , and even if they were n’t , there was no desperate bank mandate to unload these non performing assets at all costs .
Generally , even in foreclosure sales , the owner or later , the bank , wanted fair market value .
3 . Whim - and - fancy clauses were not acceptable to anyone I dealt with .
Where Is Tom Vu Now ?
After apparently being shut down by the government for his tactics , Mr. Vu can now be found in poker rooms as semi-pro player .
Let ’s analyze this career move :
How does a real estate guru make money ?
By taking it from chumps with illusions of making lots of easy money .
How does a poker player make money ?
By taking it from chumps with illusions of making lots of easy money .
You ’ve got to hand it to the guy , he definitely knows what his strengths are .
Most students of jazz will not go on to be professional players .
And few students turned on by the creative arts in school will go on to be professional artists .
And that 's OK .
Knowledge and understanding of the arts and the experience of pursuing excellence with , say , an instrument or a brush , etc. can teach students a lot about life and the value of focused effort , patience , teamwork , perspective , creativity , problem solving , and a million other things .
All things that will serve the student well no matter what profession (s ) she ends up dedicating herself to .
I made barely enough money with music to pay for my college years .
Though music is not my profession today , jazz still inspires me in my professional life as well as in my personal / spiritual life .
Jazz , of course , is about dialog and a kind of conversation with other musicians and a connection with the audience .
Jazz is inspiring to me ; it 's lessons can be applied to other aspects of life , even the art of presentation .
Below , then , are eleven quotes by jazz greats of yesterday and today which I find particularly inspiring and applicable .
Following the list is a short video clip of a gig I did in Osaka last year with some very accomplished musicians .
(1) “ The most important thing I look for in a musician is whether he knows how to listen . ” ( Duke - Ellington )
The best communicators in the world are almost always the best listeners .
Talking is easy ; any dope can do that .
But listening is hard .
The lessons learned in life come more from when we open our ears not our mouths .
(2) “ Writing is like jazz .
It can be learned , but it ca n’t be taught . ”
( Paul - Desmond )
I 'm not sure I 've ever been taught anything about making presentations , but I have learned a ton from observing great presenters , from people like Steve Jobs to scores of people far less famous , such as college professors , etc .
(3) “ Do n’t bullshit… just play . ” ( Wynton - Marsalis )
Audiences today are busier than ever and have developed built - in " crap detectors " to filter out anything remotely insincere or shallow .
They may not interrupt you or walk out of the room , but that does n't mean they have not stopped listening .
Guy Kawasaki has some good tips for those presenting to venture capitalists .
If you 're asking an audience for money , it is a safe bet that they will have zero tolerance for any overly optimistic views of future results unless you have strong evidence .
(4) “ If they act too hip , you know they ca n’t play shit ! ” ( Louis - Armstrong )
With practice we can become more polished .
But too much polish turns a presentation into a TV - like infomercial unworthy of an audience 's trust .
Presentation is a very human thing .
Practice , rehearse and make it great .
But keep it real .
Keep it human .
And remember that it is about them ( the audience ) , not us .
(5) “ Master your instrument .
Master the music .
And then forget all that bullshit and just play . ” ( Charlie - Parker )
Studying design and presentation , communication , etc. is crucial .
But when we present , all that matters is that moment and that audience .
Get to the point .
Tell us something memorable .
Quit worrying and just inspire us or teach us ( or better yet , both ) .
( 6) “ It ’s taken me all my life to learn what not to play . ” ( Dizzy - Gillespie )
Most presentations are too long or filled with information that was unnecessary and included for the wrong reasons ( such as fear ) .
Knowing what to leave out takes work .
Again , anyone can include everything and say everything , it is the master presenters ( or writers , etc. ) who know what to cut and have the courage to cut it .
(7) “ You can play a shoestring if you ’re sincere . ” ( John - Coltrane )
In most situations , you do n't need the latest technology or the best equipment in the world .
Showing that you are well prepared and ready to present naked is far more important .
A poor presentation is not any better simply because expensive equipment is used to project images .
Sincerity and respect for the audience matter far more .
(8) " When people believe in boundaries , they become part of them . "
( Don Cherry )
Many books give prescriptions for the " best way " to present .
There is no " best way " or " the correct way " to make a presentation .
There are only two kinds really : good ones and bad ones .
You know the difference because you 've seen them both .
Do n't be afraid to be unconventional if you think " unconventional " will work best for your situation .
Conventional wisdom is often the unwisest choice of all .
" Conventional wisdom " about presentations is at best a prescription for mediocrity .
( 9 ) “ Anyone can make the simple complicated .
Creativity is making the complicated simple . ” ( Charles Mingus )
This is my favorite quote of all .
Many presenters -- very smart people -- either take something essentially simple and confuse an audience or simply fail to make their more complicated material meaningful to their audience .
Simplicity ai n't easy .
In fact it 's hard .
( 10 ) “ I ca n’t stand to sing the same song the same way two nights in succession .
If you can , then it ai n’t music ... " ( Billie - Holiday )
Even if you have the same set of slides or the same key points from one night to the next , every presentation is different because every audience is different .
We must avoid the " canned presentation " or the " canned pitch " at all cost .
If we focus on the audience and place priority on their needs , we 're on the right path .
( 11 ) “ A great teacher is one who realizes that he himself is also a student and whose goal is not to dictate the answers , but to stimulate his students creativity enough so that they go out and find the answers themselves . ”
( Herbie - Hancock )
My best teachers as a child and my favorite presenters of today have this in common : they inspire , stimulate , motivate , provoke , and lead ... but they do not dictate .
Live in Japan
Below is a piece recorded in a club in Japan off a simple SLR camera featuring my buddies Dr. Hanagan ( p ) and Taku ( b ) and me on the ( d ) .
I am really looking forward to playing with Dr. Hanagan again on his next trip to Japan soon .
Here 's something slower from the same gig .

How to get users to RTFM »
Why marketing should make the user manuals !
Why do so many companies treat potential users so much better than existing users ?
Think about it .
The brochure is a thing of beauty , while the user manual is a thing of boredom .
The brochure gets the big budget while the manual gets the big index .
What if we stopped making the docs we give away for free SO much nicer than the ones the user paid for ?
What if instead of seducing potential users to buy , we seduced existing users to learn ?
Let 's take the whole damn ad / marketing budget and move it over to product manuals and support .
Let 's put our money where our users are .
If we 're in it for the short term , then sure -- it makes sense to do everything to get a new user , while doing as little as possible once we 've got them .
But if we 're really in it for the long haul - - for customer retention and loyal users -- then should n't we be using all that graphic design and pro writing talent for the people we care about the most ?
Our users ?
Most of you know our philosophy here on Creating Passionate Users :
Truly passionate users will evangelize to others .
The better users get at something , the better ( higher res ) the user experience .
The better the user experience , the more likely they are to keep trying to get better .
Nobody is passionate about something they completely suck at .
Helping your users learn and ( ultimately ) kick ass is the best way to up the odds they 'll become passionate .
Creating fabulous learning materials might be a far better use of the budget than creating fabulous ads and brochures .
If traditional advertising and marketing is becoming less and less effective , why not move all that talent ( designers , artists , copywriters , other " creatives " ) from before the sale to after the sale ?
We keep wondering why users wo n't RTFM , but just look at our FMs !
Nice brochures are printed on that coated silky paper that begs to be touched , while the manual is printed on scratchy office - grade paper .
Even just that one change -- making the user manual as touchable as the marketing material would be a good start .
And if your company insists on having fancy , slick , colorful brochures ... why not take the new fancy , slick , colorful product manuals and use THEM as your promotional material ?
As a potential customer , I 'll find your attention to user learning a lot more convincing than your attention to new sales .
Rather than using your brochure to show how much YOU kick ass , I 'd much rather see no-marketing - spin hard evidence of how you 're going to help ME kick ass .
If the best way to help create passionate users is by helping users learn and get better , then we should put our power to entice , motivate , and inspire someone to buy more , and use it to entice , motivate , and inspire someone to learn more .
In the end , those passionate users will evangelize our product or service far more credibly and honestly than we can .
So , are you as sexy after the sale as you are before ?
Do you know anyone who is ?
( I know a few , including Electric Rain )
And stay tuned for Part Two of this post -- probably tomorrow - - where we 'll look at how to get them to RTFM even without the big budget .
And hey , I missed you guys .
I was out sick for a while and then travelling for a few days .
Thanks for keeping me in your feeds .
; )

» Let Marketing Loose on UserManuals ?! from Get To The Point
I found this article by Kathy Sierra on Creating Passionate Users via Pivotal Personal Best .
Aparently , if user manuals were treated more like marketing materials , companies would get a lot fewer complaints and tech support calls , as users would RTFM ( ... [ Read More ]

Very true !
As a quite technically oriented guy I read manuals even today and I prefer shops where I can see them before the buy .
( Conrad Electronic in germany offers this on their website ) .
I do this because I want facts and the technical fineprint and I want to see the possibilities and limitations of the product .
But even for ton-technocal people the information would be useful - if it were enjoyable , as you say .

Hi Kathy ,
Hope you 're feeling better !
That 's an excellent question - and one that makes a lot of sense .
I 'm not going to pretend that I 've come up with a good reason for not using the same skills to create your user manuals - I have n't managed to come up with anything to say that it 's anything other than a good idea .
But , I think I can take a guess as to why it does n't currently happen :
It 's hard .
And :
There are very few people who can do it .
In my experience the number of people who can pull together the necessary skills as a graphic designer , technical writer and technical product expert are diminishingly small .
Heck , it 's hard enough to find someone who meets just one of those skills at a time , let alone all 3 .
Which is unfortunate - because if more people couple learning material of that quality with the philosophy that your product is a " means " and not an " end " , we 'd all end up using ( and producing ) much better products as a result .

Ummmm ... why is this the first time I 'm hearing this kind of philosophy ?
Excellent excellent excellent advice .

My impression is that most marketing materials are not reader friendly and informative .
It is very hard to get facts from markteting materials that help finding a reasonable decision .

The discrepancy between the brochure and the manual is a sure sign that we care more for the sale than for the customer .
Bad .
Which is an apt description for the quality of after sales service almost universally .
There are some exceptions , of course , but as a rule ...

Please do n't let the marketing people anywhere near the manuals .
Yes , the manuals should have a bit more effort lavished on them in terms of layout and design but if you let the marketing people anywhere near them you 'll lose the technical information they are trying to convey .
Posted by : Phillip Fayers | Aug 30 , 2006 2:19:55 AM
In my ( limited ) experience , manuals do n't need to be " glossy " as much as they need to be written in simple , coherent language with simple , uncluttered illustrations .
And be cautious : manuals can become too glossy for their own good .
( Think of the kind of " newbie instructions " that contain page after page of insanely grinning fashion models , holding their new products as if they were radiating ecstasy - beams . )
Alternately , some devices ( such as the camera on your illustration ) can come with a " walkthrough " function that instructs the user while he uses the device for the first time :
" Hi , I 'm your talking CoffeeMaker .
Press the blinking button on my base to start the introduction for new users ... "

...or , more realistically , the marketing and tech writing staff ( and web staff and product designers ) should work closely together on both sides of the sale to ensure a seamless , pleasant , enticing customer experience from start to ... well , we hope the relationship never ends !
It helps to have someone in charge of Customer Experience whose job is very explicitly to ensure that the necessary cooperation takes place to create that , and that the results are consistently good wherever company touches customer .

So marketing should n't make the manuals but should spend their money in that area rather than on brochures .
Like the idea of doubling up and using the new documentation as part of the pitch instead of brochures too .

You are of course singing from my Geek Marketing 101 songsheet so I totally agree , but I am reminded of a potential reason for the complacency you describe .
I feel a post coming on .

Too true .
Customers who know how to use products are happy customers .
I 've often found that products that you can easily pickup and use are the ones you use most often .
Having said that , at least having a boring manual is better than no manual at all .
Posted by : Neon | Aug 30 , 2006 6:10:46 AM
Kathy , there are a lot of great things in your post .
Unfortunately corporations have n't truly figured out that customers do n't care if the marketing dept and the pubs dept are under different VP's .
In most organizations that I 've seen , having pubs on time is just a checkbox in the product launch schedule .
They 're reviewed for accuracy , but little thought is put into the user 's experience or the opportunity for ongoing branding .
It 's funny how marketing cares so much about persuading a customer to buy , but seems to drop the ball on actually caring for the customer .
Posted by : Nick Rice | Aug 30 , 2006 7:19:08 AM
I 'd argue this is actually a " meta " issue .
Take for instance employers - in general , the only way employees can really move up is by changing jobs .
A good friend of mine was telling me that his team has had lots of attrition and they 're having a hard time filling openings yet raises are going to be capped - what message is that sending him ?
If you want to get what you 're worth , leave .
While I have heard of a few people getting good sized " market " adjustments , in general once you 're in the door you wo n't be seeing much in the way of corporate love .
That said , employees work in similar ways , often presenting a very glossy marketing document with a crufty user manual ...
And I wo n't even get into the whole dating / marriage game ;)
Great post Kathy , hope you 're feeling better !

Kathy , you are making an excellent point .
Marketing and communications should inform every single experience both within and outside an organization .
It is indeed very hard to get that the energy and funds expended to obtain customers should in fact be multiplied or at least maintained in keeping those customers .
It is hard for many reasons .
As marketer and communicator I have always made it my priority to learn the business I was in – whether that be technology , risk management , chemical manufacturing or non-profit medical services – as well as the functional pieces within that business ( customer service , R&D , sales , etc . )
It takes time and tremendous commitment .
The other consideration is that marketing is usually directly attached to sales ; in my experience sales is rewarded on volume while marketing is compensated on holding pricing so there is a decent margin .
This translates organizationally into tension where customer service is caught in between .
It is hard to implement because it means a blurring of the lines and collaboration rather than holding onto a territory .
It involves a commitment to working together and being responsible for each other ’s success where most organizations continue to reward individuals for checking the boxes .
It is more the model of the future , for survival and for excellence ; what has started happening with open space , social networks and blogs .
It requires changing our thinking as well as our behavior and that takes time .
Time many would contend , some organizations are running out of .
Posted by : Valeria Maltoni | Aug 30 , 2006 7:35:37 AM
On the surface , this looks attractive .
But as a technical communicator , I can see soooo many ways this could turn out even worse than the " dry boring , etc. etc. " stuff on the right .
Keep the actual goals of the user documentation in mind , and then use ideas from marketing materials to help achieve those goals more effectively .
Posted by : Milan Davidovic | Aug 30 , 2006 7:36:02 AM
This is type of mindset is prevalent in one other major area ... marriage .
How many marriages do you know that fell apart because there was n't " that spark " that was there when you first met .
In the courting period , men do everything they can to get the girl , or in marketing terms , " make the sale . "
Once the marriage happens , there 's nothing to pursue , nothing to work towards , and ultimately the consumer , or wife , loses interest .
You 've brought up an excellent point here , it just goes to show how this mindset is not just in marketing , but in the core of the human soul unfortunately .

Stone Design - www.stone.design - does a great job in supporting their software and the software 's users .
They offer free upgrades for life .
Their users become their best advertising and the user base continually expands rather than feeding upon itself .
Every user has the latest version - so Stone only has to support one version .
It 's easier and better for Stone and the users - fantastic !
Potential users trying out the product can easily use the user forums to receive support from happy users and the developer himself .
Of course , I 'm a satisfied StoneWorks user .
I 'm getting more out of the software now than I was when I purchased it over five years ago .

I can't speak for other industries but from a camera perspective there is one that was left out as for why their manuals are so bland .
In most cases Canon , Sony , and other manufacturers also release a field guide book that is sold seperately .
If the manual was as useful as the field guide no one would buy the field guide which equals lost profits .

Wow , you _completely_ missed the boat on this article , Kathy !
I think Phillip Fayers comment is bang on - you 're confusing the rather minor issue of aesthetics with the more important issue of audience .
Marketing targets a fundamentally different audience than user documentation .
They deal with people that need to be persuaded , rather than simply informed , which is what user manuals are about .
And persuasion requires fundamentally different material - it needs to be flashy and easy to digest in a very small amount of time .
I.e. it needs to be great - eye candy that fits on one or two pages .
User documentation on the other hand is for people you 've already convinced , and are willing to devote an extended amount of time learning about how to make the most of the product they 've already purchased .
Thus , the material needs to be rich in content .
By your logic , the marketing department should take over the customer support role , too , right ?
After all , Marketing can surely be more convincing as to why you should ignore the problems you 're having and just use the 5 best features instead .
No , leave the documentation responsibilities to the people who understand how users need to learn .
Sure , spend some time making the front and back cover look nicer , sprinkle a few nice pictures at the beginning of each chapter , and make sure the typography and layout are pleasing .
But please do n't mess around with any of the content .
I 've bought the product already , quit trying to sell the damn thing to me and just teach me how to really , really love it for what it does .

Excellent comments !
Deirdre ' , you have the most practical and potentially useful advice :
" The marketing and tech writing staff ... should work closely together on both sides of the sale to ensure a seamless , pleasant , enticing customer experience from start to ... well , we hope the relationship never ends ! "
I think every company that makes a product ought to have that as a serious goal .
Neon :
You 're right -- a boring manual IS definitely better than no manual ... although I 've had some manuals that were nothing but an impenetrable waste of trees .
Nick : I think you 've hit a big problem on the head : " having pubs on time is just a checkbox in the product launch schedule . "
I 've been to so many big foofy " marketing launch team " meetings , but rarely ( and by ' rarely ' I mean ' never ' ) have I been to a lavish a " product manual launch team " meeting .
Nate :
Well done ; )
I think we call that , " false advertising " or ... bait and switch ?
It is indeed a meta issue and applies to so many things .
Valeria : we need more marketers with your oreintation and who care about ALL sides of the business .
Milan :
You made the REAL point : " use IDEAS from marketing materials to help achieve those goals more effectively . "
Paul : See : " bait and switch . " I agree !
daddydoodaa : thanks so much for the pointer to Stone ...
I 'm going to spend some time exploring .
Robert :
Ah , I completely disagree with you on this -- my point is that persuasion and learning do NOT require fundamentally different material , and that in fact the people we most need to bring into the mix of learning / training / documentation are those with the skills to persuade , entice , compell , etc .
I agree that user docs are indeed for people who are already convinced , but to assume that they 're willing to devote an extended time to learning it is the one that hurts us .
You did say the material needs to be " rich in content " , and I agree ... but presentation is a shockingly important part of what makes content rich .
If it were just about the facts and information in the manual , then we would n't have RTFM as a mantra .
My point is that the manual SHOULD be as compelling to read as the glossy brochure .
Does it also need to be technically useful and correct ?
Absolutely , but those two are n't mutually exclusive .
The best of all words would be as Deirdre said -- where we combine the best of both talents .
And I 'd also argue that most companies do NOT have documentation made the responsibility of " people who understand how users need to learn . "
Again , if that were true -- we would n't all be complaining so much about our manuals , and we would n't be moaning about our users who do n't read the manual .
They do n't read the manual because the manual is usually technically correct but so brain - unfriendly as to be virtually unusable .
A dry , boring manual talks to the mind , not the brain -- but it's the brain that we need to please .
We do a great job of this with advertising and brochures -- where we appeal to both their emotions and their rational mind , but we just let all that excitement go in the manual , and the reader has a terrible time trying to stay focused and engaged .
I totally agree with you about " quit trying to sell the damn thing " .
We should not be trying to resell the product , but we SHOULD be trying to sell the user on why they should learn these things that will ultimately help them kick ass : )
I believe your wonderful line , " teach me how to really , really love it for what it does " takes some of the same graphic design / writing loving care that we give to other more high profile projects .
Maybe the best solution is to just make the resources of the graphic design / copywriting talent available to the people who make the manuals , and let those in charge of user learning direct those folks to help create the best , most compelling user documentation that makes it both productive and engaging to read the manual .
Cheers

Why ?
Same reasons guys treat fiancees better than wives , companies recruits better than employees , cell phone companies switchers better than customers , 18 - 34 year olds better than over 55 : getting is sexier than having .
We 're easily bored creatures .
We take existing conditions ( people , places , things ) for granted and glorify the acquisition of new things , not the faithful use of old things .
Basically , as a species , we suffer from ADD .
In grad school I had a psychotherapy prof who used to wax eloquent about , " the addiction of the ego to ' more and more ' ; the call of the new " ... truer words were never spoken .

What a great post !
Well said .
There is such an emphasis by marketers and sales executives to entice and motivate potential new customers , rather than focus on the captive mass and focusing on loyalty and retention .
Treat your current customers the same or better , not worse .
Turn them in to an effective viral marketing channel by engaging and helping them to become as passionate about your product as you are .
You 'll get the customers as a result .

The dream refuses to die .
After The Pirate Bay failed in its quest to buy Sealand , some supporters of the idea believed that the idea of a libertarian paradise was too precious to drop , and they entertained hopes of hoisting the " live free or die " flag over another island , possibly Ile de Caille , a small and uninhabited island off the South American coast .
Thus began the Free Nation Foundation , a group that hopes to form its own country governed by a " philosophy of freedom " where " people could actually live " ( as opposed to all those other countries , where living has been outlawed by tyrants ) .
The failure of the Sealand deal , it turns out , was a good thing .
The rusting naval platform " was too small and aesthetically displeasing to support such a goal , " according to the group , and the weather in the middle of the English Channel is not the stuff of which vacation fantasies are made .
The Free Nation Foundation is a bit like the Free State Project on steroids .
The Free Staters hope to convince 20,000 committed libertarians to pull up stakes and relocate to New Hampshire , a state chosen for its long history of independence , its low tax rate , and its unrestrictive gun laws that allow people to pack heat anywhere except in a courtroom , without even picking up a permit .
The Free Nation Foundation hopes for something similar , but their focus is more global .
The idea is that libertarians from around the world will converge on an island paradise where they can live truly free lives , a place where " the only valid restrictions are those upon actions that disallow the freedom of others . "
Suggested principles for the place include absolute democracy and the free flow of information — as a group that sprung from The Pirate Bay , we imagine that information will flow very freely .
The idea is still in the incubation period , though if it ever comes to fruition , it would be a fascinating sociological experiment ( documentary filmmakers , are you listening ? ) .
Would it end up like utopia , or Lord of the Flies ?

Male and female brains look and work differently
Doctors know that women are more likely than men to have depression , anxiety or an eating disorder , while men are at higher risk of Parkinson 's disease .
Post - mortem and brain imaging studies show that male and female brains are physically different .
Now scientists say they can to link the two together and suggest future disease cures may be " gender - specific " .
Male or female brain ?
The sex of a brain is decided in the mother 's womb and depends , among other factors , on hormone levels .
Higher levels of testosterone makes a male brain and oestrogen a female one .
We should be looking at diseases as male and female
Professor Swaab
Test your brain 's sex
Professor Dick Swaab from The Netherlands Institute for Brain Research in Amsterdam , said the evidence for this comes from studies of transsexuals - people who know , often from a very early age , that they are born in the wrong gender body .
" The theory is that the sex difference in the sex organs develops early in pregnancy - in the first few months while in utero - while sexual differentiation of the brain occurs later in the second half of pregnancy and postnatally . "
That would mean certain factors could interfere with the sexual differentiation of the sex organs and brain in an independent way because there is a time lapse between the two .
" If that was true you would expect to see female structures in male brains .
That is indeed what people have found - a reversed sex difference in the brain of transsexuals . "
Brain gender diseases
He said that because men and women 's brains are different " we should be looking at diseases as male and female " .
" There is a different sex ratio for neurological and psychiatric diseases .
" In depression , it is very clear that sex hormones are directly interfering with the stress axis in the brain .
BRAIN SEX FACTS
Women tend to be better at empathising - guessing other 's emotions and responding appropriately Men are generally better at systemising - investigating how a system works
" We have shown that sensitive proteins [ receptors ] for sex hormones are present in the cells that form the stress axis .
In women there are more oestrogen receptors and in men more androgen receptors present .
" That results in higher prevalence of depression in women compared to men because the stress axis is more sensitive .
" The oestrogens are directly affecting the production of the stress peptides .
" So for the same amount of stress in the environment , women are more prone to develop depression than men . "
Others have shown that hormone levels could play a part in multiple sclerosis .
Dr Carlo Pozzilli and colleagues at the University La Sapienza in Italy found that women with MS had lower levels of the male hormone testosterone throughout their monthly cycle compared to women who did not have MS .
Dr Glenda Gillies and colleagues at Imperial College London have been looking at Parkinson 's Disease , which is far more common in men than in women .
" The idea is that perhaps oestrogen is being neuroprotective so that the neurones that degenerate in PD do n't seem to be as susceptible to the processes in women as they are in men , " she said .
By looking at rats they found this was the case to some extent .
Female rats who had their ovaries removed became just as prone to a chemically induced condition similar to PD as male rats .
When these female mice were given extra oestrogen they got back their natural protection against PD as well .
Similarly , when they took away the source of the testosterone in male rats by castrating them , the brain degeneration was lessened .
However , surprisingly , when they gave the male mice oestrogen the damage was even worse .
His n'
Hers drugs
Dr Gillies said : " Administering oestrogen in the two sexes seems to have opposite effects .
I think we are realising that drugs have to be personalised
Dr Glenda Gillies , Imperial College London
" It may well be that there is something that has been programmed differently in the brain during early development to make it respond in a different way . "
She said work suggested that oestrogen might also help prevent strokes and Alzheimer 's disease , but that it was still very early days .
" Increasingly , I think we are realising that drugs have to be personalised and that one drug is not necessarily going to be the same for each individual . "
She said that most of the drugs available today had been tested on men , which may mean they are not necessarily the best design for women .
Anita Holdcroft , consultant anaesthetist also from Imperial College London , agrees .
She said not only are male and female brains different , but women 's brains change throughout life in relation to fluctuating hormone levels .
" That may well affect disease states and how drugs work . "
She scanned the brains of women before and after they were pregnant and found the brain shrank during pregnancy .
The shrinkage was even greater if the woman had a complication of pregnancy called preeclampsia , but reversed by six months after delivery of the baby .
" We need studies to find out why these things are happening .
" It may well affect disease states and how drugs work and highlights our lack of understanding , " she said .
Glenn Greenwald spots a very disconcerting passage in the National Intelligence Estimate :
The now - declassified summary of the National Intelligence Estimate ( PDF ) on " Trends on Global Terrorism " focuses almost exclusively on Islamic extremists .
But inserted at the very end is this one overlooked , though seemingly quite important , passage that identifies other terrorist threats :
" Anti-U.S. and anti-globalization sentiment is on the rise and fueling other radical ideologies .
This could prompt some leftist , nationalist , or separatist groups to adopt terrorist methods to attack US interests .
The radicalization process is occurring more quickly , more widely , and more anonymously in the Internet age , raising the likelihood of surprise attacks by unknown groups whose members and supporters may be difficult to pinpoint . "
It continues : " We judge that groups of all stripes will increasingly use the Internet to communicate , propagandize , recruit , train and obtain logistical and financial support . "
Prior to 9/11 , the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil was in Oklahoma City , where Timothy McVeigh blew up a federal building in pursuit of his right - wing , anti-federal - government agenda .
But there is nothing in the NIE findings about right - wing or anti-government groups .
Instead , there is a rather stark warning about the danger of " leftist " groups using the Internet to engage in terrorist attacks against the United States .
Is there any basis at all for that warning ?
In upstream reciprocity ( a ) , someone who has just been helped is more likely to help someone else , which by itself is not a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation .
However , combining upstream reciprocity with direct reciprocity ( b ) , does allow for the evolution of cooperation .
Credit : Martin Nowak , et al .
There is a story about a guy who makes a point to be kind to his taxi driver , giving him a sincere thanks and a generous tip .
The guy reasons that , if the taxi driver is then inspired to be kind to each of his passengers , which can be as many as 100 per day , and every passenger goes on to be nice to the next person they meet , who is then kind to another person , and so on , then the guy ’s initial kindness could theoretically brighten the day of thousands of people in a big city .
It ’s a nice scenario , but does it work ?
According to a recent study , no .
It turns out that , by itself , this so - called “ upstream reciprocity ” — or helping someone other than the person who just helped you —is a weak chain where natural selection prefers to reduce cooperativity , and is therefore not a mechanism that facilitates a large - scale increase of cooperation .
However , there ’s another part to upstream reciprocity , say scientists Martin Nowak from Harvard and Sebastien Roch from Berkeley .
Say that some people in the city know that when they do a favor for certain other people , they can expect a favor in return — this is what ’s called “ direct reciprocity . ”
The receiver feels gratitude toward the giver , and gives back — and sometimes , he may give back in a second way — a “ misdirected ” and “ unreasonable ” urge may cause him to be kind to a third person , completely unrelated to the initial giver .
Thus , upstream reciprocity appears as a “ by - product ” of direct reciprocity .
“ Direct reciprocity allows the evolution of cooperation , and upstream reciprocity can hitch - hike on direct reciprocity , ” Nowak and Roch found , explained in their paper from Proceedings of the Royal Society B . “ The interpretation of this finding is : if there is direct reciprocity in a population , then upstream reciprocity will evolve too . ”
Besides direct reciprocity , there is a second model that Nowak and Roch investigated where cooperators may benefit more from upstream reciprocity by forming clusters than in a random spatial orientation .
When surrounded by others with an ability to reciprocate upstream , people who cooperate can pass on their altruism at a high enough rate to allow cooperation to evolve overall .
Nowak and Roch call this interaction between upstream and spatial reciprocity “ synergistic , ” where each mechanism needs the other to succeed .
While in one sense giving back to someone other than the person who gave to you may appear misdirected and unreasonable , Nowak and Roch explain that there is a mechanism that prompts such behavior — something called “ gratitude . ”
Defined as “ the positive emotion one feels after receiving something of value , ” gratitude likely makes an individual interested in the well - being of society as a whole .
So it makes no difference which part of society ( e.g. which person ) receives his kindness .
Nowak and Roch speculate that still different situations and models will reveal enormous consequences of upstream reciprocity for human and animal behavior .
“ [ These extensions ] can lead to an ‘ epidemiology of altruism ’ resulting in an explosive increase in altruistic acts , ” they conclude .
“ For a change , this is a pandemic which would be welcomed by all of us . ”

Greise Tiere Der Schildkröten - Opa und die französische Revolution
Bislang galt Galapagos - Riesenschildkröte Harriet als das älteste Tier der Welt .
Doch nun ist in Kalkutta eine andere Schildkröte gestorben - und verglichen mit dem greisen Reptil wirkt selbst die 175 Jahre alte Harriet wie ein junger Hüpfer .
OK , here it is : a proper developer article .
After all , this is Reg Developer , so it 's about time .
Today 's subject is an Apache spinoff project : the APR lies at the heart of the webserver , but is also a standalone library , and is extensively used in separate projects : most famously Subversion .
But before diving in , here are a couple of things for your diary :
ApacheCon , the main Apache conference , will take place in Dublin , 26 - 30 June ( two days tutorials + three days conference ) .
Earlybird registration is available until 29 May .
So , start working on the boss !
If you are a student , Google 's Summer of Code may offer an opportunity to undertake a really interesting open source project , and get paid for it .
Apache is one of many open source organisations participating .
The need for APR
Despite its age and patchy heritage , C has a stronger claim than any other programming language to be the industry standard .
Yet , it has many shortcomings , and typically requires quite a lot more programming effort to work with than higher - level and more modern languages .
For example , C lacks dynamically resizing strings and arrays , and data types such as hash tables that are standard in scripting languages .
More fundamentally , C leaves all resource management in the hands of the programmer , and avoiding memory ( or other resource ) leaks can be a major chore .
Finally , it is harder to write portable , cross - platform code in C than in scripting languages .
APR serves to deal with these issues , bridging the gap between C and a scripting language in terms of programmer productivity .
The basic areas dealt with by APR include resource management , cross- platform programming , and a range of utility classes .
Resource Management
Perhaps the most fundamental barrier to productivity in C is the problem of resource management .
C programmers are responsible for all resource allocation , and ( generally much harder ) ensuring that resources are always cleaned up after use , but never used after cleanup !
Dealing with resource management can consume an utterly disproportionate amount of programmer effort , and generate very difficult bugs .
APR 's solution to this is " pools " , which lie at the heart of APR and Apache .
Pools serve to allocate memory ( faster than malloc on most platforms ) , and to ensure it is cleaned up at the appropriate time .
They can also register cleanups for other resources , for example , to close a filehandle or socket , or release a lock .
Typical usage of a pool is to tie it to an object with a well - defined lifetime ( such as , in the webserver , a TCP connection or HTTP request ) , so objects can be allocated with that same lifetime and then just left .
Dynamic Resources
A secondary shortcoming in C is the lack of built - in support for dynamically - resizing resources such as strings and arrays .
APR provides this too , built on top of dynamic memory allocation with pools .
For example , whereas in C's stdio , we have :
sprintf ( buf , fmt , varargs ) ;
APR 's strings module gives us instead :
buf = apr_psprintf ( pool , fmt , varargs ) ;
freeing the programmer from the need to compute the size of buf and allocate in advance , or make a guess and leave the code vulnerable to buffer overflows .
Basic Class Library
Higher - level and scripting languages have at least dynamic arrays and hashes as native datatypes .
APR provides these for C programmers :
Array is implemented as a stack , and can be used as an automatically - resizing array or queue .

Hash is a hash table , in which keys and entries are ( pointers to ) arbitrary data types .

Table is a table indexed by character strings .
As such , it is less general than the hash , but it supports a number of additional operations , such as merging multiple values for a key into a comma-separated list .
It is used extensively in Apache to represent tables such as the HTTP headers in a request / response , where these operations are required .

Bucket is an arbitrary data container or source , that lies at the heart of Apache 's I/O .
Buckets are contained in bucket brigades , which are an instantiation of the ring .
Dynamic Resource Pools
Another level of resource management is the apr_reslist , which manages a dynamically - resizable pool of typically - complex resources .
An example is Apache 's DBD architecture , that uses a reslist to implement a pool of connections to a backend SQL database .
Portability Layer
Aside from resource management , the other fundamental purpose of the APR is to provide a common cross- platform API for operations falling outside standard C and involving a platform - specific library .
This aims to encompass the platform - dependent operations likely to be used by Apache and its modules , such as :
I/O , including network and filesystem operations .
Process and thread management , conditions , mutexs .
Dynamic loading of code .
Identity management and system security .
Shared memory and memory mapping .
Signals , Events , Environment .
In addition to specific modules , there are general portability aids , such as pre-processor macros that expand to platform - specific declarations where necessary ( Windows ' dllimport / dllexport being prime examples where vendor - defined information that should belong to the build flags has to go in the source code ) .
Your humble scribe has worked mostly in environments where portability is not an issue .
Before getting seriously involved with Apache , I 'd ported Perl and Java reasonably painlessly , but found C and C++ more trouble than they were worth for nontrivial jobs .
Writing Apache modules I 've found I can develop on Linux or BSD and later compile on Solaris , MacOSX , or even Windows with no extra effort , or at worst half an hour ’s worth of simple hacks .
Of course , the APR portability layer is the key to this .
As proof of the pudding , Site Valet ( for which I am responsible ) is moving from C++ STL - based classes to APR - based classes to make it maintainable across platforms .
More ..
In addition to these core functions , APR provides a range of utilities .
On the one hand , basic but important things such as time / date and cryptographic APIs .
On the other hand , high - level abstractions such as apr_dbm ( DBM databases ) , apr_dbd ( SQL databases ) , apr_ldap , and apr_memcache , in the tradition of scripting language abstractions such as Perl 's Tie / AnyDBM and DBI / DBD .
Last but not least , APR makes use of the pre-processor to implement the infrastructure for hooks that form the basis for the Apache module API and related constructs .
Using APR
As usual , I 've passed the thousand words while still having a lot to say .
So rather than show usage examples and the shape of an APR - based program here , I 'll give you some URLs for further reading .
If this article has aroused your interest in using the APR , INOUE Seiichiro 's tutorial is a great introduction .
Tutorials on selected APR topics in the context of Apache exist at Apache Tutor .
My forthcoming book Applications Development with Apache devotes a complete chapter to a more extensive introduction to the APR .
Finally , of course , the APR project site includes general information , downloads and API documentation . ®
The project began by talking to " the man in the Panama hat "
By Sean Coughlan
BBC News Magazine
Ever wondered who that person is you see each day on the way to work ?
Never spoken to them , but you see them every single morning .
I WALK TO WORK
See Susie Rea 's photos here
You know what clothes they wear , the paper they read , the way they always stand at the same place on the platform .
They also see you there every day .
But they 're still strangers .
These familiar strangers are part of urban living - neighbours you 've never spoken to , the bloke who works in the cafe , the woman who sells you a newspaper , the usual suspects on the train .
Photographer Susie Rea is working on a project examining these odd , displaced relationships - where people are part of the landscape of our daily lives but remain anonymous and out of contact .
Cat in the hat
" It 's a weird one - there is an intimacy with someone you recognise , but they are still a total stranger , " says the photographer .
And she 's even broken the great non-talking taboo by approaching these people to ask them about their lives and to take their photographs .
People can see the world , but know little of the streets around them
" It struck me as strange that you could go past these people every day and not know who they are , " says Ms Rea , who like the people she has photographed , lives in north - west London .
" You could see these people more often than some of your own friends - but you do n't know anything about them , you do n't know their names , whether they 've got family or what they do with their lives . "
Her starting point was seeing a man in a Panama hat each day .
He was always wearing it and it intrigued her to think about who he might be - conjecturing that he must be " a writer or a teacher , someone who could get away with wearing that hat " .
But approaching him was difficult .
" It takes quite a lot to meet someone you recognise but have never spoken to ... it 's a very weird experience , " she says .
No man 's land
After failing to take the plunge a couple of times , eventually she spoke to the man in the Panama hat .
He turned out to be a jeweller - and when she saw him each day he was walking to the synagogue where he was training to be a rabbi .
Urban living can be about ignoring the people nearest
From this starting point , she began to approach others who are daily fixtures on her way to work - people who worked in shops she used , neighbours who stood at the gate , passers - by whose lives briefly overlapped with her own .
Her photos began to map out this community of strangers - people from Barbados , India , Iran , Ireland and Australia .
There was even someone there from London .
And the guys who ran the chip shop turned out to be from Macedonia and Kurdistan .
And from only knowing them as the " older gentleman from number 220 " or " the man in the shop that sells everything " , the photographer began to flesh out their characters , learning something about their background and beliefs .
But urban life is full of contradictions and can still bite you when you least expect it .
Because even though Susie Rea had made a new circle of friends out of these familiar faces , when she was locked out of her house , her own neighbours would n't help .
" It 's a strange beast , " she says .
Screen community
Her project also highlights how little we know about what goes on outside our own front door .
A community is now a non-geographical concept .
Friends and family are scattered widely - with contacts kept by mobile phone and e-mail .
And the real - life neighbourhood becomes an unknown zone .
Commuters occupy the same space while staying strangers
We can look at the television or the internet to find out about what 's happening thousands of miles away , day and night .
But the streets outside ?
It can be a blindspot , a no - man 's land which we navigate but never really know .
And the more often you see people you recognise but never talk to , the more difficult it becomes to cross that boundary .
The next stage of Susie Rea 's " I walk to work " project is to carry out deeper research into the lives of the people she meets , capturing more information about these familiar faces who share the same streets .
Looking around a group of commuters , plugged into their iPods and sealed into their own thoughts , it might go against the grain to try to reach out .
But this is what the photographer wants to explore .
" It 's the things that are around us that are really fascinating ...
I like dealing with what 's under my nose , " she says .
" It 's about extending your hand . "

I commuted from Bath to Swindon once as a trainee teacher and began talking to a woman who also commuted on that route .
It turned out she was also a teacher .
We talked every morning on the train .
After three months , my training was over .
On our last journey together we finally exchanged our names .

Fascinating article - I know the exact feeling .
There are people I see most days while travelling to and from work , yet the most conversation I 've had with any of them is a couple of words .
I 'm wondering now what they are like outside that narrow window into their lives I 've seen - does the woman with the Lake Wobegon book read anything else ?
Does the woman who works in my building do the same thing as I do ?
Does the man with the briefcase always carry it only in his left hand ?

This is so true , I thought I was the only one who gave nicknames to people I used to see every day .
I used to walk past this one man every morning for two years nicknaming him " the Australian " now I wish I had spoken to him and found out if he really was from Australia !
E. Long , Ipswich
For the past few years I have driven past three such strangers on the way to work every day : Big Ears , Weird Girl and Nick the Greek ( probably not their real names ) .
I 'd love to know who they really are , what they do and what they are like but I think these points will remain a mystery .
However , I am planning on shouting ' Merry Christmas ' to all of them as I speed past this year .
Seb , Leicester
What a great idea .
The same applies to your neighbour next door .
You always see the same person all the time , everyday but never really know who they they are , what they do and who they stay with .
Knowing the person you always cross your paths with can help make this world a safer and more secure place .
Wilfred Osumo , Lucern , Switzerland
Loved this article and the pictures - ordinary normal people doing everyday stuff - but with a story to tell - this is going on all around us everyday - we should make more contact with each other .
E. Taylor , Isle of Man
I walk to work and always passed the same person every day without saying hello .
After several months I thought , " this is stupid " , so I stopped her , said hello and introduced myself .
After that each morning we shared a smile and a hello - until a couple of weeks later she changed the way she walks to work .
It was never anything other than a smile and a hello , so I guess some people prefer to be left undisturbed .
It 's a pity , as it brightened up an otherwise routine walk to work .

I walk my dogs at 6.30 every morning .
I see the same people day in day out walking their dogs too or going to their place of work .
One person facinates me .
We cross every morning and every time we acknowledge each other .
He is middle aged , carries a napsack and is clearly off to work .
At that hour of the morning , neither of us are ready to engage in conversation , so I suppose I will always wonder what his job actually is .
N. Summers , Salisbury
Your article struck a chord with me .
I have been married to my husband for 8 years , but have actually " known " him for 13 years as we lived in the same small community in Edinburgh and walked the same route to work each day .
We eventually met in a local wine bar one night while out with separate groups of friends , and at that point we realised we had passed each other many times .
We now live in another part of Edinburgh , have two young children and try very hard to get to know our neighbours .
But even in the suburbs it can be difficult as many peole work during the day .
Not trying would be wrong though as neighbours add to the fabric of our family lives .

This is the first time I have added a comment to an article .
It is not something I normally do but , this is such a fantastic idea that I wanted to express my thanks to Rea .
I enjoyed the pictures and commentary very much .
I have always been fascinated with the stories of the people we meet ; veterans of past wars , people on trains and planes .
Every one with their place in the world and their story to tell .
An inspiring project , I do hope Rea carries on .

I love Putney Bridge tube station for watching peoples lives progress .
There was the ' Curly Haired Tiny Lady ' , who I noticed one day appeared with an engagement ring , sometime later a fantastic tan and a wedding ring - and later still a beach - ball pregnancy bump .
And does anyone else cringe at the ' Crazy Elf Woman ' who gets totally stressed by the tube and always demands a seat ?

I catch a small bus once a week that wends its way through the neighbourhood , and every week the same people get on .
For 18 months
I 've exchanged pleasantries and chit - chat with a woman from our road who also catches it - including heavy - weight topics like the redundancies at her hospital , our childcare dilemmas etc - but it was only this week that I found out her name .
Because she told my toddler .

A friend and I walk from Victoria to St Mary 's Hosp - Paddington each morning through Hyde Park .
Already we have constructed what we imagine to be the stories and life histories of the people we pass day to day .
We marvel at the bravery of the early morning sepentine swimmers and even have a name , Ned , for the Black Swan we see all alone on the water each day .
Maybe soon we 'll be brave enough to say Hello to some of our ' intimate strangers ' .
Neil , London
I passed Eiran many times on my way to work , and a while back he introduced himself and we agreed that we would say ' hello ' from now on .
I lived in the North of England for 20 years and was always told that London was not a friendly place .
I have learnt that if I am friendly , everywhere around me seems friendlier .
I sometimes buy my lunch at George 's chippy .

I ride a motorcyle into work in central London and used to pass a lady walking her greyhound and then a chap with a beard and glasses at practically the same spots every morning at about 06:45 .
About two weeks ago I started leaving 15 minutes earlier and have not seen them since then .
I have been thinking " I wonder if they are wondering what has happened to that biker that used to drive past at the same time everyday .... "
This article makes me think perhaps they do wonder !
Claire Dyson , Weybridge
Great article , so true .
I and my parents had lived in our house for 10 years and never spoken to our neighbours .
Then the 1987 hurricane happened and we had a huge tree crash through our roof .
That day the neighbours all came round to have a look and offer food etc .
My parents still live in the same house , but the neighbours have never spoken since .
Only one day in 30 years when everyone aknowledged they were part of the same community .
C Taylor , Heathfield East Sussex
Oh , stop it , you touchy - feely freak !
I live in London precisely because people here are NOT overly intimate .
I like the fact that I walk amongst strangers , I love the fact I am not subject to tedious drivel from people who happen to impinge upon my geography .
If you want to know your neighbours , go live up North or something - stop assuming we all want to be like you .
Tony , London
What a marvellous article , and a wonderful idea .
I am retired now , but walk my dog regularly each day , and by doing this have made many new friends who also own dogs .
My dog has made new friends of her own too , and we often meet up around the same time so we can chat , and our dogs can run and play together !
Everyone gets on wonderfully , owning a dog is a great way to make friends !

I recently passed my driving test and no longer get the train to work .
I wonder how " ten year - old buiness - man " , " Gorgeous tea - cake man " , " Dr. Earwax " , " tousled bike man " and " yawning toast woman " are .

I commute into London from Surrey each day , and would see a certain gentleman on the station everyday , we would nod and smile .
Eventually he approached me and we began chatting each morning on the train .
Then we went for a drink after work and got to know each other .
We are now engaged and getting married in July 2007 .
Goes to show how far a little friendly gesture can go !
Traci , London
This is brilliant .
I cannot stand the totally bored / rude exterior of every commuter , and the fact that it is seen as such a ' weird experience ' to just go and talk to someone who you see five days a week .
have some banter with them .
I think it shows quite a sad side to society that people put up walls around them and wont even help when you get locked out of your house !
Oliver , London
My partner commutes to London for work every day , and has made a circle of " commuter " friends who all sit in roughly the same seats on the same train carriage every day .
They chat and joke for the hour long journey to / from work , and then go away and lead seperate , unrelated lives .
Last week my partner spent a Saturday morning buying small Xmas presents for his commuter buddies , as they 're having a little party on the early morning train to work .
Earlier this year they celebrated one of the group 's birthday with cake on the train .
It is strange how this group of acquaintances operate / define their friendship purely during the hour or two they spend on the train together every day .
Outside of this milieu they do n't really know much about each other , but have managed to become a circle of friends who convene , almost ritually , on the commuter train !

Your comment
NEOCLASSICAL economics is built on the assumption that humans are rational beings who have a clear idea of their best interests and strive to extract maximum benefit ( or “ utility ” , in economist - speak ) from any situation .
In this account , price is a signal that helps you decide the combination of work , spending and saving that suits you best .
Neoclassical economics assumes that the process of decision - making is rational .
But that contradicts growing evidence that decision - making draws on the emotions — even when reason is clearly involved .
The role of emotions in decisions makes perfect sense .
For situations met frequently in the past , such as obtaining food and mates , and confronting or fleeing from threats , the neural mechanisms required to weigh up the pros and cons will have been honed by evolution to produce an optimal outcome .
Since emotion is the mechanism by which animals are prodded towards such outcomes , evolutionary and economic theory predict the same practical consequences for utility in these cases .
But does this still apply when the ancestral machinery has to respond to the stimuli of urban modernity ?
One of the people who thinks that it does not is George Loewenstein , an economist at Carnegie Mellon University , in Pittsburgh .
In particular , he suspects that modern shopping has subverted the decision - making machinery in a way that encourages people to run up debt .
To prove the point he has teamed up with two psychologists , Brian Knutson of Stanford University and Drazen Prelec of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , to look at what happens in the brain when it is deciding what to buy .
Discounting the future
In a study just published in Neuron , the three researchers asked 26 volunteers to decide whether to buy a series of products such as a box of Godiva chocolates or a DVD of the television show “ Sex and the City ” that were flashed on a computer screen one after another .
In each round of the task , the researchers first presented the product and then its price , with each step lasting four seconds .
In the final stage , which also lasted four seconds , they asked the volunteers to make up their minds .
To make the task more realistic , two randomly selected sales were real — paid for out of a $ 40 credit from which the volunteer got to keep the change , as well .
While the volunteers were taking part in the experiment , the researchers scanned their brains using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
This measures blood flow and oxygen consumption in the brain , as an indication of its activity .
The researchers found that different parts of the brain were involved at different stages of the test .
The nucleus accumbens — known from previous experiments to be involved in processing rewarding stimuli such as food , recreational drugs and monetary gain , as well as in the anticipation of those rewards — was the most active part when a product was being displayed .
Moreover , the level of its activity correlated with the reported desirability of the product in question .
When the price appeared , however , fMRI reported more activity in other parts of the brain .
Excessively high prices increased activity in the insular cortex , a brain region linked to expectations of pain , monetary loss and the viewing of upsetting pictures .
The researchers also found greater activity in this region of the brain when the subject decided not to purchase an item .
Price information activated the medial prefrontal cortex , too .
This part of the brain is involved in rational calculation , and is known from previous experiments using trading games to be involved in balancing the expected and actual outcomes of monetary decisions .
In this experiment its activity seemed to correlate with a volunteer 's reaction to both product and price , rather than to price alone .
Thus , the sense of a good bargain evoked higher activity levels in the medial prefrontal cortex , and this often preceded a decision to buy .
People 's shopping behaviour therefore seems to have piggy - backed on old neural circuits evolved for anticipation of reward and the avoidance of hazards .
What Dr Loewenstein found interesting was the separation of the assessment of the product ( which seems to be associated with the nucleus accumbens ) from the assessment of its price ( associated with the insular cortex ) , even though the two are then synthesised in the prefrontal cortex .
His hypothesis is that rather than weighing the present good against future alternatives , as orthodox economics suggests happens , people actually balance the immediate pleasure of the prospective possession of a product with the immediate pain of paying for it .
That makes perfect sense as an evolved mechanism for trading .
If one useful object is being traded for another ( or , in the modern context , for hard cash ) , the future utility of what is being given up is embedded in the object being traded .
Emotion is as capable of assigning such a value as reason .
Buying on credit , though , may be different .
The abstract nature of credit cards , coupled with the deferment of payment that they promise , may modulate the “ con ” side of the calculation in favour of the “ pro ” .
Whether it actually does so will be the subject of further experiments that the three researchers are now designing .
These will test whether people with distinctly different spending behaviour , such as miserliness and extravagance , experience different amounts of pain ( or , at least , show different patterns of brain activity ) in response to prices .
They will also assess whether , in the same individuals , buying with credit cards eases the pain compared with paying by cash .
If they find that it does , then credit cards may have to join the list of things such as fatty and sugary foods , and recreational drugs , that subvert human instincts in ways that seem pleasurable at the time but can have a long and malign aftertaste .
Editor ’s note :
In this column , the former New York Times Mideast bureau chief argues that America ’s failure in Iraq and Israel ’s humiliation in Lebanon have emboldened and empowered those in the Arab world who seek to topple U.S. - backed regimes in the Middle East and cripple the Jewish state .
The Israeli debacle in Lebanon , along with the failed occupation in Iraq , has given many Arabs , after decades of humiliation , hope that armed guerrilla resistance by Islamic radicals will topple U.S. - backed regimes in the Middle East and cripple the Jewish state .
The callous comment by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the Israeli bombing of Lebanon signaled “ the birth pangs ” of a new Middle East has turned out to be true , although not in the way the secretary intended .
The dogged resistance by bands of irregular fighters , disciplined in battle and indoctrinated with radical Islam , has seen Washington ’s most vociferous enemies , including Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah , lionized throughout the region .
This resistance has eroded the power of pro-Western regimes in Jordan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia .
As we prepare for Round Two , with Israel plotting to again bomb and invade Lebanon , it is clear that these wars of attrition are about to become cyclical , with Israel and Washington clinging blindly to the illusion that increased force will solve their dilemmas .
Israel and Washington see Lebanon and Iraq as temporary setbacks .
They believe that these setbacks can be rectified with modified tactics , greater force and more sophisticated counterinsurgency campaigns .
But the Arab world views Lebanon and Iraq differently .
It sees the battles there as finally challenging the long subjugation at the hands of the Zionist state and its American backer .
A second attempt to neutralize Hezbollah will mark the beginning of a prolonged conflict between radical Islamists and the Jewish state .
A strike by Washington on Iran will unleash waves of rage and revulsion throughout the Arab nations .
These are battles Israel and America cannot win .
The 34 days of fighting , which saw Israel withdraw in humiliation without freeing its captured soldiers or defeating Hezbollah , along with the potent insurgency in Iraq , has awakened the Arab world from its stupor .
Hezbollah is busy regrouping , rearming and restocking the rockets and weapons its guerrilla fighters used effectively against Israel ’s conventional army .
The network of tunnels and bunkers , along with the classic hit - and - run tactics of small teams of fighters , neutralized the Israeli air campaign and incursion .
And Israel , whose soldiers in Lebanon often lacked basic supplies , including food , gasoline and water , along with useful intelligence , was left to lash out blindly at an elusive enemy , as its American counterpart does daily in the streets of Baghdad .
The U.S. failure in Iraq and Hezbollah ’s stubborn resistance illustrate that modern armies such as Israel ’s , equipped with the world ’s fourth largest air force , are not invincible .
These failures have exposed the impotence of the U.S. - backed regimes in Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Jordan and Egypt , which have nothing to show for their collaboration with Washington other than increasing repression , isolation and corruption .
Iran and radical Shiites are now at the vanguard of the struggle to wipe out the Jewish state and remove the United States from the region , something that makes the Sunni - led regimes , especially those in countries with large Shiite populations , very nervous .
This is the first time since the creation of the state of Israel that an Arab force has withstood an Israeli assault .
The despair that has gripped the Arab world since Israel crushed the Egyptian , Syrian and Jordanian armies in the 1967 war has been replaced by a giddy hope that radical Islam is the tool to restore Arab dignity .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Saudi King Abdullah and Jordan ’s King Abdullah II , all of whom have criticized Hezbollah and excoriated the Iranian regime , have been silent , especially with opinion polls in their own countries showing wide support for Iran and Hezbollah .
The old politics of appeasement with Washington , which they represent , have failed .
The new politics of armed confrontation , led by Shiite radicals , have been validated .
Another upheaval in the Middle East , such as U.S. bombing of suspected nuclear sites in Iran or a second Israeli incursion into south Lebanon , could see the cracks in these unpopular pro-Western regimes lead to their disintegration .
An attack on Iran will solidify the power of the Iranian regime .
At best , these pro-Western regimes , with little credibility and support , will become ineffectual , unable , because of popular revulsion , to do Washington ’s bidding .
Such attacks will also see widening support for armed radical groups that have captured the imagination of many in the Islamic world .
The Iraqi prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , for example , refused to condemn Hezbollah and did not , although pressured by Washington , side with Israel .
Israel and Washington appear not to have grasped this seismic change .
Israeli leaders , busy studying the failures of the first incursion , appear as intoxicated with their military power as when they began bombing Lebanon .
Washington mouths its usual empty promises about a negotiated solution to the Palestinian and Israeli conflict and its tired clichs about building democracy in Iraq and the Middle East .
The quiet endorsement of the Israeli strangulation of the Hamas - led Palestinian Authority , along with the carnage unleashed by U.S. forces in Iraq , makes Washington appear more and more remote , even ridiculous .
The blunders by Israel and the United States have left Iran as the undisputed leader in the Muslim world .
These blunders have empowered the radical Islamic groups allied with Iran and have indeed ushered in the birth of a new Middle East , one that understands that the days of Israel and Washington ’s hegemony in the region are doomed .
My only non-professional blog category is on running .
That reflects one of my primary personal interests in the time since I started blogging a year and a half ago .
If I had started blogging twenty - five years ago , the extra category would have been on chess .
From grade school into college , but especially in high school , I played a lot of chess , more than anyone I knew .
I read chess books , I played chess variants , and I surrounded myself with the miscellania of the chess world .
Chess did n't seem especially popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s , but we were still in the midst of the Fischer boom , which had created a resurgence in the popularity of chess in America .
The headiness of the Fischer boom years eventually passed .
Independently , I got busy at college with computer science ( and girls ) and had less and less time to play .
But I still love the game .
A recent article in the New York Times talks about the further decline of American chess .
The article 's author , Jennifer Shahade , is a former U.S. women 's champion and one of only a few young native - born Americans to have accomplished much in the world of chess over the last decade .
There are many great minds who still play chess in the U.S. when they are young , but they are pulled toward more attractive -- and lucrative -- endeavors as they get older .
Shahade points to poker , which has undergone a massive boom in popularity over the last decade , as a source of possible ideas for saving chess from its decline .
Her suggestions are reasonable goals accompanied by simple strategies for reaching them .
The chess world needs to offer ways for adults to learn the game effectively on - line and to promote the sporting , competitive element of chess .
( And I can support Shahade 's claim that a long tournament game of chess is much more tiring than many physical activities . )
But ultimately the key is finding a way to make chess seem cool and exciting again .
A breakthrough on the world stage by a player like Hikaru Nakamura could turn the trick , but it 's hard to engineer that sort of event .
Others interested in promoting chess have adopted more , um , salacious methods .
Consider the World Chess Beauty Contest , reported in another NYT article on the same day as Shahade's .
The WCBC tries to draw people -- well , at least teenage boys -- to chess by focusing on the many beautiful young women chess players around the world .
When you are looking at pictures of these young ladies , just do n't forget this : most of them are really strong players who can easily defeat the vast majority of chessplayers in the world .
But , for the most part , they are not competitive with the very best women players in the world , let alone the top men .
Still , the thought that supermodel Carmen Kass is an avid chess player , is president of the Estonian Chess Federation last year , and is dating German grandmaster Eric Lobron makes me secretly happy .
( The above picture is from the second NYT article and shows Kass playing speed chess with Indian super - grandmaster Viswanathan Anand , the world 's # 2 player . )
Shahade talks about how we could heighten interest in chess tournaments by making them more thrilling , more immediate .
Chess tournaments are usually arranged as round - robin or Swiss system affairs , neither of which tends to create do - or - die situations that heighten in intensity as the tournament progresses .
In contrast , consider U.S. college basketball 's March Madness -- and then imagine what it would be like as as a round - robin .
Boring -- and much less variable in its outcome .
We all love the mere chance that a Princeton or a UNI will come out of nowhere to upset a Duke or an Indiana , even if it does n't happen very often .
But in chess , the chances of a much lower - ranked player upsetting a better player is quite small .
The standard deviation on performance at the highest levels of chess is remarkably small .
When you try to cross more than one level , forget it .
For example , the chance that I could beat Gary Kasparov , or even earn a draw against him , is essentially zero .
My proposal to increase the competitiveness of games among players of different skill levels comes from the 19th century : odds .
Odds in chess are akin to handicaps in golf .
For example , I might offer a weaker player " pawn odds " by removing my king 's bishop 's pawn before commencing play .
In that case , I would probably play the white pieces ; if I gave pawn odds and played black , then I would be giving " pawn and move " odds .
( Moving first is a big advantage in chess . )
Back in the 1800s , it was common for even the best players in the world to take odds from better players .
America 's first great chess champion , Paul Morphy made his reputation by beating most of America 's best players , and many of Europe 's best players at " pawn and move " odds .
Since the advent of the chess clock , another way to handicap a chess game is to give time odds .
I spent many an evening as a teenager playing speed chess with Indianapolis masters who gave me the advantage of playing in 1.5 minutes against my 5 minutes .
Even at those odds , I lost more quarters than I won for a long time ...
But I felt like I had a chance in every game we played , despite the fact that those guys were much better than I was .
My experience offering odds has been less successful .
When I 've tried to offer time odds to students and former students , they balked or outright refused .
To them , playing at advantage seemed unsporting .
But the result has generally been one - sided games and , within a while , one or both of us loses interest .
I 've never tried to give piece odds to these folks , because material seems more real to them than time and consequently the odds would seem even less sporting .
Odds chess is n't the complete answer to making top - level chess more attractive , though it might have its place in novelty tournaments .
But giving odds could make coffeehouse chess , casual games wherever , and local tournaments more interesting for more players -- and thus offer a route to increased popularity .
This whole discussion raises another , more fundamental question .
Should we even care about the popularity of chess ?
The conventional wisdom is yes ; chess is a fun way for kids to learn to concentrate , to think strategically , to learn and deploy patterns , and so on .
There is some evidence that children who play chess realize benefits from these skills in school , especially in math .
But in today 's world there are many more challenging and realistic games these days than there used to be , and maybe those games -- or learning to play a musical instrument , or learning to program a computer -- are better uses for our young brainpower .
As a lover of the game , though , I still harbor a romantic notion that chess is worth saving .
One thing is for certain , though .
Poker is a step backwards intellectually .
It may be a lot of fun and require many useful skills , but it is much shallower than chess , or even more challenging card games , such as bridge .
The article on Jennifer Shahade that I link to above ends with a paragraph that sums up both the challenge in making chess more popular and a reason why it is worth the effort to do so :
" People sometimes ask me if chess is fun , " Jennifer says .
" ' Fun ' is not the word I 'd use .
Tournament chess is not relaxing .
It 's stressful , even if you win .
The game demands total concentration .
If you mind wanders for a moment , with one bad move you can throw away everything you 've painstakingly built up . "
Modern society does n't seem to value things that are n't always fun and light , at least not as much as it could .
But we could do our children a favor if we helped them learn to concentrate so deeply , to confront a challenge and painstakingly work toward a solution .
Maybe then math and science -- and computer programming -- would n't seem unusually or unexpectedly hard .
And maybe then more students would have the mental skills needed to appreciate the beauty , power , and , yes , fun in work that challenges them .
Like computer science .
SOME TIME AFTER having lunch in Iraq with the junior senator from Connecticut , Time magazine Baghdad bureau chief Michael Ware told an interviewer , “ Either Sen .
Lieberman is so divorced from reality that he ’s completely lost the plot , or he knows he ’s spinning a line . ”
Although Ware was referring specifically to Joe Lieberman ’s observations about Iraq , his characterization perfectly summarizes the former vice presidential candidate ’s whole political approach , and it explains why so many Democrats are eager to see him lose in a primary election next month .
Many political observers have tried to paint the candidacy of Lieberman ’s challenger , Ned Lamont , as merely a referendum on the invasion of Iraq , which Lieberman supported .
This newspaper ’s editorial board declared it “ disturbing ” that the senator has been “ targeted for defeat by national fundraisers based on his foreign policy views . ”
The reason for Lamont ’s popularity , explained the Washington Post ’s David Broder , “ is simple : the war . ”
The war is certainly a reason -- and given how events continue to devolve in Iraq , a perfectly sufficient one -- but those who focus only on that miss the broader opposition to Lieberman and the kind of politics he represents .

For too long he has defined his image by distancing himself from other Democrats , cozying up to right - wing media figures and , at key moments , directing his criticisms at members of his own party instead of at the Republicans in power .
Late last year , after President Bush ’s job approval ratings hit record lows , Lieberman decided to lash out at the administration ’s critics , writing in the ultraconservative Wall Street Journal editorial pages that “ we undermine presidential credibility at our nation ’s peril . ”
In this he echoed the most toxic of Republican talking points -- that criticizing the conduct of the war is actually damaging to national security .
Lieberman has a long history of providing cover for the worst of Republican actions while enthusiastically serving as his own party ’s scold .
After the Senate acquitted President Clinton on all impeachment charges , Lieberman called for his censure .
More recently , he rejected a call by Sen. Russell D. Feingold ( D - Wis. ) to censure Bush over the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping program , calling the attempt “ divisive . ”
Lieberman looks happiest when playing a “ Fox News Democrat , ” as he did in a February appearance on Sean Hannity ’s radio program , during which the two exchanged compliments and expressions of friendship and Hannity offered to campaign for him .
The senator seems to enjoy Sunday talk shows more than actually doing his job .
New Orleans could have been spared the hacktastic performance of Michael Brown , the unqualified former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , had Lieberman not shooed him through the confirmation process in a breezy 42 - minute hearing .

Lieberman ’s relationship with the Democratic Party has been one of convenience , not principle , as was proved definitively in late June when he declared his intention to run as an independent if he loses the Aug. 8 primary .
Proclaiming that he had loyalties “ greater than those to my party , ” he decided he would deserve a do - over if rejected by Connecticut Democrats .
In what could be the final tragic act of his political career , Lieberman might soon discover that Republicans do n’t love Democrat - bashing Democrats enough to actually vote for them .
Much of the interest in this race is not because of Lamont but rather his perceived base of support from bloggers , including me .
One prominent pundit claimed that Lamont ’s online backers were practitioners of “ blogofascism ” ; another called the campaign an “ inquisition . ”
Online political discourse can indeed be caustic and combative , like talk radio .
But too many in the Lieberman wing of the party have elevated civility and the illusion of bipartisan comity over challenging Republicans ’ failed policies .
In the process , they have echoed GOP jargon in dismissing critics as “ angry ” and “ hate - filled . ”
Politics is a contact sport .
Those who would paper it over with a veneer of false propriety are pretending it ’s something that it is not .
More than that , loud and raucous debate is a healthy part of our democracy .
Lieberman ’s problem is n’t bloggers , it ’s the voters of Connecticut , who seem to be increasingly tired of his support for some very uncivil policies , including federal intervention into the Terri Schiavo case , the administration ’s operations at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay and , yes , that disastrous invasion of Iraq .
Did Alexey Pajitnov invent a pharmatronic ?
Ten years ago , a gleam lit Alexey Pajitnov 's eyes .
As an AI man in Moscow , Pajitnov had designed games for fun until an ancient Roman puzzle , Pentamino , made him blink .
He tweaked its simple geometric formations into real time .
And thus , with brackets delineating blocks , Tetris was born .
Even spanking new , Tetris was so addictive that Pajitnov himself was instantly hooked .
He laughs , " You ca n't imagine .
I could n't finish the prototype !
I started to play and never had time to finish the code .
People kept playing , playing , playing .
My best friend said , ' I can't live with your Tetris anymore . ' "
That friend , former clinical psychologist Vladimir Pokhilko , recalls , " When I met Alexey , I had heard about Tetris .
He gave it to me and I took it to my lab at the Moscow Medical Institute .
Everybody stopped working .
So I deleted it from every computer . "
Everyone went back to work , until a new version appeared in the lab .
Tetris changed Pokhilko's life .
Having used games for psychology tests , he " realized games could be interesting by themselves . "
Now he is a partner with Pajitnov .
Based near San Francisco and in Moscow , their company , AnimaTek , is producing software such as El - Fish ( see Wired 1.2 ) , El - Dino ( due for Christmas ' 94 ) , and Arena ( '95 ) .
In designing these " interactive , mental worlds with rules , " they heed the lessons of Tetris .
Pokhilko and Pajitnov believe it was Tetris 's " emotional dynamics " that led to its astounding success .
No home was sweet without a Gameboy in 1990 .
That year , I stayed " for a week " with a friend in Tokyo , and Tetris enslaved my brain .
At night , geometric shapes fell in the darkness as I lay on loaned tatami floor space .
Days , I sat on a lavender suede sofa and played Tetris furiously .
During rare jaunts from the house , I visually fit cars and trees and people together .
Dubiously hunting a job and a house , I was still there two months later , still jobless , still playing .
My friend , an economist , threatened a battery deprivation , but he knew my habit ran deep , knew that I could always tilt , blinded by sunlight , to a convenience store .
To save face , I would buy a box of tiny chocolate - filled bears , as if AA power cells were an afterthought , not the meaning of my wretched life .
We should all learn from the " emotional dynamics " of Tetris , no ?
Surely , my experience , albeit radical , was not too atypical .
At the time , eyes everywhere were glued to those little green - gray screens .
So far , Nintendo alone has sold 35 million Tetris cartridges for Gameboys , and countless copies of Tetris software exist worldwide .
I wondered if Tetris was n't really some sort of electronic drug - a pharmatronic .
At the idea of a pharmatronic , Pajitnov laughs .
" Many people say that , but my feeling is it 's more like music .
Playing games is a very specific rhythmic and visual pleasure .
For me , Tetris is some song which you sing and sing inside yourself and can't stop . "
This is true - I could n't stop - but I was still mystified as to how Tetris slyly manages to interface with the neural net in the human skull .
At the University of California at Irvine 's Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior , Richard Haier did the demystifying .
In 1991 , Haier scanned the brains of Tetris players .
In Tetris , Haier sees " a tremendous learning curve .
The question became :
When the stimuli are faster and the decision making is harder , does the brain require more energy ? "
Haier found , as he suspected , that the brain requires less energy to play higher levels of Tetris .
This is " counterintuitive , " he says , " but consistent with a brain efficiency idea . "
In first - time users , Tetris significantly raises cerebral glucose metabolic rates ( GMRs ) , meaning brain energy consumption soars .
Yet , after four to eight weeks of daily doses , GMRs sink to normal , while performance increases seven - fold , on average .
Tetris trains your brain to stop using inefficient gray matter , perhaps a key cognitive strategy for learning .
In fact , the lowest final GMRs are found in the best players ' brains , the ones most efficient at dealing with Tetris 's Daedalian geometry .
The elevated GMR " high " is why you get wired after hours of play .
Your old dog of a brain learns the Tetris trick by munching cerebral glucose .
Neural hoop - jumping seems to be streamlined until performance peaks , and then your old dog stops craving Milkbones .
The Tetris effect is a biochemical , reductionistic metaphor , if you will , for curiosity , invention , the creative urge .
To fit shapes together is to organize , to build , to make deals , to fix , to understand , to fold sheets .
All of our mental activities are analogous , each as potentially addictive as the next .
How a poet 's mind struggles to compose a phrase is equivalent to a how an engineer frets - we hope - over a new concept in bridge suspension , or how a neat freak invents infinite corners to dust , or how anyone gazes into perpetual motions in liquid crystal .
To solidify these images of cerebral addiction , we need the purely psychological hook of Pokhilko : " The main part is visual insight .
You make your visual decision and it happens almost immediately .
Insight means emotion : small , but many of them , every two , three seconds .
The second mechanism is unfinished action .
Tetris has many unfinished actions ( that ) force you to continue and make it very addictive .
The third is automatization :
In a couple of hours , the activity becomes automatic , a habit , a motivation to repeat . "
Repeat I did in 1990 .
I repeated until I consistently won rocket blastoff imagery , the prize for the highest score and the end of the game on a Gameboy .
When the GMR high wore off , my old dog of a brain went on to learn new tricks .
And so did Alexey Pajitnov's .
Pajitnov is hardly on automatic , repeating himself endlessly by producing puzzles .
He , too , needed to fit shapes together in new ways .
AnimaTek is now building the foundation for virtual worlds , aspects of which will appear over the next few years .
Vaguely nervous about the whole idea , I ask Pajitnov why he is sure people will make the trip .
" They will have no choice .
That 's how progress works .
Everybody is trying to switch from 2 - D to 3 - D , " he says .
Worried that a 3 - D pharmatronic is just over the rainbow , I very casually gasp , " You mean soon we 'll have to go to your world ? "
" Oh , no .
I am much more modest , " Pajitnov says .
" For the first years we 'll concentrate on tools , knowledge , algorithms , and technology . "
I was relieved , but I had to ask , " And then ? "
" And then , yeah , sure , " he laughs , benevolently hoping we 'll be hooked .
" But not only to my world .
There will be some new genius , new talent .
It will be a new cultural phenomenon . "
That 's the last thing I need .
How about you ?
Will I see you in the virtual world ?
Will we interface each other as we lounge on lavender suede sofas and sleep on tatami floors ?
Will we munch those tiny chocolate - filled bears to satisfy our pharmatronically induced cravings for cerebral glucose ?
Will we leap over electric rainbows and into wonderland ?
I hope , with all of my life , we will .

Robert Cringley 's 1995 documentary Triumph of the Nerds : An Irreverent History of the PC Industry features dozens of fascinating interviews with icons of the software industry .
It included this brief interview segment with Steve Jobs , where he said the following :
The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste .
They have absolutely no taste .
And what that means is , I do n't mean that in a small way , I mean it in a big way .
In the sense that they do n't think of original ideas , and they do n't bring much culture into their product .
And you say , well , why is that important ?
Well , proportionately spaced fonts come from typesetting , and beautiful books .
That 's where one gets the idea .
If it were n't for the Mac , they would never have that in their products .
And so I guess I am saddened , not by Microsoft 's success .
I have no problem with their success .
They 've earned their success .. for the most part .
I have a problem with the fact that they just really make third rate products .
It 's not credited on YouTube , but the clip is definitely from Triumph of the Nerds .
I remember it very distinctly .
What 's remarkable about this brief interview is how succinctly it sums up Jobs ' strategy for Apple today .
At Apple , taste and culture are designed into every product from day one .
Nothing is released until it looks as good on the outside as it works on the inside .
Jobs is dead on with his criticism .
But the problem is much deeper than Microsoft ; it extends to the entire PC industry .
In the PC world , taste and culture are rarely considered , and if they are , it 's always as an afterthought .
Ship it first , make it look good later .
If you ever do .
Consider PC hardware .
Why are most PCs little more than black / silver / beige boxes ?
I 've killed myself trying to find a PC case that is n't either hideously ugly or just plain boring .
A well designed PC case is rare to the point of absurdity .
If you want a PC that looks as good as it works , you have to make it yourself .
The PC industry is so inept they can't even copy Apple correctly ; the Lian - Li V1000 is ostensibly a copy of the Apple G5 case , but it looks more like its retarded cousin .
And it 's the same situation for laptops .
Only a handful of the most high - end PC laptops can approximate the thoughtful design work that goes into the most basic , inexpensive laptop Apple sells .
The PC software situation is no better .
If anything , it 's worse .
I see vendors writing their own custom user interfaces in a vain , misguided attempt to set their craplets apart from everyone else's .
At the other extreme , there are applications so concerned with being functional and utilitarian that they forget about design entirely , reverting to the bland grey Windows 95 UI style .
They 've given up .
But I do n't blame the third - party vendors .
I can hardly expect them to do any better when design barely makes the top 10 priority list for any player in the PC industry .
Microsoft is about the only company that 's in a position to set PC design standards , and they 're not trying very hard .
Who else can lead the way on design ?
Dell ?
IBM ?
Compaq ?
NVIDIA ?
Gateway ?
Please .
There are no design leaders in the PC world .
There 's nobody for these third - party vendors to look to as the gold standard of design .
There 's only the lukewarm , inconsistent , half - hearted design guidelines that Microsoft sets -- and frequently breaks themselves .
Steve Jobs has always been clear about the integral role of design in his products , as outlined in this Smithsonian interview , which is also from 1995 :
DM : You used an interesting word in describing what you were doing .
You were talking about art not engineering , not science .
Tell me about that .
SJ : I actually think there 's actually very little distinction between an artist and a scientist or engineer of the highest caliber .
I 've never had a distinction in my mind between those two types of people .
They 've just been to me people who pursue different paths but basically kind of headed to the same goal which is to express something of what they perceive to be the truth around them so that others can benefit by it .
DM : And the artistry is in the elegance of the solution , like chess playing or mathematics ?
SJ : No .
I think the artistry is in having an insight into what one sees around them .
Generally putting things together in a way no one else has before and finding a way to express that to other people who do n't have that insight so they can get some of the advantage of that insight that makes them feel a certain way or allows them to do a certain thing .
I think that a lot of the folks on the Macintosh team were capable of doing that and did exactly that .
If you study these people a little bit more what you 'll find is that in this particular time , in the 70's and the 80's the best people in computers would have normally been poets and writers and musicians .
Almost all of them were musicians .
Alot of them were poets on the side .
They went into computers because it was so compelling .
It was fresh and new .
It was a new medium of expression for their creative talents .
The feelings and the passion that people put into it were completely indistinguishable from a poet or a painter .
Many of the people were introspective , inward people who expressed how they felt about other people or the rest of humanity in general into their work , work that other people would use .
People put a lot of love into these products , and a lot of expression of their appreciation came to these things .
It 's hard to explain .
Whatever you may think of Jobs , he's had the same vision for the last twenty years : the design of a product , the art of it , is just as important as the engineering .
This is a lesson that the PC industry needs to take to heart .
They better start learning some design chops quickly , because they 're now directly competing in the same x86 market with Apple .
Why choose a beige box and a schizophrenic UI when you could have something that 's beautiful and thoughtfully designed for about the same price ?
Poland threw open the doors of its military archives to show how most of Europe would have been laid to waste in a nuclear conflagration between east and west .
Dating from 1979 , when presidents Jimmy Carter and Leonid Brezhnev were discussing detente , the map showed how Warsaw Pact forces would have responded to an attack by the Nato alliance .
A series of red mushroom clouds over western Europe show that Soviet nuclear weapons strikes would have been launched at Germany , the Netherlands , Denmark and Belgium if Nato had struck first .
Red clouds are drawn over the then German capital , Bonn , and other key German cities such as the financial centre of Frankfurt , Cologne , Stuttgart , Munich and the strategically important northern port of Hamburg .
Brussels , the political headquarters of Nato , is also targeted .
Blue mushroom clouds , representing the expected Nato nuclear strikes , are drawn over cities in the eastern bloc , including Warsaw and the then Czechoslovakian capital , Prague .
France would have escaped attack , possibly because it is not a member of Nato 's integrated structure .
Britain , which has always been at the heart of Nato , would also have been spared , suggesting Moscow wanted to stop at the Rhine to avoid overstretching its forces .
The exercise , entitled Seven Days to the River Rhine , indicated Warsaw Pact forces aimed to reach the Franco - German border within a week of a Nato attack .
Standing next to the fading map in Warsaw yesterday , Radoslaw Sikorski , the Polish defence minister , said : " The objective of the exercise on this map is to take over most of western Europe - all of Germany , Belgium and Denmark . "
Mr Sikorski , who made a name for himself working for the rightwing American Enterprise Institute thinktank in Washington , made clear he was prepared for a backlash from Russia , whose president , Vladimir Putin , has lamented the demise of the Soviet Union .
Announcing the release of 1,700 Warsaw Pact papers from Poland 's military archive , he said : " This is crucial to educating the country on the way Poland was an unwilling ally of the USSR in the cold war .
The map shows a classic Warsaw Pact exercise - it was a ' counter ' attack to defend itself by going all the way to the Atlantic . "
Mr Sikorski , who was appointed after the Law and Justice party won a surprise victory in the recent elections after pledging to cleanse the country of its communist past , believes the map shows how Moscow was prepared to sacrifice Poland to save the Soviet Union .
Nato 's policy of retaining the right to a first nuclear strike - because the Soviet Union had far superior conventional forces - meant Polish troops dug in by the River Vistula would have been wiped out .
" This map is a moving and shattering personal experience , " Mr Sikorski said of the exercise , which estimated that 2 million Polish civilians would have been killed .
" It shows that the Polish army was being used to participate in an operation that would have resulted in the nuclear annihilation of our country . "
With ties between Poland and Russia at one of their lowest ebbs since the break - up of the Warsaw Pact , Mr Sikorski was asked whether he feared a Kremlin backlash .
He said : " We think the Soviet regime was very detrimental to Russia - the Russian people suffered the most . "
Commander Waldemar Wojcik , the head of Poland 's Central Military Academy , said : " This was an exercise based on the assumption of a Nato attack .
The doctrine of the day was that the Warsaw Pact countries were peace loving . "
He added : " I visited the Pentagon in 2001 and was shown maps that were the mirror image of this . "
Other papers released covered Operation Danube , the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 , and details of a massacre of Polish strikers in 1970 at Szczecin which led to the downfall of Wladyslaw Gomulka , the relatively moderate leader .
Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz , the new Polish prime minister , insisted Warsaw was not trying to provoke Russia , even though it released the map without consulting Moscow .
" The future should be built on the truth about the past .
If the truth is damaging to international relations that is a bad thing ... I am sure this will not spoil our relations with Russia . "
Exposure to ultrasound while pregnant may affect brain development in the fetus , suggests a study on mice .
But experts caution that it is too soon to extrapolate the findings to humans .
They stress that the imaging technique has overwhelming benefits and pregnant women should not skip essential appointments .
The new research involved using a chemical to trace brain cells in growing mouse embryos .
The researchers exposed the embryos to ultrasound shortly afterwards , late in the third week of gestation , a crucial period for mice in which brain cells become organised .
Dissections following the birth of the mice showed that a small percentage of brain cells had not migrated to their normal place .
For example , 6 % of the chemically tagged brain cells had not migrated normally in mice exposed to two 30 - minute ultrasound sessions .

It may be that the ultrasound waves somehow disrupt the connections formed between cells as they move into their proper location , suggests Pasko Rakic at Yale Medical School in New Haven , Connecticut , US , who carried out the research with colleagues .
Still source
Rakic says the brains of these mice still appear healthy to the naked eye .
Moreover , his team has not yet tested to see whether the mice have abnormal mental abilities .
And he notes that the source of the ultrasound waves remained fixed , which could have increased the risk of disrupting the cells , unlike in the checkups on female patients where medical staff continuously move the ultrasound source .
Doctors generally recommend that women receive two ultrasound checkups during the course of their pregnancy to assess fetal development , each of which can last around 30 minutes .
The images generated by the pulses of ultrasonic waves can reveal information about the age of the unborn child , its position in the womb and whether it has any abnormalities .
Some previous studies have suggested that ultrasound may delay speech or cause genetic abnormalities in humans , but experts say these results have not been replicated .
Enlightened era
“ At the end of the day , nothing has been reproducible , but it does n’t mean it could n’t be , ” says Lawrence Platt , director of the Center for Fetal Medicine and Women ’s Ultrasound , in Los Angeles , California , US .
“ The widespread use of obstetric ultrasound during the past generation has transformed pregnancy from the dark ages to an era of enlightenment , ” says Frank Chervenak at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University , New York , US .
He says that “ it would not be reasonable to extrapolate the new findings in the mouse model to appropriately performed obstetric ultrasound in the clinical setting ” .
“ I would say that the benefits of the ultrasound for diagnosis are so big that I would not hesitate to use it at all , ” Rakic adds .
Trend - setting celebrity
However , experts say that the results warrant further research , especially given the dramatic rise of non-medical “ boutique ” ultrasounds – which many companies offer in shopping malls to expectant mothers for around $ 200 .
It is feared that their popularity may rise still further following reports that expectant celebrities such as Tom Cruise bought home - use ultrasound machines .
The recent explosion in boutique imaging is partly due to the growing sophistication of 3D ultrasounds , which when used in a hospital setting can provide important details to doctors about hard - to detect spinal abnormalities , clubfoot or cleft lip .
It is now possible to process the ultrasound information quickly and offer these pictures , and moving footage , on demand .
The US Food and Drug Administration has made a strong recommendation against commercial ultrasound movies .
“ Mothers leave falsely reassured and then they miss their scheduled ultrasounds with their doctor , ” says ultrasound expert Jacques Abramowicz at Rush University Medical Center , Chicago , Illinois , US .
He says that this has resulted in some serious birth abnormalities going undetected in the womb .

Ladies !
Put on your lip gloss because Nick Lachey is officially single ... again .
He and Jessica Simpson 's divorce was finalized Friday .
Papers were filed in Superior court that restored both of them " to the status of single , unmarried persons . "
Truth be told , even though I joke about it and secretly fantasize that hunky Nick can be all mine now , honestly , the part of me that once adored this couple is really , really sad that it is all over for them .
Oh well , I hope with the many ladies Nick keeps his time with , there will be one that brings him true happiness again .
Not to mention , lets hope Papa Joe allows Jessica to begin dating publicly and she too can find someone that will bring her the happiness that was once Nick Lachey .
Although , when you live in a town like Hollywood , good luck finding another man that will turn a whole room into a closet for you sweetie .
Oh , and most importantly ... this puts an end to my countless Nick Lachey / Jessica Simpson posts .
I 'm sure many of you are thrilled .
MOSCOW , Jan. 2 - Faced with mounting criticism from its natural gas customers across Western Europe , Russia on Monday restored most of the gas it withheld from Ukraine 's pipeline system a day earlier in a pricing dispute .
Officials of the state - owned Russian company , Gazprom , presented the decision not as a reversal but as a response to Ukraine 's " theft " of natural gas .
But it became clear almost immediately that the driving force in Russia 's decision was the sharp criticism across Europe , including countries like Germany that are usually reliable allies .
Just hours after Russia disrupted gas supplies on Sunday morning by reducing pressure in the pipeline system , a cascading energy emergency moved westward across Europe , as one utility after another reported dropping gas pressures -- at a time of peak demand in freezing weather .
As pressure continued to drop Monday , criticism erupted among European leaders , jittery over the threat to one of the Continent 's primary sources of energy .
The minister of economy in Germany , the largest consumer of Russian natural gas in Europe , questioned Russia 's reliability as an energy supplier .
Over the years , there have been many , many failed attempts to create alternative VMs for Python , in the hopes of increasing program performance .
Even if we ignore the many half - finished Python - to - Parrot translator projects still lurching erratically onward like a half - decayed zombie army , the road to better VM performance is lined on both sides by the gravestones of colorfully - named projects like Mamba , Rattlesnake , and Vyper , all lying untended and forgotten .
Meanwhile , newer projects like pycore and ShedSkin are announced all the time , with a hopeful optimism all too similar to that of their predecessors .
( Announced a little over a year ago with much fanfare in the blogosphere , pycore is already missing in action , without a single release yet . )
Making Python run fast , it seems , is a lot harder than it looks .
You do n’t have to be a compiler or VM design expert to look at CPython ’s implementation and say , “ Doing X is wasteful .
I ’ll bet you could make that faster by doing Y . ”
The problem is that at least 9 times out of 10 , somebody already tried doing Y , and got maybe 80 % of Python to work with their design before they hit a wall .
That wall basically amounts to this : 80 % of Python is not Python , because everybody uses some part of that remaining 20 % .
The only reason ShedSkin is n’t already in the land of the dead with all the other projects is that it neatly sidesteps this issue by not pretending to be anything but a “ Python - like ” language .
However , that ’s sort of like the Black Knight in Monty Python and The Holy Grail , insisting that his lack of arms and legs is “ only a flesh wound ” .
True , in other words , but not very useful .
On the other side we see the alternative VMs that actually implement the Python language , but do n’t ( for the most part ) try to outdo CPython for speed .
Jython and IronPython actually implement reasonably complete forms of the Python language , but from a practical perspective they are different platforms .
Trying to target an application to work across CPython , Jython , and IronPython would be rather pointless , so only pure - Python libraries are portable across the implementations in any case .
But it ’s the impure libraries that give ( C/J / Iron ) Python most of its current value !
Be it database access , number crunching , interfaces to GUI toolkits , or any of a thousand other uses , it ’s the C , Java , or CLR libraries that make Python useful .
CPython is basically a glue language for assembling programs from C libraries , and to the extent that Jython and IronPython are successful , it ’s because they ’re glue languages for assembling Java or CLR components .
What ’s more , since their value equation lies elsewhere , Jython and IronPython do n’t have to fully implement CPython ’s semantics , although they do try to come fairly close .
And IronPython actually manages to improve on some Python performance microbenchmarks , although I ’d say the jury is still out on whether IronPython programs perform better in general .
Of course , it ’s difficult to measure this well because IronPython is a different platform .
A heavy number - crunching program using NumPy is n’t going to run on IronPython , for example , so how would you compare them ?
And that leads us to the very heart of the issue with CPython .
If the value of CPython comes from all the things that work with it today , then CPython is very close to being at a dead - end for further performance improvement .
Most proposed performance enhancements these days get rejected because they change the Python C API in backwards - incompatible ways .
If a change requires that everybody rewrite their C code , the language might as well not be Python any more .
In short , CPython is n’t just a language implementation , it ’s a platform API , not unlike the Java VM and libraries .
It used to be that we held out a hope for Python 3000 – Guido ’s bold vision of a Python rethought from the ground up , unburdened by the need for backward compatibility .
Here we could break with the C API of the past , and explore new territory – or so we thought .
But more recently , Guido has pulled back from the original plan , citing the ongoing vaporware status of Perl 6 , and Joel Spolsky ’s arguments against rewriting your flagship product .
Python 3000 has become Python 3.0 , instead .
Not a complete rewrite , but a still somewhat vague plan for tuning - up the existing language , and tossing out a few things Guido considers mistakes in retrospect .
Backwards incompatibility will be allowed , but Guido has pronounced that there will be no from - scratch rewrite of the CPython implementation .
It ’s not yet clear whether that means we can refactor in ways that would require third - party extensions to be rewritten .
Perhaps this will be decided on a case - by - case basis .
But arguably the single biggest mistake in the CPython platform as it exists today is the lack of a foreign function interface , defined by the language and expressable by Python code .
Instead , CPython has always relied on a fixed C API to express foreign interfaces .
For its original intended purpose – an embedded scripting language for the Amoeba OS – that was probably okay .
But the lack of a C FFI has meant that tools like SWIG , Pyrex , ctypes , Boost : : Python , etc. had to spring up to fill the gap , but none of them are “ standard ” to Python , so a given CPython extension could be written in any of them , or none of the above .
Thus , today ’s backward - compatibility ball - and - chain : the Python / C API .
What ’s more , few of these tools are designed to be independent of the existing CPython implementation .
All but ctypes tend to have quirks that are a function of their intended code - generation target .
But a Python language - defined FFI would have allowed the CPython API to be a mere implementation detail , able to be changed with little consequence .
Indeed , such an FFI could conceivably have been usable even with Jython and IronPython , allowing even greater portability .
But , it ’s too late to fix all that now .
Or is it ?
Enter PyPy .
Two months ago , PyPy 0.7 was released .
A major milestone , PyPy 0.7 is the first self - hosting Python implementation .
That is , an implementation of Python , written in Python , that can interpret itself .
What ’s more , part of PyPy is a translation system that allows Python code to be translated to other languages , and it includes a kind of foreign function interface , although not a standardized one blessed by Guido .
The PyPy developers have now done the work of rewriting all but a minimum of platform - specific C code as high - level Python code .
In short , PyPy has already taken the most important step for us to escape from the CPython “ gravity well ” of needing a backward - compatible C API .
It ’s hard to overstress how important this is .
The current CPython implementation is locked into a host of design decisions that PyPy is not .
As a simple example , PyPy can generate threads - supporting and non-threads - supporting versions of itself , refcounting and garbage collection versions of itself , and so on .
Essentially , PyPy is completely virtual with respect to the underlying VM , even though it uses CPython bytecode .
So , in the next few years it will be possible to experiment with radical redesigns of the VM , without getting bogged down in the “ last 20 % ” issues experienced by projects of the past .
Heck , it should be possible to use custom - tuned VMs on an application - by - application basis !
Further , because PyPy is implemented in Python , hacking on it to change the actual Python language or its semantics will be easier than hacking CPython .
In short , we are almost on the doorstep of a renaissance in the development of the Python language , and on the way out of the alternative - implementations graveyard .
But what about speed ?
PyPy is currently described as 200-300 times slower than CPython , depending on what you ’re doing , and what VM you translate it to .
This sounds ludicrously bad , until you look at the fact that the untranslated PyPy , running on top of CPython , runs 2000 times slower .
Which means – if you ’re paying attention – that PyPy ’s translator is already able to turn Python code into C that runs 10 times faster !
That is one heck of an improvement , folks .
Granted , the code in question is technically “ RPython ” – a restricted subset of Python that eschews the use of certain more - dynamic features .
But it does n’t need type declarations in order to get speed , like Pyrex does .
And this technology could be available for practical use soon , if Stackless guru Christian Tismer has his way , by creating an RPython - to - CPython extension module translator .
So , if it ’s possible to create efficient C from a subset of Python , does that now mean that PyPy is finished ?
Ca n’t we just take that translation process and go on our way ?
Unfortunately , no .
Although we could certainly take those fast modules back to the CPython platform , the translation process is still quite slow , and needs some accelerating of its own .
Also , it still does n’t really make CPython any faster – it just means that we can compile some individual modules and make them faster .
To reach the promised land , then , PyPy has to first get close to CPython speed .
As it gets closer and closer to this goal , more and more people with an idea or two about speeding things up will say to themselves , “ I wonder if I can get PyPy to do Y instead of X ? ”
And , unlike the situation with CPython now , they wo n’t need to be both a Python guru and a CPython VM expert to have a prayer of implementing it .
So , instead of entirely new VM ’s springing up and dying incomplete , it may be that we will soon see the opposite trend : existing VMs fading away , consolidated and replaced by an ever - more flexible PyPy .
With any luck , we may yet see PyPy become the One Python to Rule Them All , replacing CPython , Jython , and IronPython with C , Java , and C# translator backends respectively .
Update : Just after I posted this , I found a message that appears to be saying that as of September , PyPy is now only 20 times slower than CPython .
If that ’s the case , things are moving quickly indeed .
2000 , 200 , 20 …
How much longer till 2 , and 0.2 ( five times faster than CPython ) ?
Unfortunately , each new order of magnitude from this point on will probably be more difficult than the last .
Too bad they ca n’t just feed the output back to the input and make it ten times faster as many times as they want . 🙂
One thing I 've always despised is lawyers who lie , in order to project what they think is the " right image " to the public .
It is sick , sycophantic , and silly .
Look at these two " fact / fiction " questions and answers on the Texas Young Lawyers Association American Juror web page , which was cited on the Jur - E bulletin on December 16 , 2005 : " Fiction : Attorneys only pick jurors with a college degree . " Fact :
The main thing we ’re looking for from potential jurors is the ability to be open to both sides of a debate .
It ’s up to the lawyers to present the evidence clearly .
But we count on the juries to be honest in deciding for themselves what is true and what is fair .
That is not based on intelligence or education - it ’s just a basic sense of right and wrong .
" Let me make it clear : any associate with my law firm who looks mainly for jurors to be open to both sides of a debate will be unemployed before Voir Dire is over .
We want jurors who will NEVER , EVER under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES , WHATEVER THE EVIDENCE consider the other side of the debate .
We want jurors who are 100 % biased towards our side , 100 % hostile to the other side , and if we can get 12 of them , we want them .
We will settle for a fair and impartial jury , as a bare minimum .
We assume , and have never seen this assumption proven wrong , that the other side is also seeking jurors who will be committed to their case , and biased against ours .
That 's the way the game is played - and shame on TYLA for lying to the public and prospective jurors about it .
" Fiction : Lawyers ask questions designed to figure out who will help reach a verdict in their client ’s favor .
" Fact : Voir Dire is a French term that means " Speak the Truth . "
Prospective jurors are sworn to tell the truth so that the attorneys or judge can ask questions to find out if they can be impartial unbiased , and trusted to make a reasonable decision based on the facts of the case .
" Again , any associate with THIS firm who does not ask questions designed to figure out who will help reach a verdict in our client 's favor will be unemployed before Voir Dire is over .
We do n't want a fair jury ; that is the MINIMUM we will settle for .
We want a jury that will NEVER , EVER under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES , WHATEVER THE EVIDENCE , vote against us .
Any lawyer who says he wants a fair and impartial jury is either incompetent ( being deluded by bar association PR ) or is simply lying , lying , lying .
The public knows that .
I 've spoken to many high school classes .
I ask them what they think a lawyer wants out of a jury , and they tell me a jury that will vote for their client .
We know they know .
Yet we strangely persist in lying to them when we know we 'll be caught .
That 's either insane or stupid .
What is weird is that bar associations lie , to people who they know will KNOW they are lying , in a vain attempt to improve the public image of the bar .
What they are in fact doing is proving to the general public that lawyers are liars and manipulators who cannot be trusted - because they lie when , if they gave any thought to it , they 'd know they'd be caught by anyone with two brain cells to rub together .
Kind of disgusting , this collective indifference to reality in the pursuit of image , is n't it ?
P.S. I also tell high school classes that what the judge wants is a jury that will be compliant and will return on time after lunch .
Judges HATE that I say that - one judge complained so much that the Houston Bar Association will no longer use me as a speaker .
But that is the institutional bias of the judiciary .
If we can not tell the public the truth about what we do and how courts operate , it seems to me we have far more to worry about than our public image .
What we have to worry about is that our public image may well be accurate .
The honeymoon is over .
Iran 's controversial president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has finally come unstuck .
His popularity with the Iranian electorate - the subject of much incredulous analysis in 2005 - seems to be falling back at last , and the country 's latest exercise in populism seems to be reaping the rewards of unfulfilled promises bestowed with little attention to economic realities .
Those realities have sharpened with the onset of UN sanctions .
Ahmadinejad 's casual dismissal of the sanctions has apparently earned him an unprecedented rebuke from the supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei - reflecting growing concerns among the political elite , including many conservatives , who are increasingly anxious at Iran 's worsening international situation .
As if to emphasise this point , Hashemi Rafsanjani , Ahmadinejad 's defeated foe in the 2005 presidential election , echoed the condemnation of the president 's public complacency , stressing that the threats against Iran were very real .
Indeed , as a second US carrier group heads for the Gulf , there is belated questioning of the president 's competence .
His critics argue that not only does he appear to have courted the anger of the US , but his economic mismanagement and political nepotism have weakened the internal integrity of the Islamic republic - and proved to be a gift to Iran 's enemies .
Ahmadinejad was elected on a platform of anti-corruption and financial transparency , and few appreciated how rapidly he was intoxicated with the prerogatives of his office .
He very soon forgot the real help he had received in ensuring his election , basking in the belief that God and the people had put him in power .
Ahmadinejad soon had a view for all seasons : uranium enrichment .
Of course Iran would pursue this , and what 's more , sell it on the open market at knockdown rates .
As for interest rates , they were far too high for the ordinary borrower , so cut them immediately .
And then there was the Holocaust .
None of this might matter so much , if the president had based his rhetorical flourishes on solid policies .
But much to everyone 's surprise nothing dramatic materialised .
Ahmadinejad appeared to follow the dictum of his mentor , Ayatollah Khomeini - " Economics is for donkeys " .
Indeed , his policies could be defined as " anything but Khatami " ( his predecessor ) .
So the oil reserve fund was spent on cash handouts to the grateful poor , and the central bank , normally a bastion of prudence , was instructed to cut interest rates for small businesses .
These had the effect , as Ahmadinejad was warned , of pushing up inflation .
The rationale for high interest rates was to encourage the middle classes to keep their money in Iran .
Now they decided to spend it .
Richer Iranians , worried about rising international tension , decided it would be prudent to ship their money abroad .
This further weakened the rial , and added to inflationary pressure .
In the past few months the prices of most basic goods have risen , hurting the poor he was elected to help .
Moreover , far from investing Iran 's oil wealth in infrastructure to create jobs , he announced recently that Iran 's economy could support a substantially larger population , as if current unemployment was not a big enough problem .
Views such as these , along with his well publicised unorthodox religious convictions , have earned him the ridicule of political foes .
What is more striking perhaps is the growing concern of those who should be considered his allies , especially in the parliament .
These are people who supported him and expected results .
They expected their populist protege to overturn the heresy of reform .
Much to their irritation , not only has Ahmadinejad singularly failed to consolidate and extend his political base , the recent municipal elections saw his faction defeated throughout the country .
Traditional conservatives and reformists reorganised and hit back , ingeniously using technology to work round the various obstacles placed in front of them .
Now , over the past weeks , with biting weather , shortages of heating fuel are further raising the political temperature , while his political opponents point to the burgeoning international crisis for which the globetrotting president seems to have no constructive answer .
Talk has turned to impeachment .
Ironically , it is this very international crisis that may serve to save Ahmadinejad 's presidency , a reality that the president undoubtedly understood all too well .
As domestic difficulties mount , the emerging international crisis could at best serve as a rallying point , or at worst persuade Iran 's elite that a change of guard would convey weakness to the outside world .
There can be little doubt that US hawks will interpret recent events as proof that pressure works , and that any more pressure will encourage the hawks further .
Yet the reality is that while Ahmadinejad has been his own worst enemy , the US hawks are his best friends .
Ahmadinejad 's demise , if it comes , will have less to do with the international environment and more with his own political incompetence .
There is little doubt that it will take more than a cosmetic change to get Washington to listen to Iran .
But the real question mark , as the Baker - Hamilton commission found to its cost , is whether Washington is inclined to listen at all .

The text of the ' Student and Teacher Safety Act ' reads , in part :
Sec 3 . Searches Based On Reasonable Suspicion .
( a ) IN GENERAL .--
Each local educational agency shall have in effect throughout the jurisdiction of the agency policies that ensure that a search described in subsection ( b ) is deemed reasonable and permissible .
( b ) Searches Covered .--
A search referred to in subsection ( a ) is a search by a full - time teacher or school official , acting on any reasonable suspicion based on professional experience and judgment , of any minor student on the grounds of any public school , if the search is conducted to ensure that classrooms , school buildings , school property and students remain free from the threat of all weapons , dangerous materials , or illegal narcotics .
The measures used to conduct any search must be reasonably related to the search 's objectives , without being excessively intrusive in light of the student 's age , sex , and the nature of the offense .
Sec 4 . ENCOURAGEMENT TO PROTECT STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ( a) IN GENERAL .--
A local educational agency that fails to comply with section 3 shall not , during the period of non-compliance , receive any Safe and Drug Free School funds after fiscal year 2008 .
Here is the status of HR 5295 :
9/19/2006 Passed / agreed to in House :
On motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill , as amended Agreed to by voice vote .
9/20/2006 Referred to Senate committee : Received in the Senate and Read twice and referred to the Committee on Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions .
This legislation mandates that every public school provide a policy that permits teachers and school officials to conduct invasive searches of any type on minors , including strip searches .
The legislation also insulates those that conduct the searches from liability by requiring that school policy deem such searches as ' reasonable ' and ' permissible . '
This is what the PTA has to say about it :
Though we laud your efforts to make our classrooms safer , we believe this legislation fails to create constructive policy that will actually improve the safety of students and school personnel .
Instead , as noted in Sec.2( 13 ) of the bill as introduced on May 4 , 2006 , this legislation will only " help to insulate teachers and school officials who conduct student searches from lawsuits . "
In this age of zero - tolerance policies , we must be cautious to not overextend the government 's reach .
We must allow schools and districts to set policy according to the needs and special circumstances of that school and community .
Further , this legislation fails to provide any resources to reduce drugs and violence in our schools .
In fact , the funds that would be denied schools that fail to comply with this legislation are the very resources intended to help make our schools safer .
The Safe and Drug Free Schools program provides funds for drug - and violence - prevention activities focused primarily on school - age youths .
These activities may include developing instructional materials ; providing counseling services and professional development programs for school personnel ; implementing community service projects and conflict resolution , peer mediation , mentoring and character education programs ; establishing safe zones of passage for students to and from school ; acquiring and installing metal detectors ; and hiring security personnel .
What 's more , Congress has cut funding for this program by nearly 50 percent since 2002 and plans to cut an additional $ 36.5 million in fiscal 2007 appropriations .
The PTA is n't the only organization opposed to this legislation .
It is also opposed by the National School Boards Association , the American Association of School Administrators , the American Federation of Teachers , and the Great City Council Schools ( Source ) .
Another interesting opponent to the legislation is Congress 's own legal advisors .
The ' Congressional Research Service ' says this about the legislation , in part :
Under H.R. 5295 , school districts that receive federal funds under the Safe and Drug - Free School programs would be required to establish certain policies with respect to schoolbased searches .
Specifically , school districts would be required to establish policies deeming reasonable and permissible : a search by a full - time teacher or school official , acting on any reasonable suspicion based on professional experience and judgment , of any minor student on the grounds of any public school , if the search is conducted to ensure that classrooms , school buildings , school property and students remain free from the threat of all weapons , dangerous materials , or illegal narcotics .
The measures used to conduct any search must be reasonably related to the search 's objectives , without being excessively intrusive in light of the student 's age , sex , and the nature of the offense .
In addition to considerations of constitutional jurisprudence , any federal legislation requiring school districts to establish a uniform school search policy would also have implications for federalism , i.e. , the relationship between the federal government and the states and the relative autonomy of each .
Traditionally , education , public health and safety , and law enforcement have all been issues that are primarily governed by state and local law , largely because of the local nature of these issues .
Enacting federal legislation with respect to school - based searches could therefore interfere with state and local law in areas of traditional state and local responsibility .
One of the most troublesome aspects of this legislation is that it requires that the determination of ' reasonableness ' be left to the person conducting the search , based upon their professional experience and judgment .
Personally , I 'd feel uncomfortable entrusting the invasiveness of search procedures to every individual teacher or school officials ' Professional Experience and Judgment . '
Here 's a sampling of such ' Professional Experience and Judgment ' that would be permissible under this legislation :
McMINNVILLE , Ore .
No charges will be filed against the two adults who had 34 middle - school girls strip - searched by police in a hunt for stolen cash , CDs and makeup .
District Attorney Brad Berry said Friday he found no evidence of criminal intent in the Jan. 29 search at Duniway Middle School and no grounds for charges of sexual abuse or official misconduct against the vice principal or the policeman who was liaison officer at the school .
" That does not mean mistakes were not made , " the district attorney said .
" Whether or not that 's a civil rights violation , for example , or some other civil violation , that 's not my concern . "
Since the search , the officer has been reassigned , and the vice principal resigned .
The girls , ages 12 to 14 , were searched after no one would admit to the theft of CDs , makeup and cash from the locker room .
Two women from the police department were called in and the girls were taken into the locker room , where they were asked to take off their shoes and socks , shake out their bras , and pull down their pants and underwear to see whether anything fell out .
Nothing did .
( Source )
One student , Matt Klassen , 15 , said after a classmate reported $ 90 missing from his gym bag , vice - principal John MacDonald and gym teacher Dan Bondy " made us go into the phys ed office one at a time and we had to take our clothes off in front of them . "
He said he was told to remove his underwear as well .
" I was embarrassed .
They told me to bend over but I just crouched .
It was kind of frightening . "
Matt said all the boys in the class -- about 25 -- were upset by the incident and yesterday hundreds of students left the school at lunch time and stayed out for more than an hour in protest .
" The whole town is in an uproar , " said Ed Hardy , whose son Jay , 14 , was the first to be searched .
" I 've talked to the teachers and the Board of Education because I do n't agree with their actions . " ( Source )
The strip search was prompted by a teacher who accused the four boys of stealing her ring .
Another administrator pulled the boys out of gym class and forced them to individually strip down to their underwear , jump up and down , and wiggle their toes .
The administrator threatened to call the police and send the boys to jail " for a long time " if they did not comply .
The ring was never found .
In his deposition , the administrator claimed that the search was one of his " best " and that he learned the invasive procedure from his former supervisor .
( Source )
The case stems from a May 2000 incident in which a high school student reported that money had been taken from her gym bag during gym class .
In an unsuccessful attempt to find the money , teachers , at the direction of the acting principal , strip - searched all members of the gym class .
The boys were forced to pull down their pants and underwear while they were examined by a teacher .
The girls were forced to stand in a circle and pull up their shirts and pull down their shorts .
( Source )
I believe that each one of these ' Mild ' examples reflects the potential for abuse under this legislation .
Each one of the teachers and school officials undoubtedly believed that their actions were ' reasonable , ' and under this legislation it would be .
There is nothing in the legislation to prevent some sicko from strip searching children for his own depraved pleasure , and then justifying it as a search for drugs or weapons , based upon his ' Professional Experience and Judgment . '
The Courts would ultimately determine the ' Reasonableness ' of such conduct , but in the meantime the children are forced to endure it .
That is unacceptable !
As a side note ... it 's interesting to note that one of the co-sponsors of the legislation is none other than Foley enabler John Shimkus .
If that was n't enough , John Boehner had this to say :
Parents should be able to have confidence that their children are in a safe environment while at school .
( Source )
Somehow , I just do n't have alot of confidence in Foley enablers talking about the safety of children , and this legislation is the perfect example of the ' Wrong ' way to go about achieving that .
Thanks for listening to my rant ...
My life as a Code Economist
The six billion people of the world can be divided into two groups :
People who know why every good software company ships products with known bugs .
People who do n't .
Those of us in group 1 tend to forget what life was like before our youthful optimism was spoiled by reality .
Sometimes we encounter a person in group 2 , perhaps a new hire on the team or even a customer .
They are shocked that any software company would ever ship a product before every last bug is fixed .
Every time Microsoft releases a new version of Windows , major news services carry a story about the fact that the open bug count is a five digit number .
People in group 2 find that sort of thing interesting .
The surprising truth is that a person in group 2 can lead a productive life .
In fact , as with most any other kind of ignorance , they 're probably happier that way .
The exception of course is if you are a software developer .
That 's an entirely different story .
If you earn your living building shrinkwrap software products , you need to get yourself in group 1 .
Perhaps , dear reader , you are a software developer in group 2 ?
If so , I 'm sorry I had to be the one to tell you this .
I feel like I 'm telling the neighbor kid that Santa Claus is n't real . :-)
Okay , seriously .
I apologize for the mock arrogance of the previous paragraphs , and for the Santa Claus remark .
I mean no condescension .
Just like everybody else , I 've got lots to learn .
But I 've also got lots of gray hair .
Some people read my stuff because they want to benefit from the lessons I learned from all the stupid mistakes I made which caused that gray hair .
Which reminds me -- let me tell you a story ...
In hindsight , releasing on Halloween probably was n't such a good idea .
Last week was a terrible week at SourceGear .
Most weeks I really enjoy my job .
By the end of last week , I was reminding myself every hour that I get paid to do this .
Everything started out great on Monday , October 31st .
It was the very first day in our new office space , and our whole company had a feeling of enthusiasm .
We planned to release the Vault 3.1.3 maintenance release that day .
It was ready the week before , but it did n't make sense to release it just before the move .
( Here at SourceGear , we ship a " maintenance release " of Vault whenever we want to provide our customers with bug fixes or other minor improvement .
Our version numbering scheme is " Major.Minor.Maintenance " .
Version 4.0.7 would indicate that it is the seventh maintenance release since Vault 4.0 .
Historically , we have done one maintenance release each month or so . )
It started raining around noon .
Those of us with children began to dread the prospect of going out to Trick - or - Treat in the rain .
Still , a little bad weather was n't enough to squash the mood .
Our new office space is great , and we had a general feeling of confidence about 3.1.3 .
Vault 3.1 has been a really solid product .
The 3.1.3 release contained several bug fixes , but none of them were really urgent .
We shipped the release believing that it would be the last maintenance release for quite a while .
Unfortunately , things did n't work out that way at all .
The 3.1.3 release introduced two new bugs .
But we did n't know that yet when we came in Tuesday morning wearing all smiles .
The rain was gone and it was a beautiful fall day .
Looking out my east window I could see the bright sun highlighting the colors of the autumn leaves on thousands of trees on the University of Illinois campus .
With the relocation and the 3.1.3 release behind us , I looked forward to having the entire team focused on the development of Vault 4.0 .
Then the groaning began .
We found the first bug that morning : Something in 3.1.3 broke the ability for the client to store certain settings in the registry .
It was a minor bug , but very annoying .
Any user who changed their personal settings after installing 3.1.3 was going to lose those settings when we eventually released a fix .
The fix for this bug was easy .
We really wanted to get it done quickly .
The longer we left 3.1.3 out there , the worse it was going to be .
So on Wednesday , we released version 3.1.4 , containing nothing more than a fix for this client settings bug .
I 'm a golfer , so I refer to this kind of situation as a " mulligan " .
In golf , a mulligan is basically a " do - over " .
You hit a bad shot , so you just ignore it and try again .
I hate mulligans .
We shipped a maintenance release 48 hours after the previous one !
This was just embarrassing , but we figured the best we could do was just forget about it and go back to work .
When we came to the office Thursday morning , the world did n't seem quite as wonderful as it did on Tuesday , but we were ready to be optimistic again .
The mulligan was behind us .
We told ourselves we would n't need another maintenance release for the rest of the year .
Everyone went back to being busy developing the cool new features for Vault 4.0 .
And then we discovered the second bug which was introduced in 3.1.3 .
The first bug caused groaning .
This one provoked a few colorful metaphors .
Here 's the bug :
Add a binary file to the repository .
Branch the folder containing that file .
Now try and retrieve that file from the branch .
You can't .
The Vault server returns an error .
This bug had to be fixed .
There was no other alternative .
Developers get kind of fussy when they can't get their files from the repository .
So on Friday we released Vault 3.1.5 , the third maintenance release in a week .
This felt like one of the lowest points in our company history .
We started asking ourselves what went wrong .
Regression Testing
Clearly , this was a failure of " regression testing " .
I am a little hesitant use this term , as it makes me sound like a testing guru when I am not .
The real experts in the field of software testing can speak at great length about the many different kinds of testing .
There is unit testing , regression testing , integration testing , system testing , black box testing , white box testing , stress testing and that funky " Australian rules " testing where you have to hit the bug with your fist .
These guys can pick any one of these types of testing and write an entire textbook on it .
Sometimes when I see all this jargon I break out in a Forrest Gump imitation :
" I 'm not a smart man , but I know what testing is . " ( mp3 )
I am definitely not a testing guru , but I know about regression testing .
Regression testing is used to verify that you did n't accidentally break something .
Regression testing is what you do to make sure that the product did n't accidentally get worse .
Regression testing is the testing you do to prevent mulligans .
Despite the fiasco here at SourceGear last week , we do believe in regression testing .
In fact , we use three different ways of verifying that our product is n't moving backwards :
Automated tests .
Our automated build system sends every Vault build through a suite of regression tests to verify that nothing got broken .
Manual tests .
Every build we release is manually examined by testers to verify that nothing looks broken .
Dogfooding .
We use our own product , so most of the time we catch problems before the bits ever leave the building .
Somehow , those two bugs slipped through all three of these safety nets .
Evidently we need some more work in the area of regression testing .
As luck would have it , we were already in the process of revamping our build system to use continuous integration .
We originally started doing this because our customers want us to make sure that Vault works extremely well with CruiseControl .
NET .
But we will obviously gain the benefits internally as well .
The concept makes enormous sense .
If the product should " regress " , we want to know as quickly as possible .
So now we have a brand new automated build server which throws a hissy fit whenever something gets screwed up .
It 's an absurdly fast machine with dual - core Opterons and RAID disks .
Our build / test time went from 45 minutes on the old machine to just 15 minutes now .
We 're also going to get one of those nifty build orbs that changes color whenever the build fails .
Our next step is to write a few more regression tests to specifically deal with the situation from last week .
Then we need to set up NCover .
This will of course be a bad day .
Code coverage is the perfect example of the old maxim that " things get worse before they get better " .
Everyone 's experience with code coverage is basically the same .
The first time you run code coverage , you are horrified because no matter how comprehensive you think your test suite is , the initial percent coverage is surprisingly low .
That 's the beauty of using code coverage -- it gives you a useful quantitative result to replace a qualitative guess which is almost always wildly optimistic .
Finally , we need to start writing more regression tests and watch our percent coverage go up .
Our build and test practices were already very important to us .
Now we 're taking those practices to the next level .
However , and getting back to the place where this article started , sometimes the way to prevent mulligans is to not break the code in the first place .
An ounce of prevention ...
So why would an ISV ever intentionally release a product with known bugs ?
Several reasons :
You release with known bugs because you care about quality so deeply that you know how to decide which bugs are acceptable and which ones are not .
You release with known bugs because it is better to ship a product with a quality level that is known than to ship a product which is full of surprises waiting to happen .
You release with bugs because the alternative is to fix them and risk introducing more bugs which are worse than the ones you have now .
All of the reasons for such a decision are tied up in this one basic truth :
Every time you fix a bug , you risk introducing another one .
Every code change carries the potential for unintended side effects .
Stuff happens .
Even as I write this , I miss the blissful ignorance of life in group 2 .
Do n't we all start out with the belief that software only gets better as we work on it ?
The fact that we need regression testing is somehow like evidence that there is something wrong with the world .
After all , it 's not like anybody on our team is intentionally creating new bugs .
We 're just trying to make sure our product gets better every day , and yet , somewhere between 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 , we made it worse .
But that 's just the way it is .
Every code change is a risk .
A development cycle that does n't recognize this will churn indefinitely and never create a shippable product .
At some point , if the product is ever going to converge toward a release , you have to start deciding which bugs are n't going to get fixed .
To put it another way , think about what you want to say to yourself when look in the mirror just after your product is released .
The people in group 2 want to look in the mirror and say this :
" Our bug database has ZERO open items .
We did n't defer a single bug .
We fixed them all .
After every bug fix , we regression tested the entire product , with 100 % code coverage .
Our product is perfect , absolutely flawless and above any criticism whatsoever . "
The group 1 person wants to look in the mirror and say this :
" Our bug database has lots of open items .
We have carefully reviewed every one of them and consider each one to be acceptable .
In other words , most of them should probably not even be called bugs .
We are not ashamed of this list of open items .
On the contrary , we draw confidence from this list because we are shipping a product with a quality level that is well known .
There will be no surprises and no mulligans .
We admit that our product would be even better if all of these items were " fixed " , but fixing them would risk introducing new bugs .
We would essentially be exchanging these bugs which we find acceptable for the possibility of newly introduced bugs which might be showstoppers . "
I 'm not talking about shipping crappy products .
I 'm not suggesting that anybody ship products of low quality .
I 'm suggesting that decisions about software quality can be tough and subtle , and we need to be really smart about how to make those decisions .
Sometimes a " bug " should not be fixed .
Should we fix this bug or not ?
There are four questions to ask yourself about every bug :
Question One
When this bug happens , how bad is the impact ?
Severity Question Two
How often does this bug happen ?
Frequency Question Three
How much effort would be required to fix this bug ?
Cost Question Four
What is the risk of fixing this bug ?
Risk
Two of them are " customer questions " , and the other two are " developer questions " .
The Customer Questions : Severity and Frequency
For the first two questions , I like to visualize Severity and Frequency plotted on a 2D graph :
The vertical axis is Severity .
The top of the graph represents a bug with extremely severe impact :
" This bug causes the user 's computer to burst into flame . "
The bottom of the graph represents a bug with extremely low impact :
" One of the pixels on the splash screen is the wrong shade of gray . "
The horizontal axis is Frequency .
The right side represents a bug which happens extremely often :
" Every user sees this bug every day . "
The left side represents a bug which happens extremely seldom :
" This bug only affects people who live in eastern Washington state and who have both Visual Studio 2003 and Visual Studio 2005 installed and it only happens during leap years on the day that daylight savings time goes into effect and only if the first day of that month was a Tuesday . "
Try not to get hung up figuring out the exact line or curve which separates the bugs to be fixed from the bugs to be deferred .
Speaking very broadly , stuff gets more important as you move up or to the right of the graph .
The orange bug in the upper right should be fixed .
The blue bug in the lower left should not .
This graph is n't terribly useful as a formal analysis tool for bug sorting .
Attempts to be more quantitative are not likely to be productive .
However , the graph can be helpful as a communication tool .
Sometimes in a team discussion I actually draw this graph on a whiteboard when I am trying to argue for or against a certain bug .
The Developer Questions : Cost and Risk
Questions One and Two are about the importance of fixing a bug .
Questions
Three and Four are about the tradeoffs involved in fixing it .
Corollary :
The answers to Questions Three and Four can only make the priority of a bug go down , never up .
If after answering Questions One and Two it seems obvious that a given bug does not deserve attention , the other two questions should be skipped .
A common mistake is in using Question
Three to justify fixing a bug which is n't important .
Do n't make unimportant code changes just because they 're easy .
The real purpose of these two questions is when you already know that the Severity and Frequency suggest that a given bug should be fixed .
The questions about Cost and Risk are like a dialog box that says , " Are you sure ? "
Every code change has a cost and a risk .
Bad decisions happen when people make code changes ignoring these two issues .
Example : Item 6740
Vault stores all data using Microsoft SQL Server .
Some people do n't like this .
We 've been asked to port the back end to Oracle , PostgreSQL , MySQL and Firebird .
This issue is in our bug database as item 6740 .
The four questions would look like this :
Severity : People who refuse to use SQL Server can't use Vault at all .
: People who refuse to use SQL Server can't use Vault at all .
Frequency :
This " bug " affects none of our current users .
It merely prevents a group of people ( those who refuse to use SQL Server ) from using our product .
: This " bug " affects none of our current users .
It merely prevents a group of people ( those who refuse to use SQL Server ) from using our product .
Cost :
Very high .
Vault 's back end makes extensive use of features which are extremely specific to Microsoft SQL Server .
Contrary to popular belief , SQL is n't portable .
Adapting the backend for any other database would take months , and the ongoing maintenance costs of two backends would be quite high .
: Very high .
Vault 's back end makes extensive use of features which are extremely specific to Microsoft SQL Server .
Contrary to popular belief , SQL is n't portable .
Adapting the backend for any other database would take months , and the ongoing maintenance costs of two backends would be quite high .
Risk :
In terms of newly introduced bugs , the primary risk here lies in any code changes we would make to the server to enable it to speak to different back end implementations of the underlying SQL store .
Bottom line :
This example is easy .
It 's obviously more of a feature request than a bug .
Still we 've talked about this , and the four questions play a part of the discussion .
Example : Item 10016
I told the story of Vault 3.1.3 - 4 - 5 mostly to illustrate the fact that code changes can have unintended side effects and that we need more regression testing .
However , it is reasonable to discuss this fiasco in the context of my four questions .
As an example , consider the " ca n't fetch binary files after a branch " bug .
We introduced this bug during an attempt to fix bug 10016 , another bug which involves a problem with conversion of End - Of - Line terminators for Linux and MacOS users .
The four questions for this EOL bug would have looked something like this :
Severity :
For a certain class of users , this bug is a showstopper for their use of Vault .
It does not threaten data integrity , but it makes Vault unusable .
: For a certain class of users , this bug is a showstopper for their use of Vault .
It does not threaten data integrity , but it makes Vault unusable .
Frequency :
This bug only affects users on non-Windows platforms , currently a rather small percentage of our user base .
: This bug only affects users on non-Windows platforms , currently a rather small percentage of our user base .
Cost :
The code change for this bug is small and appears simple .
: The code change for this bug is small and appears simple .
Risk :
We obviously thought the risk here was low .
Hindsight is 20/20 . :-)
If regression testing had told us that the Risk was higher than we thought , we would have revisited the four questions .
Because the Frequency is relatively low , we might have decided to defer this bug fix until we figured out how to do it without breaking things .
In fact , that 's what we ended up doing .
In the 3.1.5 release last Friday , we simply un - did the fix for bug 10016 .
Bug 10016 is now " open " again .
A 3.1.6 maintenance release is therefore probably on the way . :-(
Example : Item 4860
From an idealist 's point of view , a nice feature of a version control system is the fact that nothing ever really gets deleted .
Your repository is a complete archive of every checkin which has ever occurred .
But in real life , sometimes you actually do want to pretend that something never happened .
For these situations , Vault has a feature called Obliterate .
Unlike the Delete command , which does n't really delete anything , the Obliterate command is destructive .
Bug 4860 basically says that our Obliterate command is slow .
Severity : Obliterate is slow .
Really slow .
: Obliterate is slow .
Really slow .
Frequency : Obliterate is not a command which is used every day .
Still , most users need it once in a while .
: Obliterate is not a command which is used every day .
Still , most users need it once in a while .
Cost :
The effort required is very close to a complete rewrite of the feature .
Ballpark estimate :
One developer , code complete in a month .
: The effort required is very close to a complete rewrite of the feature .
Ballpark estimate :
One developer , code complete in a month .
Risk : Stunningly high .
This is the only feature in our product which destroys anything .
Every other aspect of Vault was designed with a pathological paranoia over loss of data .
Bug 4860 is a real pain the neck .
Users gripe about it , and we totally understand why .
However , in terms of Severity and Frequency , we 're only talking about slow performance of a feature which is not frequently used .
When you add Risk to the discussion , it suddenly becomes easy for our developers to procrastinate on bug 4860 and find something else more urgent to do .
The current implementation of this feature is slow as molasses , but it is known to be safe .
We are terrified of touching it .
Nonetheless , this bug is on the schedule for Vault 4.0 .
A product in its 4.0 release should be more polished and refined than it was at 2.0 .
I am not fond of this feature , but I admit that bug 4860 is valid and its time has come .
Market Context
Some of you already think I am making this issue far too complicated .
If so , you 're not gonna like this next part .
Not only do you have to answer the four questions , but you have to answer those questions with a good understanding of the context in which you are doing business .
Markets vary .
Each has its own competitive pressures and quality expectations .
You need to understand two things :
Understand the Quality Expectations of your market segment .
Understand what the Market Window is for your product .
I 'm probably going to get flamed for saying this , but it 's the truth , so here it is :
The reason we can ship products with " bugs " is that there are " bugs " that customers will find acceptable .
Nobody wants a crappy product , but that does n't mean that everybody expects every product to be utterly perfect .
Quality Expectations
Different market segments have different expectations about product quality .
People who write code for the space shuttle are dealing with higher quality standards than people who write casual games .
Years ago I worked as part of a team where the quality standards were incredibly high .
We were building software which was burned into the ROM of consumer cell phones .
This is a world where mulligans are not an option .
You only get one chance to burn that ROM .
Life is unbelievably bad if you discover a serious bug just after your software shipped inside a million phones .
Our development cycles were incredibly long , since most of the time was spent testing and bug - fixing until the code coverage level was well over 90 % and the traceability matrix was complete .
At SourceGear we build and sell version control tools .
People use our product to store and manage their own source code .
The quality expectations in our market are extremely high , but there is still a gap between those expectations and perfection .
Understanding those expectations is an important part of our decision - making .
A bug which affects the safety of our customers ' data is obviously going to be prioritized higher than anything else .
The fact is that last week 's mistakes are not going to be fatal for SourceGear .
In fact , in a bit of irony , it was our highest revenue week ever . :-)
What happened last week was embarrassing and frustrating , but the company will certainly survive .
The bugs we introduced in 3.1.3 were a potential inconvenience for our customers , but their data was never threatened , and since they download Vault releases over the Internet , it 's relatively simple for us to release fixes .
After three maintenance releases in five days , we swallowed our pride , briefly acknowledged how happy we are that Vault is not burned into the ROMs of a cell phone , and start figuring out how to prevent mulligans in the future .
Market Window
We all know what happens if a product falls short of the customers ' quality expectations .
For some ISVs , this is a problem , but most developers naturally have a sense of craftsmanship and pride in their work .
Good developers want to exceed the quality standards of their customers .
But is it possible to make a mistake by going too far ?
Can we err by exceeding the quality standards of our customers too much ?
Why would anyone mind if we shipped a product which was higher quality than the market needs ?
If quality could be obtained without tradeoffs , there would be no problem .
However , time is always a constraint .
There is a " market window " for your product , and it is closing .
After a certain point , the market does n't want your product anymore .
It 's too late .
And product quality takes a lot of time .
Increases in the quality of your product tend to become an exercise in constantly diminishing returns .
Which of the following choices makes more sense ?
Deliver a product today with a quality level that your market considers acceptable .
Deliver a product one year later with a quality level that is higher than your market requires .
Choosing the second option gives you the warm and fuzzy feeling of building a really high quality product .
This is a cool thing .
Good developers must have a sense of pride in their craftsmanship , and nothing I say should be construed to diminish the importance of that .
Furthermore , having a higher quality product offers competitive benefits .
All else equal , fully informed customers will choose the higher quality product .
But the fact is that shipping a year later means missing out on a year of important benefits , not the least of which is revenue .
In most market segments , there is a competitor who is ready and willing to help customers while you spend that year climbing the asymptotic hill toward product perfection .
Congratulations on building a product which makes you feel good .
Unfortunately , your ISV is now dead .
Remember , I 'm not arguing for crappy software .
I 'm arguing that building products to please yourself instead of your customers is always a mistake .
Quality and craftsmanship are incredibly important .
If you 're going to err to one side of this issue , obviously you should go for more quality , not less .
But black - and - white perfectionist thinking will kill your ISV .
Most people can intuitively recognize that there is no such thing as a software product which is absolutely 100 % perfect .
A central skill of managing an ISV is making tough decisions about exactly how your product is going to miss perfection .
Eric , why are you making this so complicated ?
I 'm not the one making this complicated -- it got that way all by itself . :-)
I know what you want .
I want it too .
I want a way to make all these decisions easy .
I want an algorithm with simple inputs that tells me which bugs I should fix and the order in which I should fix them .
I want to implement this algorithm as a feature in our bug - tracking product and make gigabucks selling it to all those people who think they can save money by hiring software development managers that are devoid of clue .
Would n't this be a killer feature ?
In the Project Settings dialog , the user would enter a numeric value for " Market Quality Expectations " and a specific schedule for the closing of the " Market Window " .
For every bug , the user would enter numeric values for Severity , Frequency , Cost and Risk .
The Priority field for each bug would then be automatically calculated .
Sort the list on Priority descending and you see the order in which bugs should be fixed .
The ones near the bottom will have a Priority less than zero , indicated that they should not be fixed at all .
Heck , I 'd probably even patent this algorithm .
I have long suspected that I am a complete hypocrite on the issue of software patents .
In principle , I believe that software patents are fundamentally evil , but my ethics would probably do a 180 if I had a patent which allowed me to purchase a Gulfstream jet . :-)
Alas , this ethical quandary is n't going to happen , as " Eric 's Magic Bug Priority Algorithm " does not exist , and it never will .
There is no formula to make this easy .
Figuring out exactly how your product is going to be imperfect is hard .
It should be hard .
The bad news is that there is no shortcut .
Understand your context , ask all four questions , and use your judgment .
The good news is that experienced developers can usually make these decisions very quickly .
In many cases , it only takes a few seconds to mentally process the four questions and make a decision .
In the tougher cases , gather two coworkers near a whiteboard and the right answer will probably show up soon .
Eric Sink , Code Economist
The title on my business card says " Software Craftsman " , a choice which reflects my preference for speaking of software development in terms of craftsmanship rather than engineering or art .
But I admit that my metaphor is not a perfect match .
Comparing shrinkwrap software development to handcrafts does n't adequately reflect the part of my job which requires tough decisions .
A cross -stitch piece can be perfect .
A non-trivial software product cannot .
For this reason , I also like to compare shrinkwrap software development to macroeconomics .
It 's an optimization problem .
Every choice involves tradeoffs .
Success is not found by building a perfect product , but rather , by finding a perfect set of compromises .
Apparently Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan is going to be out of work in a couple months .
Perhaps he should consider a career in software ?
He might be good at it . :-)
FEBRUARY 26 , 2006
In 1990 , a year or two before he became super - famous , Rush Limbaugh guest - hosted Pat Sajak ’s short - lived talk show .
It did n’t go so well :
The taping was disrupted by a group of angry activists who were seated throughout the audience .
A visibly rattled Limbaugh was unable to regain control of the show .
“ He came out full of bluster and left a very shaken man , ” a CBS executive later said .
“ I had never seen a man sweat as much in my life . ”
Eventually Limbaugh made it to the first commercial break , and then , barely , to the next one ; when the show returned from the second break , the activists were gone — along with the rest of the audience .
A demoralized Limbaugh then delivered self - serving closing remarks to an empty studio .
This is from one of my Media Shower tapes ( hence the phone number and other graphics that are occasionally superimposed over the video ) .
The clip is about 11 minutes long , and it ’s fricking awesome .
A recent Digg blog campaign sought to credit Microsoft with an early lead in using its Xbox 360 against Apple ’s iTunes , iPod , and the forthcoming iTV in rival efforts to sell movies online -- or in Microsoft ’s case , to sell exploding media rentals .
However , the story failed to mention that Microsoft has only sold 6 million XBox 360s in the last year , and most these require a hard drive upgrade in order to download movies .
Digg users fell for the story and it was widely propagated through the blogosphere as a news item .
Is it possible that anonymous blogs , popping out of nowhere without any history , might lack credibility and have ulterior motives ?
Haha .
Michael Murphy , Professional Faux - Blogger
The anonymous “ Apple Gazette ” that pushed this story using Digg is actually run by the same Michael Murphey of Texas - - aka whitebreadmike -- who incessantly attacks anything critical of the Zune .
Hmm .
Murphey maintains an array of anonymous blogs that all spread false information and cloaked FUD attacks by serving up rabid attacks on everything Apple , while sometimes also pretending to be an Apple fan site .
Murphey works as a pay for say ‘ professional blogger ’ who advertises his ability to push any propaganda through Digg for a fee .
Digg users have been eating up everything Murphey throws out .
For example , Murphey has been working to create rumors of an imminently available new “ video iPod , ” apparently in an effort to try to get iPod buyers to hold off on their purchases and perhaps consider the Zune .
Murphey has more alter ego aliases on Digg than he has website domain names .
At one point he could claim whitebreadmike , MrsMurphy , themurph2099 , and several others that have since all been banned for fraud use .
His accomplices also hide behind fake names , including carapi , monkeybutler , and lackawak , who was also banned by Digg for fraud .
He quickly turned up again as lackawack2 , 3 , and is now somewhere around 6 .
Censoring Digg
Mike Caddick -- aka Zybch -- also runs vigilant Apple censorship campaigns , complaining that the information he works to bury is “ biased . ”
However , he turned down an offer to publish his own views here , and instead launched another anonymous blog devoted to attacking RDM : cynicalapple.com .
These characters really pushed things over the top by trying to mount a disinformation campaign against RDM , accusing me of “ gaming ” the system they ’ve repeatedly censored and subverted to fit their own needs and business goals .
Bloggers were happy to drink their KoolAid .
Pot , Kettle Black
If RDM is gaming Digg , why are my articles , which were regularly always on the front page , now immediately censored as soon as Zybch / Lackawak / Carapi notices the article and begins to harass
Digg users in tirades of profanity , accusing them all of being sibyls ?
Have Digg users in general suddenly decided that all they want on the front page of Digg ’s Apple section is a series of press releases and funny pictures , or was it no coincidence that the censoring started the day Lackawak promised to start a “ vigilante ” fraud campaign against RDM , which happened to coincide with an article questioning Microsoft ’s marketing , technology and fashion sense ?
Astroturf Green
Further , who profits from repressing unflattering information about the Internet misinformation campaigns that promote everything from the Zune to the Greenpeace assault on Apple ?
With Digg hiding the identities of the narrow minority of users who subvert the entire system to promote corporate interests , there ’s no way to tell for sure .
While Digg occasionally takes action against fraudulent digging , it ignores fraud censorship completely , which is far easier to orchestrate .
With paid propaganda shills faux - blogging Digg ’s system full of misinformation , and shamelessly advertising their services to anyone interested , it ’s obvious that there ’s a profit motive .
Without any open accountability , one can only speculate on where the money actually comes from and where it goes .
The problem with the anonymous Internet is that services like Digg fail to exercise any of the accountability of traditional news sources , and are happy to be used to spread false information if it results in ad clicks .
That ’s something that Apple has the power to change , but who knows when ?
It has more profitable pursuits to follow .
What the pro-Zune cabal that runs Digg ’s censorship committee does n’t want you to know is that the Zune is in serious sales trouble .
That ’s a problem that no amount of fake and anonymous blogs can cover up , no matter how much disinformation they spew .

Ashley 's parents refer to their daughter as " Pillow Angel "
Ashley 's story
The nine - year - old , named Ashley , has the mental ability of a three - month - old baby and cannot walk or talk .
Along with hormone doses to limit her growth , Ashley 's parents also opted for surgery to block breast growth and had her uterus and appendix removed .
They say the treatment will help to improve her quality of life .
Ashley 's parents , Seattle residents who have not given their names , went public over their daughter 's treatment in a blog launched on 1 January .
Their decision came after information about Ashley 's case was published in a US medical journal last year , triggering considerable debate and criticism .
Faced with Ashley 's medical reality , as her deeply loving parents , we worked with her doctors to do all we could to provide Ashley with the best possible quality of life
Ashley 's parents
' Frozen girl ' medical debate
Ashley 's parents say that because she will remain the weight of a child , it will be easier for them to move her around , bathe her and involve her in family activities - movement that will benefit her physical and mental well - being .
Dr Douglas Diekema from the University of Washington in Seattle , who was on the ethics committee that gave the go - ahead for Ashley 's treatment , told the BBC that the panel agreed " because the parents convinced us it was in fact in this little girl 's best interests " .
" If she were smaller it would be much easier for them to continue to provide a much more personal level of care , " he said .
But Agnes Fletcher of the UK's Disability Rights Commission said is was " unnecessary medical treatment to deal with what is essentially a social problem " , referring to " the poverty and lack of support " faced by families with disabled children .
' Improve her life '
Ashley 's parents wrote in their blog : " A fundamental and universal misconception about the treatment is that it is intended to convenience the caregiver .
" Rather , the central purpose of the treatment is to improve Ashley 's quality of life . "
Ashley has static encephalopathy , a rare brain condition which will not improve .
Her parents call her " Pillow Angel " , because she does not move from wherever they put her , usually on a pillow .
The couple decided three years ago to take steps to minimise their daughter 's adult height and weight .
In July 2004 Ashley began hormone treatment , through patches on the skin , that is expected to reduce her untreated height by 20 % and weight by 40 % .
Abuse fears
Ashley 's parents said the decision to remove their daughter 's uterus and breast buds was for the girl 's comfort and safety .
" Ashley has no need for her uterus since she will not be bearing children , " they said , adding that the decision means she will not experience the menstrual cycle and the bleeding and discomfort commonly associated with it .
HAVE YOUR SAY
They have my every good wish .
I 'm sure she 's in safe hands .

The operation also removed the possibility of pregnancy if Ashley were ever the victim of sexual abuse , they said .
The removal of the girl 's breast buds was also done in part to avoid sexual abuse , but was carried out primarily so she would not experience discomfort when lying down , the parents said .
The couple emphasised their love for their daughter and said the amount of criticism their choice of treatment attracted had surprised them .
George Dvorsky , a member of the Board of Directors for the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies said : " If the concern has something to do with the girl 's dignity being violated , then I have to protest by arguing that the girl lacks the cognitive capacity to experience any sense of indignity .
" The oestrogen treatment is not what is grotesque here .
Rather , it is the prospect of having a full - grown and fertile woman endowed with the mind of a baby . "
Last year was the warmest on record in the UK , Met Office figures show
An extended warming period , resulting from an El Nino weather event in the Pacific Ocean , will probably push up global temperatures , experts forecast .
They say there is a 60 % chance that the average surface temperature will match or exceed the current record from 1998 .
The scientists also revealed that 2006 saw the highest average temperature in the UK since records began in 1914 .
The global surface temperature is projected to be 0.54C ( 0.97 F ) above the long - term average of 14C ( 57 F ) , beating the current record of 0.52C ( 0.94 F ) , which was set in 1998 .
The annual projection was compiled by the UK Met Office 's Hadley Centre , in conjunction with the University of East Anglia .
El Nino effect
Chris Folland , head of the Hadley Centre 's climate variability research , said the forecast was primarily based on two factors .
The first was greenhouse gas emissions from human activity , he said .
" This is a statistical method ; it is a number that represents the heating of the atmosphere .
" Greenhouse gases cause heating , while aerosols cause cooling , " Professor Folland told BBC News .
" The other factor which allows us to make a forecast that whether one year is significantly different from the next is the effect of the El Nino . "
El Nino events are marked by the arrival of unusually warm waters off the north - western coast of South America , and are described as the largest influence on the year - to - year variability of the Earth 's climate .
This year 's potential to be a record breaker is linked to a moderate strength El Nino already established in the Pacific Ocean .
The World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) said that it was expected to continue into the first quarter of this year , which would have a knock - on effect .
" There is a big lag between the El Nino and the warming of global temperatures - it takes about four months or perhaps a bit longer , " Professor Folland explained .
" We have two methods of forecasting the effect of the El Nino .
One is a statistical method based on two patterns of sea surface temperatures in the El Nino region , and the other is a complex mathematical model . "
He said that the forecast was then fine - tuned by looking back over data from the previous 50 years .
" We have actually run this forecast three times , updating it every month ... and it is completely stable . "

Have you noticed changes in your environment ?
How has your world changed ?
Send us your observations
The 60 % probability that 2007 would set a new record meant that it " was more likely than not " , he concluded .
The Hadley Centre has been issuing the annual forecast for the past seven years and says it has just a 0.06C margin of error .
In December , the WMO released provisional data on the global average surface temperature for 2006 .
It estimated that last year was 0.42C ( 0.75 F ) above the 1961 - 1990 average , making it the sixth warmest on record .
However , the UK experienced the warmest year on record in 2006 , according to Met Office figures released alongside the global forecast .
The meteorologists said the mean temperature for the year was 9.7C ( 49.5 F ) , 1.1C ( 2 F ) above the long - term average , based on the period between 1971 - 2000 .
The program for the 2007 International Solid State Circuits Conference ( ISSCC ) in early February is out , and Stephen Shankland over at CNET spotted it before I did .
You might have seen his article a few days ago , so here 's my own take on the program 's highlights .
POWER6 and Cell
The short description for IBM 's POWER6 session ( quoted below ) does n't really tell us much about the processor that we did n't already know :
5.1 Design of the POWER6TM Microprocessor J. Friedrich , B. McCredie , N. James , B. Huott , B. Curran , E. Fluhr , G. Mittal , E. Chan , Y. Chan , D. Plass , S. Chu , H. Le , L. Clark , J. Ripley , S. Taylor1 , J. Dilullo , M. Lanzerotti
The POWER6TM microprocessor combines ultra-high frequency operation , aggressive power reduction , a highly scalable memory subsystem , and mainframe - like reliability , availability , and serviceability .
The 341 mm2 700 M transistor dual - core microprocessor is fabricated in a 65nm SOI process with 10 levels of low -k copper interconnect .
It operates at clock frequencies over 5GHz in high - performance applications , and consumes under 100W in power - sensitive applications .
This session will probably reveal long - awaited details of the POWER6 microarchitecture .
We should finally be able to solve the long - standing riddle of how close POWER6 is to the POWER4 / 5/970 lineage , and how close it is to the PPE architecture that powers parts of Cell and the Xbox 360 .
We might also learn more about how IBM managed to combine a clock frequency north of 5GHz with such a low power envelope ( 100W in some applications ) on a 65 nm process .
Note that there are some implications here with respect to The Switch , but any musings about POWER6's apparently miraculously high clockspeed / watt ratio , Jobs ' claims about reasons for moving to Intel , and what Jobs knew about POWER6 when he made the decision to switch are all academic at this point .
This is especially true in light of what Bootcamp has done to the Mac vs. Windows switcher equation .
Mac marketshare is up , and many current Windows users are now considering the Mac because if they decide they do n't like OS X , they can always install Windows on the machine .
The program also contains a session on a new version of Cell that 's clocked at 6GHz and fabbed on a 65 nm process .
High - performance computing buyers of Cell will be happy to have that options , but the impact on Sony is less clear .
Basically , IBM could downclock this chip so that it runs at the same speed as the PS3's current processor , thereby saving on power consumption .
This would make the PS3 cheaper , because you could get rid of some of the elaborate cooling apparatus .
Note that the same would be true of a 65nm Xbox 360 chip from IBM , though no such chip is mentioned in the program .
PA Semi to unveil 2GHz dual - core PowerPC chip at 25W max
Speaking of PowerPC and stunning clockspeed / watt numbers , PA Semi will host a session on their heavily anticipated dual - core 2GHz PowerPC chip .
You may recall this chip from earlier reporting , as it was announced shortly after The Switch and it blew everyone 's mind .
The specs are worth repeating , because they 're so out of control for a laptop - capable chip :
Two 64 - bit , superscalar , out - of - order PowerPC processor cores with Altivec / VMX
Two DDR2 memory controllers ( one per core ! )
2MB shared L2 cache
I / O unit that has support for : eight PCIe controllers , two 10 Gigabit Ethernet controllers , four Gigabit Ethernet controllers
65 nm process
5 - 13 watts typical @ 2GHz , depending on the application
This looks like a great SoC , and it would 've made for a fabulous Apple portable .
Oh well ; life goes on .
Anyway , this chip will probably see use in markets from embedded all the way up to HPC .
With all of that per-chip I/O bandwidth and at 25W ( max ) a pop , you can go nuts ganging these together in a blade chassis .
( As with POWER6 , David Kanter at RWT has the in - depth scoop on this chip , if you 're looking for more details . )
Intel touts Terascale research chip , AMD opens up quad - core Opteron
When news of Intel 's 80 - core , floating - point - centric , " Terascale " prototype chip broke , it was pretty clear that this was a research project that was n't intended for market anytime soon .
I suppose the project is going well enough that Intel is doing a session at ISSSC on it , a fact that may up the likelihood of this thing becoming a reality .
For my part , I wonder if this has any relation to the whole Intel GPGPU skunkworks project that the Register has been on about recently .
If Intel uses the Terascale chip 's TSV ( through silicon via ) interconnect technology to stack a bunch of fast SRAM onto a cutting - edge GPU design , they may eat everyone 's lunch .
On the AMD side of the fence , the quad - core Opteron gets its own session .
Hopefully , AMD will release even more microarchitectural details on the new design , so that we can get a better sense of how it stacks up to Woodcrest .
The artificial hand has an opposing thumb
At present , prosthetic hands either do not move at all or have a simple single - motor grip .
But the University of Southampton team has designed a prototype that uses six sets of motors and gears so each of the five fingers can move independently .
Details of their design were presented at an Institute of Physics conference .
The aim is to create a hand with the sort of functionality a human hand has but also a sense of touch
Dr Paul Chappell
Every year 200 people in the UK lose their hands .
Common causes include motorbike accidents and industrial incidents .
It is hard for scientists to replicate hand movement , as the real thing has 27 bones and can make a huge number of complex movements and actions .
The Southampton team believe their prototype is able to make movements and grip objects in the same way that a real hand does .
The new hand - called the Southampton Remedi- Hand - can be connected to muscles in the arm via a small processing unit and is controlled by small contractions of the muscles which move the wrist .
Clutching small objects
Researcher Dr Paul Chappell , a medical physicist who worked on the device , said : " With this hand you can clutch objects such as a ball , you can move the thumb out to one side and grip objects with the index finger in the way you do when opening a lock with a key , and you can wrap your fingers around an object in what we call the power grip - like the one you use when you hold a hammer or a microphone . "
The latest design is also very light - at 400g it is lighter than the average human hand .
Heavy prosthetics can be extremely uncomfortable and cause injury to the area where it joins with the arm .
The hand was built in three parts - the three middle fingers are very similar in size and movement so those were made identical .
The little finger is a smaller version of the same .
Each of these four fingers are made up of a motor attached to a gearbox attached to a carbon fibre finger .
All of this is fitted to a carbon fibre palm .
Thumb technology
But the thumb was much more complicated .
The human thumb can move in special ways the fingers cannot .
It can rotate as well as flex and also move in a variety of different directions .
It can also oppose ( touch ) each of the fingers in the hand to form a ' pinch ' .
To mimic this , the Remedi - Hand uses two motors - one to allow it to rotate and one to allow it to flex .
The researchers say it has the first artificially - made opposable thumb .
Dr Chappell said : " The real thumb can move in five types of way , we 've managed to create a thumb that can mimic at least two of these which is a really exciting achievement .
" It 's a thumb that has really good flexibility and functionality . "
The next stage will be to integrate the latest sensor technology to create a ' clever ' hand which can sense how strongly it is gripping an object , or whether an object is slipping .
Dr Chappell said : " The aim is to create a hand with the sort of functionality a human hand has but also a sense of touch . "
Jared O'Mara , of the British Council of Disabled People , welcomed the Southampton work .
He said : " We are eager to see how such a device will work in practice and are hopeful that it will help many disabled people to lead easier lives , in particular during the course of day to day remedial tasks . "
Aliens take note : reader Gordon Milne has written in to point out that the Aussies actually created the world 's biggest logo years before KFC decided it was a good idea to plonk a 65,000 - square - foot Colonel Sanders mosaic in the Nevada desert .
Yes indeed , look on in awe and wonder at DownUnder 's 3.2 km - long Readymix monster :
According to those in the know down at the Google Earth Community , this concrete extravagance was knocked together in 1965 by construction crews laying the Eyre highway across the Nullarbor .
From 1979 until 1992 , it was rated by the Guinness Book of Records as the largest lettering in the world .
Impressive yes , but it was n't the first .

However , for the original " hi , we 're down here , come and visit " logo , we must look to the ancient civilisation of Peru 's Nazca plateau :

If you stand on the corner of Regent Street and Wigmore Street in central London , you are within five miles of 164 branches of Starbucks .
This is a fact that is liable to provoke sudden dizziness , followed by a deep , soul - corroding fear for the future of humankind , sending you scuttling to your bedroom to throw yourself , sobbing , underneath a pillow - although this wo n't help much either , since that pillow itself is within five miles of 158 branches of Starbucks , if it 's my bedroom you 're in , which , now I come to think of it , I hope you are n't .
You can calculate your personal " Starbucks density " on the company 's website ( Starbucks.com / locator ) , but be warned : any figure you come up with now will soon be out of date .
Yesterday , the company announced a massive UK expansion , focused on London , where it expects to open new outlets at the rate of one a fortnight over the next 10 years .
How many Starbucks is too many ?
In what seems now like a distant historic era - actually , it was 1999 - the frenzied growth of the US chain became a symbol of expansionist multinational capitalism , all the more insidious because of the way each branch posed as a cosy neighbourhood coffee shop when , in fact , it was driving neighbourhood coffee shops to the wall .
( Admittedly , the argument always had more credibility in San Francisco or Seattle than in Britain , where we did n't really have coffee shops in the first place . )
Now there are 530 branches in the UK , but that does n't mean there is n't still room for aggressive expansion .
Starbucks is a long - time practitioner of clustering , whereby the chain opens outlets so close to each other that it ends up cannibalising its own business .
At first glance , this does n't seem to make any business sense .
" But that 's because they 're in it for the long game , which is market share , " says Andrew Simms , of the New Economics Foundation , which has published reports condemning the " cloning " of the British high street .
In other words , cannibalisation is worth it , if the overall effect is to solidify your position as the first name anyone thinks of when they think of coffee .
You or I might feel that living within five miles of 158 Starbucks is plenty .
But look at it from Starbucks ' point of view : there are hundreds , maybe even thousands of shops within five miles of my flat that are n't yet branches of Starbucks .
Although it is probably only a matter of time .
The Baltan motor , developed earlier this year , is the size of a grain of salt .

An international team of scientists is developing what they say will be the world 's first microrobot – as wide as two human hairs – that can swim through the arteries and digestive system .
The scientists are designing the 250 - micron device to transmit images and deliver microscopic payloads to parts of the body outside the reach of existing catheter technology .
It will also perform minimally invasive microsurgeries , said James Friend of the Micro / Nanophysics Research Laboratory at Australia 's Monash University , who leads the team .
The researchers hope the device will reduce the risks normally associated with delicate surgical procedures .
While others have tried and failed to create microrobots for arterial travel , Friend believes his team will succeed because they are the first to exploit piezoelectric materials – crystals that create an electric charge when mechanically stressed – in their micromotor design .
" People have tried various techniques , including electromagnetic motors , " Friend said .
" But at this scale , electromagnetic motors become impractical because the magnetic fields become so weak .
No one has taken the trouble to build piezoelectric motors at the same scales , for this kind of application . "
Funded by the Australian Research Council , Friend 's team is tweaking larger versions of the device , and expects to have a working prototype later this year and a completed version by 2009 .
The scientists say stroke , embolism and vascular - disease patients should be the first to benefit from the new technology .
The tiny robot , small enough to pass through the heart and other organs , will be inserted using a syringe .
Guided by remote control , it will swim to a site within the body to perform a series of tasks , then return to the point of entry where it can be extracted , again by syringe .
For example , the microrobot might deliver a payload of expandable glue to the site of a damaged cranial artery – a procedure typically fraught with risk because posterior human brain arteries lay behind a complicated set of bends at the base of the skull beyond the reach of all but the most flexible catheters .
There 's a high risk of puncturing one of these arteries , which almost always results in the death of the patient .
Other regions of the body are completely outside the reach of current technology , including congenital arteriovenous malformations , or AVMs , which recently afflicted South Dakota Sen .
Tim Johnson .
The microrobot 's design is based on the E. coli bacterium , complete with flagella that will propel it through the body .
Scientists will make the flagella out of human hair in the preliminary research stages , and eventually they want to try using Kevlar .
The theory behind the microrobot 's propulsion system is modeled after turbine and helicopter blades , Friend said .
" In and of itself , the idea is not especially new , but it has always fallen down around the propulsion system , " he said .
The piezoelectric materials vibrate a twisted microstructure inside the robot at ultrasonic frequencies .
When the twisted structure is compressed against the rotor , it untwists and the rotor turns .
As the compression is released , the twisted structure unwinds back to its original shape , while the rotor slides .
Working with the flagella , the tiny propulsion system creates enough power to carry the device through the viscous , fluid environment inside the human body , Friend said .
Friend 's lab has developed larger prototype motors about the size of a grain of sand , shown in this video .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGoSzNjEQ4M
Even the most sophisticated motor can break down , and then what ?
" It is indeed something we 're concerned about , " Friend said .
That 's why the scientists plan to swim the robot against the current of the blood , so if it loses power it will return to the point of entry .
And for the riskiest procedures , the robot could be tethered by a microcatheter , he said .
Israeli scientists announced last October that they were developing a microrobot that could travel through the spinal canal .
But going into the arteries is a much more challenging proposition , according to Moshe Shoham , who led the Israeli team .
" The spinal canal is a little bit bigger , and there is n't the high flow that you have in the bloodstream , so the power that you need for the propulsion is smaller , " said Shoham .
" The idea to have a swimming device that uses tails for propulsion is very good because with such small dimensions swimming like a fish cannot work , " Shoham said .
" It would be a revolution if we could have some device that could go inside the human body 's arteries , and either send out images or perform some kind of therapeutic action . "
One can easily imagine the device being used for ill .
Imagine the bot rigged with an RFID tag embedded in a part of the body , the brain perhaps , where retrieving the tag would kill the recipient .
" I think the use of this sort of technology is like any other technology in the sense that it is subject to the desires , for better or worse , of the people with the ability to make use of it , " Friend said .
" In light of human history I would n't be surprised to see the entire gambit from dystopia to utopia played out in miniature here .
Even so , I remain optimistic . "

Editor 's note : Name that bot !
James Friend wants your help naming the artery - traveling microrobot .
Other bots in Friend 's lab are called " Baltan " ( based on a Japanese children 's show character ) and " The Scream . "

An Algorithmic Approach to English Pluralization
Damian Conway
School of Computer Science and Software Engineering

Abstract
The problem of English plurals
The use of English plurals in synthetic sentences is a case in point .
In computing applications , for example , it is quite common to encounter error messages which jar because they do not correctly inflect for grammatical number :
Compilation aborted : 1 errors were detected .
print " Compilation aborted : $ count " , ( $ count==1 ? " error was " : " errors were " ) , " detected .
" ;
Her criterion differs from mine .
The Major General met the Governor General .
Analysis of this aquarium 's fish failed to determine its genus .
That phalanx suffered a trauma .
Coping with English plurals in synthetic text
Ignoring the problem
" There were 1 errors "
One might argue that this approach is economically rational , in that the extra cost and complexity involved in identifying and coding around that one special case outweighs the benefit of correctly handling it .
This , of course , is the perennial excuse for ugly and ungainly interfaces , and quite unassailable in the estimation of the utilitarian mind .
Avoiding the problem
Number of errors : 1 Number of errors : 10
1 error(s ) found. 10 error(s ) found .
A " manual " scheme
sub select_pl ( $ $ ) { my ( $ word , $ count ) = @_ ; $ word =~ s# \ ( ( [ ^ ) / ] * ) /( [ ^ ) ] * ) \ ) # $ count==1 ?
$ 1 : $ 2 # ge ; return $ word }
print select_pl ( " $ count error ( / s ) ( was / were ) found " , $ count ) ;

More complex algorithms that cope with specific suffixes ( - ss -> -sses , -y -> - ies , etc. ) can be specified , but pure suffix - based approaches will still be prone to exceptions and meta-exceptions .
For example : -y becomes - ies , except after a vowel ( when it becomes - ys ) , except for soliloquy ( which uses - ies ) .
A usable pluralization algorithm must therefore cope with three categories of plural formation : universal defaults , general suffix - based rules , and specific exceptional cases .
The following section examines each of these categories in more detail .
Categories of English plurals
Universal rules
The rules themselves are well - known and need no elaboration .
By default :
Nouns are made plural by appending -s .
.
Verbs are made plural by removing any trailing -s ( and otherwise do not change ) .
any trailing ( and otherwise do not change ) .
Adjectives and adverbs do not change when made plural .
Suffix categories
-ss
- sses
-y
ies
Certain types of adjectives also inflect in this way .
For example , possessive adjectives that end in - 's or -' in the singular are made plural by forming the plural of the root word and appending an apostrophe ( unless the root 's plural does not itself end in -s , in which case - 's is appended ) .
Hence cat 's becomes cats ' , axis ' becomes axes ' , whilst child 's becomes children's .
Other suffix categories arise because words of foreign origin ( most commonly Ancient Greek or Latin ) have retained a non-anglicized plural inflection .
Hence criterion becomes criteria , nucleus becomes nuclei , and matrix becomes matrices .
Dealing with such categories is complicated by the fact that many other imports have been wholly or partially anglicized .
Hence although criterion always forms its plural with - a , ganglion may take either -s or - a ( ganglions or ganglia ) , whilst bastion is always inflected with -s .
Occasionally the anglicized and " classical " plural forms of a word may both be in common use , but with distinct meanings .
Thus a copy - editor might remove appendices , whereas a surgeon would remove appendixes .
The correct inflection of words derived from Latin can be particularly complex , since the same suffix may form different Latinate plurals depending on the declension ( or sometimes the part of speech ) of the original .
Thus the plural of stimulus ( second declension ) is stimuli , and that of genus ( third declension ) is genera .
Status ( fourth declension ) is traditionally unchanged in the plural , whilst ignoramus ( a first person plural Latin verb ) has been wholly anglicized and becomes ignoramuses .
The only practical way to deal with such complexities in an algorithm is to categorize words by both suffix and inflection , and to allow for both anglicized and classical variants .
Table 1 illustrates such categories .
Singular
suffix Anglicized

( see Appendix A for comprehensive lists

Table 2 : Irregular English plurals
This table is surprisingly comprehensive , though certainly not exhaustive .
Indeed , specific dialects of English may define much larger sets of irregular plurals and may not recognize some of the entries in Table 2 .
Hence it is important that any algorithmic approach to pluralization be both extensible and adjustable , so that its output may be easily expanded or trimmed for a specific audience .
A pluralizing algorithm for English
The algorithms are based on the rules of English inflection described in the Oxford English Dictionary [ 5 ] ( OED ) , Fowler 's Modern English Usage [ 6 ] , and A Practical English Grammar [ 1 ] .
Where these sources disagree , the OED is taken to be definitive .

Nomenclature
suffix ( < suffix >)
This predicate returns true if the word being inflected ends in < suffix > .
Note that standard regular expression conventions are used after the " - " that introduces the suffix .
category ( < singular suffix > , < plural suffix >)
This predicate returns true if the word being inflected belongs to the set of English words whose suffixes inflect from < singular suffix > to < plural suffix > when pluralized .
inflection ( < singular suffix > , < plural suffix >)
This function returns the word being inflected , after replacing its current suffix ( which must be < singular suffix > ) with the suffix < plural suffix > .
stem ( < suffix >)
This function removes the specified suffix ( < suffix > ) from the word being inflected and returns the remaining stem .
If the word does not originally end in the specified suffix , a special " undefined " value is returned .
" the ( user - ) specified plural form "
This phrase is used whenever a word has been found to belong to an enumerated category .
The " specified plural form " is the appropriate anglicized or classical plural form of the word , as it appears in the category table .
An algorithm for forming plural nouns
Check if the user has defined an inflection for the noun , and , if so , accept that ... if the word matches a user - defined noun , return the user - specified plural form Handle words that do not inflect in the plural ( such as fish , travois , chassis , nationalities ending in - ese etc. - see Tables A.2 and A.3 ) ... if suffix ( - fish ) or suffix ( - ois ) or suffix ( - sheep ) or suffix ( - deer ) or suffix ( - pox ) or suffix ( - [ A - Z ] . * ese ) or suffix ( - itis ) or category ( - ,-) , return the original noun Handle pronouns in the nominative , accusative , and dative ( see Tables A.5 ) , as well as prepositional phrases ... if the word is a pronoun , return the specified plural of the pronoun if the word is of the form : " < preposition > < pronoun > " , return " < preposition > < specified plural of pronoun > "
Handle standard irregular plurals ( mongooses , oxen , etc. - see table A.1 ) ... if the word has an irregular plural , return the specified plural Handle irregular inflections for common suffixes ( synopses , mice and men , etc. ) ... if suffix ( - man ) , return inflection ( - man , - men ) if suffix ( - [ lm ] ouse ) , return inflection ( - ouse , - ice ) if suffix ( - tooth ) , return inflection ( - tooth , - teeth ) if suffix ( - goose ) , return inflection ( - goose , - geese ) if suffix ( - foot ) , return inflection ( - foot , - feet ) if suffix ( - zoon ) , return inflection ( - zoon , - zoa ) if suffix ( - [ csx ] is ) , return inflection ( - is , -es ) Handle fully assimilated classical inflections ( vertebrae , codices , etc. - see tables A.10 , A.14 , A.19 and A.20 , and tables A.11 , A.15 and A.21 if in " classical mode ) ... if category ( - ex , - ices ) , return inflection ( - ex , - ices ) if category ( - um , -a ) , return inflection ( - um , - a ) if category ( - on , -a ) , return inflection ( - on , - a ) if category ( - a , - ae ) , return inflection ( - a , - ae ) Handle classical variants of modern inflections ( stigmata , soprani , etc. - see tables A.11 to A.13 , A.15 , A.16 , A.18 , A.21 to A.25 ) ... if in classical mode , if suffix ( - trix ) , return inflection ( - trix , - trices ) if suffix ( - eau ) , return inflection ( - eau , - eaux ) if suffix ( - ieu ) , return inflection ( - ieu , - ieux ) if suffix ( -..[ iay ] nx ) , return inflection ( - nx , - nges ) if category ( - en , - ina ) , return inflection ( - en , - ina ) if category ( - a , - ata ) , return inflection ( - a , - ata ) if category ( - is , - ides ) , return inflection ( - is , - ides ) if category ( - us , - i ) , return inflection ( - us , - i ) if category ( - us , - us ) , return the original noun if category ( - o , - i ) , return inflection ( - o , - i ) if category ( - , - i ) , return inflection ( - , - i ) if category ( - , - im ) , return inflection (-, - im ) The suffixes - ch , - sh , and - ss all take -es in the plural ( churches , classes , etc ) ... if suffix ( - [ cs ]h ) , return inflection ( - h , - hes ) if suffix ( - ss ) , return inflection ( - ss , - sses ) Certain words ending in -f or - fe take -ves in the plural ( lives , wolves , etc ) ... if suffix ( - [ aeo ] lf ) or suffix ( -[ ^d ] eaf ) or suffix ( - arf ) , return inflection ( - f , - ves ) if suffix ( - [ nlw ] ife ) , return inflection ( - fe , - ves ) Words ending in -y take - ys if preceded by a vowel ( storeys , stays , etc. ) or when a proper noun ( Marys , Tonys , etc. ) , but - ies if preceded by a consonant ( stories , skies , etc. ) ... if suffix ( - [ aeiou ]y ) , return inflection ( -y , - ys ) if suffix ( - [ A - Z ] .*y ) , return inflection ( -y , - ys ) if suffix ( -y ) , return inflection ( -y , - ies ) Some words ending in -o take - os ( lassos , solos , etc. - see tables A.17 and A.18 ) ; the rest take - oes ( potatoes , dominoes , etc. )
However , words in which the -o is preceded by a vowel always take - os ( folios , bamboos ) ... if category ( - o , - os ) or suffix ( - [ aeiou ] o ) , return inflection ( - o , - os ) if suffix ( - o ) , return inflection ( - o , - oes ) Handle plurals of compound words ( Postmasters General , Major Generals , mothers - in - law , etc ) by recursively applying the entire algorithm to the underlying noun .
See Table A.26 for the military suffix - general , which inflects to - generals ... if category ( - general , - generals ) , return inflection ( - l , - ls ) if the word is of the form : " < word > general " , return " < plural of word > general " if the word is of the form : " < word > < preposition > < words > " , return " < plural of word > < preposition > < words > "
Otherwise , assume that the plural just adds -s ( cats , programmes , trees , etc. ) ... otherwise , return inflection ( -, -s )
Algorithm 1 : Plural inflection of nouns
An algorithm for forming plural verbs
Check if the user has defined an inflection for the verb , and , if so , accept that ... if the word matches a user - defined verb , return the user - specified plural form Check if the verb is being used as an auxiliary and has a known irregular inflection ( has seen , was going , etc. See Table A.8 for irregular verbs ) ... if the word has the form " < auxiliary > < words > " and < auxiliary > belongs to the category of irregular verbs , return " < specified plural of auxiliary > < words > "
Handle simple irregular verbs ( has , is , etc. - see Table A.8 ) ... if the word belongs to the category of irregular verbs , return the specified plural form Verbs in the regular 3rd person singular lose their - es , - ies , or - oes suffix ( she catches -> they catch , he tries -> they try , it does -> they do , etc. ) ... if suffix ( - [ cs ] hes ) , return inflection ( - hes , -h ) if suffix ( - [ sx ] es ) , return inflection ( - es , -) if suffix ( - zzes ) , return inflection ( - es , -) if suffix ( - ies ) , return inflection ( - ies , -y ) if suffix ( - oes ) , return inflection ( - oes , -o ) Other 3rd person singular verbs ending in -s ( but not - ss ) also lose their suffix ... if suffix ( - [ ^s ]s ) , return inflection (-s , -) Handle ambiguous simple verbs that might also be nouns ( thought , sink , fly , etc. - see Table A.4 ) ... if the word is in the ambiguous category , return the specified plural form
All other cases are regular 1st or 2nd person verbs , which do n't inflect ... otherwise , return the verb uninflected

Check if the user has defined an inflection for the adjective , and , if so , accept that ... if the word matches a user - defined adjective , return the user - specified plural form Handle indefinite articles and demonstratives ... if the word is " a " or " an " , return " some " if the word is " this " , return " these " if the word is " that " , return " those " Handle possessive pronouns ( my -> our , its -> their , etc - see Table A.7 ) ... if the word is a personal possessive , return the specified plural form Handle genitives ( dog's -> dogs ' , child's -> children's , Mary's -> Marys ' , etc ) .
The general rule is : remove the apostrophe and any trailing -s , form the plural of the resultant noun , and then append an apostrophe ( or -'s if the pluralized noun does n't end in -s ) ... if suffix ( -'s ) or suffix ( -' ) , if suffix ( -' ) , let the noun < owner > be inflection ( -' , -) otherwise , let the noun < owner > be inflection ( -'s , -) let the noun < owners > be the noun plural of < owner > if < owners > ends in -s , return " < owners > ' " otherwise , return " < owners > ' s "
In all other cases no inflection is required ... otherwise , return the adjective uninflected
Algorithm 3 : Plural inflection of adjectives
A unified algorithm
Handle user - defined cases ... try step 1 of Algorithm 3 try step 1 of Algorithm 2 try step 1 of Algorithm 1 Handle known adjectives ... try steps 2 through 4 of Algorithm 3 Handle known verbs ... try steps 2 through 5 of Algorithm 2 Handle singular nouns ending in -s ( ethos , axis , etc. - see Tables A.2 , A.3 , A.16 , A.22 , and A.23 ) ... if word is a noun ending in -s , try steps 2 through 13 of Algorithm 1 Handle 3rd person singular verbs ( that is , any other words ending in -s ) ... try steps 4 and 5 of Algorithm 2
Treat the word as a noun ... try steps 2 through 13 of Algorithm 1
Algorithm 4 : Unified plural inflection of nouns , verbs , and adjectives
Note that this sequence represents a particular compromise in the face of inherently ambiguous input .
Other compromises ( which might perhaps more heavily favour the verb sense of a word ) may also be defined , by selecting different subsets of the three algorithms or by changing the order in which the various subsets are used .
Issues and limitations
Homographs of heterogeneous case
it
It ate it ->
They ate them
it
it
->
they
Of course , where the necessary context is already provided ( for example , when forming the plural of a dative or ablative : to it , from it , with it , etc. ) , the noun algorithm detects this ( in step 3 ) and correctly returns the accusative plural form : to them , from them , with them , etc . )
Homographs of heterogeneous person
I eat
you eat
I see
you see
we eat
you eat
we see
you see
However , if a verb were to take common singular forms but different plurals ( for example , the atrophying British usage : I will -> you shall , you will -> you will ) , then the algorithms presented above would be unable to determine the correct inflection without additional context ( such as an extra " person " parameter ) .
The author is not currently aware of any other verbs in English which present this problem , but is not willing to assume ipso facto that none exist .
Other homographs with heterogeneous plurals

I put the mouses next to the keyboards .
Three basses were stolen from the band 's trailer .
Three bass were stolen from the band 's fishpond .
Several thoughts about leaving crossed my mind .
Several thought about leaving across my lawn .
If both meanings of the word are the same part of speech ( for example , bass is a noun in both sentences above ) , then one meaning is chosen as the " usual " meaning , and only that meaning 's plural is ever returned by any of the inflection subroutines .
is a noun in both sentences above ) , then one meaning is chosen as the " usual " meaning , and only that meaning 's plural is ever returned by any of the inflection subroutines .
If each meaning of the word is a different part of speech ( for example , thought is used as both a noun and a verb ) , then the noun 's plural is returned by the noun and unified algorithms , and the verb 's plural is returned only by the verb algorithm .
Finally , if the choice of a particular " usual inflection " is considered inappropriate for a particular application , it can always be changed by specifying an overriding user - defined inflection .

Algorithm 5 : " Number - insensitive " comparison
Note that , because steps 2 and 3 do not specify which pluralizing algorithm is used , Algorithm 5 is generic and may be readily adapted to deal with only nouns , verbs , or adjectives , or with all three at once .
Such adaptations merely involve selecting the appropriate algorithm ( Algorithms 1 through 4 respectively ) with which to generate the " appropriate plural " forms .
Where the algorithm is adapted to a particular part of speech , one or both of steps 4 and 5 may be omitted entirely , if inappropriate .
A Perl implementation
Lingua:: EN :: Inflect
http://www.perl.com
The exportable subroutines of Lingua : : EN : : Inflect provide plural inflections for English words .
Plural forms of most nouns , many verbs , and some adjectives are provided .
Where appropriate , " classical " variants are also provided .
The module also offers pronunciation - based selection of indefinite articles ( a and an ) , but discussion of those facilities is beyond the scope of this paper .
Inflecting plurals - the PL_ ... ( ) subroutines
Lingua:: EN :: Inflect
PL_
PL_
( )
The PL_ ... ( ) subroutines also take an optional second argument , which indicates the desired grammatical number of the word .
If the " number " argument is supplied and is not 1 ( or " one " or " a " ) , the plural form of the word is returned .
If the " number " argument does indicate singularity , the ( uninflected ) word itself is returned .
If the number argument is omitted , the plural form is returned unconditionally .
The various subroutines are :
PL_N ( $ ;$ ) PL_N ( ) takes a singular English noun or pronoun and returns its plural .
PL_V ( $ ;$ ) PL_V ( ) takes the singular form of a conjugated verb ( one which is already in the correct grammatical person and mood ) and returns the corresponding plural conjugation .
PL_ADJ ( $ ;$ ) PL_ADJ ( ) takes the singular form of certain types of adjectives and returns the corresponding plural form .
PL ( $ ;$ ) PL ( ) takes a singular English noun , pronoun , verb , or adjective and returns its plural form .
Where a word has more than one inflection depending on its sense , the ( singular ) noun sense is generally preferred to the ( singular ) verb sense .
Of course , the inherent ambiguity of such cases suggests that , where the part of speech is known , PL_N ( ) , PL_V ( ) , and PL_ADJ ( ) should be used in preference to PL ( ) .
PL ( " cat " )
" cats "
Modern vs classical inflections
Lingua:: EN :: Inflect
classical ( )
classical ( )
In classical mode , the non-anglicized plural form of a word ( if one exists ) is preferred .
Hence , whereas dogma is normally inflected to dogmas , if classical mode is active it becomes dogmata .
User - defined inflections - the def_ ... ( ) subroutines
Lingua:: EN :: Inflect
def_noun ( $ $ ) The def_noun ( ) subroutine takes a pair of string arguments : the singular and plural forms of the noun being specified .
The singular form specifies a pattern to be interpolated ( as m / ^ ( ? :$ first_arg ) $ / i ) .
Any noun matching this pattern is then replaced by the string in the second argument .
The second argument specifies a string which is interpolated after the match succeeds , and is then used as the plural form .
The second argument string may also specify a second variant of the plural form , to be used when " classical " plurals have been requested .
The beginning of the second variant is marked by a ' | ' character : def_noun ' cow ' => ' cows|kine ' ; def_noun '(.+i) o' => '$ 1os|$ 1i ' ;
If no classical variant is given , the same plural form is used in both normal and " classical " modes .
If the second argument is undef instead of a string , then the current user definition for the first argument is removed , and the standard ( algorithmic ) plural inflection is reinstated .
def_verb ( $ $ $ $ $ $ ) The def_verb ( ) subroutine takes three pairs of string arguments ( that is , six arguments in total ) , specifying the singular and plural forms of the three grammatical persons of verb .
As with def_noun ( ) , the singular forms are specifications of run-time - interpolated patterns , while the plural forms are specifications of ( up to two ) run-time - interpolated strings : def_verb ' am ' => ' are ' , ' ar ( e|t ) ' => ' are " , ' is ' => ' are ' ; def_adj ( $ $ )
The def_adj ( ) subroutine takes a pair of string arguments , which specify the singular and plural forms of the adjective being defined .
As with def_noun ( ) and def_verb ( ) , the singular forms are specifications of run-time - interpolated patterns , whilst the plural forms are specifications of ( up to two ) run-time - interpolated strings : def_adj ' dat ' => ' dose ' ; def_adj ' red ' => ' red|gules ' ;
Numbered plurals - the NO ( ) subroutine
PL_
( )
" I saw 3 ducks "
print " I saw $ N " , PL_N ( $ animal , $N ) , "
" ;
Lingua:: EN :: Inflect
NO ( $ ; $ )
print " I saw " , NO ( $animal , $N ) , "
" ;
" zero "
" nil "
" no "
$ N
I saw no ducks
I saw 0 ducks
" no "
Reducing the number of counts required - the NUM ( ) subroutine
PL_
()
print PL_ADJ ( " This " , $errors ) , PL_N ( " error " , $errors ) , PL_V ( " was " , $errors ) , " fatal .
" ;
Lingua:: EN :: Inflect
NUM ( $ ; $ )
PL_
()
NUM ( )
NUM ( $errors ) ; # SET DEFAULT NUMBER print PL_ADJ ( " This " ) , PL_N ( " error " ) , PL_V ( " was " ) , " fatal .
" ; NUM ( ) ; # CLEAR DEFAULT NUMBER
NUM ( )
print NUM ( $errors ) , PL_N ( " error " ) , PL_V ( " was " ) , " detected .
" print PL_ADJ ( " This " ) , PL_N ( " error " ) , PL_V ( " was " ) , " fatal .
" if $ severity > 1 ;
Interpolating inflections in strings - The inflect ( ) subroutine
PL _ ...()
To ameliorate this problem , Lingua : : EN : : Inflect provides an exportable string - interpolating subroutine ( inflect ( $ ) ) , that recognizes calls to the various inflection subroutines within a string and interpolates them appropriately .
Using inflect ( ) plurals can be interpolated directly into a string as follows :
NUM ( $errors ) ; print inflect " NO ( error ) PL_V ( was ) detected .
" ; print inflect " PL_ADJ ( This ) PL_N ( error ) PL_V ( was ) fatal .
" if $ errors && $ severity > 1 ;
Comparing " number- insensitively " - The PL_..._eq ( ) subroutines
Lingua:: EN :: Inflect
PL_eq ( $ $ )
PL_N_eq ( $ $ )
PL_V_eq ( $ $ )
PL_ADJ_eq ( $ $ )
PL ( )
PL_N ( )
PL_V ( )
PL_ADJ ( )
The actual value returned by the various PL_eq_ ... ( ) subroutines encodes which of the three equality rules succeeded : " eq " is returned if the strings were identical , " s:p " if the strings were singular and plural respectively , " p:s " for plural and singular , and " p:p " for two distinct plurals .
Inequality is indicated by returning an empty string .
Conclusion
It is possible to cater for differences in major usage patterns ( for example , modern and classical inflections ) and for local differences in dialect ( via user - defined inflections ) .
It is also possible to make use of the pluralization algorithms to efficiently detect pairs of words which differ only in grammatical number .
A free implementation of these algorithms is available , and provides additional features such as conditional pluralization ( depending on a numerical parameter ) , setting of default number values , and interpolation of the various subroutines into strings .

Appendix A - Plural categories
THE Internet has become a great place to track down friends -- or friends of friends -- for advice or for a date .
Now you can ask them for money , too .
Prosper.com , a start - up company based in San Francisco , started operations last week , offering a mixed brew of eBay , Friendster and the local bank .
Prosper 's users lend money to and borrow money from other people on the site at what the company says are better interest rates than those available through traditional financial institutions and without some of the risk that comes from typical person - to - person loans .
" We looked at eBay and said , ' Why ca n't we do this for money ? ' " said Chris Larsen , Prosper 's chief executive .
Mr. Larsen , who founded and led E - Loan , an online lender that was bought last year for $ 300 million by Popular Inc. , says Prosper could save borrowers and lenders money because it was a leaner operation than traditional financial institutions .
He noted that consumers make , at most , about 4 percent on their savings accounts , which banks then lend to credit card customers at 14 percent or more .
Hybrid poplars
A tree that can reach 90 feet in six years and be grown as a row crop on fallow farmland could represent a major replacement for fossil fuels .
Purdue University researchers are using genetic tools in an effort to design trees that readily and inexpensively can yield the substances needed to produce alternative transportation fuel .
The scientists are focused on a compound in cell walls called lignin that contributes to plants ' structural strength , but which hinders extraction of cellulose .
Cellulose is the sugar - containing component needed to make the alternative fuel ethanol .
The Department of Energy 's Office of Biological and Environmental Research is funding a $ 1.4 million , three - year study by Purdue faculty members Clint Chapple , Richard Meilan and Michael Ladisch to determine ways to alter lignin and test whether the genetic changes affect the quality of plants used to produce biofuels .
A hybrid poplar tree is the basis for the research that is part of the DOE 's goal to replace 30 percent of the fossil fuel used annually in the United States for transportation with biofuels by 2030 .
In 2005 ethanol accounted for only 4 billion gallons of the 140 billion gallons of U.S. transportation fuel used — less than 3 percent .
About 13 percent of the nation 's corn crop was used for that production .
Purdue scientists and experts at the U.S. departments of Agriculture and Energy say corn can only be part of the solution to the problem of replacing fossil fuel .
" If Indiana wants to support only corn - based ethanol production , we would have to import corn , " said Chapple , a biochemist .
" What we need is a whole set of plants that are well - adapted to particular growing regions and have high levels of productivity for use in biofuel production . "
Chapple and Meilan want to genetically modify the hybrid poplar so that lignin will not impede the release of cellulose for degradation into fermentable sugars , which then can be converted to ethanol .
The changed lignin also may be useable either in fuel or other products , they said .
Currently about 25 percent of the material in plants is the complex molecule lignin , which in its present form could be burned to supply energy for ethanol production , but cannot be transformed into the alternative fuel .
Altering lignin's composition or minimizing the amount present in a cell wall could improve access of enzymes .
With easier access , enzymes would be able to more efficiently convert cellulose to sugars .
Current treatments used for extracting lignin from woody products for pulp and paper production are harsh and pollute the environment , said Meilan , a Purdue Department of Forestry and Natural Resources molecular tree physiologist .
To advance production of non-fossil fuels , Chapple and Meilan are using genetic tools to modify the poplar and then study how the alterations changed the plants ' cell walls .
Meilan also is attempting to find ways to produce trees that are reproductively sterile so they are unable to transfer introduced traits to wild trees .
When Chapple and Meilan are satisfied with the results , they will give wood samples to Ladisch , a distinguished professor of agricultural and biological engineering , so he can determine if the changes have created trees suitable for high - yield ethanol production .
Using hybrid poplar and its relatives as the basis for biofuels has a number of advantages for the environment , farmers and the economy , they said .
" Poplar is a low - maintenance crop ; plant it and wait seven years to harvest it , " Meilan said .
" You 're not applying pesticides every year ; you 're not trampling all over the site every year and compacting the soil .
You 're allowing nutrients to recycle every year when the leaves fall and degrade .
In addition , you are more likely to have greater wildlife diversity in poplar plantings than in agricultural fields . "
Experts are proposing planting the trees in rows just like any field crop .
The basis of these tree plantations will be tens of millions of acres that the DOE and USDA have inventoried as being unused or fallow — previously used farmland that is standing empty because farmers are paid not to grow anything .
" We need a bioenergy crop that can grow many places year - round , ” Meilan said .
" The genus Populus includes about 30 species that grow across a wide climatic range from the subtropics in Florida to sub-alpine areas in Alaska , northern Canada and Europe . "
Corn can be grown only in a few areas of the world and only during a relatively short growing season .
Besides needing potential fuel - source crops that can be grown year - round and in many geographical locations , experts also want to increase the per acre tonnage yield of crops and the gallons of ethanol per ton .
Researchers believe that using the hybrid poplar in its present form could produce about 70 gallons of fuel per ton of wood .
Approximately 10 tons of poplar could be grown per acre annually , representing 700 gallons of ethanol .
Corn currently produces about 4.5 tons per acre per year with a yield of about 400 gallons of ethanol .
Changing the lignin composition could increase the annual yield to 1,000 gallons of ethanol per acre , according to experts .
Planted on 110 million acres of unused farmland , this could replace 80 percent of the transportation fossil fuel consumed in the United States each year .
" We do n't want to compromise the structural integrity of the plant , " Meilan said .
" We just want to alter the lignin composition to make it easier to liberate the cellulose for conversion to simple sugars that the yeast can gobble up and turn into ethanol . "

Daily consumption of red meat might may significantly increase a woman ’s risk of certain breast cancers , even before she reaches menopause , according to a new study .
Women who ate large amounts of red meat were more than twice as likely to suffer hormone - related breast cancer , researchers found .
Chemicals added during meat processing or growth hormones given to cattle may be to blame , they speculate .
Eunyoung Cho of the Harvard Medical School in Boston , Massachusetts , US , and colleagues followed more than 90,000 women aged 26 to 46 from 1991 to 2003 as part of a large , ongoing nurses ’ health study .
Every four years , participants were asked about their diet and medical history , including whether or not they had experienced breast cancer and what type .
Over the course of the study , more than 1000 women developed breast cancer .
Of those , 512 were cancers that were sensitive to the hormones oestrogen and progesterone .
Another 167 were hormone - insensitive cancers , and the remaining 342 cancers were of mixed or unknown status .

Middle - aged women
Women in the study who ate more than 1.5 servings of red meat per day had nearly double the risk of developing hormone - sensitive breast cancer as those who ate three or fewer servings per week , the team found .
A single serving equates to a quarter - pound hamburger , for example , or 100 grams of red meat .
The hormones or hormone - like compounds in red meat may promote the growth of hormone - sensitive breast cancer by attaching to specific hormone receptors on the tumours , Cho suggests .
She notes that hormone sensitive cancers are increasingly common in the US – particularly among middle - aged women – while the rate of hormone insensitive cancers has remained relatively stable .
The chances that women between the ages of 40 and 49 years would develop oestrogen - sensitive breast cancer in 1992 was 65 in 100,000 , but it increased to 75 in 100,000 by 1998 .
This might be because women are consuming more foods that contain added hormones or hormone - like compounds than they used to in previous decades , Cho says .
Small risk
While few studies have looked at the link between red meat intake and breast cancer in young women , earlier studies have found a possible link in older women .
And red meat consumption has been suggested as a cause of other tumour types , such as bowel cancer .
Cho adds that since red meat also contains saturated fat , “ it ’s prudent for women to reduce their red meat intake for health purposes ” .
But other experts say that women should not feel greatly alarmed by the new findings .
“ The overall risk of pre-menopausal breast cancer is low when compared to getting the disease after the menopause .
So even at the highest rates of meat consumption , this is overall still a relatively small increase , ” says Henry Scowcroft at Cancer Research UK .

With Salam Talib
Students at Iraq ’s universities were to start the new school year this week  no small task given the daily barrage of violence that surrounds them .
“ Our ministry is the Ministry of Higher Education , so we do n’t have a military and we can’t make one , ” ministry spokesman Basil al - Khatib explained .
He said the Ministry of Higher Education says the government is doing what it can to make school safe for students and faculty members .
“ Our job is education , ” he said .
“ All that we have are some campus guards .
Until now , [ they ] have left the campuses safe , but outside the campus we can do nothing .
Outside the campus , the students and the teachers can be killed while they are on their way home or even in their houses , and we can not do anything about it . ”
According to the ministry , at least 180 professors have been killed since February , when a mosque bombing in Samarra sent sectarian violence skyrocketing around the country .
“ There are even more on the ground .
We ca n’t really deny that , ” conceded Basim al - Abdili , professor of sociology at Baghdad University .
“ But in most cases , teachers have been killed outside the university .
Sometimes , they get killed while they are shopping . ”
It ’s difficult to tell who is killing Iraq ’s academics .
Nabil al - Tikriti , an assistant professor of history at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia , said it ’s difficult to tell , but the killings are carried out in a different way from much of the violence .
“ They ’re very professional assassinations , ” he said .
“ ‘ Professional ’ meaning that they ’re only going after the person they ’re going to get .
So they ’re not dying in car bombs or sectarian killings where a checkpoint is being set up and everyone is being killed that goes through that checkpoint that ’s from the wrong sectarian background .
They ’re not getting killed in those random ways .
There are assassins that go up to them and kill them and only them . ”
The killing of so many professors has compelled those still alive to flee the country .
The Ministry of Higher Education estimates at least 3,250 have fled since February .
Abdili : “ The biggest problem is to avoid a brain drain , and the only way to fight that is to make a safe environment where professors can stay .
So we suggested that we should have the professors living on campus , or at least within a block of the campus . ”
Students , too , need solutions to stay safe .
Abdili says Iraq ’s universities are now allowing students to transfer colleges on the basis of their ethnic group  so they can attend a university in a neighborhood whose residents have the same ethnic background .
“ We have a strategy for the students , ” he said .
“ The students that have been accepted in other universities where there is sectarian violence  where the local population is from a different group than their own  we will transfer them to a university which is safer than their own , even to the University of Baghdad , which is the most prestigious in the country .
They ’ll be in the exchange program , so they wo n’t be registered as students at that university .
They ’ll just study there . ”
Analysts alternately blame militia organizations , Ba’athists , anti-Ba’athists , the Iranian secret service , the Israeli Mossad , and the U.S. military for the violence .
Tikriti says Americans should push their government for an investigation .
“ Not a single one of these cases has been solved , ” he said .
“ Is there a plot somewhere , and if so why , and if so can anything be done ?
This kind of dirty war is contributing to a breakdown of Iraqi society , and that in turn is contributing to the disaster that is Iraq that is also a disaster for Americans as well . ”
There was fierce fighting in the Khiam area for six hours
According to diplomats familiar with the UN 's initial report into the incident , the post in the town of Khiam was hit by precision - guided munition , says the BBC's Paul Adams in Jerusalem .
The report says there was fierce fighting in the area for about six hours before the post was hit , during which time UN personnel contacted the Israel military 10 times , urging them to stop firing .
Our correspondent says the UN claims that after each call , it was assured the firing would stop .
Six warning calls
A preliminary UN report said 17 bombardments landed within one kilometre of the post , and 12 artillery rounds hit within 150 metres of the structure - four of them being direct hits .
After this , the post was hit by a precision - guided weapon from an Israeli aircraft .
The Irish foreign ministry said one of its officers in the UN's Unifil peacekeeping force in south Lebanon , placed six warning calls to the Israel Defence Forces ( IDF ) prior to the attack .
" On six separate occasions he was in contact with the Israelis to warn them that their bombardment was endangering the lives of UN staff in South Lebanon , " Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed foreign office spokesman as saying .
" He warned : ' You have to address this problem or lives may be lost ' , " the spokesman said .
The Associated Press news agency named the officer as Lt Col John Molloy .
The bomb which killed the unarmed peacekeepers - Canadian , Austrian , Finnish and Chinese soldiers - hit the building and shelter of the observation post , near the eastern end of the Lebanese - Israeli border , UN spokesman Milos Struger said .
Israel has launched an investigation .
The UN post was on high ground , in an area once occupied by Israel .
" The problem is that instead of asking us or Diebold , Bruce Funk allowed a third party to put the warranty in jeopardy , " Demma said in a telephone interview from Emery County .
" If I sound frustrated , it 's because I am frustrated .
We do n't know what they did to the machines .
If Bruce would have just asked , we could have saved this forty grand . "
My friend DVDTracker , sent me an IM on AR15.com and asked , “ OP , I wonder how difficult it is to shoot a lock off ?
I ’ve seen it done on TV and in movies , but wonder if it is as easy as they show it to be .
How about if I send you some funds to buy some locks .
Will you shoot them and report back ? ”
The only answer was , “ Sure !
Why not ? ”
So , with funds supplied by LifeLiberty Etc , I set up an experiment .
The question is : How hard is it to shoot a lock off ?
The locks were “ MintCraft , 2 inch Laminated Padlocks ” , a knock - off of Master type locks .
They were heavy - duty and turned out to be tough .
We shot from a distance of about 15 feet , mostly to be far enough away in case of lead splattering .
Guys on the movies sometimes place the muzzle against the lock , but I ’m not that crazy .
First , we shot a lock with 9 mm ball .
You can see that it flattened out and dented the lock .
It froze - up the lock and it could not be unlocked .
But it held tight .
I decided to shoot the same lock with a 9 mm JHP .
As you can see , it dented the lock , but bounced off .
Next , it was time for John Browning ’s finest , the .45 ACP .
The .45 ball flattened out against the lock , but the key would still open it .
Not much effect .
So , it was time for the .44 Magnum , “ The most powerful handgun in the world and capable of blowing your head clean off ! ” , at least according to Dirty Harry .
I used a 240 grain JHP .
I ’ll admit to a bad shot that only hit the bottom of the lock , but the second one centered it just fine .
You can see where one of the pins on the lock was blown upwards .
The lock was frozen shut .
But the lock held like a rock .
Well , it was time for the rifles .
Now , just to get a little technical , rifles , when shot at close range , have what is called “ sight - offset ” , which means they will shoot low due to the sights being higher than the bore .
I tested one shot before taking the shot at the lock .
The sight offset for an AR is about 2 1/2 inches .
It was now time to shoot the lock , and aim 2 1/ 2 inches higher than the desired impact .
First , an AR shooting XM193 Ball .
The 5.56 went through the lock like a hot knife through butter .
This is the exit on the back of the lock .
The lock was frozen , but still held .
We also tried a round of Remington .223 Soft Point , with the exact same results .
Next , we shot the FAL , with Australian M1A2 Ball .
I am holding the new lock on the right just to compare .
The .308 blew the bottom half of the lock off .
But , once again , the lock held and did not come off , even when pulled .
I also loaded up a round with a pulled .30 AP bullet and got the same results .
We were not able to get a “ Breeching round ” for a shotgun , but my friend Blain had sent me a sample 12 gauge Brennke slug to test and this seemed like a good time to use it .
This is the result .
Lessons learned :
“ How hard is it to shoot off a lock ? ” Answer : Very hard .
Pistols wo n’t shoot a lock off or even penetrate the lock .
Pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles .
Enough said .
I now understand why our troops are often seen carrying “ breeching shotguns ” on their backs and a rifle in their hands .
Shotguns will blow a lock off .
Rifles will blow holes through a lock , but will not reliably shoot one off .
The rifles went through the locks with ease .
It is obvious that you could “ knaw ” off the lock , little by little with a rifle , but a shotgun does it with one shot .
Ai n’t retirement great !

Addendum to The Locks O’ Truth :
I am often asked the question : “ Do n’t you know that the way you shot the locks is not the “ best ” way to break a lock ? ”
Answer :
Of course I do .
I was not trying to determine the “ best ” way to break a lock .
To do that , the shooter should either shoot down onto the top of the lock body , or shoot the hasp itself .
What I was doing was testing the way locks are often shot in movies and TV shows to see if that would actually break or open the lock .
It so happens , that a few weeks ago I was watching the movie “ Ronin ” ( a good one , BTW ) , and the bad guy was running down an alley trying to escape .
He came to a locked gate .
He pulled his 9 mm pistol and shot the lock right in the body , just like I did .
The lock exploded and he made his escape .
I had to laugh .
Julie Aigner - Clark StoryMost great ideas are born from a need .
The Baby Einstein Company LLC based in Littleton , Colorado , came from Julie Aigner - Clark ’s need for a learning tool for her infant daughter .
In 1995 , this former teacher and new mom read the latest research regarding babies ’ capacity to learn .
Finding nothing in stores that used the research and that was developmentally appropriate , educational and fun , Aigner - Clark ( pictured with daughters Sierra , 3 , and Aspen , 6 ) decided to create something herself .
Her first video , Baby Einstein , featured intriguing pictures and mothers speaking different languages .
Says Aigner - Clark , “ I wanted something that was not only entertaining but stimulating and engaging that would give [ my daughter ] exposure to things that were lovely .
” As a mom , she knew her product was good , but “ nobody was returning my calls , ” she says .
“ I knew if I could get it into the hands of a mom or an executive who had a baby , [ that ] would sell it .
” Two years later , with no responses to her many queries , Aigner - Clark finally hit pay dirt :
She went to the American International Toy Fair in New York City determined to get her product into the hands of a buyer from The Right Start , a high - end baby retailer .
She searched the huge show for two days without luck .
When she finally found the buyers , she says , “ I ran up to them [ and said , ] ‘ You ’re going to love this video !
You have to watch it !
It ’s perfect for your store ! ’ ” Aigner - Clark ’s instincts were right on : Baby Einstein soon became the store ’s fastest - moving product .
Here initial investment - $ 5000
She ’s followed up with more books and videos — Baby Bach , Baby Mozart , Baby Shakespeare and Baby Van Gogh .
She ’s also developed Baby Santa ’s Music Box .
Still , even with 1999 sales of more than $ 4 million , $ 10 million in 2000 and $ 25 million in 2001 , Aigner - Clark ’s best rewards are being able to organize her schedule around her daughters and reading the stirring letters she gets from Baby Einstein viewers .
How does she define success ?
“ That I ’ve made these kids — who are so special — happy . . . that I ’ve made them smile . ” Using the philosophy that the infant brain thrives in a child who is positively stimulated emotionally , physically and intellectually , Aigner - Clark incorporated puppetry with sounds , foreign languages , poetry and classical music .
Baby Einstein 's productions emphasize " real - world " images over computer graphics or animation to more accurately reflect the world that babies see .
Despite Baby Einstein 's phenomenal reception , the company has never employed more than seven people .
Clark ( Julie ’s husband ) also notes Baby Einstein never took out a loan or equity capital .
In fact , Baby Einstein operated from Aigner - Clark 's home until 2001 .
The secret to Baby Einstein 's success , Clark said , has been " a good concept and a brilliant branding strategy . " " [ Julie ] did a marvelous job of catching a trend and building it , " Clark said .
That ’s when the business got Disney ’s attention .
In 2002 the couple sold the company for an estimated $ 25 million dollars .
With Disney , the characters that Aigner - Clark created would not only get a wider audience , but better production values .
As for Julie Aigner - Clark , she ’s looking for another big idea .

Founder ’s Syndrome
The simplest way to do something , of course , is to do it yourself .
But there ’s lots of stuff to be done and not enough you to do it .
You can get around this a little bit by finding friends who are interested in doing some of it themselves , but at some point you ’re going to have to start “ delegating ” , or getting somebody else to do it .
Now you ’re moving up in the world .
If you ’re a decent manager , instead of running one project , you can run five or ten .
Instead of simply directing your own labor , you can direct whole groups of people .
Of course , it ’ll still be people doing what you wanted , but — funny thing — people are smart enough that they ’ll begin to get the gist of things on their own and , if you do it right , your delegation will become an organization .
You can disappear for a week and things will keep on marching .
But make no mistake , even those organizations are still following the will of their erstwhile founder .
Even as they get big , they betray facets of the founder ’s personality .
The most obvious is in who is respected .
My friend Emmett Shear has a theory that in each company only one class of people can be in charge and it ’s going to be the class of people the founders are in .
At Apple , for example , the UI designers are in charge , because Jobs obsesses over UI design .
At Google , it ’s the programmers , because Larry and Sergey used to code .
Even though the founders are n’t directly involved in every project , their surrogates still win the day .
Now the problem comes when the organization wants to grow beyond its founder .
This is most common on non-profits , where they even have a name for it : founder ’s syndrome .
See , once you have all these people carrying out your bidding , it ’s pretty difficult to want to give that up .
Maybe you can have them do more projects , maybe you can give them more flexibility in what they choose , but I ca n’t think of a single story where the guy in charge voluntarily gave up his power .
And that has a severe cost ( which I ’ve come to calling the “ power premium ” ) because giving up your power is often the right thing to do .
In non-profits , for example , your organization is probably made up of a bunch of independent - minded young people with a strong belief in democracy .
These people are n’t too happy being told what to do all the time , especially when the instructions are pretty obviously not the best thing for the non -profit ’s mission .
So they rebel against the founder , and the founder tries to hold on to power , and things get very messy .
( I do n’t know how things usually turn out in this situation .
Maybe you fight until the founder dies ? )
Less well noticed is that the same mistake is made by for - profit corporations as well , it ’s just less obvious because the founder is the fellow holding all the cash , so you fight about it at your peril .
But companies regularly do stupid things , even when if you asked all the people in the company about it they would have told you they were stupid .
But in a capitalist economy , the founder has to maintain control .
But the power premium has a even more serious cost .
While many people seem to be able to make the leap from doing something themselves to building an organization to do it , nobody seems to have been very good at taking the next step : going from an organization to a meta- organization , an organization that hires other organizations to do its work , rather than hiring people directly .
Why ?
Partly because few people get to be in charge of something the size of Google , where they need to take that next step to grow , and perhaps the trait of thinking that big is rare .
But I think part of it is simply because the people at the top ca n’t give up their power .
Engaging organizations means you ’re no longer in charge of what people do or how they do it ; the organizations have to be in charge of that .
And that means you ’re no longer a delegator , but more of a moderator .
It ’s founder ’s syndrome at the largest scale .

Stars die when they have exhausted the fuel in their centres and until now it has been believed , that stars could only die in two ways -- one way for the smaller and medium size stars and one way for the very massive stars .
Our sun is a middle size star .
When stars that are smaller than our sun or up to 8 times more massive than the sun die , they expel the outer layers and leave behind a white dwarf in the centre
Stars with a mass more than 8 times that of our sun die violently in energetic supernova explosions expelling several solar masses of chemically enriched material into the interstellar medium leaving behind either neutron stars or black holes in the centre .
In this way the interstellar medium becomes more and more enriched in elements such as Oxygen and Carbon , that are essential for life .
The new discovery
In May and June of this year , two long - duration Gamma - ray bursts ( GRBs ) were detected by the NASA satellite Swift .
GRBs are power - full bursts of gamma- rays coming from far away .
There has been a tremendous progress in the study of this during the last 10 years , and it has been found that the long - duration GRBs ( these have duration longer than 2 seconds ) are caused by the deaths of massive stars .
A team of astrophysics from Dark Cosmology Centre ( DARK ) at the Niels Bohr Institute , University of Copenhagen monitored the two bursts intensively during June , July , August and September 2006 .
The remarkable conclusion from this monitoring was that there were no supernovae associated with these two Gamma - ray bursts .
Conclusion of this research
There are two possible conclusions : 1 ) that these GRBs were not caused by massive stars , or 2 ) that they were caused by massive stars that did not cause associated supernova explosions .
Focusing on the May burst , where the team have the strongest evidence , the team has obtained deep images in very good observing conditions and spectroscopy as well .
This allowed the team to localise exactly where in the host galaxy the burst occurred .
The host galaxy turns out to be a small spiral galaxy , and the burst occurred in a compact star - forming region in one of the spiral arms of the galaxy .
This is strong evidence that the star(s ) that made the GRB were massive , as massive stars due to their short lifetimes ( few million years ) are only found in star - forming regions .
Some massive stars simply collapse
The implications of this discovery are therefore this :
Where as we up till know thought that massive stars died in supernova explosions expelling large materials of enriched material into the interstellar medium , it seems that this is not always the case .
The theoretical idea is that some massive stars simply collapse under the formation of a black hole ( either directly as water running out of the sink , or in an indirect way where some material gets expelled , but then " falls " back and forms a black hole ) .
Such stars would return very little chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium .
It is difficult to estimate what fraction of massive stars that die in this way , but it is probably small .

BitTyrant is designed to make efficient use of your scarce upload bandwidth , rewarding those users whose upload allocations are fair and only allocating excess capacity to other users .
Familiar  BitTyrant is based on modifications to Azureus 2.5 , currently the most popular BitTorrent client .
All of our changes are under the hood .
You ’ll find the GUI identical to Azureus , with optional additions to display statistics relevant to BitTyrant ’s operation .
For details about these claims , check out the information below .
FAQ
Q : Is n't BitTyrant just another leeching client ?
No .
BitTyrant does not change the amount of data uploaded , just which peers receive that data .
Specifically , peers which upload more to you get more of your bandwidth .
When all peers use the BitTyrant client as released , performance improves for the entire swarm .
The details of this are explained further below .
In our paper , we consider situations in which peers use clients which attempt to both maximize performance and conserve upload contribution , but BitTyrant , as released , attempts only to maximize performance .
Q : How is BitTyrant different from existing BitTorrent clients ?
BitTyrant differs from existing clients in its selection of which peers to unchoke and send rates to unchoked peers .
Suppose your upload capacity is 50 KBps .
If you ’ve unchoked 5 peers , existing clients will send each peer 10 KBps , independent of the rate each is sending to you .
In contrast , BitTyrant will rank all peers by their receive / sent ratios , preferentially unchoking those peers with high ratios .
For example , a peer sending data to you at 20 KBps and receiving data from you at 10 KBps will have a ratio of 2 , and would be unchoked before unchoking someone uploading at 10 KBps ( ratio 1 ) .
Further , BitTyrant dynamically adjusts its send rate , giving more data to peers that can and do upload quickly and reducing send rates to others .
Q : Will BitTyrant work for cable / DSL users ?
Yes .
Although the evaluation in our paper focuses on users with slightly higher upload capacity than is typically available from US cable / DSL providers today , BitTyrant ’s intelligent unchoking and rate selection still improves performance for users with less capacity .
All users , regardless of capacity , benefit from using BitTyrant .
Q : Wo n’t BitTyrant hurt overall BitTorrent performance if everyone uses it ?
This is a subtle question and is treated most thoroughly in the paper .
The short answer is : maybe .
A big difference between BitTyrant and existing BitTorrent clients is that BitTyrant can detect when additional upload contribution is unlikely to improve performance .
If a client were truly selfish , it might opt to withhold excess capacity , reducing performance for other users that would have received it .
However , our current BitTyrant implementation always contributes excess capacity , even when it might not improve performance .
Our goal is to improve performance , not minimize upload contribution .

Warning : details of V for Vendetta are revealed below .
Yet if the whole process happens in an “ orderly fashion ” these excesses can be avoided .
Men whose civilian valour finds its supreme expression in pulling a lever behind a protective curtain will not have the courage to rebel , and concentration camps ( actually a “ healthy sign ” because they denote resistance ) will not exist .
~ Erik von Kuehnelt - Leddihn , Liberty or Equality
I finally got around to seeing one of this spring ’s great movies , V for Vendetta , after having read the graphic novel .
I would recommend this for anyone skeptical of government , regardless of whether one ’s position is anarchist or not .
The modern omnipotent , omnipresent , and omniscient government and its proponents would not like V for Vendetta , but that ’s a very good reason to go and see it .
I had been warned about considerable differences between the graphic novel and the movie , but the similarities were greater than these warnings had given me an expectation of .
In the graphic novel the parliamentary estate is what is first blown up .
In the novel it is clearly stated that the parliamentary estate has long since been abandoned , and Parliament ’s power is long gone .
The loss of parliamentary power and whether the estate had been abandoned in the movie was not so clear to me .
Moreover , V ’s funeral at the end , when he is sent with a tube train under Downing Street in the novel , turns into a funeral under the Palace of Westminster in the movie .
Perhaps this suggests that Parliament is the problem , not the executive office .
We see the Palace of Westminster blow up .
St. Stephen ’s Tower — housing the bell by the name of Big Ben — is no longer to be a landmark .
It is the “ Mother of Parliaments ” that is blasted off the face of the Earth .
It is the claimant to being mother of parliamentary democracy all over the world that is being demolished .
This is the very Parliament , with its Glorious Revolution in 1688 , that partly served as model for the American Republic , which eventually turned into a not so pretty democracy .
It is the foremost symbol of democracy in the world that is being demolished .
The end of movie hence has great positive symbolism .
However , I would not second any blowing up of the Houses of Parliament .
I know people who have had and do have their work in that estate .
And this illustrates a significant part of the problem .
It is not “ they ” and “ we . ”
It is not “ they ” who rule “ us . ”
It is all “ we . ”
There is basically no distinction between the rulers and the ruled .
The rulers and the ruled are basically mixed in a mush .
As the movie starts with the execution of Guido Fawkes , and V always walks around in the novel and the movie with a Fawkes mask , we should look into the question of whether the failed Gunpowder Plot is relevant today .
Americans generally celebrate the Boston Tea Party , referred to in the movie , and the following American War of Independence .
These are obviously considered to be legitimate acts .
However , to overthrow the current American federal government is generally not considered legitimate , nor is overthrowing the British government of our time .
People have a tendency to think that in pre-democratic times it must have been in order to overthrow governments , because there was no channel for peacefully replacing the government .
However , in 1605 — the year of the failed Gunpowder Plot — Parliament in England did not meet regularly .
Parliament was far from being the far - reaching body it is today .
Government was far from being of the reach and size it is today .
Yet , people tend to have sympathy for those who revolted in pre-democratic times , but not for those who revolt in democratic times .
Nowadays , we are supposed to replace governments with our votes .
That tiny part that the individual has in the electorate is supposed to protect him .
Dare he who even suggests that this protection is at best little more than no protection at all .
The Gunpowder Plot took place in the midst of the heat between Catholicism and Protestantism .
A lot of the princes of Europe had taken Protestantism to their hearts .
There is little doubt that this was done to a large extent to make the Church subject to the State .
The princes wanted to be their own “ popes . ”
Regardless of which confession one considers to be right , such abuse must be considered to be a grave misfortune .
The abuse of faith in supporting oppression and the extension of the reach and size of government is not only clearly expressed in the movie .
It also haunts us in real life to this day .
Ibsen ’s Brand is considered to be an attack on the Norwegian State Church of the time .
Christopher Bruun met with Ibsen before Brand was published .
Bruun is said to be a model of the character Brand .
He was openly a critic of the State - Church relationship .
Bruun was a priest in the Church of Norway in 1905 .
When Bruun refused to take part in the Church being used as support of the parliamentary usurpation of 1905 , the police shut him off .
On Norway ’s Constitution Day , May 17 , church services are held .
Support of the growth in parliamentary power can be heard in priests ’ speeches in churches on this day .
Last year a priest gave a speech where the “ improvements ” of the Constitution since its birth in 1814 were praised .
This year a priest gave a speech where he talked about justice or equity .
And this concept of justice or equity was about those involved making decisions , and so this concept was what won through with the Constitution , parliamentarism , and the events of the union dissolution of 1905 .
The graphic novel is said to be an attack on the Thatcher regime , but it certainly also mentions the following Labour Government ’s catastrophic economic policies .
It has been claimed that the anti-gay part of the movie ’s Sutler regime is concerned with the concept of not letting gays have their “ marriages . ”
Perhaps so .
What is certain , however , is that the graphic novel also portrays an anti-gay regime , and hardly anyone had heard of gay “ marriages ” at the time the novel was written .
As for the ban on the Koran , from how things are looking right now it seems more likely that the Bible will be the banned — or at least the most frowned upon — book of the future .
Adam Sutler is the “ conservative ” High Chancellor of the movie .
Someone suggested that you could not get closer to a name like “ Adolf Hitler . ”
It seems he was appointed after an election .
It is made clear in the movie that he was appointed .
In the graphic novel the current regime has taken over after a vacuum period of no government .
Both the novel and the movie have references to the monarchy , such as a painting of the Queen , “ Her Majesty ’s Government , ” “ the United Kingdom . ”
However , it is not clear whether the monarchy is still there .
What is striking , though , given that the monarchy is intact , is that Adam Sutler is not stopped by the Sovereign .
If the monarch is not to intervene to prevent such a regime , one can certainly wonder what the point would be with a monarchy .
Whenever there is oppression , we tend to jump to the conclusion that lack of democracy is the problem .
Americans often look at foreign lack of liberty and say “ it can not happen here . ”
Britons act in a similar way .
After all , Great Britain has a long tradition with a stable democracy , which has evolved steadily since the days of the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution .
Some even draw the story back to 1215 and the Magna Charta , demonstrating confusion of thought as to the difference between asserting one ’s rights facing the King and transferring power from a monarch to a representative assembly .
For a lot of Britons the problem with the European Union is that it is unaccountable to British voters .
Restore power to Westminster , and all will be well , the theory goes .
You can often hear from British EU skeptics that the most important right is the right to vote .
If only the people have their right to vote and there is an opposition that can debate issues , there will be near to paradise on Earth .
Of course , democracy contributes in preventing the unpopular .
Some abuses may be avoided through being unpopular , but it is often far from enough .
The tendencies in democracies to allow more and more to be handled by the government due to democratic legitimacy through elections and referenda is overlooked or underrated at our peril .
People who watch V for Vendetta or read the novel could easily conclude that here democracy is gone , and if democracy were not gone , or if it returned , the oppressive regime would also be gone .
I would n’t be too sure about that .
I would n’t be too sure .
Democratic legitimacy does perhaps reduce government ’s fear of their people to such an extent that V’s motto becomes extra relevant : People should not be afraid of their governments .
Governments should be afraid of their people .
Most people react to the regime in the movie V for Vendetta .
Installing such a regime tomorrow would not work well , fortunately .
Most people 200 years ago would be frightened by today ’s modern democracies .
They would never accept being subject to such regimes .
This illustrates the validity of what Edmund Burke said :
The true danger is when liberty is nibbled away , for expedience , and by parts .
It is more likely that society will continue to evolve bit by bit with less liberty .
We already have elements found in V for Vendetta .
No concentration camps will be needed .
In a sense it is frightening that concentration camps are not needed to support the omnipotent and omnipresent governments of today .

Plug - In Partners , the national PHEV support campaign led by utilities , including local governments , companies and individuals , launched with a splash a year ago .
On its first anniversary , Plug - In Partners ’ Congressional and press briefing in Washington , co-sponsored by the Environmental and Energy Study Institute ( EESI ) , served as the platform for a new way of thinking about electrifying transportation .
Think you ’ve heard all there is about the benefits of plug - in hybrids ?
Sure , substituting “ cleaner / cheaper / domestic ” electricity for gasoline that has none of those characteristics is good enough reason to evolve cars .
It turns out there ’s much more .
You ’ll find it in four slides by Jon Wellinghoff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , about aspects of what ’s often described as “ Vehicle - to - Grid ” ( V2G ) .
Much becomes possible when millions of PHEVs and electric vehicles , parked more than 20 hours a day , are available as distributed energy storage for the electric power grid .
A quick description and old links are found at the CalCars.org FAQ .
CalCars has soft - pedalled the potential of all the variants of V2G .
It ’s seemed too futuristic to talk about without sounding like a snake - oil salesman .
And it ’s not one thing : it ’s about perhaps a dozen different services or relationships .
But experts are starting to get excited about these opportunities .
Remember when we used “ personal ” computers ?
Was n’t it a surprise when the home and business computers of the ’ 80s in the mid ’90s evolved into a global network that has profoundly changed the world ?
V2G and variants like V2H ( emergency home backup ) could some day overshadow the initial PHEV benefits on which we now focus .
It ’s still far away .
But that does n’t mean it should n’t motivate our decisions now — both to begin real - world demonstration programs and to provide more reasons for car - makers to move rapidly from “ interest ” in PHEVs to demonstration fleets .
In October we highlighted two reports about V2G and its reverse , G2V , showing parked PHEVs ’ potential to store wind power in Sacramento and to offer Bay Area Rapid Transit commuters free parking and charging .
And this month the Pacific National Lab ’s eye- opening report dispelled capacity concerns by showing that if overnight all our cars became PHEVs , we could fuel 84 % of them off - peak on today ’s grid without adding more generators .
Now a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission weighs in .
Wikipedia explains FERC as “ the United States federal agency with jurisdiction over interstate electricity sales , wholesale electric rates , hydroelectric licensing , natural gas pricing , and oil pipeline rates .
FERC also reviews and authorizes liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) terminals , interstate natural gas pipelines and non-federal hydropower projects . ” FERC has clout .
When Jon Wellinghoff , a former Nevada utility lawyer who is one of five FERC Commissioners , looks at the future potential for PHEVs , everyone starts to take notice .
Wellinghoff ’s opening graphic of a green dollar sign on a road is powerful .
Even more compelling is what he calls PHEVs : “ The Cash - Back Plug - In Car . ”
He shows annual fuel costs : $ 1,200 for a conventional car , $ 720 for a hybrid , $ 495 for a PHEV .
Next come the important new numbers .
After paying for fuel , CAR OWNERS GET $ 425 NET ANNUAL PAYMENTS for a Cash - Back Plug - In Car that provides “ spinning reserves ” to utilities ( relieving them of having to maintain plants ready to kick in for unexpected demand ) .
And CAR OWNERS NET $ 2,790 by providing both spinning reserves and “ regulation services ” ( helping utilities maintain the system voltage within narrow ranges .
( Not calculated are revenues for providing peak power ! )
Wellinghoff also projects how rapidly a PHEV could pay back its additional costs .
Calculations are based on additional costs of $ 19,000 for a PHEV or $ 20,000 cost for a V2G - capable PHEV — probably several times higher than mass - production costs .
But even saddled by such conservative assumptions , the $ 2,790 number gives a five - year payback ( see slide two for Wellinghoff ’s sources ) .
FINE PRINT : Lest we sound overly enthusiastic , some of these applications may require relatively small fleets .
For instance , regulation services for the entire State of California might require only 20,000 cars .
Some may be most appropriate at big parking lots with heavy - duty electrical connections .
Some , like peak power , may affect battery life because they deeply discharge batteries , while others , like spinning reserves , may take minimally stress the batteries ( spinning reserves ) .
None have yet been tested in real - world applications .
All present fertile immediate opportunities for groups like the US Department of Energy , the California Energy Commission and power companies to begin demonstration projects .
And with state and federal government , utilities and industry all now saying , “ wake up , ” we hope auto - makers start paying attention to interconnection opportunities — on top of the urgent greenhouse gas and independence benefits — already driving the electrification of transportation .
If they do n’t , someday the strategy of holding out for years for somewhat better batteries for PHEVs could go down in history as the least practical idea and the worst mistake the auto industry ever made .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday December 11 2006
Around this time of year , as the nights draw in and carol - singers don their hats and scarves , David Franks can count on receiving several enraged telephone calls and letters demanding to know why he has banned the people of Luton from celebrating Christmas .
The exact circumstances in which the Liberal Democrat leader of Luton borough council came to outlaw centuries of Christian tradition are unclear , not least to David Franks , but the central facts are always the same .
He and his fellow councillors have forcibly replaced Christmas with a " Harry Potter - themed " event called Luminos , to avoid offending minorities .
The Luton controversy recurs annually , but this year something in the tone of it has changed .
According to Christian leaders , vigorously backed by rightwing newspapers , Franks is no longer a fringe figure , but one crusader in a fully fledged national war against Christmas .
" The crazy gang who constitute the local council at Luton , " as the commentator AN Wilson called them in the Daily Mail last weekend , now have sympathisers across the country : at the council that erased all mention of Christmas from its Christmas cards , in the town that banned a generous millionaire from erecting his annual charity lights display , and in the Scottish hospital that refused to distribute a Christmas CD because it mentioned Jesus , to name just three .
Almost 75 % of British employers , according to a survey released this week , have banned Christmas decorations for fear of offending other faiths , and do n't realise they have a legal obligation to celebrate Diwali and Eid , whether they like it or not .
" The dead hand of political correctness is throttling the life out of the festive spirit , " thundered the Sun , announcing , like the Mail , a front - page campaign to defend Christmas .
( In Birmingham , the paper noted despairingly , " Christmas has been rebranded as Winterval . " )
Spurred on by the former Archbishop of Canterbury , George Carey , and by the Christian Muslim Forum , which has launched a national battle against the de-Christianising of Christmas , local leaders of three faiths wrote to Franks in Luton this week .
They warned darkly of the " anger within religious communities " that might erupt if he did not " refrain from renaming the Christmas festival using another ( non-religious ) name " .
All of which might be reasonable , were it not for a few awkward facts .
Luton does not have a festival called Luminos .
It does not use any alternative name for Christmas .
When it did , once , five years ago , hold something called Luminos one weekend in late November , the event did n't even replace the council 's own Christmas celebrations , let alone forbid anyone else from doing anything .
Similarly , Christmas is not called Winterval in Birmingham .
The Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children never banned a Christmas CD for mentioning Jesus .
And Chester council 's " un-Christian " Christmas card says - as cards have done for decades - " Season 's Greetings " .
" We 're not going to have a war , we 're going to have the appearance of a war , " says the cynical spin doctor in David Mamet 's screenplay for the 1997 movie Wag The Dog , about an imaginary conflict created to whip up support for an ailing president .
But he might equally have been talking about the 2006 war on Christmas - a war that tells us much about the growing politicisation and sense of entitlement among religious groups in Britain , but which turns out to have been almost entirely invented .
The Campaign Against Political Correctness , headquartered in Kennington in south London , bases its pitch to potential members on the argument that Britain is approaching boiling - point in the backlash against misguided attempts to avoid offending minorities .
( Its website features several heroes of the anti-PC movement , including Jim Davidson , " 22 - year - old rapper Plan B " , and Sir Cliff Richard , who says that " this whole PC thing bugs me like mad " , as well as Bruce Forsyth , who is praised for not bowing to pressure , from unspecified sources , to avoid using the word " nitty - gritty " on air . )
" The difference now is that people are angry about it , " says Philip Davies , the Conservative MP for Shipley , who is the campaign 's parliamentary spokesman and a loud critic of the War on Christmas .
" People used to laugh about it , but that 's changed ... they 're angry with white , middle - class liberal do - gooders with some kind of guilt complex and too much time on their hands . "
Judging by the Sun's Christmas defence campaign ( headline : " Kick 'em in the baubles ! " ) , they are particularly angry in the village of Sonning , near Reading , where " a court banned a millionaire from putting up his annual charity light display outside his home " .
As with so many aspects of the PC war on Christmas , trying to find the truth about Sonning 's frustrated philanthropist feels like chasing a shadow across a misty field : the factual basis for the controversy continually evades your grasp , then evaporates entirely .
The facts are as follows : in recent years , Vic Moszczynski's " annual charity light display " involved 20,000 lights , covering his home , and supplemented with large illuminated snowmen and amplifiers emitting Christmas songs into the street .
( The term " housebling " started appearing on the web in 2004 to describe just such gaudy displays . )
Wokingham district council eventually won an injunction against him , citing neighbour complaints , traffic snarl - ups , increased levels of crime , and a £ 7,400 bill for policing Moszczynski's neighbourhood .
Not that he has actually been banned from putting up a display : it was still there this year , a little more restrained but still prominent , and featuring a snow machine .
Indeed , so ineffectively was Moszczynski banned from celebrating the festive season that he was the guest of honour at a shopping precinct in Reading town centre last month - to switch on the Christmas lights .
Of course , to dismantle the myth of a full - scale War on Christmas , it is n't necessary to prove that no low - level council functionary has ever once misguidedly tried to avoid offence by eliminating references to religion .
That 's what seems to have happened in Lambeth last year , when the council 's monthly newsletter , Lambeth Life , referred to some Christmas light displays as " winter lights " - the council swiftly accepted it was an error - and also in High Wycombe , where a member of the library staff refused to display an A4 poster for a carol service in 2003 because of a rule excluding religious or political posters from a noticeboard .
( The High Wycombe Carol Service Poster Incident is now regularly wheeled out as an example of how diabolically militant the anti-Christmas forces have become . )
More frequently , though , there 's even less truth to the allegations than that .
The Christmas CD allegedly banned at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children , for example , was not only not banned - it was actually made available at a hospital carol service that had mysteriously evaded the health authority 's attempts to stamp out Christmas .
( The examples are never - ending : when the Daily Express screamed " Now Christ Is Banned " on its front page last winter , it was in response to news that the letters " BC " had been removed from some exhibits at the Cheddar Gorge Museum , in line with modern curatorial practice . )
" There 's something very complicated going on here , " says Terry Sanderson , president of the National Secular Society .
" It has to do with the contest between Christianity and Islam : Christians are becoming very alarmed about the progress they see Islam making in this country , and they fear their own festivals will be overwhelmed .
I was doing a phone - in the other day , and everybody who rang in was saying , ' They 're banning Christmas ! '
So I said : ' Who ?
Where ?
Who 's standing outside a church saying you can't go in ?
Who 's coming and knocking on your door at 6 am and asking if there 's a nativity set in your house ? '
It 's quite dangerous , I think , to incite this kind of resentment against a perceived enemy . "
This year , though , the defenders of Christmas are n't only invoking the fear that nebulous Muslim forces might be about to obliterate Britain 's traditional religion .
Simultaneously , they have also aligned themselves with Muslim groups , arguing that the real enemy is secularisation .
It 's a position well - crafted for the historical moment , and for the currently fashionable notion of Britain as comprised of groups defined above all by their faith ( even though barely 10 % of us regularly attend any kind of religious service ) .
" Any repetition of public bodies or local authorities renaming Christmas , so as not to offend other faith communities , will tend , as in the past , to backfire on the Muslim community in particular , " the Christian Muslim Forum warned in a letter to councils last month .
Perhaps the most notorious of the anti-Christmas rebrandings is Winterval , in Birmingham , and when you telephone the Birmingham city council press office to ask about it , you are met first of all with a silence that might seasonably be described as frosty .
" We get this every year , " a press officer sighs , eventually .
" It just depends how many rogue journalists you get in any given year .
We tell them it 's bollocks , but it does n't seem to make much difference . "
According to an official statement from the council , Winterval - which ran in 1997 and 1998 , and never since - was a promotional campaign to drive business into Birmingham 's newly regenerated town centre .
It began in early November and finished in January .
During the part of that period traditionally celebrated as Christmas , " there was a banner saying Merry Christmas across the front of the council house , Christmas lights , Christmas trees in the main civil squares , regular carol - singing sessions by school choirs , and the Lord Mayor sent a Christmas card with a traditional Christmas scene wishing everyone a Merry Christmas " .
None of that , though , was enough to prevent a protest movement at the time , whose members included the then Bishop of Birmingham , Mark Santer , as well as two members of UB40 .
Sensing a never - to - be - repeated public - relations opportunity , tourism staff at Solihull council invited Birmingham residents in search of a traditional Christmas to travel there instead .
And the leader of the anti-Winterval campaign , Ken White , fulfilled a key requirement of all such disputes : the people of Birmingham , he declared , were the victims of " political correctness gone mad " .
Then , last year , the War on Christmas received a massive boost when it exploded on to the American political landscape , thanks primarily to two Fox News anchormen , John Gibson and Bill O'Reilly .
Gibson had a vested interest , having just published a book entitled The War On Christmas : How The Liberal Plot To Ban The Sacred Christian Holiday Is Worse Than You Thought .
( A note in the interests of full disclosure : O'Reilly , as I enjoy telling people whenever possible , accused me of " spout[ing ] incredible nonsense " earlier this year after I wrote a story about a speech in which he invited al - Qaida to attack the liberal stronghold of San Francisco ; previously , he had speculated that the Guardian " might be edited by Osama bin Laden " . )
The American War on Christmas , like the British one , relied on a grab - bag of tenuous stories that crumbled on closer analysis .
O'Reilly was forced to apologise on air for suggesting that a school district in Texas had banned red- and - green clothing ; it remains possible that it had banned red- and - green paper plates , though the story is hard to corroborate .
Meanwhile , Gibson railed against the decision to call the Capitol 's Christmas tree a " Holiday tree " - even though , by the time his book was published , the decision had been reversed .
This week 's survey by the employment law firm Peninsula , suggesting that 74 % of British employers have banned Christmas decorations for fear of offending non-Christians , seems similarly beset with problems .
Even the Christian Muslim Forum accepts that the key question - " Do you admit to banning Christmas decorations because you are worried about offending other faiths ? " - seems pointedly phrased , and several follow - up questions seem designed to steer respondents in an anti-Christmas direction .
Even if the fear is real , one might reasonably attribute it precisely to the newspapers ' provocative campaigns against the alleged War on Christmas .
( After all - as everyone involved in the argument agrees - it 's not as if there 's any track record of anybody actually taking legal action because they were offended . )
Finally , the survey asks : " Are you aware of your legal requirement to celebrate all faiths ? "
But according to the conciliation service Acas , there is no such obligation .
The Christian Muslim Forum 's letter to councils did not provide any examples of the purported de-Christianisation of Christmas , and Julian Bond , the group 's director of management and communication , seems equally reluctant to do so .
" There have been incidents , " he says .
" I was looking them up on the internet the other day .
There was one from a hospital in Scotland , where they 'd received some CDs of Christmas carols , and some obviously mentioned the baby Jesus , and the hospital said it was n't appropriate . "
But , he concedes , " it does all seem to have been more prevalent in previous years .
It does seem to have disappeared this year . "
Does the forum plan to compile a list of examples of the war being waged on Christmas ?
" We have n't published anything like that , " Bond says .
" It 's difficult to get hold of . "
He goes on : " You know , we were in Birmingham for a meeting the other day , and there 's a big Merry Christmas banner in the middle of New Street . "
So is anybody at all trying to abolish Christmas this year ?
" I have n't come across any examples of anyone doing it this year , " he replies .
" No " .

Economic migrants are some of the most vulnerable to low wages
The bill , already passed by the US House of Representatives , would have raised wage levels to $ 7.25 by 2010 .
But Democrats were unhappy that it was tied to a Republican plan to cut inheritance taxes paid by the rich .
The Republican - led Senate did not gain the 60 votes needed to enable final congressional passage of the package .
Opponents of the joint bill had previously said they were not expecting the bill to gain approval in the Senate .
' Fattest cats '
On 30 July , the House of Representatives voted in favour of increasing the minimum wage from the existing hourly rate of $ 5.15 to $ 7.25 by the middle of 2009 .
But the bill also included plans to cut estate taxes , which are a form of inheritance tax levied when a property transfers from one person to another following a death .
Republicans say small businesses and farmers would benefit .
But many economists argue that expanding the estate tax benefit would only serve a small slice of the US population , who are already rich .
" The Republicans can get 6.6 million Americans an increase in their basic minimum wage , as long as we promised that the fattest cats in America would get a great big bowl of tax cuts , " said Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois , the second - ranking Democrat in the Senate .
Mr McKinnon has been fighting extradition since 2002
Gary McKinnon , who is accused of breaking into US government computer networks , has been fighting extradition since his arrest in November 2002 .
His family says he has 14 days to appeal against the extradition .
Mr McKinnon told the BBC he was " very worried and feeling very let down by my own government " .
In May , a district judge sitting at Bow Street Magistrates ' Court in London recommended Mr McKinnon be extradited - but the final decision rested with the home secretary .
' Order signed '
A Home Office spokesman said : " On 4 July the secretary of state signed an order for Mr McKinnon 's extradition to the United States for charges connected with computer hacking .
" Mr McKinnon had exercised his right to submit representations against return but the secretary of state did not consider the issues raised availed Mr McKinnon .
" Mr McKinnon now has the opportunity , within 14 days , to appeal against the decisions of the district judge / secretary of state . "
Mr McKinnon was first arrested in 2002 by the UK's National Hi-Tech Crime Unit for hacking into a series of computer networks used by the US army , navy , air force , and Department of Defense .
The US , in its case for extradition , said Mr McKinnon caused more than $ 700,000 ( £ 375,235 ) of damage while exploring the computer networks at various US military institutions .
It said one attack at the Earle Naval Weapons Station took place soon after 11 September 2001 and made it impossible to use critical systems .
The US Department of Justice said it took a month to get systems working in the aftermath of this attack .
Mr McKinnon , who was born in Glasgow , has admitted that he spent almost two years exploring these networks but has said he was motivated by a search for what he called " suppressed technology " .
His lawyers had argued he could be sent to Guantanamo Bay as a terrorist suspect .

Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine have found that inhibitors of an enzyme called cathepsin L prevent the SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) virus from entering target cells .
SARS is caused by an emergent coronavirus .
There is no effective treatment at this time .
This study also demonstrates a new mechanism for how viral proteins are activated within host cells , states senior author Paul Bates , PhD , an Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology .
Bates and first author Graham Simmons , PhD , Research Associate , also in the Department of Microbiology , published their findings in the early August issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
To gain entry , a virus binds to receptors on the surface of the host cell , and is taken up into a vesicle , or sphere , inside the cell .
Unlike most known viruses , the SARS coronavirus ( like the Ebola virus ) needs one more step to infect the cell .
The proteins within the membrane of both SARS and Ebola need to be cut by special cellular enzymes ( cathepsins ) in order to replicate within the host cell .
Cathepsins act in the low pH ( acidic ) environment inside the vesicle , facilitating fusion of the viral membrane and the vesicle membrane , so that viral proteins and nucleic acids can enter the cell where viral replication occurs .
" This paper changes the thinking of the field , " says Bates .
" Up to this point , everyone thought all of the activation steps were at the cell surface or due to the low pH environment in the vesicle .
Our paper shows that it's not just low pH , but the cathepsin proteases in the vesicles that clip the viral protein .
This gives us a new target to address in the development of therapeutics against the SARS virus . "
The researchers found that several chemical inhibitors of cathepsin activity blocked infection of human cell lines by the SARS virus , which were grown in a high - level safety laboratory .
In general , these findings , say the researchers , have led to a better understanding that the cutting of viral protein by cathepsins is necessary for infectivity and is likely not unique because both the SARS and Ebola viruses are now known to use a similar mechanism to invade their host cells .
( In June 2005 , a group from Harvard School of Medicine discovered that the Ebola viral membrane protein is similarly activated by cathepsin L and B. )
If these proteases are important for other viruses , they represent a new way to stop viral infection .
SARS and Ebola are the first examples of the need for these proteins to be cleaved during infection of the host cell .
This work is a joint collaboration between the Bates lab and the research group led by Scott L. Diamond , PhD , Director of the Penn Center for Molecular Discovery , one of nine facilities that the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) is establishing as part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network .
Diamond is also Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering within the Institute for Medicine and Engineering at Penn .
While independently screening for inhibitors , Diamond 's lab found a cathepsin L inhibitor called MDL28170 , which Bates and Simmons tested for efficacy in inhibiting SARS coronavirus infection .
The cellular cathepsin enzymes have many other roles within the body , including mediating the inflammatory immune response in the lungs and antigen processing in T cells .
The Bates research group , in collaboration with the Diamond group , has identified a few compounds , including MDL28170 , which they plan to test in animals for SARS inhibition .
" We 're now searching for other viruses that also use this cleaving mechanism for activating their proteins , " says Bates .
" If there are a number of other viruses that do that , and we have some preliminary evidence to suggest this , then we can develop small molecule inhibitors as possible therapeutics . "
One advantage of this approach is that oral medications made from small - molecule inhibitors are more readily made and distributed in the developing world - as opposed to a vaccine , suggests Bates .
Protease inhibitors active against cathepsins have been tested in mice with no ill side effects , which bodes well for their eventual testing in humans .

Claim : Frozen squirrels have been used for criminal purposes .
TRUE
Origins :
While even a cursory study of criminal behavior will uncover instances of animals having been employed as weapons ( e.g. , snakes used in holdups ) , in
a couple of unusual cases not only have squirrels been wielded by the ill - intentioned , but the critters were frozen ones at that .
In 1994 in Lorain , Ohio , frozen squirrels were listed among the tools of trade used by two men and a teenager in their attempts to steal tire rims from a parked car .
The trio would fling said frosted rodents at barking dogs to distract the canines from raising the alarm as they worked .
In 1991 , frozen squirrels were used to bludgeon a woman in Sacramento , California .
Kao Khae Saephan , an immigrant from Laos , repeatedly struck his wife with six frozen squirrels he retrieved from the family freezer , rendering the poor woman unconscious .
( As to why the couple had these rodents in their freezer , it ’s because squirrel meat is a component of some Laotian dishes . )
The irate husband was jailed on suspicion of spousal abuse , and Mrs. Saephan filed for divorce .
Iced squirrels , by the way , are a menace even when not being used in criminal endeavors .
In 2005 , British insurance company Norwich Union paid off on a claim for damage done to a vehicle by a frozen squirrel that had fallen from a tree — the iced rodent crashed through the windshield and landed on the passenger seat .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 22  A federal appeals panel on Friday cut nearly in half the $ 4.5 billion punitive damages award against Exxon Mobil as a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 .
A majority of a three - judge panel said the company ’s negligent conduct , while “ particularly egregious , ” had not been intentional and had not warranted the maximum financial penalty that a lower court imposed .
The panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , in San Francisco , split on applying legal precedents to the company responsible for the worst oil spill in United States history .
It cut the award for punitive damages to $ 2.5 billion .
In the decision , the majority wrote , “ Exxon ’s reckless misconduct in placing a known relapsed alcoholic in command of a supertanker , loaded with millions of barrels of oil , to navigate the pristine and resource abundant waters of Prince William Sound , was reckless and warrants severe sanctions . ”
As the second leading cause of death in the world , cigarette smoking is a preventable behavior .
Most countries require warnings about health risks on every package , but the effectiveness of these warnings depends upon the design and the " freshness " of the messages .
In a multi-country study published in the March 2007 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine , researchers found that more prominent text messages were more effective and graphic pictures even more so in affecting smokers ' behaviors .
Recent changes in health warnings were also associated with increased effectiveness , while health warnings on US packages , which were last updated in 1984 , were associated with the least effectiveness .
The authors analyzed data from four waves of surveys taken during 2002 - 2005 of adult smokers in Canada , the United States , the United Kingdom and Australia .
Almost 15,000 smokers were surveyed on their awareness of the messages , any changes in understanding of the risk of smoking , their intention or motivation to quit and any behavioral changes they had noticed in themselves .
The International Tobacco Control ( ITC ) Four Country Survey collected the responses from the same smokers , approximately 2 months before new UK warnings were implemented , and then at 6 , 18 and 32 months after implementation .
Warnings on the packages ranged from graphic pictures covering half the package in Canada to small text warnings on the side of packages in the US .
The first international treaty devoted to public health , the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ( FCTC ) , has mandated " large , clear , visible and legible " warnings that cover at least 30 per cent of the surface .
Canada currently meets this guideline , although most countries fall short .
Thus , the current study evaluated warnings that were : ( 1 ) well below the minimum FCTC standard ( US and UK at baseline ) ; ( 2 ) slightly below the FCTC minimum ( Australian warnings ) , ( 3 ) enhanced to the FCTC standard ( UK at follow - up ) , and ( 4 ) at the recommended FCTC standard ( Canada ) .
Writing in the article , David Hammond , PhD , states , " This study suggests that more prominent health warnings are associated with greater levels of awareness and perceived effectiveness among smokers .
In particular , the findings provide strong support for the effectiveness of new health warnings implemented on UK packages that were enhanced to meet the minimum international standards ... UK smokers were also more likely to report that the new warnings had led them to think about quitting , to think about the health risks of smoking , and had deterred them from having a cigarette compared to Australian and US smokers .
Although the findings provide strong support for the effectiveness of prominent text warnings that meet the minimum international standards , the findings also suggest that larger pictorial warnings may have an even greater impact : data collected two and a half years after the implementation of the Canadian pictorial warnings and two and a half years after the implementation of the new UK warnings indicate that the Canadian warnings had impact levels at or above the UK warnings for each of the measures examined in the survey .

Pupils found it hard to understand English language lessons
Bilingual support worker Aishah Azmi , 24 , was asked to remove the veil after pupils found it hard to understand her during English language lessons .
Headfield Church of England Junior School , in Dewsbury , said she could wear the veil outside the classroom .
Ms Azmi refused and was suspended pending the outcome of an employment tribunal , Kirklees Council said .
The tribunal heard the case in September and is due to announce its decision within the next two weeks .
There is no religious obligation whatsoever for Muslim women to cover themselves up in front of primary school children
Shahid Malik , Labour MP for Dewsbury
Dewsbury MP Shahid Malik backed the school 's decision , saying : " In schools the top priority has got to be the education of our children .
" I fully support the decision of the education authority and the school in requesting the classroom assistant remove her veil when teaching primary school children .
" I believe the education authority has bent over backwards to be accommodating and has been extremely reasonable and sensible in the decision it has come to .
" There is no religious obligation whatsoever for Muslim women to cover themselves up in front of primary school children . "
' Inadequate standards '
The school , which has 529 pupils aged seven to 11 , takes many children from different ethnic backgrounds where English is not the first language .
An Ofsted report carried out in February said : " The first languages spoken by most children are Panjabi , Gujarati and Urdu , and many children are still learning to speak English .
" Significant improvement is required in relation to the inadequate standards of achievement reached by children and their slow progress over time .
" Children 's speaking skills are poor and this holds them back in most aspects of their work . "
Kirklees Council 's children 's services spokesman , Jim Dodds , said Ms Azmi 's suspension was " nothing to do with religion " .
Teachers ' concern
" We are simply trying to ensure that our children get the best possible education , " he said .
" Both pupils and teachers raised concerns because they were finding it difficult to make out what she was saying during lessons .
" We have a lot of pupils who do not speak English as a first language and you have to be able to see people 's lips move when you are being taught .
" We asked this young lady to remove her veil when she was teaching English language , but she refused . "
Mr Dodds said that even if Ms Azmi won her case the council would not change its position .
" Our only concern is that the children are taught properly , " he said .
Last week , Commons leader Jack Straw angered some Muslims when he said wearing the veil made community relations more difficult .
Karl Rove , the grand wizard of strategy known as ' Bush 's brain ' , seemed close to realising his ambition to create a Republican hegemony that would last for a generation .
He had a dream of turning America into a one - party state and it was a dream that looked like becoming all too real .
A country founded on the idea of the separation of powers has rarely witnessed such a concentration of might in the hands of one party .
Such hubris is always the midwife to nemesis .
Suddenly that Republican domination is beginning to crack .
This autumn the tectonic plates of American politics are beginning to shift under the feet of President Bush and an increasingly desperate Republican party .
When I spoke to Stan Greenberg , the hugely experienced political consultant for the Democrats , he predicted an ' earthquake ' in the mid-term elections for a third of the Senate and all of the House of Representatives .
Even more tellingly , the Republicans themselves sound very scared that angry voters are about to punish them with a thrashing .
Thomas Davis , a Virginian Congressman who is one of his party 's most senior strategists , talks about the Republicans losing as many as 30 seats in the House , which would put that half of Congress into the hands of the Democrats for the first time in 12 years .
Some say it is the war .
Some say it is the money .
Some say it is the sex .
Actually , it 's all three , a triple - whammy of reasons for Americans to express their disgust with how they are being governed .
Let 's start with Iraq .
Any American with a television set and an IQ above room temperature has known for a long time that Iraq is far from becoming the pacified , liberal democracy that was promised in the original prospectus for the war .
Most Americans were nevertheless prepared to tolerate the mounting carnage so long as they could believe that the ultimate outcome would be positive .
There has been a big turn in the mood about the war in the past fortnight .
John Warner , the Republican who chairs the Senate 's armed services committee , came back from a visit to American troops in Iraq to warn that there had to be ' a change of course ' .
A commission chaired by James Baker , Secretary of State when Dubya 's father was in the White House , is about to publish a report calling for a major recasting of strategy .
These rock - ribbed Republicans cannot be dismissed with the usual White House line that anyone who asks awkward questions about Iraq is an unpatriotic appeaser and fellow traveller of Osama bin Laden .
Soaring up the bestseller lists is Bob Woodward 's account of a dysfunctional administration presided over by a wilfully uninquiring Commander - in - Chief who will never acknowledge the scale of the blunders committed in Iraq .
President Bush has again tried to use national security as his trump card in this election .
The terror of terror worked for the Republicans in 2002 and again in 2004 .
It is not working this time .
The opinion polls all agree : a majority of Americans now feel that Iraq is getting worse , and that the war was a mistake which has left them less secure .
They still see Bush as a ' War President ' .
The difference now is that they see him losing his wars .
The United States has invaded Iraq and not found any weapons of mass destruction while North Korea is acquiring the nuclear bombs which George Bush once pledged he 'd prevent them from having .
At a news conference at the White House , the President talked big about Kim Jong - Il but carried a small stick .
The world 's soi-disant hyperpower is reduced to suggesting that China should do something about it .
What is most alarming people , including senior members of Bush 's own administration , is how the crisis over North Korea plays into the threat of a nuclear - tipped Iran .
The more helpless that America looks in relation to North Korea , the more emboldened the Iranians will feel about defiantly pursuing their ambitions to join the nuclear club .
The Bush presidency has expended squillions of dollars on warfare and military hardware .
So much treasure and so much blood and Americans are left with a growing dread that they have ended up weaker in the world .
Then there 's the sex .
While his party shamelessly fanned homophobia to ramp up its vote , a gay Republican congressman was making advances to teenage male interns .
Congressman Mark Foley has resigned his Palm Beach seat since his dirty computer messages were exposed and the fall - out from his cyber - stalking of teenagers could cost other Republicans their places in Congress .
As is so often the case , the Nixon rule of scandal applies .
It is not so much the crime as the cover - up that has done the most damage .
There has been a corrosive drip of accusations that the party leadership in Congress ignored warnings about Foley 's behaviour .
The Republicans are reeling from the impression that the self - appointed moral daddies of America harboured a sexual predator .
When I spoke to Andy Card , who for five years was Chief of Staff to President Bush , he calculated that the election would ultimately come down to which side could mobilise more of its supporters in the last 72 hours .
The Rove vote machine has been heavily reliant on evangelical Christians , precisely the group most repelled by what it sees as moral degeneracy on Capitol Hill .
And then there is the money .
A rising stench of corruption surrounds the Republicans .
The scale of the kickbacks made to politicians by Jack Abramoff , the convicted lobbyist , are awesome even by the standards of American bribery scandals .
A defining theme of the Bush era has been Republicans who preach fiscal abstinence while practising recklessly unprotected spending .
The surplus inherited from Bill Clinton has been blown and turned into a staggering deficit .
The richest and most powerful country on the planet is now in the strange and dangerous place of being hugely indebted to the rest of the world .
Put it all together - and I get the sense that Americans are finally putting it all together - and the Republicans look like a party that is jeopardising their nation 's moral , strategic and financial future .
You have to say , it could n't have happened to a nicer bunch of people .
Lynn Westmoreland is running for re-election as a Republican congressman in Georgia .
His sole legislative initiative has been to press a bill requiring that the Ten Commandments be displayed in the House and the Senate .
He then had to confess on television : ' I can't name them all . '
In fact , he could barely name three of the commandments that he was so keen on .
Voters in Iowa have on offer the Republican Steve King .
He wants to keep out illegal immigrants by constructing a 700 - mile wall along the border with Mexico .
Better still , he built his own model of this ' Tortilla Curtain ' out of cardboard and wire which he demonstrated to Congress in Blue Peter fashion .
That is outdone in the crazy stakes by the Texan Republican Sam Johnson who offered personally to fly an F - 15 to nuke Syria .
Afterwards , he said he was : ' Kinda joking . '
Do n't you love the ' kinda ' .
Don Sherwood , a Pennsylvania Republican , is famous for paying an undisclosed sum to his former mistress , who had accused him of repeated assaults , to settle her lawsuit against him .
He has been forced to broadcast campaign ads denying that he tried to choke her .
Down in Florida , Katherine Harris , who achieved world notoriety over the hanging chads which gave Bush the White House in the first place , is running for the Senate .
According to her : ' God is the one who chooses our rulers . '
Mmm .
If the Great Returning Officer really does bother himself with deciding elections , then God must be mighty pissed with America to have chosen rulers like these .
A slew of recent opinion polls shows support for the Republicans plummeting and the Democrats gaining what should be a decisive edge .
Gallup gives the Democrats a lead of more than 20 per cent among likely voters .
Given such a toxic blend of policy failure abroad , financial and sexual scandals at home , compounded by discontent about the economy , in most democracies the governing party would be expecting a total meltdown .
The purgative mechanism of the ballot would do its necessary work to kick the scoundrels out .
And yet you have to be a little cautious about predicting that the Republicans will suffer the sort of wipe - out that natural justice says they deserve .
America is in a febrile state .
There are three weeks left before election day and the polls have yo - yoed depending on the sleaze or terror headline of the hour .
While America 's mood is volatile , its democracy is becoming atrophied .
And by design .
The gerrymandering of seats to permanently fix their political complexion has made it extraordinarily difficult to dislodge incumbents .
The story of this election is one of Republican collapse rather than any great enthusiasm for the Democrats .
They do n't have a clear message delivered by a popular and plausible leader .
One of the Democrat 's best hopes for the presidency - Mark Warner of Virginia - has just backed out of the race for 2008 .
It is in the nature of the American system that the executive can speak with a single voice - that of the President - while the opposition talks in a cacophony of tongues .
A senior member of the Clinton cabinet put it to me like this : ' The Democrats do n't have one spokesman .
They have 10 spokesmen . '
There is no such thing as the Shadow President .
If ever there was a country in need of a leader of the opposition , it is the United States today .
Even in the absence of one , George Bush faces a bleak closing chapter of his presidency .
The Democrats need only gain control of one house to start launching investigations into 9/11 , the Iraq war and its searing aftermath , the financial scandals , the sexual scandals - you name it , they can subject the White House to torture - by - inquiry .
A Democrat majority in the House will almost certainly give the chairmanship of the judiciary committee to John Conyers who has previously called for the impeachment of the President .
George Bush is set to spend his last two years in the White House besieged by searing probes into his presidency .
That would be a fitting fate for a President famous for his unwillingness or inability to focus on detail and his lack of curiosity about the consequences of his own decisions .
The neck lock will then be on George W Bush .
If you care about what you do , you care about getting better at it .
This involves reflecting about how you do things , and trying out new techniques to see if they make you better .
Even if other people recommend new techniques , the only way you know if they work for you is by trying them out yourself and seeing if they improve your performance .
The trouble is that improvement , particularly with new techniques is n't linear .
Often there is a ravine that opens up when you try a new strategy .
The best illustration I remember of this is from Gerald Weinberg 's excellent Becoming a Technical Leader .
It comes from his habit of playing pinball .
As I slowly improved on my plateau , I began to suspect that I was missing something .
Although my scores mounted quickly when three balls were in play , once in a while , when trying to keep all three balls going , I lost all three at once .
It happened only about one time out of four , but it meant I had lost one of three precious turns .
I wondered what would happen if I stopped trying to keep all three balls going and concentrated instead on being sure that one of the three balls was retained on the playing field .
When I tried this new strategy , my scores immediately fell , into the ravine .
In fact , I was playing against a pretty fair kid at the time , and he started beating me .
Unable to face defeat , I went back to my old strategy and put him in his place .
Later , though , when I did n't have an audience , I tried the new strategy again .
Once again my scores dropped , but I noticed I was n't losing a turn so frequently , perhaps only once in five times when I played three balls at once .
Steadily , with practice , I improved my ability to ignore the other two balls and keep at least one ball on the playing field .
I did n't score so heavily each time there were three balls in play , but my overall scores got larger .
I also got to play longer for my quarter , which is one of the major objectives of the game .
The point is that when you try a new technique it'll often make you worse , at least initially .
You have to work with something unfamiliar , perhaps also unlearn something else that gets in the way .
During that period you performance has dipped .
Only with perseverance can you get through this and reach a higher plateau .
While you 're in the ravine , it 's very tempting to back out onto the familiar high ground .
When you 're learning a new language it's often tempting to stop when you have a task that you know how to do in a more familiar language .
Often your first ravine is the crucial one , because once you 've been through that cycle of ravine and higher plateau once , you 're familiar with the emotions involved .
That memory can help you with the next ravine .
After a few cycles the feelings become familiar and less frightening .
There is a dark side - sometimes there is n't a higher plateau .
Sometimes a technique just does n't work , at least for you .
The trouble is that you can never be sure if that higher plateau is just one more week away or if there is n't one there .
There no solution to that problem , but that should n't make you turn tail at every ravine you come across .
Ravines are a common part of improvement and if you want to make any real progress in anything , you have to work your way through a few of them .
Following warnings by extremist Islamic group al - Muhajiroun , in which the group said that the red cross in the England flag symbolizes the ' blood thirsty crusaders ' and the occupation of Muslims , some of the largest companies in England have ordered their workers not to wave the flags .
The flag has recently appeared in England on everything from bikinis to cars , and sold in endless versions in stores .
But the Islamic protest forced some corporations , such as cable companies NTL , and even the Drivers and Vehicles Licensing Agency to ban the flag in every form due to fears from reactions of Muslims .
The Sun tabloid newspaper has in recent days launched a campaign to bring back the flag , and has published a blacklist of companies preventing their workers from expressing their patriotism at work .
The Sun said that a large pub network has banned drinkers from entering with symbols of the national team .
The hero of the day is a two year - old toddler , who was thrown out with his parents from Leicester , because he wore the England team 's uniform .
Joshua Foer :
How does arborsculpture differ from bonsai or topiary ?
Richard Reames : Arborsculpture is the art of shaping tree trunks to create art and functional items through bending , grafting , pruning , and multiple planting .
Bonsai is the art of miniaturizing trees .
Some of bonsas basic techniques , such as bending branches and pruning , are similar to arborsculpture .
Topiary was originally defined as ornamental gardening , so you could say , to be technical , that arborsculpture is a branch of topiary , but the word topiary is more commonly used to describe the shaping of foliage .
In that sense , topiary is almost the opposite of arborsculpture in that you ’re only trimming the foliage , whereas in arborsculpture , you ’re only working with the trunk .
Of the various tree arts , arborsculpture is most closely related to espalier , a technique that began in France as a way to grow quality fruit in small areas , like inside castle courtyards .
They ’d grow fruit trees up against the wall and shape the branches so that they were evenly spaced and parallel , maximizing the amount of fresh air to each piece of fruit .
I like to say that arborsculpture is like espalier on acid .
Tell me about some of the arborsculptures you ’ve grown .
I have grown many chairs and benches .
I have a 30 - foot spiral poplar tree that goes up 8 feet , splits into two trunks that spiral around each other , and then is grafted back together at about 16 feet high .
I have a nice spiral staircase growing right now in oak .
I planted a circle of birch trees years ago and just recently spun them all clockwise a few feet and grafted the tops together .
It ’s a small gazebo .

What 's Wrong With Copy Protection
What 's wrong ?
First , I call it copy protection rather than content protection , because " content " is such a meaningless word .
What the technology actually does is to deter copying .
Such technologies have a long history in computing , starting with the first microcomputers , minicomputers , and workstations .
Except in very small niches , all such systems ultimately failed .
Many failed because of active opposition from their buyers , who purchased alternative products that did not restrict copying .
There is nothing wrong with allowing people to optionally choose to buy copy - protection products that they like .
What is wrong is when :
Competing products are driven off the market
Pioneer New Media Technologies , who builds the recently announced recordable DVD drive for Apple , says " The major consumer applications for recordable DVD will be home movie editing and storage and digital photo storage " .
They carefully do n't say " time - shifting TV programs , or recording streaming Internet videos " , because the manufacturers and the distribution companies are in cahoots to make sure that that capability never reaches the market .
Even though it 's 100 % legal to do so , under the Supreme Court 's Betamax decision .
Streambox built software that let people record RealVideo streams on their hard disks ; they were sued by Real under the DMCA , and took it off the market .
According to Nomura Securities , DVD Recorder sales will exceed VCR sales in 2004 or 2005 , and also exceed DVD Player - only sales by 2005 .
( http://www.kipinet.com/tdb/1000/10tdb04.htm)
So by 2010 or so , few consumers will have access to a recorder that will let them save a copy of a TV program , or time - shift one , or let the kids watch it in the back of the car .
Is anyone commenting on that social paradigm shift ?
Do we think it 's good or bad ?
Do we get any say about it at all ?
Instead , consumers will have to pay movie / TV companies over and over for the privilege of time - shifting or space - shifting .
Even if they have purchased the movie , and it 's stored at home on their own equipment , and they have high bandwidth access to it from wherever they are .
This concept is called " pay per use " .
It ca n't compete with " You have the right to record a copy of what you have the right to see " .
These companies can't eliminate that right legally , because it would violate too many of the fundamentals of our society , so they are restricting the technology so you can't exercise that right .
In the process they are violating the fundamentals on which a stable and just society is based .
But as long as society survives until after they 're dead , they do n't seem to care about its long - term stability .
Companies do n't disclose copy - protection restrictions
It is n't just Apple who is misleading the consumer ; it 's epidemic .
Sony portable mini-disc recorders only come with digital input jacks , never digital outputs .
Sound checks in -- but only checks out in low - quality analog formats .
Intel touts the wonders of their TCPA ( Trusted Computing Platform Architecture ) .
You have to read between the lines to discover that it exists solely to spy on how you use your PC , so that any random third party across the Internet can decide whether to " trust " you -- the owner .
TCPA is n't about reporting to you whether you can trust your own PC ( e.g. whether it has a virus ) , it does n't include that function .
It exists to report to record companies about whether you have installed any software that lets you make copies of MP3s , or any free software to circumvent whatever feeble copy - protection system the record company uses .
Intel is pushing HDCP ( High Definition Content Protection ) which is high speed hardware encryption that runs only on the cable between the computer and its CRT or LCD monitor .
The only signal being encrypted is the one that the user is sitting there watching , so why is it encrypted ?
So that the user can't record what they can view !
If the cable is tampered with , the video chip degrades the signal to " analog VCR quality " .
Intel is also pushing SDMI and CPRM ( Content Protection for Recordable Media ) which would turn your own storage media ( disk drives , flash ram , zip disks , etc ) into co-conspirators with movie and record companies , to deny you ( the owner of the computer and the media ) the ability to store things on those media and get them back later .
Instead some of the stored items would only come back with restrictions wired into the extraction software -- restrictions that are not under the control of the equipment owner , or of the law , but are matters of contract between the movie / record companies and the equipment / software makers .
Such as , " you ca n't record copyrighted music on unencrypted media " .
If you try to record a song off the FM radio onto a CPRM audio recorder , it will refuse to record or play it , because it 's watermarked but not encrypted .
Even when recording your own brand - new original audio , the default settings for analog recordings are that they can never be copied , nor ever copied in higher fidelity than CD's , and that only one copy can be made even if copying is ever authorized ( if the other restrictions are somehow bypassed ) .
Intel and IBM do n't tell you these things ; you have to get to Page 11 of Exhibit B - 1 , " CPPM Compliance Rules for DVD - Audio " on page 45 of the 70 - page " Interim CPRM / CPPM Adopters Agreement " , available only after you fill out intrusive personal questions after following the link from http://www.dvdcca.org/4centity/.
All Intel tells you that CPPM will " give consumers access to more music " http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/aw032300.htm).
Lying to your customers to mislead them into buying your products is wrong .
Scientific research is unpublishable
Competition is prevented
Abuse of " copyright protection " rewards monopolies
Microsoft built some deliberately incompatible protocols into Windows 2000 so that competing Unix machines could not be used as DNS servers in some circumstances .
Microsoft released a specification but only under an encrypted file format that claimed to require that readers agree not to use the information to compete with them .
When someone decrypted the trivial encryption without agreeing to the terms , Microsoft threatened to use the DMCA to sue Slashdot , the popular free - software news web site , who published the results .
( Luckily for us , Slashdot has a backbone and said " go ahead , we 'll defend that suit " and Microsoft chickened out . )
Copyright does n't grant the right to prevent competition , or to restrict global trade -- but somehow the legislation that was enacted to protect copyrights is being used to do just those things .
Social policy is created without public input
Copyright 's balance of benefits is lost
Beneficiaries are a tiny fraction of society
Society can truly eliminate scarcity , but not this way !
We should be rejoicing in mutually creating a heaven on earth !
Instead , those crabbed souls who make their living from perpetuating scarcity are sneaking around , convincing co-conspirators to chain our cheap duplication technology so that it wo n't make copies -- at least not of the kind of goods they want to sell us .
This is the worst sort of economic protectionism -- beggaring your own society for the benefit of an inefficient local industry .
The record and movie distribution companies are careful not to point this out to us , but that is what is happening .
If by 2030 we have invented a matter duplicator that 's as cheap as copying a CD today , will we outlaw it and drive it underground ?
So that farmers can make a living keeping food expensive , so that furniture makers can make a living preventing people from having beds and chairs that would cost a dollar to duplicate , so that builders wo n't be reduced to poverty because a comfortable house can be duplicated for a few hundred dollars ?
Yes , such developments would cause economic dislocations for sure .
But should we drive them underground and keep the world impoverished to save these peoples ' jobs ?
And would they really stay underground , or would the natural advantages of the technology cause the " underground " to rapidly overtake the rest of society ?
I think we should embrace the era of plenty and work out how to mutually live in it .
I think we should work on understanding how people can make a living by creating new things and providing services , rather than by restricting the duplication of existing things .
That 's what I 've personally spent ten years doing , founding a successful free software support company .
That company , Cygnus Solutions , annually invests more than $ 10 million into writing software , giving it away freely , and letting anyone modify or duplicate it .
It funds that by collecting more than $ 25 million from customers , who benefit from having that software exist and be reliable and widespread .
The company is now part of Red Hat , Inc -- which also makes its living by empowering its customers without restricting the duplication of its work .
It 's no coincidence that the open source , free software , and Linux communities are among the first to become alarmed at copy protection .
They are actively making their livings or hobbies out of eliminating scarcity and increasing freedom in the operating system and application software markets .
They see the real improvement in the world that results -- and the ugly reactions of the monopolistic and oligopolistic forces that such efforts obsolete .
Converting the whole world to operate without scarcity is a huge task .
Such a large economic shift would take decades to spread through the entire world economy , making billions of new winners and new losers .
We will be extremely lucky if by 2030 we are prepared to end scarcity without massive social turmoil , including riots , civil unrest , and world war .
If we are to find a peaceful path to an era of plenty , we should be starting HERE AND NOW , transforming the industries we have already eliminated scarcity in -- text , audio , and video .
Companies that can't adjust should disappear and be replaced by those who can .
As these whole industries learn how to exist and thrive without creating artificial scarcity , they will provide models and expertise for other industries , which will need to change when their own inefficient production is replaced by efficient duplication ten or fifteen years from now .
Relying on copy - protection now would send us in exactly the wrong direction !
Copy protection pretends that the law and some fancy footwork with industrial cartels can maintain our current economic structures , in the face of a hurricane of positive technological change that is picking them up and sending them whirling like so many autumn leaves .

Sunday Night
It ’s Sunday night .
I make myself a quick supper of pan seared tuna , rice , and green beans .
After I eat and clean the dishes I fix myself a light vodka and tonic and head into the living room .
I pull a book off the bookshelf and settle into my easy chair .
I get ten pages into my book when my roommate comes out of his room .
“ You want to watch anything ? ” he asks .
“ Anything you want , ” I reply , not looking up from my book .
My roommate stretches out on the couch and flips on the TV .
He starts watching a game show .
The yelling and screaming on the TV distracts me from my book .
Soon I ’m watching Deal or No Deal .
“ I do n’t get it , ” I say after a while .
“ If the woman picks the case with a million dollars she wins ? ”
“ No , ” my roommate says .
“ If she picks the case with a lot of money thats not good . ”
“ I still do n’t get it . ”
“ You want to get one of the cases with a low amount so the bank will offer you a bigger deal . ”
“ Ah , ” I say .
“ Hence the name of the show . ”
“ That ’s right . ”
I watch for a few more minutes .
It ’s all rather confusing .
I was never into game shows .
The models are cute though .
Then again every game show has cute models .
Bob Barker was no fool .
I turn back to my book .
I read about a man who never existed , living a life thats probably not possible .
When I get to the part where the detective pulls his gun the phone rings .
I sigh and close the book .
I wonder who ’s calling me .
I better answer it .
It might be important .
It might be an emergency .
I heave myself out of my easy chair and pad into my bedroom .
Looking at the caller ID I feel a sharp tingle of surprise .
Its the Bistro calling .
I pick up the phone .
“ Hello ? ”
“ Waiter ? ” a familiar voice says .
“ Is that you ? ”
“ It ’s me Louis , ” I say cautiously .
“ Whats up ? ”
There ’s no response .
In the background I hear the low roar of a busy restaurant .
Somebody laughs .
I hear a muffled voice say , “ Let me speak to him . ”
“ Waiter ? ” the Bistro ’s server says .
“ This is Louis . ”
“ Hi Louis . ”
“ Larry and Clara want to talk to you . ”
My stomach clenches .
Larry and Clara were my favorite customers .
I was their favorite waiter .
“ Put them on , ” I say .
There are some fumbling noises as Louis hands over the phone .
A female voice comes on the line .
“ Waiter ! ” Clara says .
“ Larry and I came in for dinner and Louis told us you left . ”
“ I did . ”
“ What happened ? ”
I think carefully about my answer .
After a few seconds I say , “ It was time to go Clara . ”
“ Larry and I came here because of you , ” Clara says .
“ Thanks Clara , ” I reply .
“ I appreciate that . ”
“ Are you OK ? ”
“ I’m OK Clara . ”
“ They told us you left suddenly , ” Clara says .
“ So Larry and I were worried something happened to you . ”
“ I ’m fine , ” I say .
“ I ’m pursuing other things .
I ’m just sorry I did n’t have time to let you know I was leaving . ”
“ Louis said you were doing some kind of writing . ”
“ That ’s right . ”
“ You never told us you were a writer , ” Clara says .
“ That ’s very inspiring . ”
“ Thank you . ”
“ Hang on , ” Clara says .
“ Larry wants to talk to you . ”
I wait for Larry to come on the line .
Larry ’s a good guy .
When he showed up with a diamond stud in his ear one night he took my ribbing with good grace .
He was always polite , drank Dewars 12 Year , and tipped 30 % .
But I did n’t like Larry and Clara because they were good tippers .
I liked them because they were always interested in me as a person .
Thats a rare quality in customers these days .
“ Hey Waiter , ” Larry says .
“ You all right ? ”
“ I ’m good Larry , ” I say .
“ I wish you told us you were leaving . ”
“ No time Larry . ”
“ Oh . ”
“ You know how these things can be . ”
I hear a sharp breath on the other side of the line .
“ I know , ” Larry says .
“ You and your wife are good people , ” I say .
“ I ’m going to miss you . ”
“ Listen , ” Larry says .
“ I ’m gonna put Clara back on the line .
You give her your phone number . ”
“ OK . ”
“ We ’ll get together for a drink soon , ” Larry says .
“ Then you can tell us what you ’re up to . ”
“ I ’d like that . ”
“ OK Waiter , ” Larry says .
“ Hang on a sec . ”
Clara comes back on .
We exchange information .
Clara works for a vet .
She asks how my dogs doing .
“ Buster ’s fine Clara , ” I say .
“ Thanks for asking . ”
“ Good , ” Clara says .
“ We ’ll call you soon and meet for drinks . ”
“ I ’m looking forward to it Clara . ”
“ Goodbye . ”
“ Bye . ”
I hang up the phone .
My chest tightens .
My eyes threaten to water .
I ’ve waited on some horrible people in my time .
I ’ve made a career bashing rude and obnoxious customers .
Sometimes I forget how nice people can be .
I walk back into the living room .
“ Who was that ? ” my roommate asks .
“ An old customer , ” I reply .
“ Checking to make sure I was alright . ”
“ That was nice of them , ” he says .
“ It was indeed , ” I reply .
I take another sip of my drink .
The contestant on the game show starts jumping up and down excitedly .
I reopen my book and start reading .
I think about Larry and Clara .
I think about the novel ’s detective .
Phillip Marlowe ’s a character in fiction .
Good fiction , but fiction nonetheless .
I smile to myself .
I ’m a man who exists , living a life where anythings possible .
The Scorpion and the Frog
The river was wide and swift , and the scorpion stopped to reconsider the situation .
He could n't see any way across .
So he ran upriver and then checked downriver , all the while thinking that he might have to turn back .
Suddenly , he saw a frog sitting in the rushes by the bank of the stream on the other side of the river .
He decided to ask the frog for help getting across the stream .
" Hellooo Mr. Frog ! " called the scorpion across the water , " Would you be so kind as to give me a ride on your back across the river ? "
" Well now , Mr. Scorpion !
How do I know that if I try to help you , you wont try to kill me ? " asked the frog hesitantly .
" Because , " the scorpion replied , " If I try to kill you , then I would die too , for you see I cannot swim ! "
Now this seemed to make sense to the frog .
But he asked .
" What about when I get close to the bank ?
You could still try to kill me and get back to the shore ! "
" This is true , " agreed the scorpion , " But then I would n't be able to get to the other side of the river ! "
" Alright then ... how do I know you wont just wait till we get to the other side and THEN kill me ? " said the frog .
" Ahh ... , " crooned the scorpion , " Because you see , once you 've taken me to the other side of this river , I will be so grateful for your help , that it would hardly be fair to reward you with death , now would it ? ! "
So the frog agreed to take the scorpion across the river .
He swam over to the bank and settled himself near the mud to pick up his passenger .
The scorpion crawled onto the frog 's back , his sharp claws prickling into the frog 's soft hide , and the frog slid into the river .
The muddy water swirled around them , but the frog stayed near the surface so the scorpion would not drown .
He kicked strongly through the first half of the stream , his flippers paddling wildly against the current .
Halfway across the river , the frog suddenly felt a sharp sting in his back and , out of the corner of his eye , saw the scorpion remove his stinger from the frog 's back .
A deadening numbness began to creep into his limbs .
" You fool ! " croaked the frog , " Now we shall both die !
Why on earth did you do that ? "
The scorpion shrugged , and did a little jig on the drownings frog 's back .
" I could not help myself .
It is my nature . "
Then they both sank into the muddy waters of the swiftly flowing river .
Self destruction - " Its my Nature " , said the Scorpion ...
An Interesting article regarding this fable
Blosxom sucks
Several people were upset at my recent discussion of Blosxom .
Specifically , I said that it sucked .
Strange to say , I meant this primarily as a compliment .
I am going to explain myself here .
Before I start , I want to set your expectations appropriately .
Bill James tells a story about how he answered the question " What is Sparky Anderson 's strongest point as a [ baseball team ] manager ? " with " His won - lost record " .
James was surprised to discover that when people read this with the preconceived idea that he disliked Anderson 's management , they took " his record " as a disparagement , when he meant it as a compliment .
I hope that does n't happen here .
This article is a long compliment to Blosxom .
It contains no disparagement of Blosxom whatsoever .
I have technical criticisms of Blosxom ; I left them out of this article to avoid confusion .
So if I seem at any point to be saying something negative about Blosxom , please read it again , because that 's not the way I meant it .
As I said in the original article , I made some effort to seek out the smallest , simplest , lightest - weight blogging software I could .
I found Blosxom .
It far surpassed my expectations .
The manual is about three pages long .
It was completely trivial to set up .
Before I started looking , I hypothesized that someone must have written blog software where all you do is drop a text file in a directory somewhere and it magically shows up on the blog .
That was exactly what Blosxom turned out to be .
When I said it was a smashing success , I was not being sarcastic .
It was a smashing success .
The success does n't end there .
As I anticipated , I was n't satisfied for long with Blosxom 's basic feature set .
Its plugin interface let me add several features without tinkering with the base code .
Most of these have to do with generating a staging area where I could view posts before they were generally available to the rest of the world .
The first of these simply suppressed all articles whose filenames contained test .
This required about six lines of code , and took about fifteen minutes to implement , most of which was time spent reading the plugin manual .
My instance of Blosxom is now running nine plugins , of which I wrote eight ; the ninth generates the atom - format syndication file .
The success of Blosxom continued .
As I anticipated , I eventually reached a point at which the plugin interface was insufficient for what I wanted , and I had to start hacking on the base code .
The base code is under 300 lines .
Hacking on something that small is easy and rewarding .
I fully expect that the success of Blosxom will continue .
Back in January , when I set it up , I foresaw that I would start with the basic features , that later I would need to write some plugins , and still later I would need to start hacking on the core .
I also foresaw that the next stage would be that I would need to throw the whole thing away and rewrite it from scratch to work the way I wanted to .
I 'm almost at that final stage .
And when I get there , I wo n't have to throw away my plugins .
Blosxom is so small and simple that I 'll be able to write a Blosxom - compatible replacement for Blosxom .
Even in death , the glory of Blosxom will live on .
So what did I mean by saying that Blosxom sucks ?
I will explain .
Following Richard Gabriel , I think there are essentially two ways to do a software design :
You can try to do the Right Thing , where the Right Thing is very complex , subtle , and feature - complete .
You can take the " Worse - is - Better " approach , and try to cover most of the main features , more or less , while keeping the implementation as simple as possible .
Doing the Right Thing is very difficult .
If you get it right , the resulting system is still complex and subtle .
It takes a long time to learn to use it , and when users do learn to use it , it continues to surprise and baffle them because it is so complex and subtle .
The Right Thing may contain implementation errors , and if it does the user is unlikely to be able to repair them without great effort .
Worse , because the Right Thing is very difficult to achieve , and very complex and subtle , it is rarely achieved .
Instead , you get a complex and subtle system that is complexly and subtly screwed up .
Often , the designer shoots for something complex , subtle , and correct , and instead ends up with a big pile of crap .
I could cite examples here , but I think I 've offended enough people for one day .
In contrast , with the " Worse - is - Better " approach , you do not try to do the Right Thing .
You try to do the Good Enough Thing .
You bang out something short and simple that seems like it might do the job , run it up the flagpole , and see if it flies .
If not , you bang on it some more .
Whereas the Right Thing approach is hard to get correct , the Worse - is - Better approach is impossible to get correct .
But it is very often a win , because it is much easier to achieve " good enough " than it is to achieve the Right Thing .
You expend less effort in doing so , and the resulting system is often simple and easy to manage .
If you screw up with the Worse - is - Better approach , the end user might be able to fix the problem , because the system you have built is small and simple .
It is hard to screw it up so badly that you end with nothing but a pile of crap .
But even if you do , it will be a much smaller pile of crap than if you had tried to construct the Right Thing .
I would very much prefer to clean up a small pile of crap than a big one .
Richard Gabriel is n't sure whether Worse - is - Better is better or worse than The Right Thing .
As a philosophical question , I 'm not sure either .
But when I write software , I nearly always go for Worse is Better , for the usual reasons , which you might infer from the preceding discussion .
And when I go looking for other people 's software , I look for Worse is Better , because so very few people can carry out the Right Thing , and when they try , they usually end up with a big pile of crap .
When I went looking for blog software back in January , I was conscious that I was looking for the Worse - is - Better software to an even greater degree than usual .
In addition to all the reasons I have given above , I was acutely conscious of the fact that I did n't really know what I wanted the software to do .
And if you do n't know what you want , the Right Thing is the Wrong Thing , because you are not going to understand why it is the Right Thing .
You need some experience to see the point of all the complexity and subtlety of the Right Thing , and that was experience I knew I did not have .
If you are as ignorant as I was , your best bet is to get some experience with the simplest possible thing , and re-evaluate your requirements later on .
When I found Blosxom , I was delighted , because it seemed clear to me that it was Worse - is - Better through and through .
And my experience has confirmed that .
Blosxom is a triumph of Worse - is - Better .
I think it could serve as a textbook example .
Here is an example of a way in which Blosxom subscribes to the Worse - is - Better philosophy .
A program that handles plugins seems to need some way to let the plugins negotiate amongst themselves about which ones will run and in what order .
Consider Blosxom 's filter callback .
What if one plugin wants to force Blosxom to run its filter callback before the other plugins ' ?
What if one plugin wants to stop all the subsequent plugins from applying their filters ?
What if one plugin filters out an article , but a later plugin wants to rescue it from the trash heap ?
All these are interesting and complex questions .
The Apache module interface is an interesting and complex answer to some of these questions , an attempt to do The Right Thing .
( A largely successful attempt , I should add . )
Faced with these interesting and complex questions , Blosxom sticks its head in the sand , and I say that without any intent to disparage Blosxom .
The Blosxom answer is : Plugins run in alphabetic order .
Each one gets its crack at a data structure that contains the articles .
When all the plugins have run , Blosxom displays whatever 's left in the data structure .
End of explanation ; total time elapsed , three seconds .
So OK , a plugin named " AARDVARK " can filter out all the articles and nobody else gets a chance to look at them .
So what ?
That is a feature , not a bug .
It 's simple .
It 's flexible enough :
If you do n't like that " AARDVARK " runs first , rename it to " zyzzyva " ; Problem solved .
An alternative design would be to have a plugin registry file that lists the order in which the plugins will be run .
In the right system , that could be the Right Thing .
In a system as simple as Blosxom , it would have been the wrong thing , not Worse - is - Better , but just Worse .
The author knew just exactly how much design was required to solve the problem , and then he stopped .
So Blosxom is a masterpiece of Worse - is - Better .
I am a Worse - is - Better kind of guy anyway , and Worse - is - Better was exactly what I was looking for in this case , so I was very pleased with Blosxom , and I still am .
I got more and better Worse - is - Better for my software dollar than usual .
When I stuck a " BLOSXOM SUX " icon on my blog pages , I was trying to express ( in 80 ×15 pixels ) my evaluation of Blosxom as a tremendously successful Worse - is - Better design .
Because it might be the Wrong Thing instead of the Right Thing , but it was the Right Wrong Thing , and I 'd sure rather have the Right Wrong Thing than the Wrong Right Thing .
And when I said that " Blosxom really sucks ... in the best possible way " , that 's what I meant .
In a world full of bloated , grossly over - featurized software that still does n't do quite what you want , Blosxom is a spectacular counterexample .
It 's a slim , compact piece of software that does n't do quite what you want --- but because it is slim and compact , you can scratch your head over it for couple of minutes , take out the hammer and tongs , and get it adjusted the way you want .
Thanks , Rael .
I think you did a hell of a job .
I am truly sorry that was not clear from my earlier article .

Just as most any anonymous piece of cynically humorous satire about American politics and culture ends up eventually being attributed to comedian George Carlin , so the same kind of material gets credited to English comic John Cleese when it evinces a British viewpoint on American affairs .
Unlike his fellow Monty Python trouper Terry Jones , however , Mr. Cleese does n’t generally pen this sort of political levity .
The genesis of this article is a long and convoluted one .
It hit the online world shortly after the contentious U.S. presidential election of 2000 , in which the results of Florida ’s crucial vote were disputed for weeks , the U.S. Supreme Court eventually stepped in to halt recounts , and George W. Bush was declared the winner despite receiving fewer popular votes overall than his opponent , Al Gore .
The piece evidently originated on with one Alan Baxter of Rochester , U.K. , who wrote and posted a much shorter , four - item version to an internal newsgroup hosted by his employer in November 2000 , as a wry commentary on the recently concluded ( but then still far from decided ) U.S. presidential election :
London , 8th November 2000 .
To the citizens of the United States of America , Following your failure to elect either a half decent candidate or man-monkey as President of the USA to govern yourselves and , by extension , the free world , we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence .
Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth
II will resume a monarch ’s duties over all states , commonwealths and other territories .
To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency , please comply with1 the following acts : 1 . Look up “ revoke ” in a dictionary
2. Learn at least the first 4 lines of “ God save the Queen ”
3. Start referring to “ soccer ” as football
4. Declare war on Quebec
Tax collectors from Her Majesty ’s Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due ( backdated to 1776 ) .
Thank you for your cooperation and …have a nice day !
This item was soon reworked and expanded into a ten - point version :
NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
To all the citizens of the United States of America ,
In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves , we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence , effective today .
Her Britannic Majesty , Queen Elizabeth II , will resume sovereign duties over all states , commonwealths and other territories .
Except Utah , which she does not fancy .
Your new Prime Minister ( The Rt. Hon .
Tony Blair , MP for the 97.85 % of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders ) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections .
Congress and the Senate will be disbanded .
A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed .
To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency , the following rules are introduced with immediate effect : 1 . You should look up “ revocation ” in the Oxford English Dictionary .
Then look up “ aluminium ” .
Check the pronunciation guide .
You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it .
Generally , you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels .
Look up “ vocabulary ” .
Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as “ like ” and “ you know ” is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication .
Look up “ interspersed ” .
2 . There is no such thing as “ US English ” .
We will let Microsoft know on your behalf .
3 . You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents .
It really is n’t that hard .
4 . Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys .
5 . You should relearn your original national anthem , “ God Save The Queen ” , but only after fully carrying out task 1 .
We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through .
6 . You should stop playing American “ football ” .
There is only one kind of football .
What you refer to as American “ football ” is not a very good game .
The 2.15 % of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays “ American ” football .
You will no longer be allowed to play it , and should instead play proper football .
Initially , it would be best if you played with the girls .
It is a difficult game .
Those of you brave enough will , in time , be allowed to play rugby ( which is similar to American “ football ” , but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies ) .
We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005 .
7 . You should declare war on Quebec and France , using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde .
The 97.85 % of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky .
The Russians have never been the bad guys .
“ Merde ” is French for “ shit ” .
8 . July 4th is no longer a public holiday .
November 8th will be a new national holiday , but only in England .
It will be called “ Indecisive Day ” .
9 . All American cars are hereby banned .
They are crap and it is for your own good .
When we show you German cars , you will understand what we mean .
10 . Please tell us who killed JFK .
It ’s been driving us crazy .
God Save the Queen !
The “ Revocation ” piece escaped into the wider world of the Internet a week later when Peter Rieden of Farnborough , U.K. , added three more entries to a slightly revised the list ( bringing the total to thirteen ) and posted it to the USENET newsgroup sci.military.naval on 15 November 2000 :
The following is the text of a message which was communicated to President Clinton at 07:30 ( EST ) today : NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
To the citizens of the United States of America from Her Britannic Majesty , Queen Elizabeth II .
In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves , we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence , effective today .
Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth
II will resume monarchical duties over all states , commonwealths and other territories .
Except Utah , which she does not fancy .
Your new prime minister ( The rt. hon .
Tony Blair , MP – for the 97.85 % of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders ) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections .
Congress and the Senate will be disbanded .

Future adult suffrage will be based in part on successful completion of compulsory spelling examinations which will focus on words like “ colour ” and “ visualise ” whose mis-spelling is endemic in the American colonies .
3 . You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents .
It really is n’t that hard .

As a sign of penance 5 grams of sea salt per cup will be added to all tea made within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , this quantity to be doubled for tea made within the city of Boston itself .
11 . From November 1st only proper British Bitter will be referred to as “ beer ” , and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as “ Lager ” .
The substances formerly known as “ American Beer ” will henceforth be referred to as “ Near - Frozen Gnat ’s Urine ” , with the exception of the product of the American Budweiser company whose product will be referred to as “ Weak Near - Frozen Gnat ’s Urine ” .
This will allow true Budweiser ( as manufactured for the last 1000 years in Pilsen , Czech Republic ) to be sold without risk of confusion .
12 . From November 1st the UK will harmonise petrol ( or “ Gasoline ” as you will be permitted to keep calling it until April 1st 2001 ) prices with the former USA .
The UK will harmonise its prices to those of the former USA and the Former USA will , in return , adopt UK petrol prices ( roughly $ 6 / US gallon – get used to it ) .
13 . Please tell us who killed JFK .
It ’s been driving us crazy .
Thank you for your co-operation .
The “ Revocation of Independence ” quickly spread far and wide on the Internet through e-mail forwards , newsgroup posts , and mailing lists , and within days newspapers in the U.K. were running even longer , fifteen - point versions , such as the following :
The Supreme Court of Florida has instructed me to post the following to ensure strict balance in these turbulent times .
NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
To the citizens of the United States of America ,
In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves , we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence , effective today .
Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth
II will resume monarchial duties over all states , commonwealths and other territories .
Except Utah , which she does not fancy .
Your new prime minister ( The Right Honourable Tony Blair , MP for the 97.85 % of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders ) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections .
Congress and the Senate will be disbanded .
A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed .
To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency , the following rules are introduced with immediate effect : 1 . You should look up “ revocation ” in the Oxford English Dictionary .
Then look up “ aluminium ” .
Check the pronunciation guide .
You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it .
The letter ‘ U ’ will be reinstated in words such as ‘ favour ’ and ‘ neighbour ’ , skipping the letter ‘ U ’ is nothing more than laziness on your part .
Likewise , you will learn to spell ‘ doughnut ’ without skipping half the letters .
You will end your love affair with the letter ‘ Z ’ ( pronounced ‘ zed ’ not ‘ zee ’ ) and the suffix “ ize ” will be replaced by the suffix “ ise ” .
You will learn that the suffix ‘ burgh is pronounced ‘ burra ’ e.g. Edinburgh .
You are welcome to respell Pittsburgh as ‘ Pittsberg ’ if you ca n’t cope with correct pronunciation .
Generally , you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels .
Look up “ vocabulary ” .
Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as “ like ” and “ you know ” is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication .
Look up “ interspersed ” .
There will be no more ‘ bleeps ’ in the Jerry Springer show .
If you ’re not old enough to cope with bad language then you should n’t have chat shows .
When you learn to develop your vocabulary then you wo n’t have to use bad language as often .
2 . There is no such thing as “ US English ” .
We will let Microsoft know on your behalf .
The Microsoft spell - checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter ‘ u’ and the elimination of “ - ize ” .
3 . You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents .
It really is n’t that hard .
English accents are not limited to Cockney , upper - class twit or Mancunian ( Daphne in Frasier ) .
You will also have to learn how to understand regional accents – Scottish dramas such as “ Taggart ” will no longer be broadcast with subtitles .
While we ’re talking about regions , you must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England .
The name of the county is “ Devon ” .
If you persist in calling it Devonshire , all American States will become “ shires ” e.g. Texasshire , Floridashire , Louisianashire .
4 . Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys .
Hollywood will be required to cast English actors to play English characters .
British sit-coms such as “ Men Behaving Badly ” or “ Red Dwarf ” will not be re-cast and watered down for a wishy - washy American audience who ca n’t cope with the humour of occasional political incorrectness .
5 . You should relearn your original national anthem , “ God Save The Queen ” , but only after fully carrying out task 1 .
We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through .
6 . You should stop playing American “ football ” .
There is only one kind of football .
What you refer to as American “ football ” is not a very good game .
The 2.15 % of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays “ American ” football .
You will no longer be allowed to play it , and should instead play proper football .
Initially , it would be best if you played with the girls .
It is a difficult game .
Those of you brave enough will , in time , be allowed to play rugby ( which is similar to American “ football ” , but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies ) .
We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005 .
You should stop playing baseball .
It is not reasonable to host an event called the ‘ World Series ’ for a game which is not played outside of America .
Since only 2.15 % of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders , your error is understandable .
Instead of baseball , you will be allowed to play a girls ’ game called “ rounders ” which is baseball without fancy team strip , oversized gloves , collector cards or hotdogs .
7 . You should declare war on Quebec and France , using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde .
The 97.85 % of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky .
The Russians have never been the bad guys .
“ Merde ” is French for “ 5hit ” .
You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns .
You will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler .
Because we do n’t believe you are sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items , you will require a permit if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public .
8 . July 4th is no longer a public holiday .
November 8th will be a new national holiday , but only in England .
It will be called “ Indecisive Day ” .
9 . All American cars are hereby banned .
They are crap and it is for your own good .
When we show you German cars , you will understand what we mean .
All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts .
You will start driving on the left with immediate effect .
At the same time , you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables .
Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour .
10 . You will learn to make real chips .
Those things you call French fries are not real chips .
Fries are n’t even French , they are Belgian though 97.85 % of you ( including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe ) are not aware of a country called Belgium .
Those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called “ crisps ” .
Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat .
The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer which should be served warm and flat .
Waitresses will be trained to be more aggressive with customers .
11 .
As a sign of penance 5 grams of sea salt per cup will be added to all tea made within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , this quantity to be doubled for tea made within the city of Boston itself .
12 . The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all , it is lager .
From November 1st only proper British Bitter will be referred to as “ beer ” , and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as “ Lager ” .
The substances formerly known as “ American Beer ” will henceforth be refered to as “ Near - Frozen Knat ’s Urine ” , with the exception of the product of the American Budweiser company whose product will be referred to as “ Weak Near - Frozen Knat ’s Urine ” .
This will allow true Budweiser ( as manufactured for the last 1000 years in Pilsen , Czech Republic ) to be sold without risk of confusion .
13 . From November 1st the UK will harmonise petrol ( or “ Gasoline ” as you will be permitted to keep calling it until April 1st 2001 ) prices with the former USA .
The UK will harmonise its prices to those of the former USA and the Former USA will , in return , adopt UK petrol prices ( roughly $ 6 / US gallon — get used to it ) .
14 .
You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns , lawyers or therapists .
The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you ’re not adult enough to be independent .
Guns should only be handled by adults .
If you ’re not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist then you ’re not grown up enough to handle a gun .
15 . Please tell us who killed JFK .
It ’s been driving us crazy .
Tax collectors from Her Majesty ’s Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due ( backdated to 1776 ) .
Thank you for your cooperation .
Curiously , U.S. newspapers tended to run a fifteen - point version as well , but one that was much terser and made significantly different “ demands ” to which the U.S. was required to comply :
To the citizens of the United States of America :
In light of your failure to elect anybody as President of the USA , and thus to govern yourselves and , by extension , the free world , we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence , effective today .
Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth
II will resume monarchical duties over all states , commonwealths and other territories including New Jersey .
To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency , please comply with the following acts : 1 . Look up “ revocation ” in the now official Oxford Dictionary .
Start spelling English words correctly .
2 . Learn at least the first four lines of “ God Save The Queen . ”
3 . Start referring to “ soccer ” as football .
4 . Declare war on Quebec and France .
5 . Arrest Mel Gibson for treason .
6 . Close down the National Football League .
Learn to play rugby .
7 . Enjoy warm , flat beer and steak and kidney pudding .
8 . Train waitresses to be more aggressive with customers and not to tell you their names before you eat .
9 . July 4th is no longer a public holiday ; this has been replaced with Nov. 5 . 10 .
All members of this British Crown Dependency will be required to take six weeks annual vacation and observe statutory tea breaks .
11 . Driving on the left side of the road is now compulsory .
Recall all vehicles to effect the change immediately .
12 . Report to our Consulate General in New York for your new passport and job allocation .
13 . Have Meg Ryan report to Prince Andrew ’s bedchamber .
14 .
Add the royal insignia to the top of the Washington Monument and the Queen ’s Christmas speeches to the Lincoln Memorial .
15 . Stop referring to the World Series of Baseball and instead call it the National Series of USA , Cuba and Japan .
Tax collectors from Her Majesty ’s Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due ( backdated to 1776 ) .
Thank you for your cooperation and have a nice day .
Predictably , the satire spawned a variety of U.S. “ rebuttal ” versions :
The Supreme Court of Florida has instructed me to post the following to ensure strict balance in these turbulent times .
DECLARATION OF ANNEXING THE BRITISH ISLES AS PART OF THE USA
To the imperialist British colonizers .
In the light of your indecision over joining a common European Currency , your dissatisfaction with the European Union , your bickering with European Governments and the fact that you already almost speak our language and refuse to speak any other European languages , you are to be annexed as a State of America .
Your state code will be GB .
Zip codes will be assigned to replace your old postal districts .
The state capital will be Stratford - upon - Avon which is a lot prettier than London .
Princess Diana will be declared a saint .
You have already assimilated so much American culture that you are unlikely to notice the transition .
To aid in the assimilation , the following rules are introduced with immediate effect : 1 . Look up “ aluminum ” in any good American Dictionary .
Check the spelling and pronunciation guide .
We discovered it , we named it , you are mispronouncing it .
Learn to live with it .
You are , of course welcome to your idiosyncratic and illogical place - names such as Edinburgh , if you wanted it pronounced ‘ Eddinburra ’ you have spelled it that way in the first place .
You will quit using words such as “ fortnight ” .
The correct term is “ a two week period ” .
You will learn words such as “ credenza ” , “ intern ” and “ chad ” .
2 . There is no such thing as “ UK English ” .
UK English is the relic of a defunct colonialist power which attempted to impose British English linguistic superiority on a nation which has a higher number of English speakers .
3 . Your film - makers should learn to distinguish the American and Canadian accents .
American accents are not limited to redneck drawls or New York accents .
Mainland Americans have more than enough accents to cope with in our own country , so all British dramas will now bear subtitles , especially those made in impenetrable dialects such as Scottish , Scouse or Geordie .
To make life easier for mainland America , all British films and TV programs must use American vocabulary and accents ;
Scotch characters will wear plaid , Irish characters will have shamrocks on them , Welsh characters will not be used since we do n’t have Welsh Americans , and English characters will wear bowler hats and pinstripes .
4 . The British film industry will no longer portray all Americans as cowboys , rednecks , trailer trash or Beverly Hills billionaires .
Hollywood will continue to use “ Mockney ” and “ Posh ” British accents as this makes it easier for viewers to identify which characters are British .
You can have Hugh Grant back .
He ’s a lousy actor and we do n’t want him either .
All British films will be made in Hollywood where the weather and scenery are better .
Your film industry is already unable to make a halfway - decent film which does n’t contain a American in the starring role .
All American characters should be ‘ good guys ’ .
5 . You will learn your new national anthem “ The Star Spangled Banner ” .
It shall be sung every morning at kindergarten , high school , university and your places of work .
Your Union Flag will be hung up any damn way we wish so stop bitching about it being upside down .
If there was meant to be a right way up you should have made it simpler .
All Union flags will be replaced by the Stars and Stripes over a 12 month period of time .
6 . You should stop playing soccer and rugby .
There is no need to have two games , one of which is confusingly like Football and one of which is called football but patently is n’t real football .
If it does n’t require 45 pounds of padding , it is n’t football .
You should also stop playing cricket .
Americans ca n’t understand the rules .
If you insist on playing this game which is only played by former British colonies , you will introduce a simplified scoring system , timeouts , colored strips and cheerleaders to make it more interesting .
Any match which takes longer than 90 minutes will be declared a draw .
7 . In films , as in real life , we decide who the bad guys are .
The bad guys are those guys who do n’t do as we tell them .
They are also the guys who attract the biggest audiences into movie theaters .
You will cease using the word “ cinema ” .
They are “ movie theaters ” .
The snippets of forthcoming films are not “ trailers ” they are “ teasers ” .
8 . November 5th is no longer a day for fireworks .
July 4th is the appropriate fireworks festival .
If you want a big fireworks party on November 5th , we will help you to blow up your Houses of Parliament .
You wo n’t be needing them any longer ; Disneyland London will be situated there .
Hunting with packs of dogs is also banned .
Instead , you will go hunting with a pick - up truck , some six - packs of beer , two coonhounds and enough guns and ammo to equip a private militia .
There is also no such activity as “ caravanning ” .
It is properly called “ camping ” .
The thing boy scouts do with tents and bedrolls is called “ tenting ” .
9 . Roundabouts will be banned .
What is the point of turning left in order to turn right ?
They are confusing to Americans and are death traps .
You will start driving on the right with immediate effect .
Most of the world drives on the right already .
You will be allowed to turn right on a red light if safe to do so though you must check local county legislation as this is not permitted in all areas .
10 .
Those things which you call chips are cholesterol - soaked abominations .
You will start to eat fries – light fluffy potato in crisp coating .
If you want to eat British - style fried potato sticks you will need a certificate from your doctor and good medical insurance .
Beer is to be served cold .
The warm , flat drink you call beer is properly termed ‘ ale ’ and the FDA have determined it to be unfit for human consumption .
You will also learn the difference between crackers , cookies and biscuits to avoid causing unnecessary confusion to mainland Americans .
11 .
All inter-personal communications between family members , even if resident in the same house , must be through a lawyer .
It is compulsory to sue somebody at least once per year – be inventive .
It is compulsory to have therapy three times each week and to recover false memories of your childhood which allow you to sue your parents and / or your therapist .
Therapy will take the place of speaking to family members .
You will be given compulsory courses on how to become dysfunctional .
Name your children after interesting medical conditions .
12 . You will not have guns .
In the eyes of Mainland Americans you are wayward children .
Children are not permitted to play with firearms unless they have a legitimate reason to do so i.e. they plan to gun down the population of a small town ( self - defense ) or slaughter every living creature within a mile radius ( hunting ) .
Thank you for your co-operation .
You will be assimilated .
Another popular response to the “ Revocation ” piece was this one :
SUBJECT : NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
To the citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland :
We welcome your concern about our electoral process .
It must be exciting for you to see a real Republic in action , even if from a distance .
As always we ’re amused by your quaint belief that you ’re actually a world power .
The sun never sets on the British Empire !
Right - o chum !
However , we regretfully have to decline your offer for intervention .
On the other hand , it would be amusing to see you try to enforce your new policy ( for the 96.3 % of you that seem to have forgotten that you have little to no real power ) .
After much deliberation , we have decided to continue our tradition as the longest running democratic republic .
It seems that switching to a monarchy is in fact considered a “ backwards step ” by the majority of the world .
To help you rise from your current anachronistic status , we have compiled a series of helpful suggestions that we hope you adopt : 1 . Realize that language is an organic structure , and that you are n’t always correct in your pronunciation or spelling .
Let ’s use your “ aluminium ” example .
Sir Humphrey Davy ( an Englishman ) invented the name “ aluminum ” ( note spelling ) for the metal .
However , in common usage the name evolved into “ aluminium ” to match the naming convention of other elements .
In 1925 the United States decided to switch back to the original spelling and pronunciation of the word , at which point we dominated the aluminum industry .
We ’d also like to point out that the process of actually producing aluminum was developed by an American and a Frenchman ( not an Englishman ) .
However , we ’d like to thank you for the Oxford English Dictionary .
It ’s an interesting collection , considering that over 10,000 of the words in the original edition were submitted by a crazy American civil - war veteran called Dr. William Charles Minor .
2 . Learn to distinguish the American and Canadian accents , and then we ’ll talk about the English and Australian accent issue .
3 . Review your basic arithmetic .
( Hint 100 – 98.85 = 1.15 and 100 – 97.85 = 2.15 ) 4 .
If you want English actors as good guys , then make your own movies .
Do n’t rely on us for your modern popular culture .
We liked “ Lock , Stock , and Two Smoking Barrels ” , “ Trainspotting ” , and “ The Full Monty ” .
We ’ve also heard good things about this “ Billy Elliot ” .
But one good movie a year does n’t exactly make a cultural powerhouse .
However , you ’re doing pretty well with music , so keep up the good work on that front .
5 . It ’s inefficient to have a national anthem that changes its title whenever your monarch dies .
Let ’s not forget that your national anthem has an extremely boring tune .
We suggest switching to that Rule Brittania ditty , it ’s toetapping .
Or maybe Elton John could adapt “ Candle In The Wind ” again for you guys .
6 . Improve at your national sport .
Football ?
Soccer ?
This just in : United States gets fourth place in men ’s soccer at the 2000 Summer Olympics .
United Kingdom ?
Not even close .
By the way , impressive showing at Euro 2000 .
You almost managed to get through the tournament without having your fans start an international incident .
7 . Learn how to cook .
England has some top notch candy .
Salt ‘ n ’ Vinegar chips are quite yummy .
However , there ’s a reason why the best food in your country is Indian or Chinese .
Your contributions to the culinary arts are soggy beans , warm beer , and spotted dick .
Perhaps when you finally realize the French are n’t the spawn of satan they ’ll teach you how to cook .
8 . You ’re doing a terrible job at understanding cars .
The obvious error is that you drive on the wrong side of the road .
A second problem is pricing , it ’s cheaper to buy a car in Belgium and ship it to England than to buy a car in England .
On the other hand , we like Jaguars and Aston Martins .
That ’s why we bought the companies .
9 . We ’ll tell you who killed JFK when you apologize for “ Teletubbies ” .
Thank you for your time .
You can now return to watching bad Australian soap operas .
P.S. — Regarding WW2 : You ’re Welcome .
All of this brought us to the end of 2004 , when the U.S. went through another controversial presidential election ( although one not nearly as close or contested as the 2000 version ) , which once again resulted in a victory for the Republican candidate , George W. Bush .
One of the multiplicity of variants of the four - year - old “ Revocation of Independence ” satire was dusted off , British funnyman John Cleese ’s name was appended to the end , and the cycle of forwarding started all over again , only this time with a recognizable name attached to the piece .
Many , many people have had a hand in shaping the multiple variations of this bit of humor that now exist , but John Cleese himself is one of the few who has n’t .
Observations on living around the world and in - between countries , as a non-famous , non-rich person who has seen the beauty and ugliness of so many things and discovered so many truths that have previously been unmentioned in mainstream media .
The mother of the world 's most famous ( yet unseen ) Scientologist spawn does n't let anything get in between her and Barneys .
Just days before she gave birth to Suri , Holmes was spotted in the ultra hot Beverly Hills department store for hours with security guards flanking her .
In fact , she was in the store until it closed and we 're told she was the last customer to leave .

The Gory Antigora : Illusions of Capitalism and Computers
The unfortunate Internet has only one peer when it comes to obfuscation due to an inundation of excessive punditry , and that peer is religion .
Internet pundits have been a rather self - satisfied and well - paid class for over a decade and a half , and I am happy to have been one of their number .
All things change , and I can’t imagine this gig will go on forever .
All it might take is one small misfortune , like a downturn at Google , for Internet punditry to go out of fashion .
Therefore , I cherish each remaining occasion when I am asked to comment on the Net .
The Internet as it is , rather than as we might wish it to be , is above all else an elaboration of the structure of computer software , or , more precisely , software as humans have been able to create it .
And software as we know it is a brittle substance .
It breaks before it bends .
It is the only informational structure in human experience thus far that has this quality .
Contrast software with biological information , such as the information encoded in DNA , which can frequently be changed slightly with results that are also only modified slightly .
A small change in a genotype will infrequently make a phenotype absolutely unviable ; it will usually effect either no change or only a tiny change .
All people have different genes , but few people have serious birth defects .
That smoothness in the relationship of change in information to change in physicality is what allows the process of evolution to have a meaningful signal with which to drive incremental adaptation , despite the inevitably noisy nature of reality .
Small changes in computer software , by contrast , too frequently result in crashes or glitches that teach observers nothing and cannot support smooth adaptation .
The way I put this succinctly is that “ Software Sucks . ”
Brittleness leads to the phenomenon of “ Lock - in , ” which means that software is harder to change once it has been enhanced by subsequent developments than other human artifacts .
Once software becomes part of the context or foundation for newer software in a network of dependencies , the older stuff becomes much more expensive to change than the newer stuff .
There are severe , even existential , consequences of this quality of software .
One consequence is that situational advantage in the business side of software is overwhelmingly driven by snowballing early adoption , with Microsoft perhaps being the most celebrated example .
Software requires that a variety of human ideas that have previously been functional in part because of ambiguity must be stated precisely for the first time , and it becomes much harder to withdraw or modify an idea once formally specified .
An example of the principle of lock - in from the technical sphere is the idea of the computer file .
Prior to sometime in the mid-1980s , there were influential voices in computer science opposing the idea of the file because it would lead to file incompatibility .
Ted Nelson , the inventor of the idea of linked digital content , and Jef Raskin , initiator of the Macintosh project at Apple , both held the view that there should be a giant field of elemental data without file boundaries .
Since UNIX , Windows , and even the Macintosh — as it came out the door after a political struggle — incorporated files , the idea of the file has become digitally entrenched .
We teach files to undergraduates as if we were teaching them about photons .
Indeed , I can more readily imagine physicists asking us to abandon the photon in a hundred years than computer scientists abandoning the file in a thousand .
Whether the idea of files is of any consequence is an imponderable .
Files have become too fundamental to reconsider .
But other candidates for lock - in can and must be considered .
Neither youthful political movements nor skillful entrepreneurs can usurp , or even substantially modify ideas that have been locked in by software design in a network .
For instance , long ago , on the floor of a funky , messy apartment in Cambridge , I argued with a guy named Richard Stallman , the creator of the Free Software movement .
[ Correction :
The original text stated Richard Stallman was “ the first articulate evangelist of the open software movement , ” when he is in fact the creator of the Free Software movement .
— ed. ]
He was a sympathetic hippy sort of guy who shared my idealism and hope for what computers could mean to people .
But what was he busy creating ?
An open version of UNIX !
Yuk !
He had no choice , since this was the only thing he could build on an open basis that might be used .
UNIX , again !
And now we have Linux .
As it happens , I dislike UNIX and its kin because it is based on the premise that people should interact with computers through a “ command line . ”
First the person does something , usually either by typing or clicking with a pointing device .
And then , after an unspecified period of time , the computer does something , and then the cycle is repeated .
That is how the Web works , and how everything works these days , because everything is based on those damned Linux servers .
Even video games , which have a gloss of continuous movement , are based on an underlying logic that reflects the command line .
Human cognition has been finely tuned in the deep time of evolution for continuous interaction with the world .
Demoting the importance of timing is therefore a way of demoting all of human cognition and physicality except for the most abstract and least ambiguous aspects of language , the one thing we can do which is partially tolerant of timing uncertainty .
It is only barely possible , but endlessly glitchy and compromising , to build Virtual Reality or other intimate conceptions of digital instrumentation ( meaning those connected with the human sensory motor loop rather than abstractions mediated by language ) using architectures like UNIX or Linux .
But the horrible , limiting ideas of command line systems are now locked - in .
We may never know what might have been .
Software is like the movie “ Groundhog Day , ” in which each day is the same .
The passage of time is trivialized .
Software gradually makes more and more of politics obsolete .
Consider how a civil law can change when it is implemented as software .
Pre -digital laws were made of language , which can only be interpreted .
Language does not directly specify or operate reality .
For instance , a copyright law might forbid the unauthorized distribution of a book , but the physical instantiation of the law benefits from an indispensable ambiguity .
A browsing person might read a portion of the book at a bookstore , for instance , or even at a used bookstore , or at a friend ’s house .
Casual , low cost browsing is absolutely essential to core democratic or capitalistic ideas like the soapbox or the newsstand .
If you had to agree to listen to either a whole soapbox rant , or none of it , you ’d certainly choose to skip the experience entirely .
I live in Berkeley , so I can speak with authority on this point .
But allowing the occasional stray bit of a rant to enter one ’s ear is a small investment in the unknown , a hedge against insularity .
Ambiguity in the boundaries of information access is what makes this investment inexpensive .
Unfortunately , digital instantiations of law tend to make ambiguity expensive .
The degree to which human , or “ natural ” language is unlike computer code cannot be overemphasized .
Language can only be understood by the means of interpretation , so ambiguity is central to its character , and is properly understood as a strength rather than a weakness .
Perfect precision would rob language of its robustness and potential for adaptation .
Human language is not a phenomenon which is well understood by either science or philosophy , and it has not been reproduced by technologies .
Computer code , by contrast , is perfectly precise and therefore immune to influence from context ; and therefore it lacks any deep sense of meaning .
Code is nothing but a conveyance of instructions that are either followed perfectly or not at all .
The all or nothing quality of digital code ( as we currently know how to make it ) trickles down into all systems we build with it .
In the much - examined case of digital copyright , it is easy to design a closed information system with end - to - end controls .
The video game market is an example .
If only it were easier to browse video games , it would n’t be so expensive to advertise them , and it would be easier to sell less trivial games , for a browsing person learns more than a viewer of a TV ad .
A completely open system is also easy to design .
The original Napster was an example .
Completely open systems have their own problems .
The usual criticism is that content creators are disincentivized , but the deeper problem is that their work is decontextualized .
Completely open music distribution systems excel at either distributing music that was contextualized beforehand , such as classic rock , or new music that has little sense of authorship or identity , like the endless Internet feeds of bland techno mixes .
( Yes , I ’m making a value judgment here .
One must . )
The most attractive designs , from the point of view of either democratic ideals or the profit motive , would have intermediate qualities ; they would leak , but only a little .
A little leakage greatly reduces the economic motivation for piracy as well as the cost of promotion .
A little leakage gives context to and therefore enhances the value of everything .
Alas , it is hard to get desirable intermediate effects with digital systems .
Although there are beginning to be some pale examples of leaky copyright online , the effect has not been implemented well as of this date , and whether or not an excellent leaky solution will ever be achieved is one of the most important open questions about the future of the Net .
The difficulty of achieving ambiguity in the face of digital brittleness is also central to the controversy surrounding digital or “ touch screen ” voting .
A voting system in which there is absolute protection of voter privacy has never before existed .
It is a digital phenomenon .
The closed - system approach to digital voting machine design has inspired profound , even paranoid levels of distrust .
A little bit of potential leakage turns out to be necessary in order to have checks and balances and to build trust .
If you can see the ballots in a box , there is a chance that once in a great while your eye might be able to follow the path of a particular ballot into the pile and you might just see how somebody voted .
But most of the time you just see the overall process and are able to feel more comfortable .
With a closed digital system , there might in theory be less chance that someone can spy your ballot , but there is nothing you can see to reasonably gain confidence in the system .
Ultimately what makes a good digital voting system hard to design is exactly the same as what thwarts good content distribution system design .
A little leakage is necessary to give things context and meaning , and digital systems abhor leakage .
Another consequence of digital brittleness and lock - in is that more niches turn out to be natural monopolies than in previous technological eras , with Microsoft once again being a celebrated example .
I call these niches “ Antigoras , ” in contrast with the classical idea of the Agora .
An Antigora is a privately owned digital meeting arena made rich by unpaid or marginally paid labor provided by people who crowd its periphery .
Microsoft is an almost ideal example , because users are dependent on its products in order to function in cooperation with each other .
Businesses often require Windows and Word , for instance , because other businesses use them ( the network effect ) and each customer ’s own history is self - accessible only through Microsoft ’s formats .
At the same time , users spend a huge amount of time on such things as virus abatement and glitch recovery .
The connectivity offered by Microsoft is valuable enough to offset the hassle .
Traditional stock markets , or even flea markets , are a little like Antigoras , in that they are also private meeting places for business .
One obvious difference resulting from the digital quality of the Antigora is a far stronger network effect ; Antigoras enjoy natural monopoly status more often than physical marketplaces because it would be almost impossible for locked - in participants to choose new Antigoras .
Another defining characteristic is the way that people are connected with the value they produce in an Antigora .
Much of the efforts of individuals at the periphery of an Antigora do not officially take place .
Their work is performed anonymously .
The reason is that the owner of an Antigora is powerful enough to get away with the enjoyment of this luxury .
The potential to deny access to a locked - in digital structure gives owners a profoundly valuable “ narrows of trade . ”
As with any abstraction , there is no perfect actual Antigora , any more than there is any other perfect instantiation of an economic model .
Amazon and eBay are what might be called half - Antigoras , or Semigoras .
They benefit from the enhanced network effect of digital systems , and an extraordinarily high level of volunteer labor from their customers , in the form of general communications and design services .
They differ from perfect Antigoras because , A ) Customer volunteer labor is not given anonymously , and B ) Physical goods are usually the ultimate items being sold , so they are not locked - in .
A book sold on eBay or Amazon can easily escape the system and be sold later in a physical flea market .
Wal - Mart is another interesting example of a Semigora .
It is a traditional retail store from a customer ’s point of view , but it has also engaged an enormous worldwide Web of suppliers into a proprietary digital information system .
It enjoys the enhanced network effects of digital systems , and is able to demand that suppliers adapt to its digital structures instead of vice versa .
If Google maintains its success in the long term , it will do so as an Antigora , but it is n’t there yet .
The services it offers thus far , which are essentially advertising placements , are not dependent on digital lock - in .
Someone else could still come up with a way to offer ads in a way that trumps Google .
It is only once new digital structures are built on top of Google ’s structures that Google can leverage the full power of the Antigora .
My guess is that Google will become an Antigora within a year or two .
Some other examples of Antigoras are Oracle and Apple ’s iTunes / iPod business .
The Internet and the Web would be fabulous Antigoras if they were privately owned .
A hypothesis I have entertained from time to time holds that private layers of locked - in software are always dependent on public layers .
There could be no Google without an Internet .
It ’s interesting to note that many of the public or pseudo - public layers , such as HTML and LINUX , arose in a European context , where the ideal of the Agora is more influential than in the USA .
I should make it clear that I am not “ antigoraphobic ” , and indeed have made use of many of the ones I ’ve mentioned here in order to perform the task of writing this essay .
They are part of life .
Indeed there are reasons to like Antigoras .
The Linux community is an attempt to nurture an Agora in what has become a traditional Antigora niche .
The Linux project is only a partial success , in my estimation .
It is able to generate digital plumbing that gains a following and gets locked in , but the Linux market is poor at generating high quality user interfaces or end - user experiences .
These things perhaps require some degree of privileged authorship , and the owner of an Antigora is a super - privileged author .
If that author , by the grace of fate , happens to have good taste , as in the case of Steve Jobs , an Antigora can deliver extraordinary value .
The phenomenon of Antigoras exemplifies the intimate and unprecedented relationship between capitalism and digital information .
Because of the magic of Moore ’s Law and the network effect , the Invisible Hand has come to be understood not just as an ideal distributor , smarter than any possible communist central committee , but as a creative inventor outracing human wits .
At the same time , tiny situational advantages , particularly related to timing and code compatibility , are amplified by the exponential growth environment of the Net in such a way that unusual figures can suddenly emerge as successful entrepreneurs .
A recent example at the time of this writing is the Baltic crew who started Skype on a shoestring , although it ’s still too early to say which firm will win this Antigora prize .
The resistance of digital brittleness to interventions by governments , together with the possibility that any clever person can strike it rich with minimal starting capital by being in the right place at the right time to plant the seed that grows a new Antigora , has caused libertarianism to be the house philosophy of the digital revolution .
How much efficiency are digital systems actually introducing into human affairs ?
By an engineering standard , not as much as some of us old - timers once hoped for .
( Am I an old - timer ?
When I was 40 , which was five years ago , a Stanford undergraduate expressed amazement that I , the classic figure , was still alive . )
The unreliability and quirkiness of computer systems , which result directly from the brittle quality of software , snatch away many of the gifts that would otherwise flow from them .
Every computer user spends astonishingly huge and increasing amounts of time updating software patches , visiting help desks , and performing other frustratingly tedious , ubiquitous tasks .
But at the same time , there are unquestionable efficiencies , large and small , which result not so much from computer systems working as advertised , but from the Antigora effect , in which vast human resources are applied without charges recorded on the same ledger in order to create the illusion that they are working as advertised .
This is almost as good !
Considered as a trend , the Antigora suggests fascinating potential future trajectories .
At a geopolitical level , we face the following emergent melodrama .
America wants to just manipulate bits .
India wants to run the help desks to descramble those bits .
China wants to build the physical computers that hold the bits .
I ’ll now sketch one way this casting lineup might play out in this century .
Perhaps it will turn out that India and China are vulnerable .
Google and other Antigoras will increasingly lower the billing rates of help desks .
Robots will probably start to work well just as China ’s population is aging dramatically , in about twenty years .
China and India might suddenly be out of work !
Now we enter the endgame feared by the Luddites , in which technology becomes so efficient that there are n’t any more jobs for people .
But in this particular scenario , let ’s say it also turns out to be true that even a person making a marginal income at the periphery of one of the Antigoras can survive , because the efficiencies make survival cheap .
It ’s 2025 in Cambodia , for instance , and you only make the equivalent of a buck a day , without health insurance , but the local Wal - Mart is cheaper every day and you can get a robot - designed robot to cut out your cancer for a quarter , so who cares ?
This is nothing but an extrapolation of the principle Wal - Mart is already demonstrating , according to some observers .
Efficiencies concentrate wealth , and make the poor poorer by some relative measures , but their expenses are also brought down by the efficiencies .
According to this view , the poor are only screwed up in the long term by things like health care or real estate , which Wal - Mart and its ilk do not sell .
( In fact , it has been pointed out by the editors that Wal - Mart is beginning to offer medical care , and I have no doubt the firm will find a way to address the real estate crunch sometime in the future .
Perhaps customers can live in little pods in the big box stores . )
Now we are moved by the logic of the scenario from Luddite eschatology to the prophecy of H.G. Wells ’
Time Machine .
The super - rich who own the Antigoras become so fabulously wealthy that in the context of changing biomedical and other technologies they effectively become a new species .
Perhaps they become the immortals , or they merge with their machines .
Unlike the Wells story , though , the lumpenproletariat do not revolt because their cost of living has retreated faster than their wages .
From their local perspective they are doing better and better , even as the gap between them and the rich is growing at an accelerating rate .
The poor might eventually become immortals or whatever as well , but at a different time , and inevitably in a different way .
It ’s a little like a cross between Adam Smith and Albert Einstein ; the Invisible Hand accelerating towards the Speed of Light .
Each participant has a local frame in which their observations make sense , but their means to perceive each other are altered .
I have written the above scenario as a farce , because if software stays brittle , there will be a huge dampening effect on any hyper - speed takeoff plans of the digital elite .
We will still need those help desks in India , and they will be able to charge well for their services .
The wild card is the core nature of software .
If someone can figure out a way to get rid of brittleness , then the scenario I sketched becomes possible , or even normative .
( Do n’t believe every computer scientist who claims to already know how to get rid of brittleness .
It ’s a hard problem that perversely yields a lot of promising partial results that are ultimately useless , fooling many
researchers . )
I have tried to present a summary of some of the hot Net topics of the moment by building on a foundation of what I believe are key enduring ideas , like brittleness and Antigoras .
But the most important potential of the Net as I understand it is not discussed much these days .
As I stated at the beginning , the Web and the Net are above all unfoldings of digital software as we know how to create it .
Now consider that to an alien , a digital program is not a program at all , but random markings .
As it happens , the more efficient a digital coding scheme is , the more random it appears to someone who is not given a perfect and complete decoding manual .
That ’s why the NSA and genomics research have brobdingnagian budgets and why neural firing patterns in the brain still appear random to researchers .
A tree does fall in a forest if no one hears it , but only because someone will be affected somehow by some other aspect of its falling .
Digital information does n’t ever exist unless it ’s decoded .
A program without a computer to run it does not exist .
This might sound like an extreme claim .
After all , perhaps some computer might come along in the future that can run a seemingly orphaned program .
But recall the problem of digital brittleness .
The match between programs and the environment in which a program runs , which is made mostly of layers of locked - in software , must be perfect .
Every program is therefore mortal , lasting only so long as its environment remains perfect .
The odds against an environment re-appearing once it is lost are astronomical .
That is why NASA , for instance , cannot read much of its own digital data .
Software does not exist as a free - standing entity .
This idea can be restated in political or economic terms :
Brittle software can only run , and can therefore only exist , with the backing of Antigoras .
There must be large numbers of people tweaking the global system of digital devices so that the bits in the various pieces of software remain functional and meaningful .
A market economy can only work if these people at the Antigora peripheries , like you and I , are n’t usually paid much for this service , because otherwise the software would appear to be too expensive to operate .
In this sense , the digital economy could be said to resemble a slave economy in the abstract , but one in which almost everyone spends some time as a slave .
By contrast , the content aspect of the Web is an example of a gift economy , in that a contribution is usually identified with the person who gave it , and therefore there is some relationship between motivation and individual identity .
My argument in brief is that the gift economy aspect is so good that we put up with the slave economy aspect .
A fully anonymous version of potlatch would n’t work , because there would be no collective memory of what anyone had done , and therefore no motivation for any particular continued behavior .
In a slave economy , by contrast , the slave is motivated by the relationship with the master , not the market .
In order to use a PC , a user must spend a lot of time on twiddly nonsense , downloading the latest virus killer and so on .
There is no recognition for this effort , nor is there much individual latitude in how it is to be accomplished .
In an Antigora , the participants at the periphery robotically engage in an enormous and undocumented amount of mandatory drudgery to keep the Antigora going .
Digital systems as we know how to make them could not exist without this social order .
There is an important Thoreau - like question that inevitably comes up :
What ’s the point ?
The common illusion that digital bits are free - standing entities , that would exist and remain functional even if there were no people around to use them , is unfortunate .
It means that people are denied the epiphany that the edifice of the Net is precisely the generosity and warmth of humanity connecting with itself .
The most technically realistic appraisal of the Internet is also the most humanistic one .
The Web is neither an emergent intelligence that transcends humanity , as some ( like George Dyson ) have claimed , nor a lifeless industrial machine .
It is a conduit of expression between people .
This perception seems to me not only beautiful , but necessary .
Any idea of the human future based only on amplifying some parameter or other of human capability inevitably leads to disaster or , at best , disappointment .
Take just one current example :
If a lot of people get rich in a society , eventually some nasty people will get rich .
Some of them will use their wealth to do nasty things , like sponsor terrorist activities .
In a world with a lot of rich people , the risk of terrorism will be set by the worst of them , not the best , or even the average , unless there is a process to prevent that from happening .
But what can that process be ?
If it restricts personal freedom , then the core ideal of widespread wealth acquisition is defeated .
If everyone must conform , what was the point of growing rich ?
There is a little philosophy book by James P. Carse called Finite and Infinite Games that suggests a way out .
( By the way , much of the book strikes me as silly in a “ New Age ” way , but that does not detract from the validity of its central point . )
According to Carse , there are two kinds of games .
A finite game is like a game of basketball ; it has an end .
An infinite game is like the overall phenomenon of basketball , which can go on forever .
A race to maximize any parameter , such as wealth , power , or longevity , must eventually come to an end .
Even if the ceiling seems far , far away , there is an inevitable sense of claustrophobia in singular ambition .
The alternative to the finite game of enhancement along a single dimension is found in the infinite process of culture .
Culture can always grow more meaningful , subtle , and beautiful .
Culture has no ceiling .
It is a process without end .
It is open and hopeful .
I hope I have demonstrated that the Net only exists as a cultural phenomenon , however much it might be veiled by an illusion that it is primarily industrial or technical .
If it were truly industrial , it would be impossible , because it would be too expensive to pay all the people who maintain it .
It ’s often forgotten that the Web grew suddenly big in the year before it was discovered by business .
There were no charismatic figures , no religious or political ideologies , no advertising , no profit motive ; nothing but the notion that voluntary , high quality connection between people on a massive scale was a good idea .
This was real news , a new chapter in the unveiling of human potential .
There is an interesting way in which a connection - oriented view of the Net also addresses the future of security .
There is no way for a high quality security agency to have enough spies to watch the whole of humanity .
As soon as you have that many spies , you ’ll end up with some corrupt ones .
On the other hand , a highly connected world in which everybody sees a little of everybody can provide enough eyeballs to achieve a valid sense of security .
This will require a compromise between open and closed net architectures , as described earlier , and will not be easy to achieve .
But it seems to me to be not only possible , but the unique potential solution .
Culture , including large - scale volunteer connection and boundless beautiful invention , has been somewhat forgotten because of the noisy arrival of capitalism on the Net in the last decade and a half or so .
When it comes to digital systems , however , capitalism is not a complete system onto itself .
Only culture is rich enough to fund the Antigora .
The Iraqi government is in danger of being brought down by the wholesale smuggling of the nation 's oil and other forms of corruption that together represent a " second insurgency " , according to a senior US official .
Stuart Bowen , who has been in charge of auditing Iraq 's faltering reconstruction since 2004 , said corruption had reached such levels that it threatened the survival of the state .
" There is a huge smuggling problem .
It is the No 1 issue , " Mr Bowen told the Guardian .
The pipelines that are meant to take the oil north have been blown up , so the only way to export it is by road .
" That leaves it vulnerable to smuggling , " he said , as truckers sell their cargoes on the black market .
Mr Bowen , the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction ( Sigir ) , cites Iraqi figures showing that the " virtual pandemic " of corruption costs the country $ 4bn ( £ 2.02 bn ) a year , and some of that money goes straight to the Iraqi government 's enemies .
A US government report has concluded that oil smuggling abetted by corrupt Iraqi officials is netting insurgents $ 100 m a year , helping to make them financially self - sustaining .
" Corruption is the second insurgency , and I use that metaphor to underline the seriousness of this issue , " Mr Bowen said .
" The deputy prime minister , Barham Saleh , told Sigir this summer that it threatens the state .
That speaks for itself . "
The Bush administration 's strategy in Iraq hinges on the survival of the government run by Nuri al - Maliki , despite US reservations about the prime minister 's readiness or ability to confront extremists in his own Shia community .
But Mr Bowen 's office has found that the insurgents and militias have also been abetted by US incompetence .
A recent audit by his inspectors found that more than 14,000 guns paid for out of US reconstruction funds for Iraqi government use could not be accounted for .
Many could be in the hands of insurgents or sectarian death squads , but it will be almost impossible to prove because when the US military handed out the guns it noted the serial numbers of only about 10,000 out of a total of 370,000 US - funded weapons , contrary to defence department regulations .
Jim Mitchell , a Sigir spokesman , said : " The practical effect is that when a weapons cache is found you 're deprived of the intelligence of knowing if they were US - provided , which might allow you to follow the trail to the bad guys . "
Mr Bowen 's inspectors are among the few US civilian officials who still venture beyond the fortified bounds of the Green Zone in Baghdad into the rest of Iraq , to see how $ 18bn of American taxpayers ' money is being spent .
Much of the money has been wasted .
Sigir officials have referred 25 cases of fraud to the justice department for criminal investigation , four of which have led to convictions , and about 90 more are under investigation .
A culture of waste , incompetence and fraud may be one legacy the occupiers have passed on to Iraq 's new rulers more or less intact .
Mr Bowen 's office found that nearly $ 9bn in Iraqi oil revenues could not be accounted for .
The cash was flown into the country in shrink - wrapped bundles on military transport planes and handed over by the ton to Iraqi ministries by the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) run by Paul Bremer , a veteran diplomat .
The money was meant to demonstrate the invaders ' good intentions and boost the Iraqi economy , which Mr Bremer later insisted had been " dead in the water " .
But it also fuelled a cycle of corruption left over from Saddam Hussein 's rule .
" We know it got to the Iraqis , but we do n't know how it was used , " Mr Bowen later told Congress .
In the Hillah region a defence department contract employee and two lieutenant colonels were found to have steered $ 8 m in contracts to a US contractor in return for bribes .
The Pentagon contract employee , Robert Stein , pleaded guilty earlier this year , admitting he and his co-conspirators received more than $ 1 m in cash , help with laundering the funds , jewellery , cars and sex with prostitutes .
Stein also admitted that they simply stole $ 2 m from the construction fund , accounting for the money with receipts from fictitious construction companies .
Hillah just happened to be the district Mr Bowen 's inspectors examined in depth .
It is still far from clear how much reconstruction money has gone missing around the whole country .
A potentially far more serious problem has been the way the US government decided to give out reconstruction contracts .
It split the economy into sectors and shared them out among nine big US corporations .
In most cases the contracts were distributed without competition and on a cost - plus basis .
In other words the contractors were guaranteed a profit margin calculated as a percentage of their costs , so the higher the costs , the higher the profits .
In the rush to get work started the contracts were signed early in 2004 .
In many cases work did not get under way until the year was nearly over .
In the months between , the contractors racked up huge bills on wages , hotel bills and restaurants .
According to a Sigir review published in October , Kellogg , Brown and Root ( a subsidiary of Halliburton , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former company ) was awarded an oil industry repair contract in February 2004 but " direct project activity " did not begin until November 19 .
In that time KBR 's overhead costs were nearly $ 53 m .
In fact more than half the company 's $ 300 m project costs from 2004 - 06 went on overheads , the audit found .
Iraq also represented a grey zone beyond the reach of the US civil courts .
KBR was found to have overcharged the US military about $ 60 m for fuel deliveries , but that did not stop it winning more government contracts .
A California company , Parsons , had its contract terminated this year after it was found to have finished only six of more than 140 primary healthcare centres it was supposed to build , after two years work and $ 500 m spent .
However , the contract was ended " for convenience " , meaning Parsons was paid in full .
In a police college Parsons built for $ 75 m in Baghdad the plumbing was so bad that urine and excrement rained down from the toilets on to the police cadets .
Parsons left a sub - contractor to do repairs but in general there is little punitive action that can be taken for shoddy work .
Part of the reason big US contractors have been able to get away with so much is that there has been limited proper supervision .
CPA employees were picked not for their financial expertise but for their political loyalty .
Mr Bowen would have passed the test .
He campaigned for George Bush in Texas and was one of the small army of Republican lawyers called in to Florida in 2000 to oversee the vote recounts on Mr Bush 's behalf .
When he started the job in March 2004 few expected he would do anything to embarrass the administration .
However , Mr Bowen has emerged as the scourge of the big corporations who are among the Republican party 's biggest donors .
Earlier this year a clause extending his mandate was stripped from a military spending bill just before a vote .
Sigir , however , seems to have been saved by the Democratic victory in last month 's elections .
Mr Bowen bristles at the suggestion that Mr Bush might have had a hand in the attempt to close his office .
" I 'm doing exactly what the president expects me to do , " he said .
クイックソートの話で書いたとおり、相変わらず
Excel - VBA と格闘する日々が続いております・・・orz
「 大企業にありがちな問題。委託開発の甘い罠・・・」でも書いたとおり、今まで外注して作ったソフトウェアってほぼ

さて、いままで見てきたイケてないプログラムのダメソースに共通して言えることが３点ありまして、
DRY ( Do n’t Repeat Yourself )
でない。同じもしくは似たソースのコピペが至る所に散在する。
ロジックに無駄が多すぎ。行き当たりばったりで作った感、満点。
アルゴリズム知らなさすぎ。馬鹿ループ処理で時間かかりすぎ。

のいずれか、もしくは全部が当てはまります。大抵は全部ですね。こういったソースが納品されると、センス無いなぁ〜と思っちゃうわけ。こういうは案の定、要求する処理時間を大幅に上回っていたりバグが多かったりします・・・。
さて、今回外注したソフトウェアのキモとなる部分の１つとして、データの組合せ問題を解くロジックとソートの問題がありました。ソートについては、「再帰処理のクイックソート vs 非再帰処理のクイックソート」で記述したので、そちらを見て頂くとして、組合せ問題もなかなかにキワモノのコードが書かれていました。
ってか、データの組合せ問題を解くロジックがアホでして、
億単位の組み合わせ生成 → バブルソート → データのフィルタリン グ
データのフィルタリング → 限定された組み合わせ生成 → クイックソー ト
ってかかれていたのですが、コレではループ処理が発散して１日たっても結果は帰ってきません。だろ、普通はと思ったりします。あり得ない・・・
さて、順列と組合せは高校で習う数学の問題なので、殆どの方は一度は経験していると思われますが、実際プログラムの中でお目にかかることは少ないと思います。
取りあえず 、Perl で実装してみましょう 。CPAN には 、Algorithm :: Permute っていうモジュールがありまして、XS で書かれていて非常高速ですが、今回は頭の体操と言うことで、生

Abstract for Haskellers :
This is a long , involved defense of purity , both in terms of what it affords us in terms of power and in how it enforces “ good ” programming practices .
Haskell is often defined in terms of what it cannot do : variables can’t be changed once declared , the results of IO computations can’t directly be used in functions , execution flow ca n’t be controlled , etc .
While this characterization is strictly correct , it paints a rather ascetic , when not outright negative , outlook of the language that practitioners not only know to be misleading , but also to be the key to the great power latent in functional programming .
We discuss how and why certain “ restrictive ” features have become succesful in computer programming while others have n’t , and procceed to explain referential transparency and what it affords us .
Finally , we conclude that adopting this particular set of “ restrictive ” features is useful and positive , even in contrast with the experience of non-useful “ restrictions ” that seem to have common characteristics .
Abstract for non-Haskellers :
This essay explains why Haskell is cool .
Inconvenience - oriented languages and “ proper ” programming practices
A few days ago , concatenative programming advocates in # factor argued that the main benefit of stack - based languages is that they enforced constant refactoring because managing large stacks is rather inconvenient .
This rather zen - like approach to self - restrain as the path to enlightenment might still offend those enamored with the real programmer mythos of wizardly power , but self - restrain tactics have been popular in the pursuit of better programming at least since the days of “ Goto considered harmful ” and structured - block programming .
While there is n’t a formal calculus of while / for / break structured - block programming ( at least to my knowledge ) , its benefits seem intuitive : by abstracting away common if - p - then - goto control structures , less repetitive , fluffy flow control code is written and it ’s easier to spot the actual program logic in the raw unordered source code .
In other words , while / for / break structured - block patterns enforce separating the concerns of flow control from program logic : irrelevant ‘ counter ’ variables are often hidden , automatically created or declared in the context of flow control statements , and program logic is sandwiched between these collapsed flow control pattern notations .
This is different from the “ gotta - factor - or - will - go-nuts ” approach concatenative programming advocates seem to be emphasizing .
Stack - based programming functions ( “ words ” ) are merely lego pieces of code that are referenced by a short name ; that they always work in any context , in spite of the fragile appearance of this method is a virtue of the RPN approach to computing , something that ’s been very popular in hand calculators .
It intuitively feels “ weaker ” than the previous example .
But what precisely makes this inferior to the structured - block approach ?
Structured - block patterns allows for an approach to inconvenience - oriented programming we could call the “ Pascal approach ” .
Basically , Pascal removes gotos and one is forced to use structured - block statements .
What that entails is that programmers are inconvenienced away from using “ spaghetii ” flow control ( the Bad Practice the Pascal approach seeks to remove ) and into adopting the standard while / for / break “ calculus ” — IIRC , Pascal does n’t even have “ break ” , a tell - tale sign that Nick Wirth might have fantasized about 18th - century mathematicians wearing stiletto heels and a riding crop at some point .
The fact that modern so - called structured languages do n’t bother to remove the goto statement — and yet it is seldom used — is a witness to the fact that inconvenience is really more of a culture shock meant to induce rapid change away from the Bad Practice than an essential part of not indulging in “ guilty productive pleasures ” !
What happens in concatenative languages is different .
In a sense , the complexity of running long stack - based code in your head might be regarded , in the terms defined for the Pascal approach , as a strategy to inconvenience programmers away from the Bad Practice ( entire programs written as one long subroutine ) and into dividing their code in glance - sized pieces that can be individually grokked .
The problem with this is that there seems to be no proper “ calculus ” of correct strategies to writing code being given in exchange for the great inconvenience of writing stack - based code .
That is , stack - based programs tend to be highly - factored not because programmers were persuaded , maybe with a little use of force , that it ’s a better approach , but because it ’s just impossible to do it another way .
Programmers are inconvenienced away from the Bad Practice of one - subroutine code into well , whatever gets them through the night .
This might have been important in the days of Forth , when Real Programmers roamed the land chewing tobacco and stealing horses , but what sense does it make nowadays , when programmers are educated from the get - go into trying to do things in a somewhat structured fashion , not only with structured - block patterns but also objects and classes ?
These two case studies seem to indicate that inconvenience - oriented programming is a Bad Practice in language design that might indicate that you do n’t really have a solution for the Bad Practice you ’re trying to inconvenience people away from , and good Alternative Practices do n’t need to be imposed by language design to be succesful .
Haskell ’s purity and BDSM
You give me the reason
you give me control
I gave you my purity
and my purity you stole
Did you think I would n’t recognize
this compromise ?
Am I just too stupid to realize
this compromise ?
Grey would be the colour
if I had a heart
( Nine Inch Nails , “ Ringfinger ” )
The result of this case study comparison does seem to spell bad news for Haskell , which seems to attempt to enforce ‘ proper ’ programming practices as suggested by a much better theoretical calculus basically by removing the ability to write code outside that calculus .
This particular point is raised often by advocates of quasipure languages like Dylan , Lua and Erlang .
It could be right , at least to a point , if it was n’t for the sheer depth and strength of the formal calculus behind Haskell — and how important it is to why functional programming matters anyway .
Let us spell this out for non-Haskellers , in hope of reaching a wider audience .
The principal sense in which we can call Haskell “ pure ” is in that it ’s referentially transparent : any calls to a given object always mean the same regardless of context .
This is true of all Haskell objects : types , type classes , functions and modules .
This is even true , for a wide range of meanings of “ mean ” and “ the same ” for functions that by definition are supposed to return different values everytime , like getChar or a random number generator .
Haskellers and interested outsiders alike know , at least on a name basis , the ‘ magic ’ that allows referential transparency to be strictly kept in all corners of Haskell even in the need of ‘ awkward ’ ( from a pure standpoint ) needs like I/O , concurrency , exceptions and foreign - language calls .
One of the key researchers in the Haskell community has even written a tutorial on how this is managed in a purely functional setting with monads ; beginners interested in a more superficial view of how monads model the I/O problem can consult the excellent step - by - step construction of the IO monad by Bulatz .
I shall not spend time explaining how monads solve the problem of having mutable objects of various forms in a referentially transparent context .
One should note , as an important sidenote , that monads are not a rigged - up hack enabling this , but an abstract mathematical concept that happens to apply to this problem in Haskell , as well to a few other Haskell concepts — like lists and Maybe types ; recent research on co-monads ( the categorical dual to monads ) by both high academics and rapid - fire math hackers shows that this business of importing abstract mathematics is useful for many other contexts , like generalized cellular automata and signal processing in a jaw - dropping general fashion .
There are two facts , one formally provable and one perceived here to be contrasted here .
The hard fact is that even awkward corners of programming that make other functional languages ( like * MLs and Erlang ) bend over and accept some impurity are in fact managed in a ‘ pure ’ ( read ‘ referentially transparent ’ ) environment in Haskell by the use of monads .
The perceived fact is that this ammounts in practice to making code - jockeys jump through hoops to get the tasks in the ‘ awkard squad ’ accomplished in the programming model enforced by Haskell ’s lack of certain features like destructive updates .
If one is to accept the ‘ perceived ’ fact , the hard fact seems to imply that Haskell is solidly in the “ RPN languages enforce code refactoring ” ground of bondage - and - discipline enforcing practices programmers would rather not use if a way out was available .
The perception that monadic IO entails “ jumping through hoops ” is arguably an artifact of the sheer culture shock between programmers trying to get things done quickly and computer scientists trying to prove formal theories of program calculation .
We shall dispute this notion later ; for now , I want to spend some time reviewing what it is that this referential transparency gives us in exchange for the removed features .
What purity affords us , part 1 : Declarativeness
First of all , there ’s lazy evaluation .
While laziness in an impure context is conceptually possible , its results would be “ mighty interestin ’ “ , as humorously put by Matthew Daniels in the #haskell IRC channel .
Lazy evaluation in a nutshell means that computations are only done as needed ; an expression like let bignum = product [ 1..10^9 ] in 1+1 , if strictly evaluated , would take a long time to run and might even overflow the stack ; under lazy evaluation , the useless computation of bignum is never done , since it ’s not needed .
Evidently , lazy evaluation in a non-referentially transparent environment would be virtually chaotic : programs could yield different , unpredictable results .
The fact is that there are n’t any lazy , non-referentially transparent languages , and for the reasons outlined above there ca n’t be any useful languages that are so .
My cannonical example of why lazy evaluation is critical in writing very complex code in a manageable fashion is the CA comonad , but simpler examples can be built around infinite lists .
Basically , what lazy evaluation brings to the table is that data - generating functions can be written abstractly , manipulated implicitly and computed only as actual results are requested .
I ’ve been trying to eschew specific examples so far , but it becomes useful here .
Take the Fibonacci sequence .
As explained in the popular tutorials , a simple one - liner that returns it is
fibs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+ ) fibs ( tail fibs )
If one attempts to call fibs directly , by typing “ fibs ” into an interactive environment or writing a main function that ’s simply main = print fibs , the computer will simply print the Fibonacci numbers indefinitely , until someone presses Ctrl - C or the computer dies after its years of useful service :
Prelude > fibs
[ 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946,17711,28657,46368,75025^C
Interrupted .
An infinite loop could have been written in an imperative , strict environment almost as simply :
x : = 1
y : = 1
print " [ 1,1 , "
while ( True ) {
x1 := y
y := x + y
x := x1
print y
print " , "
}
The fibs function we have defined is nevertheless much more manipulable .
Let ’s say we want new structures that respectively return the squares of Fibonacci numbers , the offset - by - one Fibonacci numbers and even the difference between these two :
squarefibs = map ( ^2 ) fibs
nextfibs = tail fibs
diff_fibs = zipWith ( -) squarefibs nextfibs
Each one of these examples becomes progressively more complicated using the imperative , strict pseudocode above .
An infinite diff_fibs becomes unmanageable in the absence of sophisticated coroutine control flow structures that are both rare in mainstream languages and hard to use .
The cellular automata comonad takes this to the next level by defining comonadic datastructures that are infinite in two different directions ( think Conway ’s game of life , where individual cells ’ state depends on the state of its neighbours ) and which can nevertheless be transformed as simply as above by defining its mathematical structure in a way not too different from the way we have defined the Fibonacci sequence .
As a cherry in the top of the cake , we can just pick and choose what elements of the infinite data structures we want if we wish :
five_diffs = take 5 diff_fibs
This simple example hacked up in five lines of Haskell code ( defining respectively fibs , squarefibs , nextfibs , diff_fibs and five_diffs ) would be incredibly more involved — there ’s a Perl golf competition waiting to happen here — and moreover reusing code from “ fibs ” to “ squarefibs ” and so on until “ diff_fibs ” would just not happen .
Just imagine what can be done with more involved mathematical structures and an actual computer programmer doing them .
This style of programming ( defining data in abstract terms and manipulating them as mathematical objects ) is often called “ declarative programming ” ; I like to call it DWIM ( do what I mean ) programming , but this is a little misleading , since Haskell understands only very strict mathematical definitions and has n’t ( yet ) evolved to the point where it understands the vast , dark , little - understood space of human desire .
Haskell is n’t a psychoanalist yet , but I ’m sure it wo n’t take us long .
What purity affords us , part 2 : Program Transformation
We ’ve seen that referential transparency affords us writing blocks of code as mathematical structures that can be later be transformed .
The second thing that purity affords us is that entire programs are mathematical structures themselves and can be manipulated not only in the sense above but also in that theorems satisfied by specific functions can be employed to optimize code — not anymore in the heuristic - working - in - the - dark sense of ordinary optimizing compilers , but in the sense of understanding the actual structure to be done .
This is probably what motivated the research program of program construction calculi in first place .
There ’s a good review of program construction calculi papers in the first pages of Functional Programming with Bananas , Lenses , Envelopes and Barbed Wire , followed by a calculus that ’s quite close to what Haskell is today .
Basically , a program construction calculus ( of which the while / for / break “ calculus ” could be considered an informal instance , if some requirements are dropped ) is a theory of how a program can be built out of well - formed “ lego pieces ” with well - understood mathematical properties .
For example , where an imperative language would apply functions to every element of a list - like data structure as follows ,
function double ( list ) {
newlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newlist.append(2*list [i ] ) ;}
return ( newlist )
}
function square ( list ) {
newlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newlist.append(list[i ] ^2 ) ;}
return ( newlist )
}
a functional language can employ higher - order functions and define a “ map ” function that allows one to say just
double = map ( 2* )
square = map ( ^2 )
Years of research have improved the theory of such program - construction ‘ blocks ’ like map , reduce / foldr , etc. to the point where there ’s a mature calculus where we know many theorems — invariant properties that can be always applied — about these blocks that can be employed in practice .
For example , a simple theorem about “ map ” is
where m is map .
Since Haskell compilers know about this theorem — theorems like that have been developed for a class of program construction blocks large enough to build anything in a large class of data - structures — code like
doublesquares list = double ( square list )
is automatically “ fused ” so not to construct the entire data structure and iterate through everything twice , composing just the mapped function as god intended .
This kind of optimization is pervasive in modern Haskell compilers .
Translating this to an imperative setting , this mean a compiler knows how to transform code like
x = double ( square ( list ) )
which would be evaluated into
newlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newlist.append(list[i ] ^2 ) ;}
newnewlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newnewlist.append(2*newlist [ i ] ) ;}
into code like
x = doublesquare ( list )
where
function doublesquare ( list ) {
newlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newlist.append(2*list[i ] ^2 ) ;}
}
All this is done automagically !
Again , as the proverbial cherry on the top of the cake , Philip Wadler has proven that
From the type of a polymorphic function we can derive a theorem that it satisfies .
How far we have come from the “ programming is giving a robot a detailed list of instructions ” paradigm !
The whip - cracking sound : what purity enforces
We have , for the two preceding sections , engaged in a starry - eyed tour of what purity affords us that we ca n’t have in the absence of it .
That alone should place the restrictions that referential transparency requires squarely outside the “ dominatrix ” scenario to computer programming where the user ’s toys are taken away so he does things the right way ; giving up destructive updates becomes closer to a doctor advising you to give up trans fats in the name of your health and all the other fun things you can do with a healthy life .
We have , nevertheless , promised to compare the restrictions of the purely - functional model with those of the two other restrictive models mentioned in the first section of this essay — the structured - block and stack - based / word - substitution paradigms .
What we intend to show here is that the programming style enforced by purity falls well into the ‘ good ’ case of better practices arising from prohibiting bad ones we ’ve witnessed before from the rise of structured - block flow control .
Stack - based languages enforce code “ refactoring ” — the structuring of code in self - contained separate blocks — by making managing code too complicated otherwise .
This could also be argued of Haskell , to a point .
Much like Forth and Factor programs are expressed like one long unmanageable stack tower in the absence of words , a Haskell program could be expressed as a long unmanageable chain of lambda forms in the absence of named functions .
That Haskell functions are something much more powerful than Factor words comes straight from the simple examples we ’ve seen before , but let ’s set this aside for a moment .
Haskell does seem to enforce the kind of modularization Factor enforces .
It would , if we did n’t have the where keyword .
“ Where ” blocks have local function definitions and type signatures , and enables you to shoot yourself in the foot all you want .
A stupid Haskell programmer ( or maybe a very smart AI learning how to program by itself ! ) might rewrite the very simple code block
double list = map ( * 2 ) list
square list = map ( ^2 ) list
as
double list = act 2 list where {
act n [ ] = [ ] ;
act n ( x : xs ) = ( n * x ) : act xs ;
}
square list = sprinkle 2 list where {
sprinkle n [ ] = [ ] ;
sprinkle n ( x : xs ) = ( x ^ n ) : sprinkle xs ;
}
and it ’s easy to see how they could screw up ( x :xs ) as well by defining their own “ head ” and “ tail ” functions .
There ’s no stopping human stupidity .
This example shows how a programmer can go out of his way and eschew everything that ’s good and saintly about functional programming if he wants to .
What he ca n’t do , and this is by virtue of purity , is mix stateful code with pure code .
That is , while in the imperative version of print_fibs I/O and actual program logic are completely intermingled ,
function print_fibs ( ) {
x : = 1
y : = 1
print " [ 1,1 , "
while ( True ) {
x1 := y
y := x + y
x := x1
print y
print " , "
}
}
in the Haskell version the I/O logic is almost forcefully separated :
fibs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+ ) fibs ( tail fibs )
print_fibs = print fibs
Part of what forces this problem to be separed into two is the recursive nature of the definition of “ fibs ” ; for a number of other , simpler problems , the mindless programmer can indulge in as much intermingling as he wants
print_doubled num = print ( num * 2 )
and get away with it .
Input is also not that difficult ; a function that reads a number and prints it doubled would be
print_doubled = getChar >>= print . ( * 2 ) . read
which is as intermingled as it gets .
This would not work so simply if we needed a recursive function , for example — unless we appeal to recursive definitions elsewhere , which is forced refactoring happening already .
It also does n’t leave us with a numeric trail ; while in an imperative language
input num
print 2*num
leaves us with a num variable that can be used in later calculations , print_doubled as defined above kills the doubled number .
Complications seem to arise exponentially .
From these code snippets , the kind of “ forced refactoring ” brought up by the whip - cracking sound of purity seems clear : what Haskell is encouraging is separation of concerns , more by the convenience of working in “ straight Haskell ” and not trying to blunder it by intermingling concerns than by the sheer inconvenience of not doing so .
In other words , a very interesting form of refactoring comes up as an artifact of purity .
Pieces of program logic are easily separated — and can be combined in clever and novel ways , like in the monadic combinators .
Flow - control is a non-issue because of laziness , but the kind of computation brought about by flow - control patterns is also easily left abstracted away .
( That the recursive patterns that solve the flow - control problems of structured procedural programming are mostly defined in the standard Prelude is a testimony to the fact that the Haskell designers have sought out to make things easier for us ) .
In one sentence , the whip cracks not for perverted pleasure but for personal growth in learning the practices that make for powerful computer programming .

The interesting parts of this essay are research done by People With Big Brains , Wadlermen and other funny alien races with thought processes that shame us ordinary people .
The uninteresting parts are random musings trying to connect some dots by yours truly , a nosy economist trying to make way into the fascinating world of functional programming .
By now I know more computer programming than I ever would if I had learned it on other languages ; the fact that ordinary people like me can grok how to unleash such great power is a testimony to the long - term positive effects of that cracking whip .
I probably could n’t have written it either without the help of too many denizens of the #haskell IRC channel to mention individually .
They have helped me with my english grammar , confirmed my shaky intuition on many points and encouraged me to go on .
Hey , this weepy acknowledgement list is beginning to sound like it ’s a freaking PhD thesis .
It ’s just a blog post , and it has more to owe to the amazing community around Haskell than to any minor thought - plumbing achievement of the author .
Ok , this is the end .
This is my last sentence .
Important notes and retractions
Apparently a long essay by a nonexpert can’t come out without mistakes and / or blunders .
This is a growing list of them as they ’re pointed out .
Apparently there actually are formal methods for for / while structured - block programming .
Thanks !
Maybe I am giving concatenative languages a bum rap , maybe I ’m not .
The fact is that when I tried to learn Factor , that was they key advantage given .
Addressing Slava , specifically , I ’m sure all the above code snippets could be written in Unlambda or Malbolge , but newbies like me do n’t want to .
I invoke the Colbert - like concept of “ mathiness ” : Factor , Java , etc. are probably amenable to formal analysis like I ’m told structured - block programming is , but Haskell ’s mathematical underpinnings are closer to what simpletons like me grok .
Oh .
Turns out Slava Pestov , who commented before , is the creator of Factor , and is already distilling bile in his own blog .
Maybe if I diss C++ I can get Bjarne Stroustroup visiting here .
Some people seem to be encouraging me to go into full flame mode with him , and I can think of one or two humorous petards , but I think silent enmity better suits his overinflated ego and my own overinflated ego .
Still , I ’m making enemies already , I must be doing something right !
This thread at reddit ellaborates a little further on lazy evaluation , call - by - need evaluation and other nomenclature details .
This has been said
When it comes to life expectancy , the US is far from one nation .
According to a new analysis of health disparities , there are in fact eight Americas – some of them more reminiscent of developing countries than a global superpower .
Life expectancy in the US varies widely by race and socioeconomic status .
Now researchers led by Majid Ezzati of the Harvard School of Public Health have thrown geography into the mix .
They examined death records for people in more than 3000 counties and divided the population into eight groups ac - cording to race , income and geographic location .
Some groups were confined to a relatively small area – Native Americans in the western states , for example .
Another group , labelled “ Middle America ” , was mostly white , fairly wealthy , and accounted for the majority of the population .
There were dramatic differences in life expectancies : in 2001 , urban black male babies could expect to live for just 68.7 years , whereas for Asian females the figure was 86.7 .
Such differences across the “ eight Americas ” have not narrowed over the past two decades ( see graphic ) .

Rural south to inner cities
International comparisons reinforce the picture of a deeply divided country .
When Ezzati examined the probability of dying during youth ( 15 to 44 years ) or middle age ( 45 to 64 ) , the figures for black men – whether in the rural south or inner cities – looked more like those seen in the developing world than in other rich countries .
In contrast , the results for Asians and Middle Americans were similar to those of the UK and Japan .
Income and access to healthcare explained little of the variation .
For instance , poor white people living in the northern plains are similar to those in the Mis- sissippi valley and Appalachia by these measures , yet tend to live longer .
While political conservatives may seize on these results to argue that taxing high earners to improve welfare and healthcare for the poor would be unpro-ductive , Ezzati says that would be a misinterpretation .
“ We ’re not trying to say that broader socioeconomic factors do n’t matter , ” he says .
Indeed , studies controlling for other causes have shown that low income is linked to poor health .
Ezzati is focusing on the conditions that cause early deaths in the low - life - expectancy groups .
These include injuries and cardiovascular disease linked to risk factors such as obesity , tobacco and alcohol .
He believes public health campaigns targeted at particular groups could yield big returns .
Others argue that these may not be enough without stimulating economic development in high - risk communities .

The Big Picture on Microformats
In : Articles
By John Allsopp
Most web developers who read magazines such as Digital Web will be familiar with the term microformats , and might even have played around with hCards or tags .
In fact , way back in November 2005 , Digital Web was among the first to address this subject , publishing a great introduction by Garrett Dimon .
Few really dispute the potential of microformats , but all technologies , no matter their promise , live and die by their adoption .
So , how are microformats faring a year or so after their coming - out party ?
Since microformats are markup , their impact is less obvious than , say , AJAX — whose dynamic visual effects are usually a bit of a giveaway .
It may come as a surprise , then , that the level of adoption by tool developers , publishers , and aggregators is significant , and that you probably visit sites with microformatted content all the time , without even knowing it .
In this article , we ’ll review what people are doing with microformats right now , and finish up by looking at a couple of cool projects that might whet your appetite for microformats ’ future prospects .
Chicken and Egg
I occasionally wonder who bought the first fax machine — what a remarkable act of faith .
The fax illustrates an important phenomenon associated with many technologies — the network effect — where the value of a technology increases the more it is used .
In trying to climb the slippery pole of the network effect , new technologies often face a chicken - or - egg moment .
With microformats , content developers may ask , “ If there are no services that take advantage of microformatted data , why should I use microformats ? ”
Service developers may similarly ask , “ If there is no microformatted data , why should I develop services in the hope it may one day be available ? ”
As I ’m about to demonstrate , microformats have passed this chicken - or - egg moment in a number of areas .
If you are a content developer , a tool developer , or a service developer , using microformats to add semantic markup your content offers significant benefits .
Let ’s take a look at what individuals , open - source projects , major - league content publishers ( such as Yahoo ! ) , and service developers ( such as Technorati ) , are doing right now with microformats .
Development
Most of us now rely on tools to do the heavy lifting for us — whether we use tools like WordPress or Moveable Type for blog posting , or Dreamweaver for design .
While hand - coding microformats is relatively simple , many of the applications we use for markup , web design , and posting have added support for — or have plug-ins for — easily adding microformatted content .
The Web Standards Project Dreamweaver Task Force , in the shape of Drew McLellan , has developed a plug - in for Dreamweaver that makes it easy to add microformatted content to your web pages .
This beta version extension helps Dreamweaver users insert hCard , rel-tag , hCalendar , rel- license , and XFN data into their documents .
WordPress , Moveable Type , Drupal , TextPattern , and other blogging and CMS tools offer plug-ins for adding a variety of microformatted content to blogs and other sites developed with these tools .
A quick search will locate plug-ins to create just about any kind of microformat — reviews , calendaring , tagging , contact details , and more — for many CMS and blogging systems .
Microformats.org also has several stand - alone creators for developing microformatted content .
hCard Creator , hCalendar Creator , and hReview Creator allow you to develop complex microformats — simply enter the necessary information into a web form , and then paste the output right into your source code .
So , whatever your development methods , you ’ll likely find tools to help perform the boring , repetitive tasks — such as translating nice , human - readable dates and times into ISO 8601 format , making microformat creation simple .
Publishing
The earliest adopter phase of microformats — more or less until early this year — saw the majority of microformatted content developed by bloggers .
Tagged content using the rel-tag microformat and XFN are the best examples of this , and , to a lesser extent , contact details using hCard .
The last six months or so has seen the use of microformats tip over into decidedly mainstream situations , including widespread adoption at Yahoo !.
Several Yahoo ! sites , including Tech , Local , Flickr , and Upcoming use various microformats in their publishing .
Both Yahoo !
Tech and Yahoo !
Local use hReview for publishing reviews , while Yahoo !
Local uses hCalendar for events , and hCard for contact details .
Flickr uses hCard for profile information , as well as XFN .
Upcoming.org has more than a million events around the world marked up using hCalendar .
The beauty of many of these services is that while users generate content — for example , reviews — there is no need for these users to know anything about the underlying formats .
The tools do the work of translating the content into the appropriate microformat .
It ’s this significant adoption by publishers that is really driving the huge growth in microformatted content on the web .
Uncorking Microformats
One of the most innovative uses of microformats in the last twelve months has been the recently launched , great - looking Cork ’d , a very Web 2.0 wine - oriented site .
Cork ’d , developed by the well - known author and designer Dan Cederholm of SimpleBits , and Dan Benjamin of Hivelogic , features hReview as the format for wine reviews , hCard for wine reviewers ( anyone can sign up for a free account and review wine ) and rel-tag for “ tasting tags ” ( so reviewers can tag wines by flavor — such as pepper , berry , or moldy sock ) .
Cork ’d is a great model for the simple , elegant use of semantic markup that use of microformats enables .
If you are working on or planning any kind of user - generated site , you ’d be mad not to spend some time looking at what Cork ’d does with microformats .
Aggregators
The real promise of microformats is that they enable decentralized development , content , and services .
Until now , a great many review sites ( such as Amazon book reviews or IMDB movie reviews ) , classified listings , social networking services , and other types of sites have been centralized — locking users and their content into a single service , rarely even providing an API so that developers can do interesting things with all that content .
Think of classifieds sites , such as craigslist or Trading Post , or auction sites such as eBay , all walled gardens , where user - generated data is tightly controlled , and — in many cases — owned by the aggregators .
The recent explosion of map - based mashups shows the promise of what open data can enable when the walls to those gardens are pulled down .
But open data requires standardized formats , such as microformats , to make it useful .
It ’s in this area of aggregators and other decentralized services that the real promise of microformats lies .
Already , Technorati tag searching has demonstrated the power of a simple standard format for tagging content — in the fifteen months leading up to April of this year , tagged posts indexed by Technorati grew from zero to 100 million .
But what ’s happening with other decentralized services using microformats ?
Recently , Technorati took the wraps off their Kitchen , which has a search engine specifically for microformatted content , including events in hCalendar , contact details in hCard , and reviews in hReview — all indexed from around the web .
Now you can search for microformatted content no matter where it is published .
But coupled with this is something even more exciting : Pingerati .
Pingerati passes information about microformatted content on to services that want to index it .
Sites such as Eventful can ping Pingerati to obtain updates for its index of events that are in hCalendar format .
This makes developing distributed services for microformatted content even easier — providing a centralized location for publishers to ping with updates , and indexers to check for new content , much like weblogs.com is available for blogs to ping when they are updated .
This type of distributed service has n’t taken off yet to the extent that publishing microformatted content has ; still , very promising services are already out there .
Edgeio , a classifieds site , aggregates listings in the hListing proposed microformat , rather than forcing you to submit your listings to them .
Edgeio also publishes the listings in this format , and — recognizing that not everyone has a site at which to publish their classifieds — allows you to publish classifieds at their site .
Kritx , though just recently introduced , is an aggregator for reviews published in hReview format , with an approach similar to that of Edgeio .
It can only be a matter of time before aggregators and distributed services for microformatted reviews for restaurants , films , events , resumes , and other content take off .
After all , microformatted content is found more and more often at individual blogs , at niche sites such as Cork’d , and at large scale sites such as Upcoming and other Yahoo ! sites .
It soon may be at your sites , too , if it ’s not there already .
Cool stuff
I recently had the privilege to hear Lars Rasmussen , one of the original developers of Google Maps , speak about building maps .
An interesting part of that story was that they never really thought of people doing mashups , and it took them by surprise .
Now , a significant part of each day is spent looking at map mashups .
In fact , Rasmussen says that an important reason for requiring an API key is so that they can keep track of popular mashups .
Google ’s open approach to allowing others to use their mapping data has created , in effect , a new category of web applications , and let them get the jump on a number of more established , well - resourced mapping applications .
By giving open data on the web simple , established formats , we move one step closer to enabling a whole range of as - yet - unimagined mashups .
h Card Maps Mashups
A couple of cool projects illustrate how to take advantage of these new ways of working with data .
One of the most prolific contributors to microformats the last couple of years has been Brian Suda .
He ’s the co-author of the hCard and hCalendar specifications , a contributor to a lot of the brainstorming associated with other formats , the author of an upcoming O’Reilly PDF book on microformats , and the developer of X2 V .
X2V is an online service that will take a page with , say , an hCard or hCalendar in it , and convert it to vCard or iCalendar format ( the IETF formats on which these are based ) , and , depending on how your system is setup , these will automatically be opened in whatever software you use for reading these formats ( Outlook , iCal , Address Book , etc. ) .
Here ’s a link that will allow you to take a look at this in action — X2V grabs the hCard embedded at Web Directions , converts it to a vCard , and allows you to download it and open it in your address book .
But recently , Brian ’s gone one better with a tool to create Google Maps mashups from hCards containing geodata .
This example locates the hCard at http://suda.co.uk/publications/EuroOSCON06/, which contains geodata — the longitude and latitude for the location of the venue of this event .
The geodata is then converted to Google Maps ’ own XML data format , KML , and is then sent to Google Maps , which displays the location and its name .
It ’s a mashup without any need for Google ’s APIs , and just a hint of the kind of thing people will be doing with open microformatted data .
So , what are you waiting for ?
The network effect tells us that the value of a technology increases the more it is used .
Microformats are rapidly experiencing the benefits of this effect .
Innovative publishers are publishing microformats , while innovative developers have embraced microformats to help build new types of online services .
These innovators have taken the plunge , demonstrating the practical value and the promise of microformats right now .
Even if you are n’t sure about developing with microformats quite yet , why not grab the Tails extension for Firefox , or the FlockTails extension for the Flock browser ?
You ’ll be able to see which sites you visit are making use of hCard , hCalendar , or hReview .
After Tails / FlockTails is installed , take a look at one of the reviews at Cork ’d , or browse some sites at Yahoo !
Tech .
The new microfomats logo in the status bar at the bottom of your browser window will light up when a page contains microformatted content .
Click the logo to get details of all the microformat items on the page .
Whether you are a web developer , content publisher , or service developer , you ’ll be in good company if you consider how the content you publish , the applications you develop , or the services you provide could benefit from utilizing microformats .
Looking for a cool new project ?
Why not aggregate restaurant , movie , book , or other reviews using Edgeio ’s model ?
I ’ll happily sit on your company ’s advisory board .
Microformats have come of age .
So , what are you waiting for ?

Pattern Matching Wrap -Up
by Martin Odersky
July 18 , 2006
Summary
A follow - up on my previous blog on pattern matching , which summarizes the discussions this entailed .
Advertisement
The previous blog In Defense of Pattern Matching has sparked many interesting discussions .
I will try to give a quick wrap - up here .
Besides some technical questions , most comments fell into two categories :
They were wishing for more flexible and abstract schemes how objects can be matched into patterns , or they were proposing a classical object - oriented decomposition with virtual method calls as a better alternative to pattern matching .
More flexible patterns
This was very constructive .
It 's great motivation for us to continue exploring ways to make pattern matching more flexible .
In fact there had been a discussion about this on the Scala mailing list before .
One thing to note here is that current pattern matching already provides quite a bit of flexibility ( this should not imply that we should stop trying to generalize it further ) .
Take , for instance , the prototypical example of points :
case class Point ( x : double , y : double )
One might think this would lock us into a specific implementation of Points with cartesian x/y co-ordinates .
But in fact , we could create a new sub-class of points with polar coordinates :
class PolarPoint ( radius : double , angle : double ) extends Point ( Math.sin( angle ) * r , Math.cos ( angle ) * r )
Even though these points now use internally a polar representation , their pattern matching would be cartesian .
So we see that values returned by pattern matching need not correspond to an object 's internal data representation .
In that sense , encapsulation is preserved .
Multi-methods are a flexible alternative to pattern matching .
They are not present in Scala .
I think multi-methods would be great if they could replace Java 's static overloading , which always seemed a bit ad - hoc to me .
The question is whether one can do this without breaking compatibility with Java in too serious ways .
Maybe the Nice folks have some experience to offer here ?
I have noted that some multi-method designs , such as MultiJava , have both static overloading and multi-methods ; however I fear this would be too confusing for users .
Philosophy Another class of arguments criticized pattern matching on more fundamental grounds .
Basically it goes as follows :
" Sure , pattern matching is a more convenient alternative to Java 's instanceof and type casts .
But all of these techniques are inferior to a proper object - oriented decomposition , where you use virtual methods to differentiate behavior in subclasses . "
I believe this argument is valid in many cases , but not in all .
There are situations where an OO decomposition is not easily doable .
An example that 's right under our noses is the try - catch statement found in Java and many other languages .
In Scala it is written like this :
try { ... } catch { case ex : IOException => " handle io error " case ex : ClassCastException => " handle class cast errors " case ex : _ => " generic recovery " }
Here , every catch clause does a pattern match on the thrown exception ( using a so - called " typed pattern " ) .
In the equivalent Java code this is less obvious but in essence Java catch clauses contain pattern matches as well .
What would the strict OO alternative be ?
To choose the correct handler code we'd have to call a virtual method in the thrown exception .
The problem is that the exception itself does not not " know " how the handler should react to it ; this clearly depends on the context .
It is possible to program around this using the visitor pattern , but the result is clumsy and not easily extensible to new kinds of exceptions .
That 's probably why most languages have opted for exception handling in the pattern - matching style .
There are arguably many more cases where a decomposition from the outside is preferable to a decomposition from the inside using virtual methods .
Cases to watch out for are :
when a computation rule involves several objects , when a computation cannot usefully be defined as a member of the class on which we want to differentiate .
An example of the first kind is the following rule from my term simplification example :
x * l + x * r == x * ( l + r )
The corresponding simplification rule in Scala is :
case Add ( Mul ( x1 , l ) , Mul ( x2 , r ) ) if ( x1 == x2 ) => Mul ( x1 , Add(l , r ) )
An example of the second kind are exception handlers , discussed above .
In summary , I do believe there is a role for pattern matching in object - oriented languages .
But with the added power comes the requirement that programmers now have to choose a style of decomposition .
This can sometimes be difficult .

Two men are due to appear at a court in Johannesburg on Tuesday , accused of raping a five - month - old girl who was discovered covered in blood and in tears .
It is the latest in a series of rapes of baby girls - some of them involving children less than one year - old , which has left South Africans reeling with horror .
Every day the newspapers bring awful revelations : a nine - month - old girl gang - raped by six men ; an eight - month - old raped and left by the roadside .
I do n't know how to take my anger out .
I do n't know why he did this
Mother of abused child
Outside the central Johannesburg magistrates ' court , 200 demonstrators gathered carrying banners with slogans like " child rapists are not human " .
Yet many protesters seem unable to understand why the rapes are happening .
" I do n't have an answer , it 's inhuman , it 's inhuman , " one told me .
Rape statistics from South Africa are so shocking as to be almost unbelievable - women 's rights activists say one South African is raped every 26 seconds .
It is the young who are particularly vulnerable , with the police saying that more teenagers are raped than any other age group .
But even in a country numbed to horrific events , these cases are bewildering to South Africans , and making them question where their society is heading .
Unearthing truth
It is hardly believable - but some think that this is not new , only that a horrible truth is finally being acknowledged
" Actually it 's not a new phenomenon , it 's been something that you hide , you regard it as an embarrassment within the family .
But now people have started to talk , they 've decided that they 've had enough , " a woman protester told me .
A typical story reveals the horror .
On a poor Johannesburg estate , a family of eight sleep in one dirty bedroom .
Last week a neighbour seized the nine year old daughter , showed her pornographic magazines and then raped and indecently assaulted her .
He gave her a few coins , and said sorry .
The little girl needed extensive surgery - her mother and father are inconsolable .
" I 'm very angry , I 'm very angry , I do n't know how to take my anger out .
I do n't know why he did this , he used to come here and play with my children ... " said the mother .
The father said he wanted to hunt down the rapists .
" How many parents ' hearts must be broken ? "
He is not alone in his rage .
Last weekend in Soweto a suspected child rapist was stoned to death .
The government is appealing for calm .
Myths
It is also trying to dispel a widespread rumour - that having sex with a virgin cures Aids .
Traditional healers , or witchdoctors , are blamed for spreading this idea , and encouraging child rape .
A sociologist , Lisa Vetton , draws a parallel with Europe , when child prostitution was rampant " At that time venereal disease like Aids today was incurable .
If you had gonorrhea or syphilis you were going to die .
And exactly the same myth emerged , that sex with a virgin is going to cure you - so it seems like a very old response whenever sex and death are combined .
Suddenly women - girls - get attributed with magical healing powers " .
We must re-educate and empower men

Scientists may have just found out why marijuana impairs memory and why the brain 's natural versions of the drug might help against epilepsy .
The active ingredient of marijuana , THC , is known to impair memory and to bind to areas of the brain linked to memory , such as the hippocampus .
Still , the exact mechanisms by which marijuana impairs memory remain unclear .
Neuroscientists David Robbe and Gyorgy Buzsaki at Rutgers University and their colleagues recorded hippocampus activity in rats .
Normally brain cells in this region often synchronize their electrical activity .
When the researchers injected rats with THC or a related synthetic drug , they found the normally synchronized workings of the hippocampus became disrupted .
While the cells did not change how often they fired nerve impulses , their timing became erratic .
Imagine an orchestra where the musicians are deafened and perhaps blindfolded , Buzsaki said .
" They could still play their own pieces , but without any feedback from the other instruments played by other musicians or the conductor , depending on the nature and the length of the music played , it could be just a bit worse or outright disastrous , even though every note has been played .
What is missing is the temporal coordination , " Buzsaki explained .
This is similar to what the researchers think goes on " in the hippocampal circuits under the influence of marijuana . "
The neuroscientists put rats through a standard test of memory , where the animals had to learn to alternate which direction they went in a maze in order to get water .
As rat hippocampal brain cell activity grew less synchronized under the influence of drugs , the rodents made more mistakes .
This suggests synchronized brain cell activity is crucial for memory formation and hints that THC impairs memory by disrupting this synchronized activity .
The scientists suggest the way THC disrupts synchronized brain cell activity might help fight seizures .
During seizures , brain activity becomes abnormally synchronized .
Prior research suggested the brain 's natural versions of THC , known as endocannabinoids , helped prevent seizures .
Whether or not marijuana is good against epilepsy remains unclear .
Anecdotal reports going back centuries say it can help control seizures , but animal studies reveal it could also provoke fits .
The neuroscientists report their findings in the December issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience .

Column Investment banks and major brokerage firms may or may not be leading the innovation in algorithms for securities trading purposes , but they take the lead in publicising their innovations in this field .
With trashy names reminiscent of graphic comics such as Dagger , Nighthawk , Cobra , Razor and so on , they are rolling these innovations out to their client base .
Deployment of successful algorithms in electronic trading is perceived as an important service to generate deal flow from their trading clients .
Equally , it is yet another component of prime brokerage services , through which major investment banks and brokerage firms generate deal flow from their hedge fund clients .
It should be remembered that Exchanges , ECNs and Multi-lateral Trading Facilities ( MTFs ) provide algorithmic trading capabilities integrated within their order management systems .
These institutions make substantial investment in the quantitative and mathematical skills to create the algorithms as well as the programming skills to provide commercial applications and integrate them into order management and execution systems .
More importantly , these firms are responsible for the gradual adoption of algorithmic trading technology by the buy - side firms .
With the exception of some highly specialised funds with the research and development resources and capabilities , it is highly unlikely that the buy - side would have adopted algorithmic trading technology .
A number of investment banks and brokerage houses claim to be leaders in the field of algorithmic trading capabilities .
The criteria for claiming success for an algorithm are somewhat self - selecting .
They include investment and trading performance , ease of use , accessibility , breadth of use across instruments and asset classes .
How durable are the algorithmic models ?
Are they ephemeral ?
Does wide scale adoption devalue their value ?
Do the innovators keep the “ best inventions ” to themselves , deploying them strictly on their proprietary desks and / or for favoured clients ?
Conscious and concerted development of algorithmic trading models is about five years old , though the activity has been undertaken since the early 1990's but without the technology to give full rein to their commercial scope and application .
As may be expected , comparative measurement of the durable success of algorithmic trading models in different market and trading environments is elusive .
If it has been conducted it has been conducted in private .
Some organisations claim success of their models over a period of time .
It may be logically conjectured that “ unsuccessful ” algorithmic models are quietly dropped while successful models and maintained and , where appropriate , enhanced .
Rather like Official Secrets , it is unlikely that any scientific research on the matter will be published at least until it is merely a matter of historical record .
What can be said is that unsuccessful models have not been so unsuccessful that they have had to be disclosed as publicly attributable to substantial trading losses .
Does wide scale adoption devalue their value ?
Do the innovators keep the " best inventions " to themselves , deploying them strictly on their proprietary desks and / or for favoured clients ?
The “ Algorithmic Arms Race ” has now reached a stage where there are two distinct business models that drive the development of algorithmic trading capabilities .
The first is driven by the quest for cost reduction , operational and trading efficiencies .
These are themselves influenced by the competition between exchanges , ECNs and MTFs , investment banks and brokerage organisations and as they enhance the efficiencies and reduce the cost of access to their electronic trading services .
This is the publicised side of the Algorithmic Arms Race .
Institutions will publicise the service element of this model , though publicising the " trading " or " investment " performance will remain elusive .
The second is " the original model " : development of complex and sophisticated trading technology which encompasses a greater range of events and criteria on which to base trading strategies ; not only short term but taking a longer term perspective on issues which influence markets and economies .
The former is likely to encompass the majority of financial institutions .
The latter will be confined to specialist funds and elements of the proprietary trading desks of major global investment banks .
This remains the secret side of the Arms Race .

LAST November , William Graham was minding his own business on karaoke night at a sports bar near his home in Miami when things took a nasty turn .
On the other side of the bar , he recalled , a drunk couple was arguing .
The woman gave Mr. Graham a look , which her boyfriend apparently did n’t appreciate .
He approached Mr. Graham , 44 , flicked a cigarette at him and challenged him to a fight .
Unfortunately for the aggressor , Mr. Graham is a passionate student of the art — scratch that — the act of street fighting .
He owns approximately 20 DVD ’s and books on street fighting , many of them by the brawling guru Paul Vunak .
One is perfectly suited for karaoke nights that get out of hand : “ Anatomy of a Street Fight . ”
Mr. Graham recalled his training , and what happened next at the bar was not pretty .
He first went in with his thumbs for an eye gouge before letting loose with a “ straight blast , ” a flurry of driving blows to the midsection ( “ Bruce Lee ’s favorite , ” Mr. Graham said ) .
The aggressor fell to the floor , at which point Mr. Graham applied a choke hold until security separated and dismissed the two — through separate doors .
The whole episode lasted less than 20 seconds , Mr. Graham said .
In the end , the aggressor was vanquished and Mr. Graham ’s manhood was intact , just as his videos had promised .
His opponent was in a state of disbelief after the fight , Mr. Graham said .
“ He thought we were going to do the whole boxing match thing .
He was n’t ready for a poke in the eye and a 50 - yard dash down the centerline . ”
DIGG THIS
The foreign policies of America are going down to disastrous defeat all over the world .
Americans will soon wake up to defeat after defeat .
The basic reason for these defeats is that the West under American leadership is simply incapable of controlling the rest of the world .
Too many people live in too large an area with too many political cross-currents for any one nation or even a group of nations to be able to have mastery over .
Within the many areas and countries that the U.S. is trying to subdue and run are too many people with knowledge of how to fight , the means to fight , and the will to fight .
The world has too many other large nations , such as Russia and China , that can check America and the West in many possible ways and at every turn that suits them as the West seeks to run countries on or near their borders .
Within the Western alliance , there are fractures that prevent united action .
There are entire continents such as South America and Africa where events can , have , and will go out of American control .
America in every way is simply unequal to the task of ruling the world .
It ca n’t do it physically since it lacks the raw resources or power .
It ca n’t do it mentally since it lacks the spirit or will .
It ca n’t do it morally since it lacks the moral high ground .
It ca n’t do it financially since it lacks the wealth .
If it keeps on trying to run the world , it can only meet with more defeats than it already is running into .
And there is no need for America the state to run the world .
Our security does not depend on it .
Nor is it right to spread a vision of what some or even many Americans think are right values via the forces of the state .
Preventing mass airplane terror is a win and a welcome win .
That win did not come about by American foreign policy or by a war against terror expressed by American or Israeli troops on foreign soil .
No doubt it came through intelligence methods and infiltration of terror networks .
These are better methods than invasions , threats , sanctions , and similar pressures and methods that states employ .
Neoconservative baloney
The myth of America being a superpower that can remake the world is just that , a myth .
Neoconservatives had a dream .
They came to power .
They turned that dream into a nightmare .
They have taken America down to defeat after defeat .
They are still dreaming their dreams and still leading the country downwards .
Faced with bitter losses , they will now accuse America of not trying hard enough .
They will say that we should unleash even greater power and weaponry .
They will claim that the military has been stabbed in the back .
They will shout that their policies were not put into practice effectively , or that they were sabotaged by weak - willed or ineffectual politicians .
They will seek even more power .
They will blame everyone and everything they can think of .
They will fill the air with their denunciations and obfuscations .
They will call us critics defeatists .
They will bemoan the toll already paid in blood , as if that were reason to spill even more blood .
But the reasons for defeat lie in a basic reality that neoconservative policies failed to reckon with : America can not run the world .
Why do Americans support the wild - eyed neoconservative policies ?
Some Americans are warmongers .
Some are mute followers of their leaders .
Some believe pragmatically that the President knows what he is doing .
Some believe that this is World War III .
Some believe that it is a Christian duty to save the world even if it involves collective military might .
And so on .
Defeats we can hope will alter these attitudes and beliefs , all of which are entirely wrong .
War does not bring peace .
Mute submission is suicide .
The President has no idea what he is doing .
This is not World War III .
And Christians should not support armed interventions on behalf of what they think are good causes .
Christians should not be supporting wars right and left .
Americans should hold fast to one self - evident truth and not listen to neoconservative humbug .
The truth is that this country cannot rule the world by army , navy , marine , and air force power , threat , warfare , and intimidation .
Nor can it even diminish terror by these conventional means .
Superpower methods are useless in the aim of world rule .
They are worse than useless .
They backfire .
If Americans continue to listen and follow current foreign policies , if they keep buying into the neoconservative propaganda , then they will suffer even more defeats .
Defeats
Afghanistan is a defeat and a snare .
That war did not put Usama bin Laden out of business .
It did not put local insurgencies out of business .
The West ties down forces trying to hold a lid on a situation it ca n’t control in the long run .
Russia could n’t hold this country and the West ca n’t either .
Trying to do so begets
Western losses with no tangible long - run benefits .
Men and women die and sustain injury .
Wealth is dissipated .
American debts rise while Afghani conflict continues .
Warlords keep battling or fattening their purses .
A fragile democracy there and others elsewhere struggle against insurgencies or do n’t measure up to American goals .
The clock ticks on to a more visible Western defeat in Afghanistan , but the defeat is already there .
What is it that the West has won ?
Afghanistan was under Taliban rule which was tied in with Pakistan ’s support .
The Taliban probably still have Pakistani support .
American defeat in Afghanistan is also defeat in Pakistan .
Someday the lid will blow off Pakistan as it did in Iran .
What will America do then ?
Iraq is a defeat and a snare .
The country has a severe civil war going on .
Americans sit in the middle of it all , powerless to enforce the American will , whatever that will is .
All the king ’s horses and all the king ’s men cannot put Iraq together again .
Lebanon is a defeat and a snare .
Israel launches an invasion .
The U.S. approves and supports it .
However , the war reveals the weakness of Israel ’s armed forces , not only politically but also militarily , just as the Iraq War revealed the weakness of American armed forces to control a country .
Hizbullah parries Israel with a force only a fraction of Israel’s .
Hizbullah , which is no moral paragon , makes itself look good beside Israel ’s blunderbuss approach that inflicts damage in all directions .
There is no Israeli lightning war this time around .
After weeks , Israel has penetrated Lebanon only a few miles .
Iran sits safely at a distance observing how weak Israel really is .
In the long run , can the State of Israel survive ?
Can it survive by brute force ?
I do n’t think so , not in its current form .
Lebanon will be counted as a turning point in which Israel ’s enemies not only tasted blood but got the measure of their opponent , when the tide began to turn in their favor , when they rallied more sympathy for their cause , and even when they began to make headway in overturning Arab governments in favor of Islamic fundamentalist regimes .
An Israeli defeat is an American defeat , whether or not America gave the green light for the initial invasion .
All over this world are trouble spots and more potential defeats .
Thailand is or will be having war .
Somalia experiences war and Ethiopia intervenes .
China will sooner or later make a move of some sort on Taiwan .
North Korea threatens South Korea .
Venezuela links up to Cuba and Iran while threatening trouble elsewhere in South America .
Brazil has severe problems .
One can go on and on and on .
America cannot control all of these situations .
It can not police the world .
It can not run the world .
Neither can the major countries that run the United Nations Security Council , and it is a good thing they can’t .
Will Americans learn ?
Defeat will not go down American throats easily .
It may not go down at all .
I do not know .
But where character and brains most count are in times of defeat and loss .
America failed to learn the lessons of stalemate in Korea and defeat in Vietnam .
I have no great hope that it will learn from the current episodes .
When the hand is burned on a hot stove , one learns not to touch it again .
Will America learn not to touch the multitude of world trouble spots ?
I doubt it .
There will be excuses and rationalizations instead .
A basic problem is that foreign policy is the main toy of Presidents and Congresses .
They ca n’t resist playing with it .
They like to .
They do n’t get burned .
We do .
The basic problem is that Americans support their Presidents and Congresses with money , bodies , and wills .
They should not .
If this is the only way that Americans can get satisfaction , by displays of brawn all over the world , then they are doomed to defeat .
The Lilliputians will tie the American Gulliver down and cut him up into little pieces .
America should not be trying to save the world via armed force .
New directions
What is to be done ?
Many Americans worry about Islamic fundamentalist regimes coming to power , such as the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Bin Laden or his deputies might soon be running Somalia or some other country .
We need to distinguish the American state from individual Americans .
The state ’s actions need to be severely constrained .
The correct foreign policies in situations like these for the state are ( a ) patience , ( b ) non-intervention , ( c ) peaceful engagement , and ( d ) appropriate defense of America .
The last resort should be war and only when a country directly engages the U.S. in war .
Individuals should maintain their own moral high ground so that they can apply moral pressure against injustices and so that they can engage in voluntary individual ( not state ) action against them .
The general idea is to shrink the state ’s role in foreign policy ( state to state ) , and allow individuals to engage foreign people in voluntary relationships if they wish to , but still within the boundaries of just and justifiable actions .
State ’s policies should be more passive than is today the case , and individual policies should be as active or passive as individuals see fit ( within the limits of being just . )
If Christians wish to remake the world , they can do so with proper and traditional means as individuals ( which includes voluntary organizations ) .
If pirates attack ships in Indonesian waters , the shippers can use mercenaries if they wish for protection .
Piracy need not lead to extension of the U.S. war against terror to Indonesian waters .
If separatists in Thailand blow up a train and Americans want to take sides and fight in Thailand , that is their prerogative as individuals , not that I ’m recommending it .
They might even fight each other , or they might find Thais fighting them .
And if so , the Thais should understand that America the state is not going to protect any of its citizens who undertake such ventures in foreign countries .
They are actions of individuals .
Situations can rapidly become complex , and this is a good reason why the American state should stay out of foreign situations .
It is not proper for the U.S. state to choose up sides and commit the nation to one side or the other in foreign struggles , even if they involve Americans .
It makes no sense to extend the protection of the American state , for example , to every American wherever they are in the world in ways that drag the state into local conflicts and wars .
An American who travels should be responsible for his own protection .
If Americans could carry guns , they would be a lot safer .
And if they wore an emblem that signified they were under the protection of a credible protection company that would seek justice for any harm done , that would be better than running to an Embassy in case of trouble or waiting for the Marines to land .
It would be better than terrorists , insurgents , and rebels being able to drag the U.S. into wars of their choosing .
The American state should lay back and sit still , first for 5 years , then 10 years , then 20 years , and longer .
Americans need a long , long respite .
We need to recover our sense of proportion .
We need to learn how to think and see straight again .
We need to solve our own problems .
No nation can keep fighting forever without having a nervous breakdown .
We need to lay back and sit still because oppressive regimes have a way of self - destructing over time .
This happened to the Soviet Union ( and it ’s the path that the U.S. is on ) .
There is a reason .
The more that a regime tries to control , the higher become its costs of control .
But also the benefits of citizen resistance rise as the regime becomes more oppressive .
At some point , if the regime goes too far , the citizens make a change .
It depends on their pain threshold and dissatisfaction levels .
This is something that outsiders can’t gauge .
We should know about this .
Americans once had a low threshold of pain and threw off the British rule .
Nonintervention has the enormous benefit of giving foreign peoples no excuse to be against America as a state .
If our state has done nothing to earn their hatred or enmity , then they have no just cause against us .
This will diminish attacks on us inasmuch as many attacks are for what enemies regard as just causes even if those attacked see matters in the opposite light .
Nonintervention will not end all attacks or problem situations , however .
One can imagine all sorts of such difficult cases even if the U.S. becomes more passive , but they will be clearer and easier to manage if our state is minding its own business .
That ’s what nonintervention means :
Mind your own business , America .
If Islamic regimes oppress their people ( or we believe they do ) , we should be patient and not intervene as a state .
Anyway , we have little choice but to wait for the inevitable alteration in the country ’s politics because collective intervention makes matters worse .
We should be passive as a state , but active as individuals if we wish to .
North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam despite American intervention , but now that country engages the U.S. in trade and other ways .
If Iranians become dissatisfied enough with their rulers , they will change what they have .
The U.S. surely can’t do it for them without further defeat .
The U.S. once intervened to put in a puppet , the Shah of Iran , and the Iranians , or some of them , never forgot it .
Our CIA ’s intervention , among many others , led to the troubles we now face .
If there is injustice in Iran that the Iranians complain about , Americans as individuals can support them if they see fit and speak out .
If Iranians want money to support their cause , it is the right of any American to support them if the cause is just and the actions to support it are just .
Knowing these things may not be easy , but that is what conscience requires .
Pressures should build up from below , not from above by the concerted state actions we are used to seeing .
The evidence is in .
State interventions solve nothing .
They lead only to further conflicts .
No person needs to sit on his hands in the face of international evils .
There is plenty of work to be done to identify them .
People can organize and speak out .
They can apply moral pressures .
Some international organizations do this already , and they make a difference .
People can communicate with other peoples as individuals ( including voluntary groups ) and support them in many ways , even including smuggling , supplying arms , and fighting There are many ways to effect changes .
Muscular state policies have failed .
What is left except the actions of individuals ?
If this sort of free market foreign policy sounds visionary and strange , it is .
This is what bin Laden is doing .
He is conducting his own war against the United States and its citizens .
But his actions are terribly wrong and unjust .
I am not commending private marauders , pirates , terrorists , and thieves that prey upon innocents .
I am commending private actions that are just , and that creates a large constraint and poses difficult problems for anyone who uses force .
Patience means that the state ( not necessarily individuals ) takes a much longer - run view than it is accustomed to and sits still and waits for the natural forces of change to occur .
It means the state sees what its leaders think is evil or bad and does not do anything about it through sanctions , threat , armed force , interventions , and alliances .
The state should simply not be leading the country into foreign adventures .
The situations the state and the country face are not like calling the police because our neighbor gives his wife a black eye .
A state that acts like a policeman in foreign nations faces resistance from other states and peoples .
The state ’s international tools are limited , and the ones we have been taught to think work do not work well over the long haul .
There is no end of injustices in this world , and the state cannot successfully commit the American people to rectify them militarily or by the standard means that have gotten us into so much trouble in the past .
Militarism must end
Americans have shed enormous amounts of blood .
They have spent enormous wealth .
Why ?
Defense or national security was only part of it and not even the major root cause .
One intervention led to another and yet another on a growing scale .
That was the main reason .
The main reason was that U.S. policy is militarism .
According to one definition , militarism is a national policy of maintaining large armed forces and being willing to use them aggressively to defend or promote national interests .
This describes America .
U.S. militarism is destroying America .
President Eisenhower in 1961 warned the American people : " In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military - industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist . "
Immediately thereafter , Presidents Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon committed the nation to the Vietnam War .
Every President since has committed the nation to intervention and war in foreign lands .
There is no end in sight .
For wrong reasons , Americans now support what Ike foresaw would be a " disastrous " rise and misuse of power .
The returns are coming in .
They are defeats .
American militarism will end or else America will end .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
The beautiful and deeply religious Madame de Tourvel is so distraught after cheating on her husband in the 1782 novel “ Les Liaisons Dangereuses ” that she blacks out the betrayal altogether , arriving at a convent with no idea of what had brought her there .
Soon the horror of the infidelity rushes back , in all its incriminating force .
More than two centuries later , she has become part of a longstanding debate about whether the brain can block access to painful memories , like betrayals and childhood sexual abuse , and suddenly release them later on .
In a paper posted online in the current issue of the journal Psychological Medicine , a team of psychiatrists and literary scholars reports that it could not find a single account of repressed memory , fictional or not , before the year 1800 .
The researchers offered a $ 1,000 reward last March to anyone who could document such a case in a healthy , lucid person .
They posted the challenge in newspapers and on 30 Web sites where the topic might be discussed .
None of the responses were convincing , the authors wrote , suggesting that repressed memory is a “ culture - bound syndrome ” and not a natural process of human memory .
The executives in your company may be paid way more than they ’re worth , but do n’t worry – it ’s for your own good .
That ’s the point of a recent Forbes article defending overpaid executives which contains the single most disingenuous and illogical argument it has ever been my misfortune to see in a business context .
From the article :
The ugly truth is that your boss is probably overpaid–and it ’s for your benefit , not his .
Why ?
It might be because he is n’t being paid for the work he does but , rather , to inspire you .
In other words , we work our socks off in underpaying jobs in the hope that one day we ’ll win the rat race and become overpaid fat cats ourselves .
Economists call this “ tournament theory . ”
The article is based on a 25 year old economic paper on how tournament theory can be used to rank employees and allocate rewards like promotions and raises , arguing that :
Performance is hard to quantify , therefore rewards like promotions and raises are decided more by luck than by qualifications or results
Since rewards are mostly based on luck they need to be big or people wo n’t want to work hard to get them Overpaying executives motivates others to work hard because they can rise to the same position
The tournament system is good for the company
I beg to differ .
Here ’s my step - by - step debunking to make sure we never have to see this horrible argument used to defend overpaid executives again .
1 : Performance is hard to quantify , therefore rewards like promotions and raises are decided more by luck than by qualifications or results
From the article : … Managers find it hard to spot an excellent performance .
It is a rare job where workers can be fairly paid according to some objective criteria .
This argument basically says that evaluating performance is tricky … so we should n’t even try to make salaries fair .
It ’s clear to me that the most fair way to reward people at work is according to what they ’re worth for the company based on their performance and results .
This can be difficult to evaluate , but to simply give up and accept that rewards are mostly random seems silly and unfair .
Even if we can’t find a system that ’s 100 % fair , we can try to make it as fair as possible .
2 : Since rewards are mostly based on luck , they need to be big or people wo n’t want to work to get them
From the article : the more luck is involved in work , the larger the pay gaps should be between the winners and the losers .
If Jack ’s promotion is 90 % luck and 10 % effort , Jack may be inclined to goof off–unless , of course , the rewards for promotion are absolutely astronomical .
So : Promotions are mostly a matter of luck , and in order for this to work , the randomly awarded benefits have to be huge .
Am I the only one here thinking that it would make more sense to try to make rewards less dependent on luck rather than increase the rewards ?
3 : Overpaying executives motivates others to work hard because they can rise to the same position
No , this is fundamentally wrong .
In fact , when rewards are the primary motivational factor most people become less efficient – especially when the rewards are unfairly decided .
Alfie Kohn ’s article on Myths About Money and Motivation is a great paper on this , based on massive psychological research .
Even if this kind of motivation did work , it could only work on those employees who have a reasonable shot at getting one of the overpaid jobs .
But the majority of employees have long since accepted that they ’re never going to be VPs or CEOs and for them the tournament system can only be demotivating because they see others getting unfairly large rewards that they will never get , no matter how well they perform .
4 : The tournament system is good for the company
I think this system is little short of a disaster for businesses , resulting mostly in frustration among employees who are consistently not rewarded for doing great work .
This frustration results in a loss of motivation and happiness at work and consequently to lower productivity and higher employee turnover and absenteeism , just to mention a few issues that can cost companies millions .
Also , a recent article in the New Yorker James Surowiecki points out that companies that overpay their CEOs have worse performance than others .
One quote from the article :
One recent study of the market between 1992 and 2001 by economists at Rutgers and Penn State found that the more a C.E.O. was paid , relative to his peers , the more likely his company was to underperform in the stock market .
There are a few additional misconceptions in the article that need debunking .
Stock options
From the article : Tournaments also help protect workers against risks they cannot control .
Companies can be affected by recessions , unexpected competition and hurricanes .
As long as every worker is equally affected , the incentives to try hard remain the same .
Trying to encourage performance through , say , stock options would unnecessarily expose workers to risks without really encouraging them to work harder .
First of all , I think it ’s touching that companies want to protect their people by not giving them stock options .
At the same time , most CEO ’s and other top executives do get stock options , because common wisdom dictates that this motivates them to better performance .
So in summation : Stock options for employees are dangerous and not really motivating .
Stock options for executives are essential to motivate them .
All clear ?
The evidence
From the article : Lazear and Rozen ’s tournament theory has stood the test of time and been supported by many subsequent pieces of empirical research .
There ’s also massive amounts of research pointing out the opposite – I mentioned some examples above .
Suddenly everything is clear
From the article : Economists do n’t even pretend that your boss deserves his salary .
Suddenly , everything is clear .
But apparently some of them pretend that this is a good system , one that inspires employees to do their best at work and creates good performance in a company .
Some of them even say that it ’s good for the employees .
I find it more likely that these theories are floated in an attempt to make an unfair but ingrained business practice survive a little longer against the onslaughts of common sense .
Like all such attempts it ’s ultimately doomed to fail .
Did I miss any more fallacies in the original article ?
Tell me about them in a comment .
What to do instead
Alfie Kohn ’s recommendation is simple : Pay people as fairly as you can .
Then focus on other things than rewards .
True motivation and great performance at work is never about salary – very few people do their best work while wondering how much cash they will make from it .
The tournament argument completely fails to appreciate this and that ’s why companies who choose this approach are forever doomed to sub- standard performance , massive frustration and zero motivation .

Analysis
By Steve Schifferes
BBC News economics reporter
China 's currency is undervalued , say many of its trading partners
As of 1 October , China 's central bank announced that its reserves were $ 987bn - and they are growing by $ 18 bn each month .
That sum is the largest holding of foreign exchange reserves in the world - and more than the annual value of economic activity in all but a handful of the world 's big economies .
The huge surplus is a product of China 's success as an exporter to the world .
China 's trade surplus , the difference between the amount it sells and buys from the world , has topped $ 100bn , with the imbalance especially marked with the US .
As a result , China receives more and more foreign currency each year , which it puts in its reserves .
But China 's currency reserves are now so large that some economists fear they will unbalance the entire global economy .
Grip on US
Foreign currency reserves are generally seen as a good thing - it is the lack of reserves that means that countries might suffer runs on their currency , as Britain did in the 1970s .
But China 's surplus is much more than China needs to cover its exports , or pay for its own investments abroad .
And China has mainly invested its foreign currency reserves in long - term US Treasury bonds and other government securities .
Brad Setser , a former US Treasury official , estimates that China now holds $ 700 bn in US long - term bonds , enough to lower US long - term interest rates by 1.5 % - which helped stimulate the recent housing boom .
But those holdings are a double - edged sword .
If China attempted to diversify its holdings , it could cause a collapse in the value of the dollar and higher inflation in the US .
That would also lower the value of China 's own reserve assets - so China is only slowly moving out of dollars and into other currencies such as the euro .
However , it also ties the fate of the US economy to China .
Worries for China
In economic theory , China 's currency should rise in value since it has such a big trade surplus and currency reserves .
The world wants China 's cheap goods - and is paying in dollars
But China 's economic growth is highly dependent on exports and investment , with relatively little coming from domestic consumption .
So the Chinese government wants to keep the value of its currency , the yuan , fixed at a rate tied to the US dollar ( with a 3 % variation allowed ) .
This helps boost foreign investment but makes it more difficult to control inflation .
In the long term , China wants to switch the emphasis in its economy to domestic demand .
But that will take time - and in the meanwhile the currency reserves could double to reach $ 2 trillion in a few more years .
Foreign investment
Some economists argue that the pattern actually benefits both the US and China .
The US gets a cheap and stable source of funding for its trade deficit , allowing the economy to continue to grow as consumers purchase cheap foreign goods - whose low prices keep inflation in check .
And China is able to maintain its export - led economic growth , generating jobs for its growing urban population , while continuing to attract foreign investment .
But others argue that it may not be sustainable - and the attempt to unwind these huge imbalances could destabilise the world economy .
Brad Setser believes that unless China rapidly revalues its currency , it will face increased pressures on its domestic economy - with over - investment ( now approaching 50 % of GDP ) eventually collapsing , putting pressure on the banking system .
Fred Bergsten of the Institute of International Economics argues that the problems of adjustment - and the huge trade imbalance - will generate growing protectionist pressures in the US and Europe , undermining support for free trade .
The IMF and the OECD also see this adjustment as the central problem of the world economy .
And unless it is tackled , the prospects for future world economic growth might well be derailed .

Can you imagine what life would be like if you could only come out at night ?
If ultraviolet rays -- even from a light bulb -- could be dangerous , perhaps fatal ?
Kasey Knauff , 5 , of Bellefonte , Pa. , faces this reality .
Her strange symptoms began the day she was born : April 10 , 2001 .
She was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit and placed under special bilirubin lights to treat what doctors suspected was jaundice .
Instead of getting better , Kasey 's condition worsened .
A dermatologist was called in to examine her .
Howard Pride of the Geisinger Medical Center in Danville , Pa. , removed Kasey 's heart monitor patches and was shocked by what he found .
The skin underneath the patches was white ; the skin around them , red .
The bilirubin lights had caused a full body burn .
The dermatologist now knew that Kasey 's skin was sensitive to light .
It was another symptom , though , that would lead to a diagnosis -- the color of Kasey 's urine was red .
That proved that Kasey was suffering from CEP -- Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria -- a condition in which the body has trouble producing heme , an essential component of hemoglobin in the blood .
This causes light - activated chemicals called porphyrins to build up , turning bones and urine red , and teeth , a dark brown or purple .
The Knauffs contacted Robert Desnick , a medical geneticist from New York 's Mount Sinai School of Medicine , who has been studying porphyrias for 30 years .
After analyzing the DNA of Kasey 's parents , his lab found that each parent had passed a different rare mutation for CEP to Kasey .
Her older sister Kylie had gotten only one affected gene .
That made Kylie a carrier .
Living With CEP
Bili lights are n't Kasey 's only enemy .
Any exposure to ultraviolet rays -- the sun , halogen lamps , regular light bulbs -- can burn , blister and scar Kasey 's skin .
Before leaving the hospital , the Knauffs made sure their house was ultraviolet - proof .
Five years later , the family is still living in the dark .
Because the maximum UV light that Kasey can tolerate is 40 watts , she must spend most of her days indoors .
The treatment ?
Blood transfusions if hemoglobin levels drop too low and a bone marrow transplant if a match is found .
While a bone marrow transplant would be a cure , it is risky .
For now , Kasey 's hemoglobin levels are fine , and she will not need blood transfusions .
So , until this medical mystery is solved , Kasey 's family continues to live one day and one night at a time .
I was reading something on Slashdot about HP dumping Board member George Keyworth for leaking things to the press .
The issue was n’t that he was dumped , it was that pretexting was used to get his phone records .
This being Slashdot , the idea that all CEOs and politicians are sociopaths quickly came up .
This is how it supposedly works : no normal human being would be willing to cut jobs , sell out their colleagues , keep saying what people want to hear with no guilt from lying , and otherwise do the things that lands you on top of the corporate ladder or in Congress .
In order to be successful at those things , you have to lack empathy with others â€ “ hence , you ’re a sociopath .
Very intelligent sociopaths can be surprisingly charismatic â€ “ they learn can learn , and exploit , social graces even if they do n’t feel bound to them .
Is there any evidence to back this up ?
There ’s a book called The Sociopath Next Door , written by a clinical psychologist , but I have n’t read it .
A search of the literature does n’t show much , although I have to admit I ’m not familiar with the technical terms to use in searching academic journals .
I did find one piece of related evidence .
A magazine was able to run a Voight - Kampff test on the candidates for mayor of San Franscisco .
They determined that the majority were replicants , and not human beings at all .
What do you think ?
Are politicians and CEOs really amoral enough to be called sociopaths , or do these jobs select for sociopathic tendencies ?
Or is it just an intelligent way of saying their jerks and we ’re jealous of them ?

Rudolf denied that the Nazis used gas at death camps like Auschwitz
Germar Rudolf published a study saying the Nazis did not use gas to kill Jews at the Auschwitz concentration camp .
The prosecution says he " represented the Holocaust as invention " and used the internet to spread his documents .
If found guilty , Mr Rudolf will face up to five years in prison .
He has already been given an jail sentence in a similar case but fled to the US .
A chemistry graduate , 42 - year - old Mr Rudolf also faces charges of defaming the memory of the dead .
COUNTRIES WITH LAWS AGAINST HOLOCAUST DENIAL Austria Belgium Czech Republic France Germany Israel Lithuania Poland Slovakia Switzerland
He was sentenced to 14 months in prison in a similar case in 1995 but fled the country .
His 2000 application for political asylum in the US was rejected and he was deported back to Germany to serve the earlier sentence .
In a similar case in February 2005 , British revisionist historian David Irving was found guilty of denying the Holocaust by an Austrian court and sentenced to three years in prison .
Selecting bedroom furniture for kids is a fun but challenging endeavor .
You have to make sure that furniture for your child ’s room is fun , safe , and functional .
Here are some tips on opting for the right bedroom furniture for your kids of different ages .
As your child begins crawling or toddling around , you have to be even more vigilant on their safety .
Toddlers tend to be active and curious and they risk bumping into things and also knocking them over at the age , or touching things that they are not supposed to .
Bedroom furniture for kids must be simple , safe , and clean .
Keep away from using bedroom furniture for kids or interior decoration with sharp edges , and also do not put something heavy on top of the surfaces .
Make sure that all the furniture in the area is sturdy and will not topple easily .
Toddlers frequently use bedroom furniture for kids or something else that they can reach as support for at what time they want to stand up .
You do not desire whatever it is they are holding on to fall on them .
The flooring must have soft wall to wall carpeting and slip - proof rugs to cushion your children if they fall and trip .
Bedroom Furniture for Kids Small Object
You need to avoid having small objects in the space , or having bedroom furniture for kids with small , and detachable parts .
Some kids put their hands or small objects right in their mouths , and you do not desire them choking on something or swallowing something toxic or indigestible .
Decorations and bedroom furniture for kids do not have to be fancy or luxurious .
At this age , your children may perhaps have favorite colors ; however they still cannot understand the complex imagery such as characters or storybook pictures .
At the age of six to eight , kids start having choices for what they desire to see in their own rooms .
Allowing them to voice out their choices for the bedroom furniture for kids will help them increase a sense of style and freedom .
You still have to set limitations and then let them see which of their requests is really possible .
Keeping your kid healthy , comfortable , and of course happy are very important responsibilities that you have as a good parent .
Opting for appropriate bedroom furniture for kidsas well as playrooms for them is only one way to keep your little one happy while still making sure their safety .
Kids ’ Room Paint Colors Typically
When you have decided to set up painting the kids area or the entire house , first of all you need to select what kind of kids ’ room paint colors you want to purchase .
Not all paints are made equal and of course the first thing you settle on is the colors .
The next thing you need to settle on is the shine level ; it is typically dictated by the use of the space .
For instance you might desire to paint the kitchen using semi gloss latex paint and perhaps your bathrooms as well .
Do not forget that the semi gloss kids ’ room paint colors will reflect many more flaws in the walls .
If you decide on a satin or flat paint , it will be softer on the form of the walls .
Young kids just like kids ’ room paint colors which are bright like red or orange .
Young girls really like hot pink and purples like orchid flowers .
Obviously when you paint the whole room using those colors it might be very overwhelming , thus what you can do is to come up with a slyness strategy to counter the impact the kids ’ room paint colors which are bright .
If your kid loves orange , you might be interested in appending a little beige or white to it giving it a capability of blending in .
Kids ’ Room Paint Colors Red
You might do a wall with kids ’ room paint colors that are harsh like red making it an accent wall .
In this way , you still give your kid a red wall but you did not need to paint the entire room red .
An important aspect of decent quality paint is the truth that it can put the underlying surface out of sight , clearly the better the paints , the less the coats have to be applied that consecutively costs less money either in painting or in your time .
In higher quality kids ’ room paint colors , the real base is of higher metallic content providing it with a better hiding ability .
It is especially essential that when you are painting with kids ’ room paint colors like red or yellow or purple , it is well advised to apply absolute top notch paint otherwise you will be repainting more and more paint coats .
It is sometimes not worth buying the inexpensive kids ’ room paint colors paint since you will end up either purchase more paint and you will end up expending more time painting that equals to about a can of best top line paint .
A young teen riding his bike at dawn reaches into his shoulder bag , grabs a tightly folded newspaper and deftly throws it toward the front steps .
It ’s an image as American as apple pie , but the
paperboy has gone the way of the milkman .
Papers today usually arrive by anonymous drive - and - toss .
For reasons including the demise of afternoon papers , a shift to centralized distribution and earlier delivery deadlines , adults in cars now make up 81 percent of the country ’s newspaper carriers .
As recently as 1994 , more than half of newspaper carriers — 57 percent — were younger than 18 , often neighborhood children , according to the Newspaper Association of America ( NAA ) .
As the job moved into the hands of grown - up independent contractors , who do n’t come to the door for payment anymore , many bemoan the lost sense of community in which the paperboy played a unique role .
Also lost is an opportunity that gave children as young as 10 business skills .
If you were n’t a paperboy or papergirl , your sibling , parent or friend was .
And if you did n’t do it , you subbed for your brother when he went to Scout camp .
Parents , more likely than not , helped — either driving on bad weather days or helping stuff inserts into the Sunday papers .
Some former paperboys recall loving the responsibility and a sense of pride ; others hated the early mornings and collecting from stingy subscribers .
“ It was a great first job because I had to manage for myself , ” said George Rohling , 41 , who delivered the Spokesman - Review in Spokane , Wash . , in the 1970s .
Like most paperboys , Mr. Rohling was paid according to the number of papers he delivered , and he collected payments each week .
“ I was n’t standing at a register , asking if they want fries . ”
President Harry S. Truman , actors John Wayne and Bob Hope , and baseball star Willie Mays all had paper routes when they were young .
So did TV journalist Tom Brokaw , cartoon great Walt Disney and investment whiz Warren Buffett .
Teens and tweens really started delivering America ’s papers in the postwar era , NAA Vice President John P. Murray said .
Boys had hawked newspapers on city street corners , and as customers moved to the suburbs , it was a natural fit .
“ They were appealing , tenacious and would work in a small window of time , ” Mr. Murray said .
In return , delivering papers rewarded children “ relatively speaking , handsomely . ”
In the 1950s , Henry Petroski earned a lucrative $ 20 a week delivering the Long Island ( N.Y . )
Press each afternoon and Sunday morning .
The job taught him how to deal with people and money , as well as how to fold a paper .
“ It was n’t that easy ; the first few times the paper would open in the air and would fall apart , ” said Mr. Petroski , now a Duke University professor and author of a memoir , “ Paperboy : Confessions of a Future Engineer . ”
“ By learning what did n’t work , you learn eventually what not to do more than the secret of doing it right . ”
Now Mr. Petroski receives his Durham ( N.C. ) Herald - Sun each day from an adult driving a car .
It ’s not the same , particularly when it rains .
“ When I was a paperboy , we would do what we called ‘ doorknob , ’ ” he said .
“ You would walk up to the door and put the paper in the storm door .
Here , it ’s just a yellow plastic bag at the bottom of the driveway . ”
At least one paper is bucking the trend .
Since December , the Sun in Lowell , Mass. , has shifted about 2,000 papers from adult routes back to youth carriers .
“ It ’s strengthening everything all the way around , ” Circulation Director Michael Sheehan said .
Routes grow newspaper readers , he said , while young carriers provide better service and create customer loyalty .
Sun paperboy Joseph “ J.J. ” Polcari , 15 , is learning about the value of good service .
A five - year veteran of delivering Sun papers , he recently was named carrier of the week .
“ If you treat people well , they give you good tips , ” said J.J. , who earns about $ 40 a week .
Delivering 20 papers takes 20 minutes each day , he said , thanks to his bike .
And the work is paying off :
His mother , Debbie , said J.J. is saving for a car and has enough for insurance .
Yet this return to youth carriers is an alternative not open to many morning papers .
In Bloomington , Ill. , the Pantagraph employs about 200 young people in its carrier force of 480 .
Circulation Director Bill Hertter says it ’s tough these days to find teens willing to deliver the morning paper by 6 every day .
“ Money is too available , ” he said .
“ Why would they want another five , 10 bucks when they have everything ? ”

The weird and wonderful creatures living by methane vents in the southwest Pacific have been photographed for the first time ( see images right and below ) .
The deep - sea communities live around methane seeps off New Zealand ’s eastern coast , up to 1 kilometre beneath the sea surface .
The team of 21 researchers from the US and New Zealand , who spent two weeks exploring the area , have just returned to shore .
See video footage recorded by the researchers here , here and here .
“ It ’s the first time cold seeps have been viewed and sampled in the southwest Pacific , and will greatly contribute to our knowledge of these intriguing ecosystems , ” says Amy Baco - Taylor from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US .
Cold seeps are areas of the seabed where methane or hydrogen sulphide gas escape from stores deep underneath .
Like hydrothermal vents , the gases support unique life forms that can convert the energy - rich chemicals into living matter in the absence of any sunlight .
Sheer extent
Animals living around methane seeps off Chile and Japan have been observed before , but not near New Zealand .
“ The seeps here are remarkable in the sheer extent of their chemosynthetic communities , ” says Baco - Taylor , whose team visited eight such sites between 750 and 1050 metres beneath the surface .
They used sonar to map the seafloor and to detect plumes of water rich in methane , then lowered a video and stills camera system over each site .
This allowed them to record images of tube worms between 30 cm and 40 cm in length as they emerged from beneath limestone boulders .
They also recorded corals , sponges and shell beds covered with various types of clam and mussel .
The expedition was led by scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of Hawaii at Manoa in the US , and New Zealand ’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research .

Q is no longer supported , see Pure instead
Please note that Q has been superseded by the Pure programming language , so please head over to the new website and download the latest version of the Q successor today !
This website remains online so that the final Q version is still available for those who need it .
However , we really recommend that you switch to Pure which has many improvements such as LLVM - based JIT compilation to native code , full 64 bit support , lexical closures , built - in list and matrix support and an easy - to - use C interface .
Q is an interpreted , dynamically typed functional programming language based on term rewriting which allows you to define functions using symbolic equations .
It works on ( 32 bit ) Linux , OS X , Unix and Windows , and comes with a bunch of useful libraries which turn it into a practical programming tool .
The Q programming system is free software distributed under the GPL .
If you come here for the first time , then you might wish to take a look at the About and Documentation sections to learn more about Q .
If you 're looking for the software , go right ahead to the Download section .
Information about the Q mailing lists can be found in the Lists section .
Also make sure you visit our Wiki .
Enjoy your stay !
NOTE : This is the new Q website on SourceForge .
The old website ( Q versions up to 4.5 ) is still available here .
News
8 June 2008 : In case you 're wondering about the lack of updates , please head over to the new Pure website and subscribe to the Pure mailing list , this is where all the action is now .
Pure is a much improved version of Q , completely rewritten from scratch , with powerful new features and an LLVM backend which compiles scripts to fast native code .
Pure is slated to eventually become Q's successor .
It is working pretty well already , scripts run a lot ( 20 - 30 times ) faster , and interfacing to C is much easier than in Q .
11 March 2008 : Toni Graffy now maintains the SUSE packages for Q at the Packman repository ( look for q- core and q- addons ) .
This is a complete set of packages which includes all addons and can easily be installed with YaST .
I have also made available Q packages for the ASUS eeePC .
( If you still have n't heard about this nifty little machine , it is a fairly low - cost subnotebook running a Debian Linux version . )
Moreover , Q - Audio was updated to version 2.7 , which fixes a display refresh bug in the audio_player program with recent GGI versions , and Pd/Q was updated to version 0.4 , fixing a deadlock in the asynchronous message passing code .
As usual , more information and downloads can be found on the Download page .
For your convenience , I have also uploaded a patch which fixes the broken - inwin option of the X11 target in all GGI 2.2 releases up to 2.2.2 .
This is required for X11 - based systems , to make GGI applications like audio_player work which embed GGI windows in GUI applications .
( These changes are also in GGI CVS now , so they should eventually become available on systems which currently ship broken GGI packages , such as Debian .
You do n't have to worry about this if you are still running GGI 2.1 or the Windows version . )
24 February 2008 : Q 7.11 has been released .
The new release sports symbolic XML - style character escapes in string literals , various improvements and bugfixes in the clib , system and odbc modules , support for highres timers and timed waits on mutexes and semaphores on systems which provide that functionality , and Jiri Spitz ' new AVL tree implementation which considerably speeds up the dictionary and set data structures in the standard library .
( Please see the NEWS file for details . )
Moreover , the all - in - one package now includes all the latest versions of the addon packages , as well as Eddie Rucker 's new CSV module for reading and writing comma-separated value data .
As usual , you can grab all the new stuff on the Download page .
23 January 2008 : Q 7.11 RC1 is now available in testing .
Changes besides the XML - style symbolic character escapes ( see below ) are that the clib module has some new operations providing read / write access to C vectors represented as byte strings , and the glob and regex operations have been moved back into the clib module .
17 January 2008 : A new cvs snapshot is now available in testing , which features symbolic character escapes in strings following the 2007 - 12 - 14 W3C Working Draft " XML Entity definitions for Characters " , as discussed on the Q mailing list .
I also took the opportunity to update the Unicode character properties ( used for character type predicates like isalnum ) to the latest from ICU 3.8 .
The snapshot is available here .
18 December 2007 : Q 7.10 has been released ( sporting some minor bugfixes in the clib module ) , and openSUSE 10.3 packages are now available .

About Rumplepay
The Rumplepay service allows payments between interconnected friends and businesses .
Normally , if your friend Alice owed you $ 10 , she would have to pay you back before you could make any use of that debt .
If you were creative , however , you might be able to pass the debt on to someone else who knew and trusted Alice , in exchange for something you wanted .
For example , you might be able to get a book you want from Bob , who also knows Alice , in exchange for letting Alice know that she now owes Bob $ 10 .
Instead of money , you used Alice 's IOU to pay Bob .
Alice acts as an intermediary between you and Bob .
The Rumplepay service does the same thing , only it takes the idea one step further .
What happens if you want to get a haircut from Carol , who does n't know Alice at all ?
Your $ 10 IOU from Alice is n't useful because Carol being owed money by Alice does n't mean anything to Carol .
But suppose you had a way to find out that Bob , who knows Alice , also knows Carol .
You could talk to Bob and arrange for him to take Alice 's IOU in exchange for giving his own IOU for $ 10 to Carol .
Since Alice owes him exactly what he owes Carol , Bob is even on the deal .
Both Alice and Bob act as intermediaries between you and Carol .
And that 's how the Rumplepay service works .
You create a profile inside your financial services account and indicate who you know and how much you trust them by connecting to people by email address and giving them credit limits .
Then whenever you want to make a payment to another Rumplepay service user using only friendly obligations , the Rumplepay service finds a chain of intermediaries connecting you to the person you want to pay , and records the payment in each intermediary 's account all the way down the chain .
You end up owing one of your " neighbours " , and the payment recipient ends up being owed by one of her neighbours .
For more information , see the Frequently Asked Questions , or contact us with your questions .
Rumplepay is a part of the Ripple financial service project to develop a peer - to - peer network protocol for making decentralized Ripple service payments between users on different computers .
To learn more , please visit the Ripple service project homepage .
Update : The Ripple Project is now being developed by Ripple Inc .
I 've just hit an article in the BBC News about the sale of the most haunted house in Britain , Windhouse on Yell in Shetland .
I visited Shetland myself in 2002 ; while I was there , I became fascinated by the ruin seen
from the road and I did enough archive research to potentially pitch a magazine article on it later .
The article never happened , but here 's the gist of what I wrote up right after my visit on my blog of the time .
According to the Shetland guidebooks , people only go to Yell to get to Unst , famous for its bird preserve , but people from Yell are nevertheless " passionate " about the place , said the local history archivist who dug up some of the ghost stories for me .
Yell folk are also storytellers , which might be why the house is still famous there .
The Trow 's Tale and Folklore Collection
One of the best - known of all Shetland folktales is " The Trow of Windhouse " or " Trow of Yell . "
Trows are the local fairy folk , but the trow in the tale is nothing like the normal ones .
Unlike the little people or slim types capable of passing for human , this one was a huge mountain of gelatinous blubber .
[ Linguistic note : " ow " is usually pronounced " oo " in Shetland .
Cows are " coos " and Windhouse is " Windhoose . "
The archive guy said " trow " not " troo . "
No idea what the actual rule for the sound , I gave up linguistics years ago ! ]
This one goes back to the mid-1800 's at latest .
The versions all agree on this part : Christmas
Eve a shipwrecked sailor makes his way to Windhouse , and finds the family packing up to spend the night elsewhere .
Every Christmas
Eve , horrible things happen and someone ends up dead ( very much like my own family holidays ) .
So they invite him to go away with them , but he stays in the house alone instead , not being scared ( and maybe interested in the silver they left behind ) .
A giant monstrous creature attacks the house in the night , and he grabs his faithful axe ( with him since the shipwreck , rather surprising ) and gives chase outside .
He buries his axe in the giant and kills it .
He sees on the ground there naught but a shapeless mass .
The family is happy to see him alive Christmas Day , and he points out where he killed it .
The heather there had turned bright green and the spot is supposedly still known to the locals ( in one version , there 's an actual fence around it ) .
The archivist found me transcriptions of Edinburgh folklorist interviews with one of the storytellers .
The interviews read like this :
This man cam te Windhouse , te de Spences , an dey wir at tea , is I referred .
An dey asked him if he wid pertake , an he said he wis hungry fer dey wirna tasted food -- ot wos all been watter logged for so many hours .
An he took dis tea , and dey teld him dis story aboot de eruptions it wis ite da house , an de house bein haunted , an dey wir goin te dir cousins in Mid - Yell , an dey waanted him te come with dem .
An he said he wisna fightened for no trows , ir nothin like it an as well , he didna believe in it .
This particular interview transcript is an entertaining read for a former academic .
After the blob is dead , the interviewer says in a spectacularly lame , leading - the - informant manner : " I see .
It 's interesting that sometimes in these stories that the use of cold iron could drive away the supernatural . "
Our innocent storyteller starts to say , " Very much so , bit dey wir ... "
The interviewer ploughs on in his undergraduate , man - on - a- mission collection method : " Have you heard any other stories like that --[ Storyteller says , " No " over him ] where cold iron like an [ Storyteller : " No. " ] axe or knife could drive away the - - "
( I remember giggling into my wine in a Shetland bar as I read the document copy . )
Here the poor storyteller finally gets in a complete statement : " Steel .
Dey mightla been steel ina yon . "
The crushed interviewer , knowing this is being recorded and will be transcribed or he wo n't finish his degree : " Yes . "
The storyteller then really pounds it home , with a long paragraph about how much more useful steel is , get off your lame old - fashioned " cold iron " academic folklore kick and let me tell you what we think up here about modern weaponry .
Body Count
There are a bunch of other , less well - documented ghost stories , ones I was actually more interested in but did n't have much access to .
There 's one about a " lady in silk " believed to be a housekeeper or mistress who fell down the stairs and broke her neck .
There 's an unsubstantiated rumor of a woman 's skeleton found under floorboards at the foot of the stair .
There 's another one about a tall man 's ghost in a long black coat , possibly connected to the actual substantiated body on site .
I found it in microfilm from 1887 :
Human Remains Found .--
While some workmen , who are engaged repairing the manor house of Windhouse , were removing some debris from the back of the house , they came upon the skeleton of a human being .
It had apparently been that of a man of large stature , as the bones measured fully six feet long .
It was lying in the position it had been put down , the arms folded over the breast .
It was only a small distance under the ground and there was no evidence of their ever being a coffin , which gave rise to an opinion that it had been a murder ; but if it has it is not in the memory of any of the inhabitants nor does any remember any person ever being missed .
One of the archive transcripts says it was thought to be someone who disappeared at a workmen 's party .
There 's another report of a baby 's skeleton found in a kitchen wall , but I could n't find a date with which to verify that story in the papers .
Historic Rundown
The house had a pretty strange history even without the bodies .
There was an earlier house higher up on on the hill in the 1600s , owned by a series of pretty nasty men ( lying , cheating , beatings , hangings ) .
The current house ruin represents a reconstruction of the old one in 1700 - something , done by moving the stones down the hillside .
Supposedly the foundations of the original are still visible , but I did n't go up to see , being a coward .
The gatehouse by the road is now a camping lodge where you can stay for 5 pounds per night , but you could n't pay me to do it .
The farmhouse on the land opposite across the road was occupied by one of the amateur
Yell historians who wrote an 8 - part history of the 1600s house and house owners in a local magazine 2 decades ago .
( It 's a nice article , the source of many of these leads I followed . )
In the 1930s , the last owner sold it and it is now on land owned by the RSPB ( the royal bird society ) .
There are supposed to be otters living nearby , which is why I was
Scottish graveyard
there at all .
It 's now a ruin that kids dare each other to spend the night in and adults told me they get an uncomfortable feeling there .
I certainly did , too .
I considered going back after my first view of it from the road , to actually look closer at the ruin , maybe walk around and look for the old house , but I talked myself out of it .
Long drive , anyway .
The house was put up for sale and according to the most recent newspaper blurb ( July 02 ) , " It is the reputed haunt of many ghosts and skeletons have been found in the walls and beneath the floors of the imposing old ruin . "
There were interested parties inquiring from all over the world , and the new buyer is from England .
I called the paper to see if they knew anything more , but they did n't and were n’t terribly interested in talking to a wannabe freelancer calling from a payphone .
And that 's all she wrote , folks !
( I did not in fact spot any otters my entire time in Shetland , although other tourists did . )
If you have any more stories about Yell or Windhouse , drop me a note !
Postscript in Jan 2007 : A Reader 's Story
I am an American in Denver , Colorado , who once lived in Scotland and took a trip up to Shetland for a short period of time .
In that summer of 1985 , I visited Shetland in general , and Yell in particular , for some five to six weeks .
I came up as a Church of Scotland summer “ intern ” to work with a local pastor in Yell , whom I believe is retired now and living in the south of Shetland .
I spent a number of weeks in the area , staying with the pastor ’s family .
Anyway , one of the most interesting curiosities at the time I was there was this same Windhouse at the top of the hill .
I stopped my car once on the road beneath it after a round of visitations on the island .
I stepped over the marginally preventative barbed wire fence ( at the time ) and began walking up to it to take a closer look .
It just looked like a place that had a story behind it , especially with its crest ( something Americans get curious about ) .
It was private property .
Soon I saw one or two people starring at me with a determined look from a distance , so I turned back so as not to be charged with trespassing .
I decided to talk more about the ruin to the pastor , again as I was staying at their home further in town ( across the field from the crab factory in operation at the time nearer to the harbor ) .
The next day , or perhaps the day after , we went for a walk in the hilly fields some distance behind the Windhouse , but I did not realize that at the time .
We walked and walked and walked , four of us , the pastor and his wife , along with me and my wife , who stayed only part of the time before heading back to Aberdeen to begin to teach at the American school in Cults .
However , on this walk we soon came upon the back section of the Windhouse itself .
As we approached it , a strange sight came into view in a cleared area directly behind it .
There were a number of dead sheep , four of five approximately ( though not exactly sure ) .
There was something they all had in common .
They all had significant wounds right in the chest area .
Their coats were still red from the gash , though it must have been days old .
That much was very evident and never forgotten .
It was if something
had cut into them originally and then later was exploited by the birds .
I starred at them , and felt I was in the presence of the remains of what had been some ritual .
It unnerved me to say the least .
I then walked into the back part of the house wary of lose materials only to see the broken down staircase and then the crest and front portions of the house glimpsed from the road .
After a brief review of the place , the pastor hastened us on and we returned as we came .
At the time I felt that he did not want us to hang around it , though I heard later that he had gained permission to walk in the area from the owner of the property .
When I asked further about what this could be , I did not get a response that encouraged further discussion .
I was hoping to go back before I left for good , but that opportunity never arose .
But perhaps there is more than meets the eye to the reputation of a haunting at Windhouse ?
Maybe something worse ?
Anyway , for what it ’s worth , I thought I would convey this bit of past personal experience , for it remains one of the vivid memories of my stay in Yell .
This is no hoax or “ urban legend ” as they say here .
... I later graduated from Aberdeen University and became an assistant pastor at [ a church in Aberdeen ] for a year before returning to the States .
Post Postscript : Shetland Forum
After posting the above comment , I searched again on Windhouse and realized I 'd been referenced off a Shetlander foum discussion of ghost stories .
[ Note in 2014 : The original link does n't work , this is a new link to the " current " 2008 thread , which does n't have these exact stories in it .
Sigh . ]
Several mentions of Windhouse stories surfaced in the thread :
Would the wind house every one is alluding to be the house in Mid yell .
I have alwas know it as the hoose ' o ' windows , me granfaither , used tae tell wis stories ( he wis frae Mid yell ) 'n he telt wis dat sumaen wis kilt and burried under da flag stanes at da back 'o da hoose .
dat da dead eens haunted da hoose ower newrdy .
stories in da late fifties early sixty's .
[ Update 2014 : Reader Andrew Anderson emails , " Just a quick message to tell you that the man from Midyell was Gideon Smith , a builder called to inspect a flooded flagged drain outside the rear kitchen .
He found the skeleton of a man there blocking the stone lined drain / sewer .
I know this to be true as he was my mother 's grandfather . " ]
I remember some of the North Isles boys at the AHS back in the day telling some wild stories about that place , not so much about ghosts , but about the supposed happenings in the past .
Everything from the old woman who was the last resident , who lived as a hermit in the upstairs rooms while the rest of the house was over - run by feral cats , until .... ( there was more to it , but I 'm applying self - censorship here ) , to some tax collector who " disappeared " after going to the house .
Something about someone being murdered in the house and buried outside one of the front windows as well , I do n't remember now whether that was the tax collector or someone else .
There was probably some small grain of truth in some of it somewhere , but as stories are wont to be , embellished with each retelling for the sake of a good yarn so as to be virtually unrecognisable as the original .
I think much of Windhouse 's notoriety is down to it 's appearance and positioning though , it has a commanding position , alone and higher up a slope than most else around it making it immediately feel imposing , add to that it 's design gives it an a certain humanesque appearance , the two large blank front windows resemble the empty eye sockets of a skull , and the castilled top wings either side give the skull sticking out ears with raggety tops .
Especially in certain lights and in certain positions it can feel very much like the house is " watching " you , like some giant " head " rising out of the hillside .
I went past it a while back and it had crows circling above it .
It was one of those ' wish I had my camera ' moments .
I have seen the ' tax collector ' fellow at da Windhoose .
We were parked at da road haein a sandwich and a tall man walked across the front o da hoose and in through a wall .
He was very tall , wearing a top hat , and had a long coat on .
3 others in da car saw it .
It was only when I returned home and read a bit aboot da hoose that what I saw was accurately described in the book .
It was not a living person .
A Postcard Postscript ( February 2007 )
Since posting the new content above , reader Justine Bainbridge in Stirling Scotland contacted me with a reference to the ghost .
Her great - grandmother lived in Windhouse in the early 1900's , and she has old photographs of the era .
Katie Sutherland was the sister of Alice Georgina Sutherland , Justine 's great - grandmother .
She received this postcard referring to the ghost .
Postcard recipient Katie Sutherland
Windhouse Grounds , a resident .
( Update 2014 : Reader Elizabeth Morewood says this was taken in Fetlar at Brough Lodge , not Windohouse )
Justine 's Sutherland relations ( including Katie ) are all listed on this Shetland geneology site with address as Windhouse , Mid Yell .
The ramparts of the still - built Windhouse are visible in this photo of a fellow with a dog , which Justine also passed on to me .
It 's exciting to see some real people who were associated with the house and knew one of the ghosts personally .
More Stories from the Bainbridges ( October 2007 )
Justine 's aunt Kate contacted me and sent me some stories too .
As told to me by my father , Edward Hendersen Bainbridge : Windhouse has many stories of haunting .
Built , I have been told , on an old Celtic burial ground this is not an ideal site for a happy home !
From Phil Mortimer
Over the years my father told me many tales of his experiences there as a child , the weird noises , people appearing and disappearing , seemingly just walking through walls .
I remember well when my uncle and my father would get together and talk of the old house and what a strange place it was .
One experience they both remembered was of a ghostly dog .
My father watched his brother put out his hand to stroke the strange dog and it disappeared immediately he touched it , right before their eyes !
Many a tale was told to me of the guests that came to stay and would not stay the night , packing their belongings and leaving , whatever the time or the weather conditions .
The whole house was apparently subject to haunting and although the winds out in these remote parts were severe and chilling there was no explanation for the cold spots that my family would encounter .
In places where there was no usual draughts the air could turn to ice .
Laughter and disembodied voices of people could be heard in empty rooms , especially the bedrooms .
There was one bedroom in particular that people refused to go into .
According to my father , there was an incident where the maid tried to make the bed and ran out of the room because every time she tried to make it someone started laughing .
From Phil Mortimer
The legend of the body under the stairs is correct .
My family had workmen in to do some job or another that involved lifting the floor boards .
It was then that the skeleton was found , apparently with its skull broken , possibly by a blow to the head my father said .
Objects that hold spirits are a fascination of mine and I remember one tale of my fathers that include such a thing , an old sea chest .
The old sea chest used to stand in the hall and one day my father tried to get into it to have a look what was inside but it was locked .
As he examined the chest , looking for a way to open it , a strange mist appeared at one of its corners and proceeded to rise above the chest .
The mist then formed a cloud , and from the cloud grew the apparition of a man .
Seconds after the formation took place it disappeared back into the chest where it came from .
From Phil Mortimer
The types of haunting were so varied and so many as to suggest that the house itself was like a crossover point between this world and that of spirit .
It is my understanding that it takes a considerable amount of energy for an apparition to occur and my next account certainly describes a considerable amount of energy increase and decrease .
One evening the family had gone out for a walk and by the time they returned it was dark .
My father recalls the whole family standing there on the road up to the house in disbelief as one by one , each window of the house became a bright blaze of light .
In only a few seconds the entire house was lit up like a beacon .
Just as mysteriously as it had happened , the lights started to go out one by one until the house was again in darkness .
Windhouse had no electricity , either by mains or generator .
From Phil Mortimer
There are other tales I recall from my father about the house and its strange history .
According to him my family would trade with the Russian ships that came in to dock on the island .
He had many accounts of the weird and wonderful things they used to trade but sadly I have forgotten exactly what they were apart from unusual foods and clothing .
One thing that never left my mind was the fact that Wind House basically had an arsenal of weapons !
I dont mean just shotguns for going out shooting game either ; I mean high powered rifles , boxes of shells and dynamite !
The mind boggles .
My father used to recall how irresponsible his mother must have been as she would cheerfully give him a handful of shells , a rifle and tell him to go down to the beach and shoot things to keep him amused and out of her way .
Oh , one more ghost story !
A couple of my family came to visit at Wind House and tried to stay the night .
When tired and wanting to go to bed they could not or would not go up the stairs because of the darkness .
This was no ordinary darkness , when a paraffin lamp was shoved into the darkness the lamp and the light from it disappeared .
Guess what , they didnt stay the night either !
It is a strange place with a strange history .
I hope the new owners treat it with respect and that they and the old tenants get along OK .
Old News Article from 1898 ( Posted Dec 2014 )
Reader Dave Hamilton found an old news story in the Shetland Times , Saturday February 19 , 1898 , which might account for some of the extensive damage to the building :
On Sunday evening last a short but very severe thunderstorm passed over the Yell district .
Sunday night was very dark , and about nine o'clock several flashes of lightning were observed , and there were heavy showers at intervals , but about ten o'clock the lightning became much brighter and was accompanied by thunder .
The thundercloud appeared to be extremely near , judging by the shortness of time between the flashes of lightnight and the sound of the thunder .
The thunder was not particularly loud , but the lightning was very bright and of bluish colour .
The storm only lasted a short time , but next morning it was found that considereable damage had been done at Windhouse , near Mid-Yell .
The Manor House of Windhouse stands on a height above the road leading to Westsandwick , and between the heads of Whalfirth and Mid-Yell Voe .
It has not been occupied by a tenant for some considerable time , but under the last proprietor it underwent extensive alterations and was fitted up in quite a modern style .
This house had been struck by lightning on Sunday night , and a lot of damage has been done .
The kitchen gable had been struck and a hole torn at the foundation , and the wall split almost half up .
The bathroom roof is very much broken and the window of this room torn entirely off and the glass smashed .
The chimney top and cans at east [ each ? ] end of main house was entirely knocked down , and in the dining room underneath , the grate was thrown out on the floor .
This is all the more remarkable , as it was securely screwed in its place .
The ridge is torn off the house , and in the roof there are seven holes at different places .
One hole at the ridge is opened right through slate , felt , and wood so that a person could pass through .
At the eave on south side a similar hole is made , and the plate glass in the drawing - room completely smashed .
In the garden wall at north side a hole has been torn out near the ground , right throught [ sic ] the wall .
In addition to the damage done to the house , ten tups and a ewe belonging to Mr Thomas Ogilvy were found dead in the vicinity .
Where the wall was broken through at the north side three tups were lying dead ; another three were found in front of the garden wall ; two were outside the easy dyke , and two at the back of the kitchen , the ewe being found there also .
One tup has its leg broken and the wool torn off one side , and another is frightfully burned and mangled .
The loss of so many valuable animals is a serious matter for the owner , and people sympathise with Mr Jack , the genial manager of Windhouse farm , in the accident that has befallen the stock under his charge .
The damage to the house is also very considerable .
Fortunately , damage of this kind through lightning is a rare occurrence in Shetland .
Some years ago a crofter 's house at East Yell was partly knocked down , but the present damage is far more extensive and done to a building of much stronger construction .
It may be mentioned that the thunder was accompanied by a hail shower of great violence .
The hailstones were of a large size .
Links to the first half and remainder in jpg are here and here .
Incidentally , there seems to have been no development to the house since the purchase years ago .
On Google Satellite it appears a ruin still .
I 've told many horror stories about my " time served " in corporate America .
When I started this blog a year ago I was still incarcerated .
I would tell people the insane stories about my job and the general environment I was in and the response was always the same : QUIT .
Now I 'm hearing it again in regards to others ' stories that I post here .
Of course , quitting is much easier said than done .
For me , the moment that things got really bad at work I dedicated my LIFE to saving my sanity and getting out of that hell - hole of a job .
Granted , I probably should have started seeing the writing on the wall before the s*** really hit the fan , but I was in denial ... as many people are ( and quite frankly I had great benefits : 4 weeks vacation , fully vested in 401k , and I had a great reputation with everyone outside of my immediate boss ) .
Things were not yet at the point where people would tell me I should quit .
Things were just ... getting uncomfortable .
From the time things went from bad to worse until the day I fled , 18 months had elapsed .
During that time I sent out 200 " cold " resumes ( from which I had ONE decent lead ... plus many other offers to sell various insurance policies and products door - to - door ) , followed about two dozen " warm " leads ( interviews from recommended sources – my friends in the business ) , networked my tail off and filled up my business card folio with 96 cards .
Although I had some great responses , some extremely close calls ( I could have had a hot job at Viacom if they did n't completely change management ) , and even an offer ( with longer hours and a pay cut that would have forced me to take a part - time job ) , I was unable to make my way out .
I spent everyday in tears .
There was n't anything anybody could tell me that would make it better .
I cried when I woke up , I cried when I went to lunch , I cried when I went home , and I cried when people told me it was time to find another job ( as if I did n't know and was n't already actively pursuing that goal for 18 months ! ) .
I also cried out of frustration .
I knew I needed to leave and began to devise ways where I could just quit .
Time and again I 'd heard stories of people quitting their jobs with nothing to go to , but I was too terrified to do that and had too much at stake ( bills , mortgage , etc ) .
You really can't just quit a job without some kind of strategy .
So I developed a strategy .
To every person out there in a hazardous work situation ( hazardous to your physical , mental , and emotional health ) :
You CAN quit your job !!!
It takes planning and effort , but it can be done .
Here 's what you do :
- Investigate your financial status .
Develop an additional savings plan that will enable you to quit your job .
Cut everything out that is not absolutely necessary .
Use your 401k only when ( and if ) your savings runs dry .
- Once you determine your financial situation , plan a " drop dead " date .
How long will you need to do what you need to do to get everything in order before you quit ?
3 months ?
6 months ?
A year ?
( It took me a year when I finally made the choice ) .
- Find something to do .
You quit your job … now what ?
You ’re either going to look for something else in your field or try something completely different .
I did the latter : I formed Pied Piper Consulting , wrote a book about my corporate hell experiences ( Lead , Follow , or Get Out of the Way … to come out around Thanksgiving … stay tuned for details ) , and picked up work as a freelance writer to help with the bills in the meantime .
Something I recommend to people in this situation that do n’t know what they want to be when they grow up , is to take a personality test .
It ’s a fantastic guide – I did it and it revealed some very real career possibilities … as a matter of fact , I ’m living one of them !
The journey was a tough one .
Frankly , I ’m struggling even now but : I ’m the happiest I ’ve ever been in my career .
Things are moving slowly , but they are moving – and in the right direction .
That ’s good enough for me .
Every day I wake up thankful for the decision I made .
People , you need to remember : this life is not a dress rehearsal .
Both of my parents had strokes at young ages .
My father ’s parents also suffered strokes .
My older brother ( who 's still young ) has been known to have high blood pressure .
You see where this is going ?
Right – life ’s too short to work so hard and be taken advantage of .
I know how good I am and I know what I can contribute to a company and to society .
I ’m doing it now on my own terms .
You can too .
Women follow the gaze of a familiar face more readily than men do , researchers suggest , after carrying out a curious , small study .
Michael Platt at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina , US , and colleagues asked 32 volunteers to watch a screen that showed the face of either a stranger or a colleague looking to the right or left for 200 milliseconds ( one - fifth of a second ) .
The participants then waited to see whether a dot appeared on the right or left of a screen , and pressed one of two buttons accordingly .
Under all conditions , women in the study were slightly slower than the men to push the buttons , the team found .
But when a familiar onscreen face looked at the side opposite to which the dot appeared , the women performed even worse – taking about 24 milliseconds longer than men to press the button , on average .
In cases where the familiar face gazed toward the side where the dot then appeared women lagged behind men by only 10 milliseconds .
Although the experiment involved few subjects , and all the onscreen faces were all of men , Platt believes it is possible to draw some general conclusions from the findings .
He says the results suggest that women follow the attention of familiar faces more closely than men do , and that brain differences between men and women might account for this finding .

Potential skew
Previous studies have shown that the brain regions that process facial expressions – including the amygdala and obritofrontal gyrus – are highly sensitive to sex hormones .
But Platt stresses it remains unclear whether potential brain differences are innate or the product of environmental influences .
He does admit that since all of the “ familiar ” faces used in the experiment were pictures of men , the results could be skewed .
We hope to conduct similar experiments in the future using familiar female faces , he adds .
More experiments are needed to find out why the gaze of familiar faces influences women more than men , Platt ’s team says .
They claim that understanding this difference could shed light on the causes of autism , which affects four times more males than females .

Home Practical Type Inference Based on Success Typings
We show that it is possible to reconstruct a significant portion of the type information which is implicit in a program , automatically annotate function interfaces , and detect definite type clashes without fundamental changes to the philosophy of the language or imposing a type system which unnecessarily rejects perfectly reasonable programs .
To do so , we introduce the notion of success typings of functions .
Unlike most static type systems , success typings incorporate subtyping and never disallow a use of a function that will not result in a type clash during runtime .
Unlike most soft typing systems that have previously been proposed , success typings allow for compositional , bottom - up type inference which appears to scale well in practice .

Trojans now outnumber viruses and worms four to one
Sophos security said that the 10 most commonly found pieces of malicious software all targeted Windows machines .
In contrast , it said , none of the " malware " were capable of infecting the Mac OS X operating system .
Microsoft has pledged that the latest version of its operating system , known as Vista , will be its most secure yet .
One analyst told the BBC News website that the reason why there are fewer viruses and worms on Mac systems is that the smaller user base makes them a less attractive target for hackers .
Microsoft Windows currently runs on nearly one billion computers worldwide .
The latest version will be released later this year .
" It is our goal to give PC users the control and confidence they need so they can continue to get the most out of their PCs , " a Microsoft spokesperson said .
" Windows Vista contains a number of new safety features that , taken together , are designed to make Windows PCs more secure and online experiences safer . "
Microsoft said that security on Vista would be an integral part of the operating system rather than an add - on like in previous systems .
Top threats
The advice from Sophos was given as it released a report , detailing the security threats posed to computers so far in 2006 .
The report says that there has been a vast drop in malicious software like viruses and worms .
It seems likely that Macs will continue to be the safer place for computer users for some time to come
Graham Cluley , Sophos
Trojans are pieces of malicious software that are hidden in other legitimate programs such as downloaded screensavers .
The Trojan may collect financial information or allow the infected computer to be controlled remotely for sending spam or launching web attacks .
" The continuing rise of malware will concern many - the criminals responsible are obviously making money from their code , otherwise they 'd give up the game , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos .
Mac flaws
Although Trojans dominate the list of security threats , the most widespread problem was the Sober - Z worm .
The worm , which was spread by e-mail , infected people 's computers and tried to turn off security settings .
It replicated by looking for other e-mail addresses on the computers ' hard drives .
STAYING SAFE ONLINE
Install anti-virus software Keep your anti-virus software up to date Install a personal firewall Use Windows updates to patch security holes
Use reputable anti-spyware programs such as AdAware or Spybot Do not open e-mail messages that look suspicious
Do not click on e-mail attachments you were not expecting
The worm infected computers running the Windows operating system , but was not designed to infect Apple Macs .
" It seems likely that Macs will continue to be the safer place for computer users for some time to come , " said Mr Cluley .
" [ That is ] something that home users may wish to consider if they 're deliberating about the next computer they should purchase , " he added .
But Brian Gammage , an analyst at Gartner research does not believe the advice is well founded .
The number of people using Macs is far less than those using Window 's based PCs , he said .
" If you have smaller walls , you attract less graffiti , " he said .
" There is nothing architecturally safer about Macs .
If everyone moved to them then the situation would change overnight "
Earlier this year , a security flaw in the way that Macs downloaded files was identified ; while three concept viruses and a worm written specifically for Apple computers were also discovered .
The viruses were never released into the " wild " and posed little security threat .
新興企業 のFlockは、社名と同じ名称のブラウザ「Flock」のバージョン1.0を、2006年の秋にリリースする予定だ。このブラウザは、ウェブサーフィンにソーシャルネットワーキングを組み合わせることができる。
オープンソースブラウザ「 Firefox 」をベースに開発され たFlockの機能は、いわゆる「 Web 2.0」サービスの共通テーマである共有とコミュニケーションに焦点を絞っている。同ブラウザは、「Flickr」や「del.icio.us」といったWebサービスとの連携を強化する方向で改良が進められている。
無料ブラウザ のFlockには、画面の上部に「 Photobar」があり、横一列に写真が並んでいる。このPhotobarに、写真共有サービスを利用している友人の画像ページを登録しておくと、友人がページを更新するたびに、Photobarから新しい写真を閲覧できる。画像をPhotobarにドラッグ＆ドロップして、写真共有サイトにアップロードすることも可能だ。
カリフォルニア州マウンテンビューに拠点を置くFlockの最高戦略責任者（CSO）、Geoffrey Arone氏は、いささか停滞気味のブラウザの世界を活性化することを目標に、同社は1年半ほど前に設立されたと、米国時間8月2日に語った。
Mozilla Foundation のFirefoxブラウザは、大勢のユーザーを獲得しているが、タブブラウザ機能をのぞけば、実際の使用感は旧来のブラウザとそれほど変わらない、とArone氏は指摘する。
「 どのようなブラウザを開発すれば、ユーザーがオンライン参加をよりよいものにするうえで役立つか、われわれは調べてみることにした」とArone氏。
Arone氏によると 、Flockは人気のブログサービスとリンクしているという。それにより、同ブラウザのRSSリーダーからニュース記事を読んだり、マウスを1回右クリックするだけでその記事に関するブログを投稿したりできる。
そのほか、デスクトップ検索と「 Yahoo Search」によるウェブ検索を同時に実行できる機能もある。また、ブックマークを共有したり、コンテンツをブラウザ画面最下部の「 Web Clipboard」に保存することもできる。
「これらが組み合わされた（機能強化の）体験は、ウェブ消費のライフサイクルに貢献する--それにより人々は、新しいコンテンツの発見と創造、コンテンツの消費と共有が可能になる」と、Arone氏は語る。
Webサービスとの緊密な統合は、同社の収益モデルの基盤にもなっている。
たとえば 、Flockから検索が行われた場合は、同社と検索プロバイダが売り上げを分け合い、ユーザーが「Amazon.com」から商品を購入した場合は、同社と売り手が売り上げを分け合うことができる、とArone氏は説明する。
2005 年10月にFlockのベータ版を初めてリリースしたとき、Flockはメディアに大々的に取り上げられたが、製品に十分な安定性がないため、ユーザーから否定的な意見も寄せられた、とArone氏は振り返る。
リリース後のフィードバックを受けて、同社は開発プロセスを見直し、顧客にさらに意見を求めざるを得なくなったという。
「 かつてわれわれは、夢のようなアイデアと崇高な野心をあれこれ抱えていた。だが、焦点の定まらない革命は、混乱を招くものだ」と、Arone氏は語った。
毎 年1月にスイスのダボスで開催される「 World Economic Forum」には、世界各国の指導者や政財界人などが参加し、人類が現在置かれている状況について議論を戦わせている。
今年、同会議で新たに取り上げられたテーマの中には、世界の「情報を持つ者」と「持たざる者」との間にあるテクノデバイド（情報格差）をいかに埋めるか、という問題があった。
例によって、この問題に対する明確かつ最善の回答は見いだせなかったが、その原因は情報格差の解消に向けた取り組み方について参加者の間に大きな隔たりがあることにある。この問題について、一方の考えを代表するのは、米マサチューセッツ工科大学（MIT）Media Labの創設者であ るNicholas Negroponteだ。同氏は、100ドルのノートPCを開発したいと考えている。しかし、Microsoftは別の考えを持っており、自社の強大な力を利用して、自ら「セルラーPC」と名付けたコンセプトを推進しようとしている。
今のところ、どちらの構想も実現には程遠い状況にあるといっていい。しかし、少なくとも会議の出席者らが未来について考えていることは評価すべきだ。そして彼らの幸運を祈らなくてはならない。彼らの構想が実現すれば、世界各国の数千万人の人々がようやくハイテク革命のもたらす恩恵の一部を享受できるようになる。
しかし、まだ先は長い。ハイテク業界には偏狭的な考えから進められている論議が多いが、情報格差をめぐるこの論争も例外ではない。なにか画期的な出来事でもあれば話は別だが、たいていの場合は長期間にわたる徹底的な論争を経た後に解決策が生み出されることになっている。この点については、この後すぐに詳述するが、その前にまず2つのアプローチの長所について考えてみよう。
セルラーPCには2つの大きな利点がある。携帯電話は低価格な上に、どこにでも存在しているという点だ。私は南米を訪問する（私は頻繁に南米を訪れている）度に、いつもそのことを実感する。空港の税関を通過した後に、私の半分眠った状態の頭はいつも空港中に鳴り響く携帯電話の着信音で叩き起こされる。空港にいるあらゆる人間（文字通り、すべての人）がベルトから携帯電話をぶら下げているように見える。そして、誰もが携帯電話を使用している。実際にみんなが携帯電話を使っている。携帯電話をPC代わりに使うというのはとにかく便利で、価格のほうもさほど高くはない。
Microsoftは2005年秋以来、セルラーPCのプロトタイプを相次いで発表してきた。同社の上級幹部らはセルラーPCの構想がまだ完全には固まっていないとしながらも、それが従来のデスクトップPCやラップトップPCに代わる、主に発展途上国をターゲットにした低価格で入手可能なPCになると考えている。ここまでは何ら問題はない。
しか しMicrosoftの構想では、外部に表示するためにテレビを利用する必要がある。そうなると、ユーザーはアダプターや特別に作られたキーボードを購入しなければならない。だからといって交渉が破談になることはないが、Microsoftはそれらの予定価格を明らかにしていない。コストが1ドル、1ペソ、1レアル上昇するごとに状況は大きく変わってくる。確かに、私はこれまで、ブラジルの人里離れた貧民街で、かなり多くの家の屋根に衛星テレビのパラボラアンテナが取り付けられているのを目撃してきたが、貧しい人々は自分たちが食べていくのも厳しい状況だ。仮にパンかテレビのどちらを購入するかという選択を迫られたら、彼らは迷うことなく前者を選ぶだろう。
また、それらの機器を動かす電源をどうするか、という問題もある。Microsoft会長のBill Gatesはこれまで、病気撲滅を目的とした活動への寄付を通じて素晴らしい功績を残してきた。しかしGatesはビジネス界の大物として恐れられ、時には嫌われることもある。
現在 、Symbianオペレーティングシステム（OS）を搭載した携帯電話が多く出回っているが、GatesはMicrosoft製OSを標準にしたいと考えている。しかし、彼の考えに同意すれば、Microsoftのさらなる独占の土台を築くことになる。同社の独占禁止法違反の歴史が人々の記憶に新しい現状では、同社がセルラーPCを売り込むのは極めて困難だろう。
MIT のNegroponteは、まもなくタイ、エジプト、ナイジェリア、インド、中国、ブラジル、アルゼンチンの7カ国と、合わせて700万台、総額にして7億ドルに及ぶ100ドルPCの売買契約を締結すると見られている。100ドルという価格は魅力だ。しかし、Negroponteは見せて回るためのサンプル機をわずか1台しか所有していない。同氏によると、100ドルPCの生産は台湾のQuanta Computerに委託し、プロセッサはAdvanced Micro Devices（AMD）製を使用するという。しかし、実際に稼動するノートPCを、早ければ1年後に見られるだろうなどと期待してはいけない。
さらに、まだ答えが出ていない大きな問題がもう1つ残っている。それは、インターネットへの接続費用だ。製品の価格に高額な接続料が上乗せされれば、100ドルPCのコストは容易に2〜3倍に増加してしまう。Negroponteはさまざまな反対論を退け、2〜3の地上インターネット回線を共有する1000台のPCが自動的に接続しあうようなシステムを思い描いている。このシステムはたしかに理屈の上では素晴らしいが、実際にそのシステムを自分の目で見るまでは、そうしたものがうまくいくとは信じられない。
では、MicrosoftとNegroponteは互いに協力する道を模索したらどうか。2人ともそれぞれのプロジェクトについて真剣に考えているではないか。
私はいまでも、Microsoftの上級幹部（地上か らCraig Mundieへ、まだ着陸していませんか）から説明を聞こうとしている。おそらくNegroponteがオープンソースソフトウェアを選んだことで、Microsoftは独自路線を進むべきだと確信したのだろう。先ごろThe New York Timesで掲載されたある記事によると、NegroponteがWindows CEのようなMicrosoft製OSの代わりにRed HatのLinux採用を決めたことについて、Gatesは内心苦々しく思っているという。
さらに、この先にはもっと別の障害もある。しかし、革命的なアイデアはどれも難題にぶつかるものだ。そこで必要なのはコンセプトを現実に変える方法を見つけ出すこと。世界の貧しい人々を、ビジネスをめぐる駆け引きや個人的なエゴから、再び落胆させることにでもなれば、なんと恥ずかしいことだろう。

Dignity is Deadly , Part Two
In an earlier post , I talked about Paul Graham 's talk at Amazon , on what the corporate world can learn from start - ups .
The point that stuck with me the most is this :
When you evolve out of start - up mode and start worrying about being professional and dignified , you only lose capabilities .
You do n't add anything ... you only take away .
Dignity is deadly .
So I made a list of what I 've found in start - ups versus what I 've lived in the corporate world .
I painted this in the extreme on both sides , of course .
Or did I ?
I 'm not saying start - ups could n't learn a thing or two from Big Business , but keep in mind the name of this blog .
We 're not doing Best Business Practices For Maximixing Profit .
This is about creating passionate users .
The good news is the big( ish ) companies that " get it " are working hard to incorporate the best of both cultures .
There 's no REAL reason why a big , established company cannot keep the start - up spirit alive , while still running a business and yes , maximizing shareholder value .
And as each day goes by , the chances that your users / customers / clients are from the gamer generation goes up .
That 's the best news of all ... because the post - boomers do n't give a damn about your " professionalism " .
They want to know how you can help them kick ass , and why you do n't have a blog .

" There 's no REAL reason why a big , established company cannot keep the start - up spirit alive , while still running a business and yes , maximizing shareholder value . "
In theory , I think I can accept this as true .
In practice , what big , established company has truly kept the start - up spirit alive ?

As a post - boomer , I disagree a little bit .
I want , if not a sense of professionalism , a sense of reliability from the companies I purchase or interact with .
Professionalism does n't guarantee reliability , of course , but there is a high correlation .
That is , why the heck would I sign up for the pro version of your web app if I thought that my data was vulnerable or that I 'd have trouble getting to it when I needed it .
Or why would I hire your firm for a job if there was n't any historical data ( you know , completed projects , stuff like that ) that you and your guys could get the job done .
If a company can both help me kick ass and kick that ass on a regular timetable , then fuck yeah , let 's rock and roll !

Provocative as always , Kathy , which is what makes life .
I agree 100 % with the sentiments here , except for one point .
You 're missing a valuable source of information if you do n't think and know a lot about the competition .
As Isaac Newton said in explaining how he got those amazing thoughts ( gravity for example .. ) , I stood on the shoulders of giants .
Well those giants can be your competitors .

" There 's no REAL reason why a big , established company cannot keep the start - up spirit alive "
I have to say I disagree with this statement .
Those people who get involved with start - ups , either the founders or the early employees , are people who are attracted to all the points you list on the left of the chart .
As the business grows and becomes more established , the job applicants change .
By definition these are not people who are attracted to " the start - up spirit " - if they were they'd be starting their own company rather than applying to yours for a job .
And once they become the majority that 's it , the underlying ( unspoken of course ) sentiment is " let 's be careful " rather than " let 's bet it all on red " .
Great list though !
Can I add another category ?
Listens to : ( start - up ) our guts , ( corporate ) our stakeholders

There are reasons for professional standards .
It 's important to understand them but in the end you should n't let them hold you back .
I think that is the message .

As a pastor , I definitely see and feel the reality of this article .
How many new church plants grow exponentially ( sometimes hopping from meeting place to meeting place ) while established congregations die protecting their reputations ( professionalism ) and edifices .
I want the start - up spirit that does the impossible because they do n't know they are not suppose to !

I think part of it is size .
Not all but a significant chunk .
So with bigger companies you have to fight a lot harder to stay fun , innovative , etc .
My friend Kevin Meagher 's consulting company refuses to grow past 50 people .
( Last I heard , at least . )
They 're very good , very much in demand , could do ten times the work and make more money , but what they have works .
GoreTex , I believe , divides its departments / divisions into no more than 200 or so people .
Bigger than that , you can't at least have heard of all the people in the department , and accountability and other stuff slides .
When a group grows past that mark , they divide it into two or somehow manage to preserve the small size .
My best ever employment experience by orders of magnitude , Great Plains Software in Fargo ND ( now owned by MS .... ) was about 250 when I joined .
Very low salary , not much for cubes , especially when we moved into a factory outlet mall .
But we LOVED our jobs .
For many reasons but one was that the CEO knew what was important , made it very clear to everyone what the values of the company were , and rewarded those behaviors publicly and frequently .
If you had a good idea , you were allowed to implement it , and then you got rewarded .
Amazing .
Have n't found that culture since .
( Why did I leave ?
Kinda cold . )
So --it 's not the only factor , of course , but some aspects of corporate culture come from size .
Not always size of the company but size of your " world " you work in , the department as in the Goretex example .
Though of course you can certainly have a soul - sucking small company , as well . ;>
Posted by : Solveig Haugland | Mar 1 , 2006 8:31:01 AM
Perhaps an equivalent way of saying the same thing is that the corporate world does n't have a lot of humility .
There 's a lot of ego associated with marketshare and position and other status indicators .
Ironically , creating neat us vs. them tables actually fosters corporate - style status seeking and ego because it focuses attention on a set of criteria which we are encouraged to measure and rank with .
From there , its just a few steps from becoming a superficial exercise in checking off boxes .
You can observe this phenomenon at work with AJAX / Web 2.0 , or even punk rock - the enthusiasm for something different ends up creating a set of criteria that trend - followers can appropriate and misuse .
The danger is that these new , revolutionary ways of thinking will become codified and become a set of rigid and inflexible blinders much like the one 's the corporate world is currently wearing .
The line of thinking we have here is remarkably corporate , because it sets two philosophies in competition to each other to see which is better , which is quite a reversal when the same people also claim to shun competition and are focus purely on enjoying what they do .
I would encourage people to live and let live a bit more , and to the extent that criticism is useful and called for , focus on the general principles .
Posted by : Mike | Mar 1 , 2006 11:59:32 AM
There is merit to what you say , but I think your exageration also points to a flaw in your logic .
What good is " professionalism " ?
Repeatability , reliability .
CMM level 3 + is boring as all get - out , gobs of useless - seeming documentation , archiving , training , etc , BUT it has the advantage of producing at least " average " product over and over and over .
The " startup mode " will produce exceptional stuff occasionally , but there will be a LOT of stuff produced that quite frankly , is disgusting .
Oh , and in that same neighborhood , startups frequently will be lax on important standards of Many kinds , including things like workplace harassment training ...
Posted by : greenup | Mar 1 , 2006 1:11:46 PM
Thanks for adding to the discussion ( and pointing out flaws ) .
It can only help ...
Rob : there are at least * pieces * of established companies that are able to do this , but it 's often through pirate projects or skunkworks .
But I might claim that Amazon , has at least some of this , despite their growth .
That said , Amazon might have a bit too MUCH of the start - up mentality when it comes to scaling .
But that 's another topic .
Jeff : I 've been stuffed away as a server - side girl for the last six years .
You 're assuming I 'd have a clue how to do an HTML table .
I tried to get away with it by saying you can't drag a table to your desktop .
You know , it 's a feature not a bug ...
But I hear you -- I acknowledged I was doing something bad , but it does n't excuse it .
Barry : " You 're missing a valuable source of information if you do n't think and know a lot about the competition "
Hmmm ...
I was n't clear about that -- when I said , " irrelevant " , I did n't mean that they did n't know or care , but rather that they were doing something in a space where competition did not yet exist -- the Blue Ocean approach , where you are uncontested in whatever " market " you are in .
So yes , I agree with you -- you should DEFINITELY know as much as possible about what else is out there , if for no other reason than to learn what needs are not currently served , or where users are frustrated .
Danno , and others :
This really depends on your definition of " professionalism " .
I agree that trust and quality are EXTREMELY important , and must be communicated in some way .
I 'm assuming that the start - up cares deeply about quality , but I did n't make that clear .
greenup : " BUT it has the advantage of producing at least " average " product over and over and over .
The " startup mode " will produce exceptional stuff occasionally , but there will be a LOT of stuff produced that quite frankly , is disgusting . "
Completely agree on all counts .
But again , this post ( and this blog ) is not about producing average or even * good * products .
This is not a management blog -- it 's about creating passionate users , and it 's worth producing some really bad things to get to the f'n amazing and exceptional things .
Mike : " The line of thinking we have here is remarkably corporate , because it sets two philosophies in competition to each other to see which is better "
This is exactly why I do it .
This notion of putting too philosophies in competition , especially when there are conflicting and compelling points on each side , is a foundation of the learning principles we apply here and in our classrooms or books .
Facing cognitive dissonance , the brain is virtually * forced * to think more deeply rather than simply skimming the surface .
It 's almost impossible for a brain to NOT do it .
The fact that y'all have found flaws on both sides , and agree with some and disagree with others is the important part .
In our books , we consider this one of our best tools for getting brains to flex more neurons .
There is no one true answer .
In our books , we implement this all over the place through interviews between two characters ( including anthropomorphized parts of a system ) , debates , " fireside chats " , etc. , many of which take extreme positions on both sides .
It would n't surprise me if down the road I made a post that would seem to contradict what this one says , if only because it points the flashlight in a different spot in the same room .
Mike : I could not agree more with you on this :
" You can observe this phenomenon at work with AJAX / Web 2.0 , or even punk rock - the enthusiasm for something different ends up creating a set of criteria that trend - followers can appropriate and misuse .
The danger is that these new , revolutionary ways of thinking will become codified and become a set of rigid and inflexible blinders much like the one 's the corporate world is currently wearing . "
The question is , how can we avoid that ?
It 's happening everywhere , and so quickly it 's scary .
I suppose there 's a danger that putting up lists like this one only adds to the problem , but I have greater faith in the readers here than that .
And the comments on this particular post are evidence .
Selfishly , it means I get to learn from everyone else here .
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Mar 1 , 2006 2:12:15 PM
I think a good bit of what happens is caused by basic social instincts based on group size .
People behave differently depending on the size of the group they see themselves in .
Standing up in front of a group of 5 is very different from a group of 50 or a group of 5000 .
In a small group you 're thinking , " can we be friends ? " " do you understand me ? "
In a medium size group you start to become conscious of the primate pecking order .
" Who is the leader ? "
" What is the dominant person doing ? "
Finally , in a very large group the herd dynamic takes over .
" How can I avoid being noticed ? "
I 'm sure this has its roots in basic primate brain behavior .
So what we need are the tricks to get past this , just like the Head First books use tricks to get past the primitive brain barriers to learning .
What are the mind - hacks to getting larger groups to function effectively ?
I would bet that a " startup " with 1000 employees would act much the same as an older company within weeks of its founding .
( Would n't that be a fun experiment , though ! )
Posted by : Charlie Evett | Mar 1 , 2006 5:02:12 PM
What a great list - had me laughing out loud .
May I suggest some additions ?
When we screw up :
Startup : Admit it , apologize , fix it , compensate customers , move on .
Corporate : Try to hide it .
When that fails , blame the customers .
Meetings :
Startup : Fun , chaotic , everyone is heard .
Corporate :
The boss talks , you listen .
When you disagree with management :
Startup :
You 're valued .
Corporate : You 're fired .
Work - time :
Startup :
Whatever works for you
Corporate : 9 - 5 . On paper .
In reality : 9 - 9 .
Having children :
Startup :
Hell yeah .
Come back in 6 months .
Or when you 're ready .
Corporate :
Are you sure you want to jeopardize your career ?
When you succeed :
Startup :
The whole company celebrates with you .
Corporate : " Employee of the month " certificate .

I guess my problem is mainly one of where the focus is .
We 're not really comparing philosophies so much as we are looking at differences of expressions of those philosophies .
I 'd like to see more about why these differences exist , what they represent and why they are better / different .
To that end :
Its important to realize that some of these differences exist because of structural differences ( small vs. big ) between startups and corporations rather than philosophic differences .
Some of these Culture , Focus , Innovation , Voice , Public Image , Business Plan , Daily Reads .
If your startup becomes successful and expands , these things should be allowed to change or included without feeling like you are abandoning your principles .
For example , it is n't feasible for a large corporation to speak in an authentically human - to - human voice , because at that scale , you hire people whose job is to speak on behalf of other parts of the organization .
This is also partly due to philosophic differences which favors centralizing everything in one specialized department which co-ordinates all external communication , and some companies like Microsoft are moving toward softening this by decentralizing some of their communications with blogs .
But still , any large company needs some co-ordinated communication , and it would be a mistake to think that the absence or presence of it is a strong predictor of the underlying philosophy .
What 's more , it is possible to have blogs that are reviewed and controlled by a centralized authority within the company , even with small startups , and readers would never realize that .
A few of these differences are n't differences at all , like Competition and Passion .
Startups are always competing internally , with other startups , and of course , with the big guys .
Profit is a kind of passion for a certain kind of person .
Its true that for large technology companies , the people who actually work on the product are n't terribly passionate , but the business guys have a passion for doing the kinds of things that you get an MBA for .
Its not my thing , personally , but I can acknowledge that there 's something there that is fun for them .
The differences that I think are clearly philosophic include Presentation Style , Dress Code , Workspace , Corporate Office , You 'll Be Fired For .
I think the obsession with status , hierarchy , authority and bureaucracy reflects an essentialist philosophy which says there is a natural order such that certain people are meant to rule over or manage others , sometimes ignoring whether they are actually competent or not .
In some ways , our whole economic system is structured around this , because people are trained to become specialists , not generalists , which means that you take your place in the natural order .
Of course , this viewpoint has been eroding over the last century or two , we 're a bit more meritocratic than that , but I think this effect is still felt in business , especially with its obsession as status , which I see an effort to be perceived as Important , belonging somewhere higher up in the hierarchy .
One problem with this is that making business decisions based on some abstract concept of order such as " Men are natural leaders " or " Nobody can question the CEO because he 's like God " is frequently inefficient , which is one concern among several perhaps more serious ones involving civil rights , equality and so on .
There might be an argument there that people with a startup mentality are more likely to be liberal and libertarian than conservative in political outlook .
On the question of how to avoid codifying a philosophy , it may not be possible to do that , and what 's more , I suspect that you actually do n't want to do that .
It is sometimes easy to forget that organizations do n't exist just to deliver products to customers , they also function as communities for the employees , and its in this capacity that they become inflexible .
Its very comforting to believe that the world has a natural order and hierarchy to it , or the reverse of that , that everyone is equal and no - one 's opinion is any more valid than any other .
Communities coalesce around these ideas , and it is the function of a community to preserve the common ground that makes up interpersonal relationships , but this often comes at the expense of efficiency .
Additionally , communities often deal quite harshly with people who are perceived as threats .
Even supposedly inclusive communities do this , since all communities have a protective function for itself and its members , but that protection can become stifling too , as innovators from within are branded as traitors and cast out of the inner circle .
And so on .
I recommend Don Beck and Christopher Cowan 's Spiral Dynamics for those interested in understanding the various value systems among and within organizations and how to create change .

BBC News , Arlington , Virginia
Capt Nuneville speaking " plain language "
Captain Michelle Nuneville has a lot of un-learning to do .
After many years on the force the commander of the Arlington police department 's operations division is adjusting to life after the 10 - codes .
Since they were first introduced in the 1930s , abbreviations such as 10 - 4 and 10 - 20 have been the natural language of the American cop ; part of police folklore .
But , in Virginia they have decided that it is over and out for the 10 - codes .
On a drive through the streets of Arlington , Capt Nuneville explained that the problem was a lack of compatibility .
Individual counties have their own 10 - codes , and while some are common to all police forces , many are not .
As a car skidded to a halt next to us - narrowly avoiding a pedestrian - she was able to give a concrete example .
" If there had been an accident , " she said , " I would have called in a 10 - 50 , a 10 - 50 i if the pedestrian had been injured .
A 10 - 50f , if there 'd been a fatality .
" Now , I happen to known that in neighbouring Montgomery County , a 10 - 50 means ' officer in trouble ' . "
Contradictory codes
The codes were originally introduced in order to keep conversations brief on a single police radio channel - and have gone on to have a long and distinguished career .
Brevity on the airwaves is still preferable when mere seconds could save a life
Thomas Hejl ( right )
But the experience of Capt Nuneville and her colleagues on 11 September 2001 has proved to be the catalyst for their demise - in Virginia , at least .
When the plane hit the Pentagon that morning , the Arlington force found themselves co-ordinating rescue efforts , with the help of colleagues from neighbouring counties , who had offered their services .
But the contradictory 10 - codes complicated an already - confused situation , convincing the state authorities that it was time for a change .
In 2003 , Chris Essid was appointed Virginia 's first inter-operability co-ordinator - the official in charge of improving the state 's emergency communications .
He is the driving force behind the new linguistic regime .
" Just because your radio can talk to mine , " he said , " if you 're speaking Japanese and I 'm speaking Chinese we wo n't understand each other .
That 's what you can get with the codes .
And that 's no good in an emergency situation . "
The Virginia experiment is being watched very closely in neighbouring states - where not everyone is convinced that the codes can be jettisoned .
' Brevity preferable '
In Calvert County , Maryland , Assistant Sheriff Maj Thomas
Hejl says it is not about folklore or nostalgia , but about practicality .
Brevity on the airwaves is still preferable , he argues , when mere seconds could save a life , and the codes help to ground an officer in his job .
" When you come out and go to work you give a 10 - 8 , " he explained .
" It tells us you 're on duty .
It 's a world in and of itself , which lets the rest of us know what 's going on .
" If you do n't know the 10 - codes and are n't using them , you 're not doing what the public expects . "
The process of change will be gradual .
In Arlington , Capt Nuneville admits that it will be hard for officers - especially those who have been using the codes for many years - to adjust .
She also says there will have to be new guidelines .
" In one county officers took to saying okey dokey , rather than OK - and that 's just not professional , " she said .
And as we listened to the voices on her radio , it was clear that many dispatchers and officers are still using the old system .
Although not to the extent that I thought .
When I heard the dispatcher refer to a 10 - 18 and 10 - 37 , I asked Capt Nuneville what they meant .
" 1018 is the number of the house , she said .
And 10.37 ?
Look at your watch .
It 's the time . "

How can the man who is Prime Minister of this country
come into this parliament and say that he is a person
of experience on the question of national security
when within the last 24 hours he has made the statement
that , when it comes to the operation of al - Qaeda
and its dealings in the world of international affairs
today , somehow al - Qaeda is a terrorist organisation
that would prefer to see a Democrat win the next presidential
election rather than any other representative of
another political party ?
The Prime Minister today has inserted that in fact he
was only making a reference to Mr Obama , one of the
US Democratic Party presidential candidates .
It is important
that we place this unequivocally on the record .
Yesterday the Prime Minister gave this answer to a
question in relation to the Obama plan :
Yes , I think he is wrong .
I mean , he is a long way from being
President of United States .
I think he is wrong .
I think that
that would just encourage those who wanted completely to
destabilise and destroy Iraq and create chaos and victory for
the terrorists to hang on and to hope for an Obama victory .
If
I were running al Qaeda in Iraq I would put a circle around
March 2008 and pray as many times as possible for a victory —
not only for Obama but also for the Democrats .
That is not an addition invented by the Australian Labor
Party .
That is not an addition invented by anybody
else .
That was spoken , or would we dare say misspo -
ken , yesterday by the Prime Minister of Australia on a
matter of great consequence — that is , the future of this
country ’s relationship with the United States , particularly
on the question of the future direction of Iraq policy .
To accuse the Democratic Party of the United States
of being al - Qaeda ’s party of choice , to accuse the Democratic
Party of being the terrorists ’ party of choice ,
to accuse the party of Roosevelt , Truman , Kennedy and
Johnson of being the terrorists ’ party of choice is a
most serious charge .
I cannot understand how any responsible
leader of this country can say to the nation
that it is his serious view that the Democratic Party of
the United States is the terrorists ’ party of choice .
But
these are your words , Prime Minister .
I did not invent
them ; they are yours .
In this parliament today we gave
you every opportunity to say that you got it wrong .
The SPEAKER — Order !
The leader will refer his
remarks through the chair .
Mr RUDD — We gave the Prime Minister every opportunity
to say that it was wrong .
It may have been
that he got caught up in the flurry of the interview .
It
may have been that he did not hear it clearly .
It may
have been that he did not understand it clearly .
I understand
that these things can happen , but the Prime Minister
was given not once , not twice but on three separate
occasions in this place today an opportunity to say ,
‘ I got that wrong ; I did n’t mean that . ’
For him to pass
up each of those opportunities says much about the
partisan way this Prime Minister now views the relationship
with our great American ally .
Let us be absolutely clear about what is at stake
here .
This is not just an attack on a single US senator
but an attack upon an entire political party .
Here is
where Australia ’s national interest kicks in : the Democratic
Party currently controls the majority in the United
States House , controls the majority in the United States
Senate and , within a year or so , may control the White
House itself .
In this parliament today , this country ’s
Prime Minister has reaffirmed that he describes this
party as the terrorists ’ party of choice .
This is a serious
matter .
Prime Minister , can you imagine if I stood up in this
parliament as the alternative Prime Minister and said to
the people of Australia that the terrorists would be advantaged
if the Republicans were to return to the White
House at the next presidential election ?
Ponder for a
moment how that would be regarded .
How would it be
seized on by those opposite ?
Can you imagine the reaction
from those opposite if I stood at this dispatch box
or appeared on national television and said that the
Republicans , if they won , would cause an eruption of
joy on the part of al - Qaeda and on the part of terrorists ?
This is a grave mistake and I fear that it reflects a
deep view on the part of the Prime Minister about
those within the US political system with whom he
may not share a view .
