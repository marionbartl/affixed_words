For the first time ever , fewer than 90 % of computer users are running Windows .
The figures show the growing success of rival operating systems -- though there 's no sign of Microsoft losing its dominant position any time soon .
The figures come from Internet services firm Net Applications .
They regularly measure which operating system users are using when connecting to web sites .
While this is obviously not a perfect way to quantify market dominance , it does provide a decent sampling method given how many users have an Internet connection these days .
The figure for Windows in November was 89.6 % , a drop of 0.84 percentage points on last month .
Most of that share was lost to Mac systems which were up to 8.9 % .
Linux systems are at 0.83 % , with the iPhone now established in fourth place with 0.37 % , nearly ten times the share of the fifth place Sony Playstation .
Among Windows users , Windows XP was notably down , with Vista rising slightly .
That 's been a trend all year with the withdrawal of XP from most sales outlets , though the shift was notably large this month .
The trend away from Microsoft continues in figures for web browsers : Internet Explorer continues to lose share , while Mozilla 's Firefox topped 20 % for the first time .

There is one note of caution on reading too much into the exact figures : most calendar months have up to 23 work days , whereas last month there were 5 weekends in a 30 day period ( yielding 16 - 18 working days ) , plus many Americans took one or two days off for Thanksgiving .
Furthermore , home users are much more likely to be running Macs or experiment with alternative web browsers than those on work machines , so this does somewhat sway the figures .

However , there 's no denying that Windows is losing in popularity .
If Microsoft is to stop this trend , they need to act now .
WILKINS ICE SHELF , Antarctica ( Reuters ) - A huge Antarctic ice shelf is on the brink of collapse with just a sliver of ice holding it in place , the latest victim of global warming that is altering maps of the frozen continent .

“ We ’ve come to the Wilkins Ice Shelf to see its final death throes , ” David Vaughan , a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) , told Reuters after the first -- and probably last -- plane landed near the narrowest part of the ice .
The flat - topped shelf has an area of thousands of square kilometers , jutting 20 meters ( 65 ft ) out of the sea off the Antarctic Peninsula .
But it is held together only by an ever - thinning 40 - km ( 25 - mile ) strip of ice that has eroded to an hour - glass shape just 500 meters wide at its narrowest .
In 1950 , the strip was almost 100 km wide .
“ It really could go at any minute , ” Vaughan said on slushy snow in bright sunshine beside a red Twin Otter plane that landed on skis .
He added that the ice bridge could linger weeks or months .
The Wilkins once covered 16,000 sq km ( 6,000 sq miles ) .
It has lost a third of its area but is still about the size of Jamaica or the U.S. state of Connecticut .
Once the strip breaks up , the sea is likely to sweep away much of the remaining ice .
Icebergs the shape and size of shopping malls already dot the sea around the shelf as it disintegrates .
Seals bask in the southern hemisphere summer sunshine on icebergs by expanses of open water .
A year ago , BAS said the Wilkins was “ hanging by a thread ” after an aerial survey .
“ Miraculously we ’ve come back a summer later and it ’s still here .
If it was hanging by a thread last year , it ’s hanging by a filament this year , ” Vaughan said .
Nine other shelves have receded or collapsed around the Antarctic peninsula in the past 50 years , often abruptly like the Larsen A in 1995 or the Larsen B in 2002 .
The trend is widely blamed on climate change caused by heat - trapping gases from burning fossil fuels .
WARMING TO BLAME
“ This ice shelf and the nine other shelves that we have seen with a similar trajectory are a consequence of warming , ” Vaughan said .
In total , about 25,000 sq km of ice shelves have been lost , changing maps of Antarctica .
Ocean sediments indicate that some shelves had been in place for at least 10,000 years .
Vaughan stuck a GPS monitoring station on a long metal pole into the Wilkins ice on behalf of Dutch scientists .
It will track ice movements via satellite .
The shelf is named after Australian George Hubert Wilkins , an early Antarctic aviator who is set to join an exclusive club of people who have a part of the globe named after them that later vanishes .
Loss of ice shelves does not raise sea levels significantly because the ice is floating and already mostly submerged by the ocean .
But the big worry is that their loss will allow ice sheets on land to move faster , adding extra water to the seas .
Wilkins has almost no pent - up glaciers behind it .
But ice shelves further south hold back vast volumes of ice .
“ When those are removed the glaciers will flow faster , ” Vaughan said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula have warmed by about 3 Celsius ( 5.4 Fahrenheit ) since 1950 , the fastest rise in the southern hemisphere .
There is little sign of warming elsewhere in Antarctica .
BAS scientists and two Reuters reporters stayed about an hour on the shelf at a point about 2 km wide .
“ It ’s very unlikely that our presence here is enough to initiate any cracks , ” Vaughan said .
“ But it is likely to happen fairly soon , weeks to months , and I do n’t want to be here when it does . ”
The U.N. Climate Panel , of which Vaughan is a senior member , projected in 2007 that world sea levels were likely to rise by between 18 and 59 cm ( 7 and 23 inches ) this century .
But it did not factor in any possible acceleration of ice loss from Antarctica .
Even a small change in the rate could affect sea levels , and Antarctica ’s ice sheets contain enough water in total to raise world sea levels by 57 meters .
About 190 nations have agreed to work out a new U.N. treaty by the end of 2009 to slow global warming , reining in emissions from burning fossil fuels in power plants , cars and factories .
WE THE PEOPLE OF INDIA
have had enough .
Enough of terrorist attacks that threaten our lives and that of our loved ones and rip apart the fabric of our cities and our society ;
Enough of politicians of all parties who fiddle while terrorists burn , then seek to appease our anger with platitudes and pointless ‘ resignations ’ ;
Enough of excuses from prime ministers and accusations from wannabe prime ministers ;
Enough of the empty rhetoric of governments that promise action but give us only inquiry commissions ;
Enough of the callous unconcern of the political class that has resulted in this country we love being subjected to constant attacks from external forces .
W e have left this country in your hands for all these years , hoping that you will do what we elected you to do .
Y ou have failed us – miserably , and on every front .
W e have had enough .
And we are , from this moment on , taking the country back into our own hands .
WE DEMAND
Science is a far more dynamic process than many realize .
The constant upheaval of new measurements and new data forces us to constantly reassess our theories and our very view of how well we know the world .
In 2001 , a very interesting image began circulating around the internet .
It was of a narrow strip of Mars , captured by the Mars Global Surveyor ’s MOC ( Mars Orbital Camera , great originality there ) .
It was stored in a large database open to the public , but this image had sat unnoticed next to thousands of others until now .
What did we see ?
These dark blobs were almost a kilometer across .
Well , no one really wanted to say .
It kind of looked like lichen :
Or a bacterial colony :
Sir Arthur C. Clarke even suggested that they were some sort of Martian banyan tree .
“ I ’m quite serious when I say have a really good look at these new Mars images , ” he said .
“ Something is actually moving and changing with the seasons that suggests , at least , vegetation . ”
There ’s only one problem with that , and any schoolchild can point it out to you – Mars is supposed to be a dead planet .
No life has been found there , at least not that the unwashed masses have been made aware of .
The conspiracy theories soon flew fast and thick – that this was one of many images NASA had suppressed that indicated life on Mars .
In short , we were being manipulated by some sort of New World Order that kept knowledge of Martian life silent in order to … well , no one was really clear on that point .
Thankfully , the file clerk of this powerful cabal was so incompetent as to leave these blockbuster images on a public server .
But what could it be if it was n’t life ?
There are other processes that can produce similar structures :
such as diffusion limited aggregation .
So perhaps imminent takeover of the world via suppressed satellite images was n’t the first thing we should worry about .
Maybe there was a less elaborate explanation .
If all we had to base our assumptions on was that single picture , the debate could rage on for a while .
Thankfully a new satellite , the Mars Reconissance Orbiter ( MRO ) , entered the skies of Mars in 2006 .
On the MRO was one crucial piece of equipment – the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera .
This camera was the largest camera ever carried on a deep space mission – to give you an idea of its capabilities , it could see a beachball on the surface of Mars from orbit .
So what did the new pictures look like ?
Well …
they certainly were n’t lichen , or bacteria , or banyan trees .
These long tortured cracks hundreds of meters long were like nothing ever seen on Earth .
What could have caused them ?
Conventional geologic processes on Earth simply did n’t do things like this .
So what was the alternative ?
Were we back to thinking it may be life again ?
Well , perhaps there was an unconventional geologic explanation .
Hypothesis : The [ carbon dioxide ] seasonal ice in the cryptic terrain is translucent , allowing sunlight to penetrate through the ice to the surface below .
The ice then sublimates from the bottom of the slab , eroding channels in the surface below .
( H. Kieffer , 2000 )
Here ’s the idea .
Mars is cold .
So cold in fact , that in it ’s “ winter ” carbon dioxide will actually freeze into transparent sheets over certain regions of the planet .
The key thing here is that the ice is transparent , like black ice on asphalt .
Now , think what happens when bright sun shines on black ice .
Where does it start melting from ?
Well , it does n’t start from the top like you ’d think .
The sun shines through the clear ice , heats up the asphalt , and the asphalt melts the ice from the bottom .
It might even make tiny river - like channels of water between the ice and asphalt , as the liquid water needs somewhere to go .
But what if you ice is n’t made of water , and instead is made of a gas like carbon dioxide ?
Suppose the sun shines through the ice , heats up the Martian soil , and starts melting the ice from the bottom .
Enormous amounts of gas are produced – but where can it go ?
Well , first it might start to make little channels under the ice like we thought of before to escape .
But if there ’s no where to go to , eventually , something has to give .
And so , screaming with pressure , the ice fractures .
Gas rushes out of these many cracks , carrying dust and soil with it .
So what do we end up with ?
A giant circular region with fractures , darkened relative to the rest of Mars by freshly spit up soil and dust .
So a deep dark conspiracy theory ?
Perhaps not .
It may not be Martian trees , but it is an amazing geologic process that has never been observed on Earth .
At Last , A Date
For the first time , the International Energy Agency has produced a date for peak oil .
And it ’s not reassuring .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 15th December 2008
Can you think of a major threat for which the British government does not prepare ?
It employs an army of civil servants , spooks and consultants to assess the chances of terrorist attacks , financial collapse , floods , epidemics , even asteroid strikes , and to work out what it should do if they happen .
But there is one hazard about which it appears intensely relaxed .
It has never conducted its own assessment of the state of global oil supplies and the possibility that one day they might peak and then go into decline .
If you ask , it always produces the same response : “ global oil resources are adequate for the foreseeable future . ” (1) It knows this , it says , because of the assessments made by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) in its World Energy Outlook reports .
In the 2007 report , the IEA does appear to support the government ’s view .
“ World oil resources , ” it states , “ are judged to be sufficient to meet the projected growth in demand to 2030 ″ ( 2 ) ; though it says nothing about what happens at that point , or whether they will continue to be sufficient after 2030 .
But this , as far as Whitehall is concerned , is the end of the matter .
Like most of the rich world ’s governments , the United Kingdom treats the IEA ’s projections as gospel .
Earlier this year , I submitted a Freedom of Information request to the UK’s Department for Business , asking what contingency plans the government has made for global supplies of oil peaking by 2020 .
The answer was as follows : “ the Government does not feel the need to hold contingency plans specifically for the eventuality of crude oil supplies peaking between now and 2020 . ” ( 3 )
So the IEA had better bloody well be right .
In the report on peak oil commissioned by the US Department of Energy , the oil analyst Robert L. Hirsch concluded that “ without timely mitigation , the economic , social and political costs ” of world oil supplies peaking “ will be unprecedented .
” (4) He went on to explain what “ timely mitigation ” meant .
Even a worldwide emergency response “ 10 years before world oil peaking ” , he wrote , would leave “ a liquid fuels shortfall roughly a decade after the time that oil would have peaked .
” (5 ) To avoid global economic collapse , we need to begin “ a mitigation crash program 20 years before peaking .
” ( 6 ) If Hirsch is right and if oil supplies peak before 2028 , we ’re in deep doodah .
So burn this into your mind : between 2007 and 2008 the IEA radically changed its assessment .
Until this year ’s report , the agency mocked people who said that oil supplies might peak .
In the foreword to a book it published in 2005 , its executive director , Claude Mandil , dismissed those who warned of this event as “ doomsayers ” .
“ The IEA has long maintained that none of this is a cause for concern , ” he wrote .
“ Hydrocarbon resources around the world are abundant and will easily fuel the world through its transition to a sustainable energy future . ” (7 ) In its 2007 World Energy Outlook , the IEA predicted a rate of decline in output from the world ’s existing oilfields of 3.7 % a year ( 8 ) .
This , it said , presented a short - term challenge , with the possibility of a temporary supply crunch in 2015 , but with sufficient investment any shortfall could be covered .
But the new report , published last month , carried a very different message : a projected rate of decline of 6.7 % , which means a much greater gap to fill ( 9 ) .
More importantly , in the 2008 report the IEA suggests for the first time that world petroleum supplies might hit the buffers .
“ Although global oil production in total is not expected to peak before 2030 , production of conventional oil … is projected to level off towards the end of the projection period . ” ( 10 ) These bland words reveal a major shift .
Never before has one of the IEA ’s energy outlooks forecast the peaking or plateauing of the world ’s conventional oil production ( which is what we mean when we talk about peak oil ) .
But that is as specific as the report gets .
Does it or does n’t it mean that we have time to prepare ?
What does “ towards the end of the projection period ” mean ?
The agency has never produced a more precise forecast – until now .
For the first time , in the interview I conducted with its chief economist Fatih Birol , it has given us a date .
And it should scare the pants off anyone who understands the implications .
Fatih Birol , the lead author of the new energy outlook , is a small , shrewd , unflustered man with thick grey hair and Alistair Darling eyebrows .
He explained to me that the agency ’s new projections were based on a major study it had undertaken into decline rates in the world ’s 800 largest oil fields .
So what were its previous figures based on ?
“ It was mainly an assumption , a global assumption about the world ’s oil fields .
This year , we looked at it country by country , field by field and we looked at it also onshore and offshore .
It was very very detailed .
Last year it was an assumption , and this year it ’s a finding of our study . ”
I told him that it seemed extraordinary to me that the IEA had n’t done this work before , but had based its assessment on educated guesswork .
“ In fact nobody had done this research , ” he told me .
“ This is the first publicly available data ” .
( 11 )
So was it not irresponsible to publish a decline rate of 3.7 % in 2007 , when there was no proper research supporting it ?
“ No , our previous decline assumptions have always mentioned that these are assumptions to the best of our knowledge – and we also said that the declines [ could be ] higher than what we have assumed . ”
Then I asked him a question for which I did n’t expect a straight answer : could he give me a precise date by which he expects conventional oil supplies to stop growing ?
“ In terms of non-OPEC [ countries outside the big oil producers ’ cartel ] ” , he replied , “ we are expecting that in three , four years ’ time the production of conventional oil will come to a plateau , and start to decline . …
In terms of the global picture , assuming that OPEC will invest in a timely manner , global conventional oil can still continue , but we still expect that it will come around 2020 to a plateau as well , which is of course not good news from a global oil supply point of view . ”
Around 2020 .
That casts the issue in quite a different light .
Mr Birol ’s date , if correct , gives us about 11 years to prepare .
If the Hirsch report is right , we have already missed the boat .
Birol says we need a “ global energy revolution ” to avoid an oil crunch , including ( disastrously for the environment ) a massive global drive to exploit unconventional oils , such as the Canadian tar sands .
But nothing on this scale has yet happened , and Hirsch suggests that even if it began today , the necessary investments and infrastructure changes could not be made in time .
Fatih Birol told me “ I think time is not on our side here . ”
When I pressed him on the shift in the agency ’s position , he argued that the IEA has been saying something like this all along .
“ We said in the past that one day we will run out of oil .
We never said that we will have hundreds of years of oil … but what we have said is that this year , compared to past years , we have seen that the decline rates are significantly higher than what we have seen before .
But our line that we are on an unsustainable energy path has not changed ” .
This of course is face - saving nonsense .
There is a vast difference between a decline rate of 3.7 % and a rate of 6.7 % .
There is an even bigger difference between suggesting that the world is following an unsustainable energy path – a statement almost everyone can subscribe to – and revealing that conventional oil supplies are likely to plateau around 2020 .
If this is what the IEA meant in the past , it was n’t expressing itself very clearly .
So what do we do ?
We could take to the hills , or we could hope and pray that Hirsch is wrong about the 20 - year lead time , and begin a global crash programme today of fuel efficiency and electrification .
In either case , the British government had better start drawing up some contingency plans .

Mice or rats are thought to have chewed through electric wires
Mice may be responsible for a blaze that killed nearly 100 cats at an animal shelter near the Canadian city of Toronto , officials say .
The fire at the humane society shelter in Oshawa also killed three dogs and some rats that were up for adoption .
An initial report from the fire marshal says mice or rats chewing through electrical wires in the ceiling are likely to have sparked the blaze .
Offers of help have been pouring in from animal lovers across Canada .
" It 's unfortunate and ironic that mice caused the fire that killed the cats , " Toronto Humane Society spokesman Ian McConachie told the BBC News website .
" Unfortunately , the mice probably perished in the fire as well , " he added .
The $ 250,000 ( £ 137,000 ) fire is still under investigation by the Ontario Fire Marshal 's office .
Mr McConachie said it would be some days before a final report would be released .
In all , only nine dogs , two cats and one rat were rescued in Wednesday 's early morning blaze .
They are being housed in a nearby municipal shelter , while volunteers rebuild the burnt - down shelter for the Humane Society of Durham Region .
Today has been loaded with little metaphors .
Dick Cheney leaving in a wheelchair , for instance , but another amazing one is comparing the White House website today with what it looked like when Bush took office .

Legal Papers Claim Initiative Procedure Cannot Be Used To Undermine the Constitution 's Core Commitment To Equality For Everyone
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
SAN FRANCISCO – The American Civil Liberties Union , Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights filed a writ petition before the California Supreme Court today urging the court to invalidate Proposition 8 if it passes .
The petition charges that Proposition 8 is invalid because the initiative process was improperly used in an attempt to undo the constitution 's core commitment to equality for everyone by eliminating a fundamental right from just one group – lesbian and gay Californians .
Proposition 8 also improperly attempts to prevent the courts from exercising their essential constitutional role of protecting the equal protection rights of minorities .
According to the California Constitution , such radical changes to the organizing principles of state government cannot be made by simple majority vote through the initiative process , but instead must , at a minimum , go through the state legislature first .
The California Constitution itself sets out two ways to alter the document that sets the most basic rules about how state government works .
Proposition 8 was put on the ballot through the initiative process .
But any measure that would change the underlying principles of the constitution must first be approved by the legislature before being submitted to the voters .
That did n't happen with Proposition 8 , and that 's why it 's invalid .
" If the voters approved an initiative that took the right to free speech away from women , but not from men , everyone would agree that such a measure conflicts with the basic ideals of equality enshrined in our constitution .
Proposition 8 suffers from the same flaw – it removes a protected constitutional right – here , the right to marry – not from all Californians , but just from one group of us , " said Jenny Pizer , a staff attorney with Lambda Legal .
" That 's too big a change in the principles of our constitution to be made just by a bare majority of voters . "
" A major purpose of the constitution is to protect minorities from majorities .
Because changing that principle is a fundamental change to the organizing principles of the constitution itself , only the legislature can initiate such revisions to the constitution , " added Elizabeth Gill , a staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California .
The groups filed the lawsuit today in the California Supreme Court on behalf of Equality California and 6 same - sex couples who did not marry before Tuesday 's election but would like to be able to marry now .
The groups filed a writ petition in the California Supreme Court before the elections presenting similar arguments because they believed the initiative should not have appeared on the ballot , but the court dismissed that petition without addressing its merits .
That earlier order is not precedent here .
" Historically , courts are reluctant to get involved in disputes if they can avoid doing so , " said Shannon Minter , Legal Director of NCLR .
" It is not uncommon for the court to wait to see what happens at the polls before considering these legal arguments .
However , now that Proposition 8 may pass , the courts will have to weigh in and we believe they will agree that Proposition 8 should never have been on the ballot in the first place . "
This would not be the first time the court has struck down an improper voter initiative .
In 1990 , the court stuck down an initiative that would have added a provision to the California Constitution stating that the " Constitution shall not be construed by the courts to afford greater rights to criminal defendants than those afforded by the Constitution of the United States . "
That measure was invalid because it improperly attempted to strip California 's courts of their role as independent interpreters of the state 's constitution .
In a statement issued earlier today , the groups stated their conviction , which is shared by the California Attorney General , that the state must continue to honor the marriages of the 18,000 lesbian and gay couples who have already married in California .
A copy of the statement is available at : www.aclu.org/lgbt/relationships/37701prs20081105.html.
A copy of the writ petition filed today is available at : www.aclu.org/lgbt/relationships/37709lgl20081105.html.
In addition to the ACLU , Lambda Legal and NCLR , the legal team bringing the writ also includes the Law Office of David C. Codell ; Munger Tolles & Olson , LLP ; and Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe , LLP .

Ever wondered if that 93 octane you 're paying two arms and a leg for is really 93 octane ?
Pondered the legitimacy of that " homogenized and pasteurized " claim on your most recent milk purchase ?
If so , congratulations .
You 're the target market for the D+caf caffeine test strip .
Reportedly , these strips keep the paranoid abreast of the truth whenever they venture out for a decaf drink ; java sippers simply insert a tester into their beverage , wait for it to grow intolerably cold ( or 30 seconds , whichever comes first ) and then view the findings .
The creator proclaims that they 're 98 % accurate for detecting greater than 20 - milligrams of caffeine per 6 - ounce serving , but we 're not willing to pay $ 9.95 for a 20 - pack in order to find out .

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will be hosting energy ministers from at least 11 natural gas exporting countries in a bid to strengthen their so - called “ gas OPEC ” cartel .
Moscow is seeking to bolster their informal club called the Gas Exporting Countries Forum ( GECF ) , which includes members such as Algeria , Iran , Qatar and Venezuela .
“ Maybe it ’s a bright image , but the mechanisms of OPEC ca n’t be used on the gas market , ” Alexander Medvedev , Russian energy giant Gazprom ’s chief of exports , said last week .
“ In this case , it ’s not necessary to make comparisons . ”
Four cities are competing to be the home of the cartel ’s secretariat – St. Petersburg , Algiers , Tehran and Doha , Qatar .
During Putin ’s presidency , from 2000 until May this year , he consolidated state control over Russia ’s oil and gas industry with Gazprom taking the lead .
Gazprom signed a deal earlier this year with Iran and Qatar to coordinate natural gas prices and policies .
The global economic crisis has heightened Russia ’s dependence on revenues from its oil and gas sectors as their currency has weakened in value .
The meeting is scheduled to take place Tuesday in Moscow .

So , that 's it then .
The family of Jean Charles de Menezes waited three years for an inquest to explain why he was shot to death on a tube train and then , at the crucial moment , the whole thing was rendered meaningless .
By instructing the jury that they should not even contemplate a verdict of unlawful killing or make any additional observations , Mr Justice Wright robbed that family of any hope they may have had that those involved in the debacle would be held to account .
In that context , this open verdict was the only rational option left for the jury .
Still , tragedy slides into farce .
Let 's look at what the judge decided .
He said no reasonable person having heard the evidence could conclude that what occurred was murder .
That 's surely right .
Whatever happened underground at Stockwell , there was no malice aforethought .
It was a horrible and scary time .
Those of us who live in the capital well remember it .
People had died on 7/7 and had been maimed in the most horrible circumstances and the talk was of an immediate repetition , of young men queuing up to martyr themselves .
The context is important .
But the judge 's instruction to the jury meant they were also prevented from viewing what happened as manslaughter .
Can that be right ?
Was there no possibility , on the basis of what was heard that the death might have been the result of recklessness or criminal negligence , which would have amounted to gross negligence manslaughter and might have led to a verdict of unlawful killing .
Should n't the jury have been left to decide that ?
Because , even when viewed in context , the way the police and the security services went about their business that day seemed shambolic .
The nerve centre had all the organisation and purpose of Trafalgar Square on New Year 's Eve and as for the effort to identify and to follow the suspect , that would have been better carried out by reporters from the News of the World .
And so we are left with a conclusion that does everything but give us closure .
But then that was always likely .
Inquests have clearly defined objectives .
They are convened to discover cause of death .
The surrounding events are incidental .
Anyone who has sat through an inquest has heard the coroner say that they are not there to apportion blame .
They are emotional affairs but they are administrative and limited .
I have yet to see a grieving family emerge from an inquest satisfied that the death of their loved one had been explored in the round .
This was no forum for the forensic examination of these events , touching as they do on politics , policing , international affairs , intelligence .
In this limited forum , mistakes and lies can be covered up and lessons go unlearned because those under scrutiny well know that their best chance of reducing pressure on themselves is to take advantage of the fact that the scope of these hearings is limited .
The laws governing inquests allow them to do that .
Jean Charles de Menezes was a victim of terrorism .
He was killed by brave officers responding to a terrible threat , but he was blameless .
It was his terrible luck to end up in that underground carriage with them .
It was their terrible luck to end up in that carriage with him .
What still needs explaining is how that happened .
Why an operation that should have been months in the planning , given all the warnings police had given to the public in preceding months , ended so tragically .
Relatives of the dead man and their supporters have long called for a public inquiry .
For all our sakes , they should have it .
Barack Obama will give voice to an unusual name that was rarely heard during the campaign except by critics .
Swearing in : ' Barack Hussein Obama '
President - elect Barack Obama says he plans to use all three of his names when he takes the oath of office in January , giving voice to a name that was was rarely used during the campaign except by critics .
In his first post-election newspaper interview , with reporters from the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times , Obama was asked : “ Do you anticipate being sworn in as Barack Obama or Barack Hussein Obama ? "

He replied : “ I think the tradition is that they use all three names , and I will follow the tradition , not trying to make a statement one way or the other .
I 'll do what everybody else does . ”
In fact , all presidents have not used their middle names when taking the oath of office .
Jimmy Carter famously went as “ Jimmy Carter . ” Ronald Wilson Reagan took the oath as simply “ Ronald Reagan . ”
Harry Truman , of course , did n’t have a middle name — just an initial that did n’t stand for anything — and was sworn in as “ Harry S. Truman . ”
( We 've gotten a lot of e-mail about the period after the ' S . '
Despite the urban myth to the contrary , the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum says Truman put a period in his signature and posts a photo to prove it . )
Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gerald R. Ford took the oath using their middle initials .
The last three presidents have used their middle names : George Herbert Walker Bush , William Jefferson Clinton and George Walker Bush .
So did Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John Fitzgerald Kennedy .
Lyndon Baines Johnson , in the hasty ceremony aboard Air Force One , went nameless — prompted to say only , “ I do solemnly swear . ”
The insertion of the name is a tradition not specified in the U.S. Constitution , which directs about the president in Article II : “ Before he enter on the Execution of his Office , he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation : —‘ I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my Ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . ’”
Obama ’s middle name was largely taboo during the campaign , and Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) apologized when it was used by Bill Cunningham , a talk - radio host who was introducing McCain at a rally in Cincinnati .
The Associated Press reported at the time , “ Asked whether the use of Obama 's middle name — the same as former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein — is proper , McCain said : ‘ No , it is not .
Any comment that is disparaging of either Senator Clinton or Senator Obama is totally inappropriate . ’ ”
Here is a transcript of Obama ’s interview with the two newspapers , which have a joint Washington bureau as Tribune Co .

An Australian Defence Department ( ADD ) report published in October , and highlighted on November 26 by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ’s “ Lateline ” program , provides a rare account of the shameful operations being performed by the Australian military as part of the US - led occupation of Afghanistan .
The units most involved are from the Special Air Service Regiment ( SAS ) and the Fourth Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 4RAR ) , the Army ’s designated commando battalion .
These are highly trained troops and their ostensible role in times of war is to carry out long range reconnaissance , surveillance , harassment or raids on enemy targets .
In the so - called “ war on terror ” , they are being used as little more than death squads .
The ADD report presents the findings of an inquiry into a September 17 Australian operation that resulted in the mistaken killing of Rozi Khan , the pro-occupation governor of Chora district in Uruzgan province and a long - time colleague of Afghan president Hamid Karzai .
The intended target , codenamed “ Musket ” by the Australian military , was an alleged member of the Islamist Taliban movement .
While much of the mission statement remains censored , it is apparent that a squad was sent out to storm into the man ’s house in the dead of night and execute him in cold blood .
The possibility for things to go wrong is inherent in such operations in civilian areas , and on September 17 , they went terribly wrong .
Just days before the hit on “ Musket ” was ordered , the Taliban had issued threats against residents of a village , which lay on the route being taking by the Australians .
Rozi Khan had encouraged the villagers to resist any attack and promised to come to their aid with his armed followers .
As the Australian troops moved close to the village , sentries atop houses spotted them and assumed they were Taliban intruders .
Within minutes , dozens of villagers were firing on the Australians from the east , west and north .
Khan and his men , alerted by the gunfire , began moving toward the fighting , as did local Afghan police .
Troops in an Australian back - up unit , who had manoeuvred to try and flank what they believed to be Taliban , engaged Khan ’s group and , the inquiry found , most likely inflicted fatal wounds on the district governor .
It was not until a police vehicle arrived that the Australians made efforts to communicate with the men they were attacking .
After realising their mistake , the Australian troops aborted their “ Musket ” mission — at the cost of two dead and five wounded Afghans .
The Defence Department inquiry ruled : “ That Rozi Khan was among the casualties is resultant of his unfortunate intervention into a complex situation , albeit with altruistic motives . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The September 17 mission was no isolated incident .
It was part of a broader and ongoing operation codenamed “ Peeler ” that tasks the Australian special forces with “ disrupting [ i.e. , killing or capturing ] Taliban leadership or improvised explosive device facilitators ” .
Not all missions result in the target ’s assassination .
Last month , the alleged Taliban “ shadow ” governor of Uruzgan , Mullah Bari Ghul , was detained in a raid that was most likely conducted by Australians .
Other missions result in massacres .
On November 23 , 2007 , Private Luke Worsley of 4RAR was killed during an assault on a residence in Chenartu village in Uruzgan .
Because of the Australian fatality , details of the incident were made public .
The target was Taliban leader Mullah Baz Mohammed , who was expected to be at the house that night .
Australian troops crept up under the cover of darkness , blew the outer doors off the housing compound and rushed in .
They left the Daad family — three men , two women and one female child — dead on the floor .
A neighbour , Faiz Mohammed , told Time magazine : “ There was blood everywhere . ”
Worsley was shot as he entered the house .
Mullah Baz Mohammed was not there .
“ Lateline ” commented that the Defence Department report “ prompts questions about the legality and the ethics of targeted killings , even in the dusty and chaotic battleground of Afghanistan ” .
Tim McCormack of Melbourne University , a professor of Humanitarian Law consulted by the program , provided reassurances .
“ International law is not pacifist law , ” he said .
“ It does allow the killing of enemy combatants and civilians who take a direct part in hostilities — just as it ’s also legal for the Taliban to hunt down an Australian SAS person or anybody on the Australian side or any of the allied side ” .
McCormack ’s remarks , however , serve only to obscure the essential issues .
They ignore the thoroughly predatory and , therefore , criminal motives behind the US - led invasion of Afghanistan .
The September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington were utilised as the pretext to deploy military forces into the desperately impoverished country with the aim of securing long term bases in the very heart of Central Asia , a region rich in untapped resources .
Over the past seven years , the Afghan war has evolved into a component of the struggle for regional dominance between the US — supported at present by its European NATO allies — and Russia and China .
The existence of Al Qaeda bases in Afghanistan had nothing to do with the decision to send in troops .
Not only did the Bush administration reject offers by the Taliban to hand Osama bin Laden over to a third country if evidence were presented of his involvement in 9/11 , but virtually no steps were taken by the US military to prevent the bulk of Al Qaeda simply moving across the border into Pakistan ’s tribal agencies — where it has largely operated ever since .
Australia ’s involvement in the war was the result of the most cynical calculations .
By sending troops to fight in Afghanistan and then Iraq , the former Howard government hoped to cement Washington ’s backing for a series of military operations that would secure Australian strategic and economic interests in the South Pacific , as well as a free trade agreement with the United States .
The Rudd Labor government is continuing the same policy .
There is a stark difference — both politically and morally — between the activities of citizens resisting the invasion of their country and those of the invading army .
Afghans are fighting for the right to determine their own future free from foreign domination .
The Australian military in Afghanistan is an instrument of imperialist aggression .
It is conducting a campaign of terror throughout Uruzgan province to force the population to accept a US puppet government .
One obvious parallel to the Afghanistan operation is the Vietnam War ’s Operation Phoenix .
Over a five - year period , American and South Vietnamese death squads assassinated tens of thousands of Vietnamese on the grounds they were supporting the Viet Cong ( VC ) liberation movement .
Only the most craven apologist for US imperialism would claim that such atrocities were “ legal ” on the basis that many of the victims belonged to the VC .
The Labor government repeatedly tries to ennoble the Afghan war with flowery descriptions of Australian soldiers as “ heroes ” who are “ putting their lives on the line for the rest us ” .
The truth is they are killing and maiming people , including entirely innocent civilians , of an oppressed country for a thoroughly reactionary , neo -colonial cause .

COLUMBIA , S.C. , Dec. 12 ( UPI ) --
A federal judge has barred South Carolina from issuing license plates that include a cross and the words " I believe , " ruling that they are unconstitutional .
U.S. District Court Judge Cameron McGowan Currie granted a preliminary injunction Thursday , The Greenville News reported .
Americans United for Separation of Church and State sued this year , arguing that the plates violate the Constitution 's establishment clause because they are primarily aimed at Christians .

Currie said the plates , to be legal , must pass a three - part test -- that they have a primarily secular purpose and a secular effect and avoid involving government and religion .
" I find it unlikely the act satisfies even one of these , " she said .
No plates have been issued , although several hundred car owners have ordered them .
State Attorney General Henry McMaster said he would urge the Division of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Corrections to appeal quickly .
" I am extremely disappointed in the court 's ruling , and feel the ' I Believe ' license tag is completely constitutional , " McMaster said .
The lawsuit had support from groups and religious leaders that included Christians , Jews , Muslims and Hindus , The State reported .

Journal to require authors to post in the free online encyclopaedia .
Wikipedia , meet RNA .
Anyone submitting to a section of the journal RNA Biology will , in the future , be required to also submit a Wikipedia page that summarizes the work .
The journal will then peer review the page before publishing it in Wikipedia .
The initiative is a collaboration between the journal and the RNA family database ( Rfam ) consortium led by the TrustSanger_Institute " >
UK Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton .
" The novelty is that for the first time it creates a link between Wikipedia and traditional journal publishing , with its peer - review element , " says Alex Bateman , who co-heads the Rfam database .
The aim , Bateman says , is to boost the quality of the scientific content on Wikipedia while using the entries to update the Sanger database .
Share the data
RNA Biology will require Wikipedia pages from all authors who submit work to a new section of the journal , to be launched later this week , that describes families of RNA molecules .
The first paper scheduled is " A Survey of Nematode SmY RNAs " 1 ; its corresponding Wikipedia summary can be found here .
The goal is to encourage more scientists who work on RNA to get involved in creating and updating public data on RNA families , while being rewarded by the traditional method of a citation " > citable publication , says Sean Eddy , a computational biologist at the Janelia Farm Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Ashburn , Virginia , and a co-author of the nematode article .
The Sanger Institute created the Rfam database in 2005 , and it now contains data on about 1,200 RNA families from some 200 complete genome sequences .
Sanger last year started to experiment with the idea of using Wikipedia to improve the database .
It set up an RNA subsection on the encyclopaedia , called RNA WikiProject 2 , which has the same entries as those on the Rfam database .
The database is synchronized each night with Wikipedia , so that any changes made to the Wikipedia pages are transferred to the corresponding entries in the Rfam database .
Bateman says he has been " pleasantly surprised " by scientists ' willingness to edit the RNA Wikipedia pages .
Most of the edits are made by a core group of around 15 researchers , but there 's a LongTail " > long tail of other scientists who pop in sporadically , he says , often to fix or add information about molecules specific to their research .
Wiki love
Editing is not restricted to experts .
The experience with RNA WikiProject suggests that vandalism will not be a big problem ; if anything , Wikipedians chipped in to fix typos , add links and generally tidy up the entries .
" We do n't think vandalism will ever be as much of a problem for a Wikipedia page on RNA " > transfer RNAs as it is for a page on George Bush , " says Eddy .
The RNA wiki is a subset of a broader project , the WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology , which has marshalled hundreds of scientists to improve the content of biology articles in Wikipedia .
It , in turn , is collaborating with the InstituteoftheNovartisResearchFoundation " >
Novartis Research Foundation on Wiki " > GeneWiki 3 , an effort to create Wikipedia articles describing every human gene .
Beyond Wikipedia itself , scientists are also increasingly using wiki technology to get scientists to help curate other biological databases ( see Nature 455 , 22 – 25 ; 2008 ) .

Renée Schroeder , the editor of RNA Biology and a biochemist at the University of Vienna , says she hopes that other journals will also take up the idea of submitting peer - reviewed information to Wikipedia .
" RNA families are the perfect example to start this exciting experiment , " she says .
" We will see how the scientific community accepts it . "
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) has just approved the relaxation of the rules for the introduction of new Top - Level Domains — a move that could drastically change the Internet .
The new decision — some calling it of historic importance and others predictable — will allow companies to register their brands as generic top - level domain names ( TLDs ) .
For instance , Microsoft could apply to have a TLD such as ' .msn ' and Apple apply for '.mac ' .
" We are opening up a new world and I think this cannot be underestimated , " said Roberto Gaetano , ICANN board member .
The new rules will allow any public or private organization from anywhere in the world to register any string of letters as a gTLD , which could result in hundreds of new gTLDs registered this year .
The decision was taken unanimously on Thursday , June 26 , 2008 at the 32nd ICANN Meeting in Paris .

Officials in Palm Beach County , Florida arrested Heather K. Southworth for felony fraud after exposing her big cat rescue charity as a complete fabrication .
[ social_buttons ]
Her non-existent organization , called Rescue : Big Cat Organization , complete with a fictional website , location , staff , and convenient donation link , was outed by The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission when they attempted to visit the site and found that no such rescue exists .
While her website claimed that Rescue : Big Cat Organization was “ home to over 150 of the world ’s most endangered felines , ” and that their facilities were “ better than those found in most Zoos , ” officials report that the whole thing was fabricated .
Clearly the real “ purrrr ” pose of this organization had little to do with rescuing any big cats .
Donations to the organization went to a P.O. box registered to Southworth or to a Paypal account , but the exact amount that she made from the scam is so far unclear .
Scams like these injure the reputations of real rescue operations like Big Cat Rescue , located in Tampa Bay , FL and damage the credibility of environmental activists across the country .
If you are passionate about the rescue or long - term care of large animals that are not in their natural habitat , please do your part to support quality operations .

Oh , man , this is sad and unexpected news : 16 - year veteran CNN reporter and anchor Miles O'Brien will be departing CNN , as the network closes its sci / space / enviromental / tech news division .
Snip from mediabistro :
O'Brien 's departure comes as the network dismantles its science , space , environment and technology unit in Atlanta .
That includes O'Brien as well as six producers .
O'Brien has been CNN 's chief technology and environment correspondent since being replaced as anchor of American Morning in April 2007 .
The network 's environmental coverage will continue through the Planet in Peril franchise , which is part of the Anderson Cooper - hosted show AC360 .
The LA Times has an item about these changes , too .
I wo n't go through a laundry list of the departing names here , but I 've had the pleasure of meeting and / or briefly working with a number of them as a guest on various CNN shows .
They 're talented , dedicated , rare professionals .
Miles is truly one of the greats .
I can't think of a single broadcast journalist as knowledgeable on space , aeronautics , and other tech topics .
I am so sorry to hear this news .

As Canadians live through the current political uproar in Ottawa it is important that they understand the constitutional rules of our parliamentary democracy .
The first rule is that when we hold an election we do not directly elect a prime minister .
We elect a House of Commons .
It is this elected chamber of Parliament that decides who governs the country .
The second rule of parliamentary government is that it is the leaders of the party or coalition of parties that have the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons who have the right to govern .
Immediately after an election the incumbent prime minister remains in office no matter how badly he or she may have done at the polls .
In 1993 , Kim Campbell was still prime minister of Canada even though she her party had elected only two MPs .
It was obvious that a Campbell Conservative government would not have the confidence of the newly elected House of Commons so she tendered her resignation to the Governor General .
The Governor General then called on Jean Chrétien , whose Liberal party had won a majority of seats in the House of Commons , to form a government .
The situation is not always so clear .
After the 1985 provincial election in Ontario , the incumbent premier , Frank Miller , whose Conservatives had won the most seats but were nonetheless in a minority position in the Legislative Assembly , formed a government and prepared to meet the newly elected Legislature .
But when it became clear that Liberal Leader David Peterson and NDP Leader Bob Rae , whose parties between them had a majority in the Legislature , had signed an agreement whereby the NDP for two years would support a Liberal minority government so long as it pursued certain legislative priorities , Miller submitted his government 's resignation to the Lieutenant Governor .
These precedents and many , many others illustrate the basic point that in parliamentary democracies we elect parliaments not prime ministers , and that the Governor General ( or the presidential head of state in a republican parliamentary system ) must be advised by ministers who are supported by a majority in the elected house of parliament .
Now let 's apply these rules of parliamentary democracy to the situation Canada now faces .
After the Oct. 14 election , Stephen Harper remained Prime Minister , formed a new government and prepared to face the House .
Although his party had improved its seat total it was still in a minority position in the House .
This meant that to continue in office Harper would have to win enough support from the opposition benches to secure the confidence of the House .
For a few days it appeared that Harper would reach out in a conciliatory manner and garner the parliamentary support he needs on order to have the right to govern .
But , to put it mildly , on Nov. 27 just a few days into the session , through his finance minister 's economic update , he made an abrupt U - turn .
Instead of seeking support from the opposition , his government presented an in - your - face , take - it - or - leave - it position .
The opposition parties – all three of them – decided not to take it .
Instead , they announced that they would use their collective majority in the House to vote no confidence in the Harper government and support an alternative coalition government .
The no-confidence vote is to take place next Monday .
If the government loses that vote , the rules of parliamentary democracy give Harper two options .
He can tender his government 's resignation to the Governor General and clear the way for Madame Jean to ask Stéphane Dion to form a Liberal - NDP coalition government .
Or he can ask the Governor General to dissolve the 40th Parliament so that we can elect the 41st Parliament .
The first option – resignation – would be entirely constitutional .
It involves no " usurpation " of power but is an honourable way out of the present impasse .
If Harper were to take the second option , the Governor General would have to consider carefully whether to grant his request for a dissolution .
Her primary concern must be to protect parliamentary democracy .
A steady diet of elections – four in four years – is not healthy for parliamentary democracy .
If there is an alternative government available that has a reasonable prospect of being supported for a period of time by a majority in the House of Commons , she would have reason to decline Harper 's request .
Harper would then have to resign , and the Governor General would commission Dion to form a government .
If this happens , again there would be no " usurpation " of power but a proper application of the rules and principles of parliamentary democracy .
It has been very disturbing to hear over the last few days , from people who should know better , wild unparliamentary theories about our system of government .
Elections are not simple popularity contests in which the leader whose party garners the most votes gets all the power .
I am greatly concerned that there is so little public knowledge of the constitutional rules that govern our parliamentary system of government .
These rules are not formally written down in a legal text or taught in our schools .
Maybe the most important lesson to take from the situation we are now living through is to begin to codify as much as we can of this " unwritten " part of our Constitution and to ensure that it is well taught in our schools .

' Phantom ' Cell Phone Sensations : Mind Over Matter Modern gadgets may convince the brain that they are part of the body .
Oct. 17 , 2007  --
Phantom arms , legs and now cell phone vibrations -- you can feel them , you can sense them , but they are n't really there .
Chalked up largely to a natural anomaly in the wiring of the brain , such experiences blur the boundaries between reality and imagination in those who experience them .
It is hard , for example , to understand how patients who have had an arm or leg amputated can experience acute pain in a limb that is no longer there .
But for these people , the pain is uncomfortably real .
" In the past , it was thought that people with phantom limbs were crazy , but today we know that people are n't crazy , " says Dr. Jack Tsao , an assistant professor of neurology at the Uniform Services University in Maryland .
" There is a physiological basis to this sensation . "
And phantom sensations do n't just affect amputees .
Though it is a complaint of an entirely different magnitude , many cell phone and BlackBerry users report feeling vibrations when their phones are , in fact , silent .
Although such sensations are nothing like pain from a phantom limb , doctors say the two phenomena may be somewhat related .
" If you use your cell phone a lot , it becomes part of you , " says Dr. William Barr , the chief of neuropsychology at the New York University School of Medicine .
" You become habituated to it .
" It 's like wearing a tight sock all day , " he explains .
" When you take it off , you still feel it there on your foot .
If your cell phone is not there , you still feel like it is . "
It 's in Your Mind
Although the reasons for these false perceptions are not definitely known , researchers agree that , in both cases , a certain part of the brain plays a key role .
For amputees who experience phantom limbs , the part of the brain affected is called the somatosensory cortex .
This region contains nerves that process information related to touch .
For example , if someone touches your hand , nerves in a particular area of the somatosensory cortex are activated , allowing you to feel that your hand is being touched .
All of your body parts are mapped out to a certain area of the cortex .
Jon Kaas , a professor of psychiatry at Vanderbilt University , explains that after losing a limb , the neurons that control the movement and the sensation of that limb are still present in the brain .
" After losing a limb , the brain is reorganized , " he says .
" When neurons are deprived of their normal source of stimulus , they send out new connections and start to respond to new signals . "
Kaas goes on to explain how patients with an amputated arm can still feel a sensation in their arm when they are touched on the face .
The reason for this is that the nerves that originally controlled the hand have formed new connections so that they now respond to a touch on the face .
" There is an orderly organization of the body in the cortex of the brain , " Kaas says .
" If you lose input from your hand , the section of neurons that control the hand are initially inactive , but then recover and start to respond to other connections .
" These brain parts still have the capacity to signal to the limb even though the limb is not present , which gives the sensation of a phantom limb . "
Like the phantom limb phenomenon , mysterious cell phone vibrations can also be explained by changing nerve connections in the brain .
" Cell phones enter into the neuromatrix of the body -- they become appendages , " says Barr .
So when you leave your cell phone at home , the brain interprets it as it would a phantom limb -- it 's not present , but you feel as though it is .
" It 's an interesting technological statement about society that our machines are becoming part of us , " says Barr .
Press the Button , Get the Message
Kaas says another principle , known as operant conditioning , may also be at play in phantom phone vibrations .
In studies of operant conditioning , researchers have found that rats that are rewarded after pressing a lever will learn to press the lever more frequently .
The pressing becomes habitual .
In the case of cell phones , people are rewarded when they pick up their calls and read their incoming text messages , which causes them to pick up their cell phones more and more frequently .
" People are rewarded when they are able to detect low amplitude vibrations so they get better and better at responding , " says Kaas .
" It is very rewarding to get the message , so people are able to train their system to detect that signal . "
As people repeat this behavior over and over again , connections between nerves in their brain become stronger and new ones are formed , which helps to make the behavior automatic .
And sometimes , as is the case with vibrating cell phones , the behavior becomes too automatic .
" People have gotten so good at detecting vibrations that they start responding to false positives -- they think something is there when it is not , " says Kaas .
Tsao agrees .
" Most people keep BlackBerrys on their hips or in a shirt pocket , and so the body is used to picking up sensations in this area , " he says .
" Even when the BlackBerry is n't present , the body gives the signal that something is going off . "
Kicking the ' CrackBerry ' Addiction
And just as the brain changes to create phantom sensations , it can also change back to get rid of them .
Over time , the phantom limb syndrome goes away as other parts of the brain take over the part that controls the limb .
" Sometimes other parts of the brain will move into the real estate occupied by the amputated limb , " says Barr .
" Over time , other parts of the brain start to encroach on the part of the brain that represents the phantom limb . "
Similarly , experts say that those haunted with BlackBerry vibrations should simply stop using them .
" The problem will stop if people stop carrying BlackBerrys , " says Kaas .
" It 's not a permanent condition .
If people stop carrying their BlackBerrys , the connections between neurons will degrade , and people will be able to retain their neurons to do other things . "
However , while phantom sensations arise from similar brain functions , phantom limbs and phantom phone vibrations are in no way similar in how they affect the lives of those experiencing these sensations .
Losing a limb and losing a cell phone are not at all comparable , and many experts emphasize that the pain experienced by some amputee victims can be seriously disabling .

Some parts of Apple 's 32 - point rebuttal say that the company was being truthful .
But one paragraph says , in effect , that anyone who believes what the company says in its ads is a fool .
" Plaintiff 's claims , and those of the purported class , are barred by the fact that the alleged deceptive statements were such that no reasonable person in Plaintiff 's position could have reasonably relied on or misunderstood Apple 's statements as claims of fact , " Apple said in its answer .
Gillis was one of several dissatisfied iPhone 3G customers who recently filed lawsuits alleging Apple falsely advertised the handset 's performance .
The lawsuits stem from widespread frustration over the popular smartphone ; the complaints vary from frequently dropped calls to sluggish broadband speeds and the inability to stay on 3G before it switches to the slower EDGE network .
Apple has already moved to dismiss some of the iPhone 3G lawsuits filed , but Gillis ' remains alive and kicking .
Michael Ian Rott , Gillis ' attorney , said that out of the five iPhone 3G lawsuits filed , he thinks his client 's is the most likely to succeed .
" Ours has the most teeth and the most legs to it , " Rott said .
" If there was any way that Apple could get out of it , they would have filed a motion to dismiss here , too .
Their M.O. has been , ' File motion to dismiss and let 's get out of here , ' but they have n't done that with ours . "
In the past , Apple acknowledged the iPhone 3 G 's network issues and promised the problems would be addressed with future software updates .
Consumers are reporting that the most recent firmware version – iPhone 2.2 – appears to be mitigating the issue of frequent dropped calls .
However , many still complain about reception problems .
" I keep waiting and hoping for a fix , " wrote iPhone customer " BarJohnG , " in Apple 's support forums .
" So far the reception is still lousy .
I can't believe that Apple is not fixing this issue but merely trying to mask it and keep the customer confused by showing more bars than there is signal .
When you look at the logs it is shocking the number of crashes and problems with the phone and OS . "
Though Apple is continuing to hold its ground in U.S. courts , the corporation has n't been so lucky in the U.K .
The U.K. Advertising Standards Authority banned two iPhone 3G advertisements , deeming them misleading for exaggerating the speeds and internet capabilities of the handset .

7 Reasons Leaders Fail
Around two - thirds of workers say the most stressful aspect of their jobs is their immediate boss , their line manager ( Hogan , 2006 ) .
While this will come as no surprise to most , this statistic suggests a massive number of unhappy working relationships .
So , does this mean that leadership is failing on a massive scale ?
Well , not exactly …
A recent article published in American Psychologist beautifully explains why so many people experience their managers as piping hot geysers of stress ( Vugt , Hogan & Kaiser , 2008 ) .
What emerges is that bosses are n’t inherently bad people ( mostly ) , but that the modern culture of work sets them up to fail .
Here are the seven main reasons I ’ve picked out from this article for why leaders fail :
1. Strict hierarchies .
For Mark Van Vugt of the University of Kent and colleagues a large part of the problem with many modern organisations is their hierarchies .
Leaders are at the top of the chain and are assumed to have all the answers , so they make most of the decisions .
In reality knowledge and expertise is spread across people in organisations .
But it ’s the leaders who must be seen to lead and so followers get frustrated because their superior knowledge and expertise is frequently ignored .
This leads to :
2 . Poor decision - making .
Leaders often do n’t make any better decisions than followers , and frequently make worse ones .
This is another consequence of strict hierarchies .
Rather than setting up leaders to fail , Van Vugt et al. ( 2008 ) argue it ’s better to agree that leaders are not always the best people to make the decisions .
Spreading the responsibility around , or using more participatory strategies for decision - making is often more effective .
But this is n’t the way things generally work , part of the problem is :
3 . Huge pay differentials .
Followers often hate their leaders because of the huge difference in their salaries .
It ’s hard to feel any sympathy for someone whose pay is stratospheric ( average CEO pay is 179 times that of average workers ) .
And , because more pay means more status , leaders can quickly come to believe they really deserve the God - like status their pay suggests , resulting in their thinking they have all the answers and that they have the right to treat their employees less than fairly .
In the bosses ’ defence , though , there are :
4. Impossible standards for leaders .
Perhaps because of the huge pay and incredible demands , followers expect their leaders to be almost superhuman .
The leadership literature identifies a whole range of personal qualities thought important for a good leader .
These include integrity , persistence , humility , competence , decisiveness and being able to inspire the troops .
While a leader may be high on one or two of these , they are unlikely to have the full set .
Followers are almost bound to be disappointed by what is , after all , another fallible human who is just trying to :
5. Climb the greasy pole .
If the boss is nice to you , it ’s a bonus , because it ’s not required for them to get on in the organisation .
Leaders are promoted by those higher than them , not those below them – so it ’s only necessary for bosses to impress their bosses .
This is a recipe for disaffection amongst the followers .
Talking of which , forget the psychology of leadership , what do we know about the :
6. Psychology of followership ?
One of the best points Van Vugt et al.
make is that although it ’s leadership that has been most extensively studied and discussed , most of us end up as followers .
So really the psychology of followership is more important than leadership .
What is it that makes us follow someone else ?
And , more subversively : do we need leaders ?
For example , some research shows that when people know what they ’re doing , they resent having leadership imposed on them .
Generally , though , there ’s little known about followership , and how to avoid :
7. Alienation .
As a result of the strict hierarchies , huge pay differentials , poor decision - making , greasy - pole climbing and feeling powerless to change huge bureaucracies , followers naturally develop feelings of alienation , and alienation kills motivation and productivity , along with any hope of job satisfaction .
Talk is cheap
By implication the way to rectify these perceived problems is to do the reverse .
Do n’t instigate rigid hierarchies , discourage huge pay differentials , democratise decision - making and do n’t set impossible standards for leaders .
Some organisations are already managing this – presumably those in which followers do n’t find their bosses the biggest sources of stress – but most are not .
Of course talk is cheap and recognising the problem is quite different to knowing what to do about it , or having the courage to do it .
Anyone wanting to make these types of changes across an organisation would have to be a really great leader – and there are truly few of those around .
Do you know what the Great Napoleon , John Kennedy , Leonardo da Vinci and Churchill had in common ?
All four - loved power napping , the short sleep shortly after noon .
It is proven that the power nap reduces stress and helps to have a more productive afternoon , whether we are in the middle of the week or during the weekend .
At a time when even the list of our obligations grows and the time for a good night sleep is reduced , power nap is a very good way to fill up your batteries .
Power nap does not last long but it invigorates and stimulates our body and spirit , cutting pleasantly the day to two .
The power nap effect is like when a computer makes a SAVE and stores the information , in the same way our brain stores the information obtained until the power nap .
So when we wake up from power napping our memory is clean and our mind is refreshed .
The need for a power nap has to do with not only sufficient sleep at night but also with the load of information we receive .
Our brain has the need to rest and stop for a moment the flow of information and this is why we need to ‘ turn off the switch ’ during the day .
The signs that notify us that we need sleep are different for each person .
Some feel that energy is reduced , others experience memory gaps and others simply cannot keep their eyes open .
Whatever your warning alarm the key ‘ is to sleep a little ’ – take a power nap , of approximately 20 – 30 minutes so that you do not get in deep sleep ( REM ) .
If you sleep more , you run the risk of having difficulties to wake up and when you manage to wake up you will end up with a headache and bad mood .
The facts about power napping
The American psychologist at the Salk Institute in California , Sara Mentnik , in an authoritative surveys she conducted found that the power nap makes us more creative and more productive , while helping to improve our health .
In an investigation carried out by a psychiatry professor and chairman of the Hellenic Society for Research , had proved that the brief power nap generally improves mental attitude .
The study , as well as our everyday experience has shown that when you wake up from a power napping , you feel better and have increased vigilance .
The functions of the brain are improved and the reflexes work much better .
Large companies in the United States are convinced by the benefits of a power nap .
This is proven in practice because they have for their staff rest rooms with special chairs especially suited for power naps !
After taking their power naps their employees return at work in a better mood and they are more productive .
The Ministry of Health of France is considering establishing the right of workers for a 15 - minute power nap .
A very big survey carried out by the School of Public Health at Harvard University showed that people who regularly had a power nap are 34 % less likely to die because of heart problems .
This of course assumes that they also exercised , had a normal weight and a balanced diet .
Power napping improves the levels of cortisol in the blood ( a hormone which is considered ‘ bad ’ when it remains at high concentrations for a long period of time ) that falls dramatically after a night out .
Taking a power nap will improve the levels of cortisol enough to make us feel better .
All this shows that a power nap helps balance hormones and is necessary for good health .
Power naps are also necessary for children and students who do not sleep well , as they should .

It is good for our heart
15 proven tips for the perfect power nap
1. Ideal time for a power nap is between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm , just after lunch .
2 . To benefit the most from your power nap make sure that your sleep is without any disruptions .
Switch off your mobile .
3 . Put the alarm to wake you when you have completed 30 minutes of sleep .
It is very common to lie down and sleep for a while and end up sleeping for hours .
4 . Many people when they wake up they present some kind of instability and a sense of disorientation .
If this happens to you , sit down and try to relax for 5 minutes before standing up .
5 . To wake up from your power nap , put some water on your face , drink a glass of water and go out in the fresh air for a while .
6 . If you are not feeling like sleeping then do not try to force your self to sleep
7. 30 minutes of sleep is enough to relax .
If you sleep more , you will end up with a headache and bad mood .
8 . Put some soft music in the background .
9 . Make sure that you include power napping in your schedule [ See also 16 Tips for Better Time Management ]
10 .
Try not to consume big amounts of coffee or caffeine before your power nap .
11 . Check the temperature of the room you will take the power nap and make sure that you wo n’t feel cold or hot while you sleep .
Operate the air - conditioner if needed during the summer and the heating during the winter .
12 . Make sure that you are power napping in a room with a clean atmosphere .
13 .
Some people are more relaxed when there is no light in the room while they are power napping .
If possible darken the room or wear an eyeshade .
14 . Before entering your power nap zone try to free up your mind from any thoughts .
Focus your thoughts on something you enjoy .
15 .
Do not feel guilty .
Taking a power nap does not make you lazy .
It ’s a very simple technique you can use to improve both your mental and physical health .
6 Don’ts about power napping
1. Do not believe the proverb , which says , « anyone who sleeps does not catch fish » .
2. Do not try anxiously to sleep whenever you have insomnia .
3. Do not get under the blankets ( better use air - conditioning ) .
4. Do not think that in order to enjoy your power nap you need absolute silence .
5 . Do not sleep more than 30 minutes .
6. Do not take your power nap long time after lunch .
It is clear that the time we devote to sleep on average has declined and the consequences are obvious .
Power napping is an easy and pleasurable way to reduce some of the disadvantages of not sleeping well and also we can gain from the benefits of power napping as explained in this article .
The euro at ten :
Why do effects on trade between members appear smaller than historical estimates among smaller countries ?
Jeffrey Frankel
Trade among euro members has increased 10 - 15 % since the introduction of the euro , a far smaller effect than estimated prior to the currency 's introduction .
What explains the discrepancy between the European experience and previous history ?
This column explores the difficulty of explaining the difference .
With the tenth anniversary of the launching of the euro , everyone is taking stock .
The record of the euro shows both pluses and minuses .
Looking back , the euro has in many ways been more successful than predicted by the sceptics – many of them American economists .
The historic transition to a monetary union among 11 countries in 1999 went smoothly , the euro instantly became the world ’s number two international currency , and the officials of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) have from the beginning worked as citizens of Europe rather than as representatives of home constituencies .
After a rocky start , the ECB has achieved a strong reputation , the euro has achieved a strong value , and new members to the east have achieved membership in the club .
At the same time , however , some of the sceptics ’ warnings have turned out to have merit : shocks have hit members asymmetrically , cushions such as US - type labour mobility have remained thin , and the Stability and Growth Pact has proven unenforceable .
Furthermore , the popularity of the project with the elites does not extend to the public , many of whom are convinced that when the euro came to their country , higher prices came with it .
One of the most interesting questions at the inception of the euro was whether the elimination of currency risk and of foreign exchange transactions costs would promote trade among members .
Facilitating trade had been one of the most important of the original motivations of founders such as Jacques Delors .
Prior to 1999 , however , most economists believed that the effects of currency barriers between countries , if even greater than zero , were small – small , for example , relative to trade barriers .
In 2000 , Andrew Rose published in Economic Policy what turned out to be one of the most influential empirical papers of the decade : “ One Money , One Market … ” Applying the gravity model to a data set that was sufficiently large to encompass a number of currency unions led to an eye - opening finding : members of currency unions traded with each an estimated three times as much as with otherwise - similar trading partners .
Many found the tripling estimate implausibly large .
No sooner had Rose written his paper than the brigade to “ shrink the Rose effect ” 1 – or to make it disappear altogether – descended en masse .
But however plausible their methodological critiques , most replication - with - twists came away , at most , only denting the finding .
Few studies , if any , managed to shrink the estimated effect of currency barriers below the estimated effect of trade barriers .
This research was of course motivated by the coming of the euro in 1999 , even though estimates were necessarily based on historical data from ( much smaller ) countries that had adopted ( or left ) currency unions in the past .
By roughly the five - year mark , enough data had accumulated to allow an analysis of the early effects of the euro on European trade patterns .
Studies include Micco , Ordoñez and Stein ( 2003 ) , Bun and Klaassen ( 2002 ) , Flam and Nordström ( 2006 ) , Berger and Nitsch ( 2005 ) , De Nardis and Vicarelli ( 2003 ) , and Chintrakarn ( 2008 ) .
The general finding was that that bilateral trade among euro members had indeed increased significantly , but that the effect was far less than the one that had earlier been estimated by Rose and others on the larger data set of smaller countries .
Overall , the central tendency of these estimates seems to be a trade effect in the first few years on the order of 10 - 15 % .
None came anywhere near the tripling estimates of Rose , or the doubling estimates ( in a time series context ) of Glick and Rose ( 2002 ) .
Why such small trade effects ?
There are three leading explanations for the discrepancy between the estimates of the euro ’s effects ( 10 - 15 % increase in trade among members ) and those from historical estimates ( doubling or tripling ) .
It takes time for the effects on trade to rise to their full magnitudes ; Monetary unions have much smaller effects on large countries , and The Rose estimates on smaller countries were spuriously high as a result of the endogeneity of the decision to form a currency union ; in other words , bilateral currency links have historically been the result of bilateral trade links rather than the cause .
In a new paper ( Frankel , 2008 ) I try to assess the importance of each of these factors in explaining the discrepancy .
Surprisingly , the evidence does not support an important role for any of the three explanations .
Pursuant to the question of time lags ( Explanation 1 ) , I have updated the estimates .
The effect of the euro on trade between members remains highly significant statistically , but no higher in magnitude than it was four years ago ; it is steady at 10 - 15 % .
It is entirely possible that the future will reveal substantially larger effects as substantially more time goes by .
But at the moment there is little evidence to support the lags explanation .
Pursuant to the question of country size ( Explanation 2 ) , I tested for an effect of the interaction of size and currency union membership .
There is no tendency , overall , for currency unions to have larger effects on the trade of small countries than large .
The question of endogeneity ( Explanation 3 ) , is trickier .
I tried a “ natural experiment , ” designed to be as immune as possible from the argument that the choice of currency is endogenous with respect to trade .
The experiment is the effect on African CFA members ’ bilateral trade of the French franc ’s 1999 conversion to the euro .
The long - time link of CFA currencies to the French franc has clearly always had a political motivation .
So CFA trade with France could not in the past reliably be attributed to the currency link , perhaps even after controlling for common language , former colonial status , etc .
But in January 1999 , 14 CFA countries woke up in the morning and suddenly found themselves with the same currency link to Germany , Austria , Finland , Portugal , etc. , as they had with France .
There was no economic / political motivation on the part of the African countries that led them to an arrangement whereby they were tied to these other European currencies .
Thus if CFA trade with these other European countries has risen , that suggests a euro effect that we can declare causal .
The dummy variable representing whether one partner is a CFA country and the other a euro country has a highly significant coefficient of .57 .
Taking the exponent , the point estimate is that the euro boosted bilateral trade between the relevant African and European countries by 76 % .
It is not doubling , and the timing is not perfect .
But it does suggest that the effect on trade among small countries is very substantial even after correcting for endogeneity .
Thus none of the three explanations appears to explain the gap between the recent euro estimates and the historical estimates .
Perhaps time will offer more evidence for one or more of the explanations in the future .
For the moment , the gap remains something of a mystery .
But promotion of trade must nevertheless be counted one of the successes of the euro .
If Rose had come up with a 15 % effect on trade from the beginning , that would have been considered important .
Furthermore , there has been virtually no evidence of diversion of trade away from non-members , which is important for judging economic welfare .

That was what almost happened with Mrs. Weinstein , an active , athletic 64 - year - old who lives in New London , N.H .
And it was her great fortune to finally visit a surgeon who told her so .
He told her bluntly that her pain was caused by arthritis , not the torn cartilage .
No one had told her that before , Mrs. Weinstein said , and looking back on her quest to get a scan and get the cartilage fixed , she shook her head in dismay .
There ’s no surgical procedure short of a knee replacement that will help , and she ’s not ready for a knee replacement .
“ I feel that I have come full circle , ” she said .
“ I will cope on my own with this knee . ”
In fact , Mrs. Weinstein was also lucky because her problem was with her knee .
It ’s one of only two body parts  the other is the back  where there are good data on abnormalities that turn up in people who feel just fine , indicating that the abnormalities may not be so abnormal after all .
But even the data on knees comes from just one study , and researchers say the problem is far from fixed .
It is difficult to conduct scans on people who feel fine  most do not want to spend time in an M.R.I. machine , and CT scans require that people be exposed to radiation .
But that leaves patients and doctors in an untenable situation .
“ It ’s a concern , is n’t it ? ” said Dr. Jeffrey Jarvik , a professor of radiology and neurosurgery at the University of Washington .
“ We are trying to fix things that should n’t be fixed . ”
As a rheumatologist , Dr. Felson saw patient after patient with knee pain , many of whom had already had scans .
And he was becoming concerned about their findings .
Often , a scan would show that a person with arthritis had a torn meniscus , cartilage that stabilizes the knee .
And often the result was surgery  orthopedic surgeons do more meniscus surgery than any other operation .
But , Dr. Felson wondered , was the torn cartilage an injury causing pain or was the arthritis causing pain and the tear a consequence of arthritis ?
People who drive Hummers receive almost five times as many traffic tickets as the average driver , according to a new study .
Quality Planning Corp. , which helps insurance companies identify risk , surveyed data from 1.7 million drivers and found the Hummer H2 and H3 are the most frequently ticketed vehicles on the road , surpassing even the 565 - horsepower Mercedes CLK 63 AMG .
At the other end of the spectrum , the Jaguar XJ GMC Sierra CL1500 pickup was the vehicle least likely to attract the attention of Johnny Law .
The study found those who drive the leviathans get 4.63 times as many tickets as the average driver , something the researchers attribute to the feeling of invincibility that comes from driving a rolling bank vault .
" The sense of power that Hummer drivers derive from their vehicle may be directly correlated with the number of violations they incur , or perhaps Hummer drivers , by virtue of their driving position , are less likely to notice road hazards , signs , pedestrians and other drivers , " Raj Bhat , president of Quality Planning , said in a statement .
Mark S. Foster , author of " A Nation on Wheels : The Automobile Culture in America Since 1945 , " was even more direct , essentially calling Hummer drivers colossal jerks .
" Hummer drivers feel like kings of the road because of their elevated driving positions , " he said .
" As these statistics show , they are leading the pack when it comes to violating the law , which may reflect their driving attitude . "
Ouch .
The study suggests such an attitude is unique to Hummer drivers and does n't apply to everyone in an SUV , because the the Hummer was followed by the diminutive Scion tC and xB .
People behind the wheel of those cars were 4.6 and 4.03 times , respectively , as likely to get tickets than the average driver .
The researchers attributed that to the fact the average Scion driver is in his or her early 20s .
Other vehicles on the top - 10 list included the Toyota Solara and Subaru Outback .
What 's weird is the Hummer is essentially a Chevrolet Tahoe under the skin , but Tahoe drivers were less likely than average to be ticketed for moving violations .
Other cars on the do - gooder list include the Jaguar XJ and Buick Lucerne .
So , are Hummer drivers being persecuted by state troopers ?
The boys at The Hummer Club would probably say yes , considering how widely reviled their vehicles are .
But we 're not so sure .
There 's not a lot of evidence suggesting cops target specific vehicles for tickets .
A lot of people argue people in red cars are more likely to get stopped , for example , but the guys at Edmunds.com say that 's a myth .
Hummer drivers , therefore , have some serious explaining to do .

On January 7 " Gunny " Bob Newman , host of The Gunny Bob Show on Colorado 's KOA - AM Radio , used his Clear Channel - owned media platform to make false and defamatory comments about gay service members .
Newman suggested that lifting " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , " the ban on allowing qualified gay military personnel to serve openly in the armed forces , would lead to greater HIV risk .
On the program Mr. Newman said :
" Interesting , though , how Barack Obama , who strictly avoided military service , has – says that the key test must be those things .
He left a lot of stuff out .
Like being able to fight with as much combat power as you possibly can .
And if we have gays serving openly in the military , according to the military , that is going to reduce their combat power .
You reduce combat power , casualties can go up .
We had a doctor call in the last hour , a military doctor , been in a long time , and he explained the dangers of HIV - AIDS on the battlefield .
Especially when it comes to combat transfusions at the battalion aid station or where have you , in the back of a Hummer ambulance , wherever .
And I added there 's also the danger of contamination when it comes to all the first responders on scene .
Often times that 's gonna be a medic or a corpsman .
Or just another soldier – does n't have to be a medic or a corpsman or a Marine or what have you – who faces the additional risk of HIV - AIDS contamination .
And the doctor also went on to explain , you know , how these transfusions are sought and how quickly they must happen .
And he pointed out that if we do this , and more and more gays join the military and they are HIV - positive or suffering from AIDS , and their blood ends up getting transfused , you know , into another military person , well , then that 's a death sentence for the other person too .
303-713-8585 .
This does n't bother Barack Obama .
It does n't faze him in the least .
He does n't care if a soldier or a Marine or a SEAL or what have you gets HIV , becomes HIV - positive , and then develops AIDS and dies because he happened to get a transfusion from an , say , an openly gay person with a very active sexual , open lifestyle .
Because to Obama , what 's most important is two things , being politically correct – excuse me , three things : being politically correct ; functioning as a good leftist ; and number three , paying back the gay and lesbian lobby , which donated such staggering sums of money to his campaign .
He owes them a lot of money . "

Nationalize this beast now and sack them all .
If ever there was a company that was begging for intervention – well , besides AIG – it ’s Citi .
They ca n’t survive without bailout cash and yet they own a damned fleet of corporate jets called CitiFlight .
Beleaguered Citigroup is upgrading its mile - high club with a brand - new $ 50 million corporate jet – only this time , it ’s the taxpayers who are getting screwed .
Even though the bank ’s stock is as cheap as a gallon of gas and it ’s burning through a $ 45 billion taxpayer - funded rescue , the airhead execs pushed through the purchase of a new Dassault Falcon 7X , according to a source familiar with the deal .
The French - made luxury jet seats up to 12 in a plush interior with leather seats , sofas and a customizable entertainment center , according to Dassault ’s sales literature .
It can cruise 5,950 miles before refueling and has a top speed of 559 mph .

American ’s Journey
December 29 , 2008
There are two sides to every story .
Is it possible that Americans are given access to only one side of the story involving struggles in the middle East ?
I wonder if we knew the whole story our perspective might change to one reflecting more balance .
I wonder if it is our business at all – except that it seems wrong to stand by while people slaughter each other when one has the power to stop it .
But are we doing that ?
Can Americans form a reasoned opinion based on the information presented to the American public through normal media outlets ?
The American federal government ignores President George Washington ’s warning stated in his 1796 Farewell Address : to stay out of foreign entanglements – Why ?
Are they wiser than he ?
Here ’s a sample :
" Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground ?
Why , by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe , entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition , rivalship , interest , humor , or caprice ? "
Is it possible that one side of this bloodbath has gotten the upper hand when it comes to influence in American government ?
Is it possible that some American " public servants " might have stronger allegiances OUTSIDE the U.S. ?
Is it possible that movies and television impress Americans with an unbalanced perspective ?
Would an unbalanced perspective allow Americans to form opinions that will result in justice for all ?
Do negative consequences result from ill - informed public decisions ?
( Click here ) – to see for yourself who is behind the curtain .
Is it possible , intentionally or unintentionally that the biases of these people will become manifest in the final product ?
Is it possible that the news we watch does n’t give us both sides of the story and could use a little more balance ?
Is it possible that news anchors and news owners either consciously or unconsciously bias the news we take for granted as the whole truth ?
Is it possible that we Americans are only hearing one side of the story ?

Is the second coming of the woolly mammoth near ?
Possibly , say researchers at Japan 's Institute of Physical and Chemical Research ( RIKEN ) , who have successfully cloned mice from carcasses that spent years in a deep freezer .
A RIKEN research team led by genetic scientist Teruhiko Wakayama successfully demonstrated a promising new cloning technique by replicating frozen laboratory mice whose cells were severely damaged after 16 years in permafrost - like conditions ( - 20 degrees Celsius ) .
The technique might one day be used to resurrect mammoths and other extinct species , according to the researchers .
Here 's some video from ANN News :
Scientists have long discussed the possibility of resurrecting extinct animal species by cloning carcasses preserved in ice , but existing techniques do not work with dead , freeze - damaged cell tissue .
However , the RIKEN researchers were able to extract nuclei from the ruptured brain cells of the frozen mice after breaking down the tissue in a culture solution .
Then , using the conventional nuclear transfer technique ( which involves inserting cellular material from the frozen mice into the egg cells of healthy mice ) , the researchers created embryonic clones from the extracted brain cell nuclei .
After that , the researchers established embryonic stem cell lines from the cloned embryos , which they used to produce four cloned mice .
When the clones reached maturity , they mated with other mice to produce healthy offspring .
Healthy offspring of cloned mice
The ability of clones to reproduce is a promising development for those interested in resurrecting extinct species .
Mammoths top the list of extinct animals that scientists will try to clone , primarily because many preserved specimens have been found buried in ice .
In July 2007 , a well - preserved frozen baby mammoth discovered in the Siberian Arctic was shipped to researchers in Japan .
" There are many technical challenges involved in resurrecting a mammoth , " says Wakayama .
" But we have shown that the nuclear transfer method can be used to create healthy clones , even when the animal 's cells have been damaged by permafrost - like conditions . "
Meanwhile , Kinki University biology professor Akira Iritani is pleased with the development .
Iritani , a leading member of the Mammoth Creation Project -- a Japanese organization that aims to resurrect the woolly mammoth by cloning frozen specimens -- estimates as many as 10,000 frozen mammoth specimens lie buried in ice around the world , waiting to be cloned .
Iritani also coordinates the " Pleistocene Park " project , which aims to set up a Jurassic Park - like sanctuary in northern Siberia populated with resurrected mammoths and other creatures that roamed the Earth 20,000 years ago .
The envisioned park would cover an area twice the size of Japan and include woolly rhinos , Siberian tigers , steppe lions , giant deer , ancient foxes , and ancestors of the Siberian horse .

“ We do expect the near - term environment to be very challenging , ” Mr. Kelleher said .
“ This recession has turned global in a relatively short time frame . ”
The bank is trying to chart a new course as a deposit - taking institution , which will provide new types of earnings as well as a steady base of financing for some of the bank ’s operations .
But the makeover includes a retrenchment from areas that once provided handsome profits like proprietary trading , principal investing and prime brokerage , the business that services hedge funds .
Morgan  and its closest rival , Goldman Sachs  have yet to prove they can find new ways to churn out high profits again in the new environment .
Goldman reported a quarterly loss of $ 2.1 billion on Tuesday , its first loss ever .
Investors pushed Goldman ’s stock upward on the news , because the loss was not as bad as some had feared .
Much of Morgan ’s woes continue to relate to investments it made before the credit crisis began .
The bank continued to take losses on those all year , but in the last three quarters , revenue outweighed those losses .
In the fourth quarter , the worst losses came from mortgage investments , private equity and real estate .
The bank ’s loss this quarter was less than its fourth - quarter loss last year of $ 3.6 billion , or $ 3.61 a share , when Morgan took the bulk of its mortgage write - downs .
But profit this year was down over all 49 percent  to $ 1.59 billion  from last year , when it was $ 3.14 billion .
Morgan ’s pain was most concentrated in the bank ’s asset management unit , where revenue was a negative $ 386 million , down 160 percent from the third quarter .
The unit was stung by a $ 187 million loss related to structured investment vehicles on its balance sheet and write - downs on real estate and private equity in its merchant bank .
It also took a $ 243 million impairment charge on its Crescent real estate subsidiary .
And customers also withdrew $ 76.5 billion of assets from the unit , leaving Morgan with much lower fee revenue .
The institutional securities group also suffered from write - downs , recording revenue of $ 844 million , down 86 percent from the third quarter .
The tally of losses included : $ 1.2 billion on mortgage assets , $ 1.1 billion of write - downs on loans related to buyout commitments and $ 1.8 billion in loses in real estate and other investment funds .
And revenue in businesses like underwriting , equity sales and credit products remained lower than a year ago .
Greg Maddux has thrown his last pitch .
The four - time Cy Young winner will announce his retirement Monday at the baseball winter meetings , near his home in Las Vegas .
Maddux , who turns 43 in April , ranks eighth on the career wins list with 355 .
He went 8 - 13 with a 4.22 ERA last season with the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers .
Maddux made three relief appearances in the playoffs for the Dodgers this year -- he had an 0.00 ERA over four innings -- and then filed for free agency amid speculation he would retire .
On Friday , confirmation came from the office of Maddux 's agent , Scott Boras .
Maddux , his family and Boras will hold a news conference at the hotel where the meetings are being held to announce one of baseball 's greatest pitchers is finished .
Last month , Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti left open the possibility that Maddux would return for a 24th season in the majors .
" I told Scott we 'd love to have him back , and we 're not going to be closing the door on Greg Maddux anytime soon , " Colletti said at the time .
" I 've known him for a long , long time .
I respect who he is and admire him for what he 's done .
I know the impact he has on a club and on a franchise . "

Introduction & Overview
There are a number of alternative healing therapies that work so well and cost so little ( compared to conventional treatment ) , that Organized Medicine , the Food & Drug Administration , and their overlords in the Pharmaceutical Industry would rather the public not know about them .
The reason is obvious : Alternative , non-toxic therapies represent a potential loss of billions of dollars to allopathic ( drug ) medicine and drug companies .
The Big Three have collectively engaged in a medical conspiracy for the better part of 70 years to influence legislative bodies on both the state and federal level to create regulations that promote the use of drug medicine while simultaneously creating restrictive , controlling mechanisms ( licencing , government approval , etc ) designed to limit and stifle the availability of non-drug , alternative modalities .
The conspiracy to limit and eliminate competition from non-drug therapies began with the Flexner Report of 1910 .
Abraham Flexner was engaged by John D. Rockefeller to run around the country and ' evaluate ' the effectiveness of therapies taught in medical schools and other institutions of the healing arts .
Rockefeller wanted to dominate control over petrolem , petrochemicals , and pharmaceuticals ( which are derived from ' coal tars ' or crude oil ) .
He arranged for his company , Standard Oil of New Jersey to obtain a controlling interest in a huge German drug cartel called I. G. Farben .
He pulled in his stronger competitors like Andrew Carnegie and JP Morgan as partners , while making other , less powerful players , stockholders in Standard Oil .
Those who would not come into the fold " were crushed " according to a Rockefeller biographer ( W. Hoffman , David : Report on a Rockefeller { New York : Lyle Stuart , Inc. , 1971 }page 24 . )
The report Flexner submitted to The Carnegie Foundation was titled " Medical Education in the United States and Canada " .
Page 22 of the report said : " the privileges of the medical school can no longer be open to casual strollers from the highway .
It is necessary to install a doorkeeper who will , by critical scrutiny , ascertain the fitness of the applicant , a necessity suggested , in the first place , but consideration for the candidate , whose time and talents will serve him better in some other vocation , if he be unfit for this , and in the second , by consideration for a public entitled to protection from those whom the very boldness of modern medical strategy equips with instruments that , tremendously effective for good when rightly used , are all the more terrible for harm if ignorantly or incompetently employed " .
All too often , politicians are prepared to enact laws that rob citizens of yet another constitutional freedom under the banner of " public protection " .
Needless to say , congress swallowed the recommendations of this report hook , line , and sinker .
It was decided that the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , would be the " doorkeeper " .
The AMA was now empowered to certify or de-certify any medical school in the country on the grounds of whether that school met the AMA 's standards of " approved " medicine .
The AMA came into existence in 1847 .
It is a private organization of allopathic physicians which serves the interests of its members , especially when it comes to influencing favorable legislation .
It functions in every sense of the word as a union , although its members wear white collars instead of blue .
Giving the AMA the power over the certification of medical schools is the equivalent of giving the Teamsters Union the exclusive right to decide on the laws of interstate commerce and transportation .
Is it any wonder that the total number of medical schools in the United States went from 160 in 1906 ( before the Flexner Report ) to 85 in 1920 and further down to 69 schools in 1944 ?
A little like putting the fox in charge of the hen house , no ?
Not surprisingly , Flexner ' found ' that any discipline that did n't use drugs to help cure the patient was tantamount to quackery and charlatanism .
Medical schools that offered courses in bioelectric Medicine , Homeopathy or Eastern Medicine , for example , were told to either drop these courses from their curriculum or lose their accreditation and underwriting support .
A few schools resisted for a time , but eventually most schools cooperated ( or were closed down ) .
A similar scenario was played out in Canada .
It was attempted in England against Homeopathy , but it failed due to the personal intervention of the Royal Family who had received much relief and healing at the hands of Homeopathic healers in the 19th century .
By the way , the AMA was found guilty of conspiracy against chiropractors in 1987 by a federal judge and fined a couple of million dollars .
Here in America , a relentless campaign of misinformation , fraud , deception , and suppression of alternative therapies and healers has been in place for the better part of this century in order to keep highly effective alternative therapies from reaching any significant plateau of public awareness .
Control is exerted through " news items " and propaganda from pro-establishment organizations like The American Medical Association , The American Cancer Society , The Diabetes Foundation , etc. ; local medical boards ; and government agencies like the FDA , The National Institute of Health ( NIH ) , and The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , The National Academy of Science , etc. with the full cooperation of main - stream media of course .
Over the past decades , hundreds of caring , concerned , and conscientious alternative healers have been jailed and abused like common criminals for the " crime " of curing people of life - threatening diseases in an " unapproved " manner by heavy - handed government agents who swoop down on clinics with drawn guns , flax jackets , and Gestapo manners .
All the while , these same agents and agencies posture themselves before TV cameras and the public under the ludicrous pretense of being servants of the people and protectors of the common good .
The medico - drug cartel was summed up by J.W Hodge , M.D. , of Niagara Falls , N.Y. , in these words : ' The medical monopoly or medical trust , euphemistically called the American Medical Association , is not merely the meanest monopoly ever organized , but the most arrogant , dangerous and despotic organization which ever managed a free people in this or any other age .
Any and all methods of healing the sick by means of safe , simple and natural remedies are sure to be assailed and denounced by the arrogant leaders of the AMA doctors ' trust as fakes , frauds and humbugs Every practioner of the healing art who does not ally himself with the medical trust is denounced as a ' dangerous quack ' and impostor by the predatory trust doctors .
Every sanitarian who attempts to restore the sick to a state of health by natural means without resort to the knife or poisonous drugs , disease imparting serums , deadly toxins or vaccines , is at once pounced upon by these medical tyrants and fanatics , bitterly denounced , vilified and persecuted to the fullest extent . '
( see The Drug Story for more revelations about the AMA , the House of Rockefeller and the pharmaceutical industry )
At long last , however , the public 's consciousness seems to have finally reached a critical mass and is now beginning to seriously question the efficacy and appropriateness of using orthodox therapies and allopathic medicine in general .
Thank God .
It 's been too long overdue .
Understanding the Nature of Ill Health and Disease
The entire approach and foundation of Orthodox Medicine is based on Luis Pasteur 's Germ Theory , a flawed concept .
A disease condition is viewed by the orthodoxy as an isolated event , confined to the area in which it manifests itself ( E.g. an ear infection , eye infection , gum infection , lung cancer , skin cancer , etc. ) .
Under this theory , for unknown reasons , microbes or tumors indiscriminately grow in the patient and must be cut ( surgery ) , burned ( radiation ) , or poisoned ( drugs ) out of the body .
In the orthodox model , the solution is sought through mechanical and chemical means .
Seeking to understand WHY the infection or disease condition appeared in the first place , is not seriously explored .
The quick fix with a prescription for drugs to smother the symptoms is the typical orthodox ' answer ' .
A contemporary of Pasteur , Antoine Bechamp , had a different opinion as to why disease conditions ' took hold ' .
Bechamp felt that the ENVIRONMENT , or the ECOLOGY of the blood played the critical role in deciding whether disease conditions would manifest or not .
Alternative medicine explores the stressors ( environmental , biological , chemical , psychological , and emotional ) in a patient 's life that cause a weakening of a particular energy field ; which in turn allows the manifestation of a disease condition in a weakened area .
In order to maintain a state of health , all energy systems within the body need to exist in a state of balance or equilibrium .
Imbalance leads to conditions of discomfort ( dis-ease ) which eventually spirals into ill health if not corrected .
The Chinese and Indians ( Ayurvedic medicine ) had worked all of this out thousands of years ago .
Orthodox or Allopathic Medicine utilizes poisonous substances ( drugs ) in non-lethal dosages in order to suppress symptoms in an affected area .
This approach neither addresses the cause of the disease condition , nor is it responsible for healing the patient .
Rather , the use of drugs often will temporarily mask the outer manifestations of the malady , while at the same time , drive the disease deeper into the body ... only to reappear at a later date , as a more serious , and chronic health threat .
One of the many flaws of the orthodox approach is that it focuses on the disease condition itself , rather than the patient .
The term wholistic ( or holistic ) originally sprang up to distinguish those physicians whose diagnostic gestalt considers all of the physical , emotional , and spiritual energies interacting with the patient .
Do not assume that the only difference between allopathic and alternative medicine , however , is an honest difference of opinion in the philosophies and views on the origin of disease states .
Hardly !.
There is , in truth , a concerted , organized agenda - concocted , planned , and contrived by the international pharmaceutical companies and organized medicine to suppress any and every alternative , non-drug therapy that WORKS .
Why ?
Because they want people to keep on coming back for more treatments and more drugs .
A cured patient is a lost source of income .
A sick patient who is marginally " improved " is a manageable patient .
Managing patients means routine office visits and renewing of drug prescriptions .
Therefore , a manageable patient is a continuing source of income ; a cash cow if you will .
Multiply that by a few hundred million people and you get an idea why this deceit is being put upon you .
The profits from the so called " health - care " industry are staggering !
The thrust of the orthodox pharmaceutical agenda is to provide temporary relief , while never addressing the cause of the disease condition .
This agenda insures regular visits to the doctor 's office and requires the patient to routinely return to the pharmacy to refill his prescriptions .
This is what the game is all about folks , plain and simple .
Deny it or Deal with it , ... Stick with it or Get Out of it !
... your choice .

Natural Healing
The patient 's immune system and the immune system alone is responsible for healing and recovery from ill health .
The use of drugs and vaccines represents an assault on the immune system .
In some cases , the use of a particular drug might be a wise choice to speed healing and recovery for the patient , but the use of natural , orthomolecular therapies and substances ( substances normally found in Nature ) that can more effectively address the cause of the disease should be considered first because natural substances work in harmony with Nature .
They aid and stimulate the body to truly cure itself , without the terrible millstone of drug side - effects .
The human body is predisposed to heal itself and to exist as a healthy , thriving organism .
We inhibit that process by ingesting unhealthy foods , fouling our inner environment with toxins , and relying upon poisonous substances to treat disease conditions .
Unlike ' miracle drugs ' and other ' drug breakthroughs ' , you will never see or hear anything from mainstream media about most of the therapies described here .
The Big Three see to that , but you can still glean this information from the alternative health press , books , web sites , and at health expos .
Some of these alternative therapies require high - tech equipment and specialized knowledge , but many , many others can be done at home without third party intervention or supervision .
It 's amazing , but true , that many of the most effective healing therapies ( even for grave , life - threatening disease conditions ) are simple things that you can do for yourself at home .
You simply have to educate yourself and take responsibility for your own health .
The following is a brief overview of some alternative therapies that have demonstrated themselves to be effective and readily obtainable , usually at a low to modest cost .
This list is far from complete .
As time permits , the description and scope of these and other therapies will be added to , and expanded upon .
Oxydative Therapies
MMS1 , MMS2 , & CDS Water
Mix equal parts ( drops ) of 28 % Sodium Chlorite solution and 50 % Citric Acid solution and you get " activated " MMS ( Miracle Mineral Solution , a name coined by Jim Humble ) , an incredibly effective an dpowerful germicidal solution and curative therapy .
A very simple , but powerful , oxiding molecule called Chlorine Dioxide gas , is releaased when MMS is activated .
The chlorine atom is able to pull out FIVE electrons from the outer orbit of the membranes of ALL pathogenic organisms .
This causes the immediate death of the organism , but has NO adverse affect on normal bodily tissue .

Oxygen therapies encompass more than the application of regular oxygen ( O2 ) , although regular oxygen can speed and assist healing ; especially when used in higher - than - normal concentrations and under pressure , such as used in Hyperbaric Oxygen Chambers .
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy ( HBOT ) has been traditionally used for rapid detoxification in acute situations , but it also has shown to be extremely efficacious for new stroke victims .
It has been found that almost all of the usual conditions ( paralysis , slurred / no speech , etc. ) associated with a stroke can be minimized or eliminated entirely by subjecting the patient to a hyperbaric oxygen treatment within the first 36 hours of a stroke .
The quicker the patient can be treated from the onset of the stroke , the better the results .
Even cases started a few days or even weeks after a stoke have shown remarkable results .
HBOT has also proven helpful in cases involving other forms of brain damage as well .
Singlet Oxygen Therapies
Oxygen atoms can be configured into certain quasi-stable arrangements that will allow a single oxygen atom to be released .
This atom is called a singlet oxygen ( O1 ) .
For therapeutic purposes , single atoms of oxygen can be released from hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) which breaks down to water ( H2O ) and a singlet oxygen ( O1 ) , and also from ozone ( O3 ) , which reduces to oxygen ( O2 ) and a singlet oxygen .
When a singlet oxygen atom is released within the body , it is highly reactive and will oxidize ( reduce or break down ) the molecular structure of undesirable and harmful organisms ( bacteria , foreign proteins , etc. ) and diseased tissue ( E.g. cancer cells ) .
This high - energy form of oxygen ( O1 ) possesses a greatly enhanced healing capacity than that exhibited by regular oxygen ( O2 ) .
Hydrogen Peroxide
A bottle of 3 ½ % Hydrogen Peroxide is available in any pharmacy for under a dollar and can be used daily to keep the mouth and gums germ - free ( always use full strength and try to retain in the mouth as long as possible ) .
It should also be conscientiously applied to disinfect any type of oral infection , cut , sore , or wound that one may encounter .
For external use , the drug store variety of hydrogen peroxide is OK , but it does have some low levels of contaminants in it .
For internal use , it 's wiser to use Food - grade hydrogen peroxide .
You can make your own 3 ½ % hydrogen peroxide by diluting 35 % food - grade hydrogen peroxide by a ratio of 10:1 with distilled water .
However , that should not stop you from using pharmacy - grade hydrogen peroxide externally - if you are in normal health .
People trying to recover from serious diseases such as AIDS or cancer need to be more concerned about ingesting contaminants .
35 % Food - Grade Hydrogen Peroxide is available at many farm supply outlets and by mail order .
Since it 's more concentrated , 35 % hydrogen peroxide can produce spectacular results when intelligently applied .
Hydrogen peroxide can also be applied either internally as injections ( directly into a cancerous tumor for example ) or intravenously into the blood stream .
If properly diluted , hydrogen peroxide can also be ingested .
Medical Cartel Sponsored ' Studies '
Of course , you have to know what you 're doing .
At higher concentrations , H2O2 is powerful and can burn tissue , but look to the alternative health press for information from practitioners who are actually using this therapy .
Do n't expect on an honest accessment from the allopathic crowd .
Like most cheap , unpatentable natural solutions , the pharmaceutical / organized medicine cartel will try to frieghten you off from using these therapies with scares stories of exaggerated dangers , ommision of relevant data , and insertion of misleading statements .
For example , they will point to rat studies that show increassed stomach cancers from ingesting H2O2 .
By promoting this ' study ' , the cartel wants you to draw the conclusion that you will get stomach cancer from injesting hydrogen perozide without actually saying it .
No additional details such as the concentration of the peroxide administered , frequency of dosage , quantity given vis a vis body weight etc. , are provided about the ' study ' in these press reports - only the bottom line conclusion : .
Of course , most knowledgeable researchers know that rat studies do n't equate to people studies .
Rat studies , in fact , have an extremely limited range of applicability for purposes of human extrapolation .
In addition , most studies are funded by pharmaceuticals or government agencies and they have an agenda that has nothing to do with sincere scientific inquiry .
Ralph Moss and Linus Pauling are two individuals who come to mind who looked at different cartel sponsored ' studies ' and clearly demonstrated that the Big Boys can and will skew a ' study ' in any direction they wish it to go .
Scientific honesty among cartel sponsored investigative groups is a myth .
All medical schools , teaching universities , and government health organizations such as the National Institute of Health ( NIH ) , National Cancer Institute , National Academy of Science , etc. , etc. are all under the cartel 's propaganda umbrella .
Ozone
Ozone ( O3 ) is composed of three atoms of oxygen lightly bound together .
One of those atoms can easily break away and form regular oxygen ( O2 ) and a singlet oxygen atom ( O1 ) .
Through oxidation , the singlet oxygen atom is capable of producing amazing healing results .
Ozone can be produced with a hot or " cold " spark , with ultraviolet light , or with a method invented by Nikola Tesla called cold plasma ozone production .
The cold plasma method produces much larger quantities of ozone and is the preferred means of production for therapeutic purposes .
Larger , cold plasma ozone machines can only be legally purchased outside of the United States , but there are underground ' suitcase ' size units being manufactured clandestinely in the U.S. .
Smaller cold plasma ozone generators , however , are legally available in the U.S.as water pruifiers ( send e-mail < Ken Adachi , Editor > for more info ) .
All cold plasma ozone generators can easily produce high quality Ozonated Water , which can be ingested as often as desired .
The effects of drinking ozonated water on a regular basis can be very healthful .
People with serious disease conditions will notice more - pronounced effects in a shorter space of time than those who are in good health , but the benefits of ozonated water are realized by all who use it , whether you have a serious health concern or not .
The ozone from the ozonated water passes into the bloodstream via the stomach / small intestines and provides the benefits of ozone without the need for expensive equipment .
Some people notice a very slight sensation of light headedness the first time they drink ozone water .
It 's temporary and usually only happens the first time - if at all .
The reaction is due to slightly more oxygen reaching the brain than normal .
Ingested daily , ozone water will progressively send ozone into deeper tissues of the body , oxidizing non organic drug residues and hidden , dormant pathogens .
You might be surprised to learn that the virus that gave you chicken pox as a child or herpes as a young adult is still hidden deep within the body such as in the nerve ganglion at the base of the spine .
Your immune system developed antibodies which normally hold these residual bugs in check , but that does n't mean that the bugs are gone , as any person who suffers recurrent bouts of herpes will attest .
But if you hit them long enough and hard enough with ozone ( or certain other alternative therapies ) , they will be gone - for good .
Another useful product that can be applied topically is called Ozonated Olive Oil .
It is made by bubbling ozone through olive oil for a considerable period of time ( weeks ) until the olive oil eventually becomes saturated with the ozone molecules and becomes much thicker .
Afterwards , the product can be applied as a balm to infected areas and will often greatly promote and / or speed healing .
Methods of Ozone Application
Medically , ozone can be applied in different ways .
One of the oldest methods , used in Germany for over 60 years , is called Autohemotherapy .
This technique involves removeing about a pint of blood , ozonating it , and return it intravenously to the patient .
It works , but it 's rather limited in the amount of ozone applied .
Another method has the patient hooked up to a dialysis type machine with blood coming out one arm , going through the machine for ozonation , and returned via tubes hooked up to the other arm .
You get a lot more ozone into the body with this technique , but the pumping mechnaisms used to push the blood around can damage the membranes of the red blood cells somewhat .
A third technique is called Ozone Injection .
Like its name implies , the ozone is carefully and slowly injected into the patient .
Ozone , remember , is composed of oxygen atoms .
Oxygen dissolves into the blood ; it does not form bubbles in the bloodstream like air , which is composed of oxygen and 80 % nitrogen .
Many ozone specialist prefer this later method , but each of these ozone techniques have their advocates .

Alkalizing pH Therapy
Vernon Johnston was given the typical death sentence for a rapidly advancing prostate cancer that had begun to metastacize to his bones ( which the orthodox cancer doctors told him was in stage IV ) .
He ordered some Cesium alkalating mixture over the internet designed to increase pH , but it did n't arrive in time , so logic told him that Baking Soda should also work for alkalizing his pH .
He decided to use black strap molasses as a " carrier " to get it pulled into the cancer cells .
He 's still alive and cancer free five years later after his 2008 " Dance with Cancer . "

Bioelectro Medicine
There are a number of devices that use specialized electric fields to alter the function or condition of targeted tissue , organisms , or cells within the body .
These electric fields can be programmed to promote the healing of healthy tissue or inhibit the growth of undesired organisms .
Where there are electric fields , there are also magnetic fields , usually rotated at 90 degress to each other .
The interplay of the electric and magnetic fields play a role in this therapy , but the frequency , the shape of the wave , the duration and polarity of the pulse , etc. , all play into the mix and can make the difference between success or failure depending on the care and attention given to these parameters .
This is not necessarily a new technology .
At the turn of the 19th century , Nikola Tesla patented many Electro - inventions that demonstrated incredible health - promoting attributes ; some of them based on the use of his high frequency , high voltage DC pulse generator circuits which produced a new ether - derived form of energy called Radiant Energy .
Tesla had even patented a highly efficient cold plasma ozone generator by 1893 .
Dr. Royal Rife
In the late 20's and early 1930's , Dr. Royal Raymond Rife from San Diego , California , developed a high powered microscope which he used in conjunction with a frequency generator .
Using special UV light , Rife 's mircroscope was capable of 60,000 x magnification !
This degree of magnification allowed him to observe LIVE virus and bacteria organisms while he applied the MOR ( Mortal Oscillatory Resonance ) frequency from his frequency generator via plasma tube radiation of the energy .
He was able to destroy all manner of disease organisms ( including cancer related organisms ) by merely ' tuning ' the generator to the correct resonant frequency of these organisms and applying the oscillating electric fields via the plasma driven , " Beam Ray Tube " .
Everything in the universe , living or dead , and its own resonant frequency .
If you apply this exact resonant frequency to the object or organism , it will begin vibrating until it literally shatters itself .
You 've all seen the wine glass and the opera singer demonstration .
Same deal for microbes .
60,000 x magnifications is an unheard of degree of magnification in a light microscope , even by today 's technical standards .
Today 's electron microscope can deliver high magnification , but it can only view DEAD organisms .
The ability to view micro organims in a LIVING state is of great importance to diagnostic and therapeutic goals .
This is an extremely important point to understand .
Rife 's microscope played no role in the actual destruction of the pathogenic organisms , but it allowed him to view the effects of the electric fields from the Beam Ray Tube upon the organism itself .
As Rife adjusted and tuned his frequency generator to the correct frequency , he was able to observe the disintegration of the bacteria , parasite , or virii under the influence of the resonant electro - magnetic fields exerted by the Beam Ray Tube .
At first , Rife 's enormous accomplishments were ballyhooed in the press .
He was feted and hosted by the local medical elites of the day who were hoping to climb onto the Glory Bandwagon with him and get their mug published in the newspaper as a supporter and cohort of the " man who could finally end cancer " .
But the Big Boys finally caught up with him .
I 'm referring to the string pullers in organized medicine and the pharmaceutical industry .
Needless to say , once word of Rife 's success began to spread too wide , he was quickly ' neutralized ' by organized medicine and demoralized into obscurity ( unending court litigation , charges of quakery , intimidation of financial supporters , the burning down of laboratories , etc ... the " usual ' routine ) .
His principle persecutor was the head of the American Medical Association and chief editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
His name was Dr. Morris Fishbein and he never treated a patient in his life .
He was motivated more by an unmitigated lust for greed and power , and less by a desire to save lives .
Failing to convince Rife to sell him the exclusive rights to his technique and therapy , Fishbein set out to crush Rife with a vengence .
The outrageous injustices against Rife by Fishbein and the medical establishment are explained in great depth in a book by Barry Lynes called The Cancer Cure That Worked .
Some of the best books about Rife were written by Barry Lynes ( E.g. The Cancer Cure That Worked ) .
Dr James Bare of Albuquerque , New Mexico has also published a manual and video on how to build your own Rife device

Geroges Lakhovsky
Another brilliant observer and thinker was the Russian - born engineer , Georges Lakhovsky .
Lakhovsky theorized that the genetic filaments stands within the nucleus of a living cell acted as a coil and exhibited all the properties properties required of an oscillator ; namely : inductance , capacitance , and resistance .
Lakhovsky postulated that all living cells , including disease organisms , could act as both an emitter and receiver of very high frequency oscillations .
According to his theory , a state of health or disease was dependent on whether the oscillations from healthy cells were maintained ( a state of equilibrium ) or were overtaken by the oscillations of disease - causing cells ( disequilibrium ) .
He found that he could boost the oscillatory level of weakened cells and overcome disease by attaching a simple coil - shaped ' antennae ' to the affected area and leaving it in place .
Lakhovsky referred to these antennae as oscillating circuits and they were worn by people as collars , belts , or bracelets .
He claimed that his ' antennae ' captured and focused sympathetic waves from the cosmos ( cosmic waves ) which resonated with harmonics of the fundamental frequency at which the weakened cell oscillated .
Whenever additional oscillating energy ( from cosmic waves ) , of the same frequency or harmonics of that frequency , are introduced into an oscillating circuit ( the nucleus of the cell ) , the oscillations within that cell will be strengthened through a phenomena of physics called resonance .
According to Lakhovsky , the now - strengthened oscillations emanating from the formerly weakened human cell could now overtake the oscillations of the disease - causing organisms and cause them to diminish in strength and subsequently die off .
Lakhovsky conducted an experiment with plants in 1924 to establish the validity of his theory .
He inoculated ten potted geranium plants with a plant disease that causes cancerous tumors .
Coiled around the stem of one of the geraniums , he affixed an open ended coil of thick copper wire about 30 cm in diameter .
It was held in place by an ebonite stake stuck into the pot .
While the other nine inoculated geraniums quickly succumbed to the cancerous disease , the one geranium with the attached coil ( the ' antennae ) sloughed off the cancerous growth and thrived into a robust and healthy plant .
Lakhovsky had similar success when these antennae coils ( the 'oscillating circuits ' mentioned above ) were used with people and animals .
He later expanded his research with the development of the Multi-Wave Oscillator ( explained below ) .
Lakhovsky 's Multi-Wave Oscillator ( MWO )
Geroges Lakhovsky published an extremely important book into French , German , Italian , and Spanish in the 1920's called The Secret of Life .
Unfortunately , it was n't available in English until September , 1939 - at the very outbreak of World War II .
Occupied with the emerging drama of World War II , the book went unnoticed and unreviewed .
Thanks to Dr Bob Beck , however , many researchers are today re-discovering Lakhovsky 's astounding Multi -Wave Oscillator .
This instrument manufactures a broad range of high frequency pulsed signals that radiate energy into patient via two resonators : one resonator acting as a transmitter and the other as a receiver .
The patient sits on a wooden stool in between the two resonators and is exposed to these energies for about 15 minutes .
These energies increase the resonance of healthy cells and create disequilibrium in disease organisms .
His clinical results created a lot of excitement in Europe where his reputaion quickly spread .
You can read more about the MWO on the Georges Lakovsky page .
Interested readers can obtain a spiral - bound reprint of Lakhovsky 's 1939 English translation of The Secret of Life and The Waves That Heal by Mark Clement by sending me an email .

Bob Beck Rescues Lakhovsky 's MWO from Obscurity
In the early 60's , Dr Bob Beck found an original Lakhovsky Multi-Wave Oscillator in the basement of a well known southern California hospital .
He took it apart and described exactly how it was built in a series of articles published by Borderlands in 1963 .
After Beck 's articles were published , a number of builders began to assemble MWO's and the word started to spread .
Two MWO builders who lived on the west coast , using the information contained in Beck articles , began making and selling a lot of Multi Wave Oscillators .
Apparently they worked fairly well because the FDA got word of the MWO 's growing popularity and told Beck to come to Washington .
Beck and the two builders were told to stop promoting the MWO and to stop building them .
They were told in no uncertain terms to cease and desist immediately ... or else ( here in the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave ) .
Beck and one of the MWO builders , Ed Skillings , complied and stopped builing them and talkiing about them , but the second builder , Ralph Bergstresser , was determined to keep going , so he actually formed a church dedicated to the worship of the MWO .
Yes , you read that correctly .
And , for a couple of years at least , his ' parishioners ' were able to come to church , sit around the MWO - perched high atop an altar , with resonator antennas glowing - and received the ' blessed waves ' from the Sacred Oscillator .
It helped a lot of church goers , until the ' pastor ' was finally thrown into the slammer by the Feds and had his modern version of the Ark of the Covenant hauled away .
He got out after a couple of years , but still went on building MWO 's anyway ( God Bless Ralph ) , distributing them through underground sources .
Many present day owners of properly working MWO's are either using units built by or copies of the " pastor 's " work ( now why is n't there an Oscar category reserved for a guy like that ? ) .
[ Spiral - bound re-prints of the Borderlands compilation titled The MWO Handbook , which includes articles and book excerpts from both Georges Lakhovsky and his son Sergie , along with the most comprehensive assembly of Multi -Wave Oscillator constructions plans from Bob Beck and other MWO builders , is available .

Blood - Electrification
In recent years , different electro - medicine units have been promoted at health expos and through magazine articles , interviews , books , etc. .
One of the more interesting devices is the blood electrifier of Dr Bob Beck .
I 've seen laboratory reports and Institutional Review Board studies that seem to clearly support claims made by Dr Bob Beck that his blood electrification device has caused ' complete spontaneous remission ' in literally thousands of AIDS patients .
Dr Beck discovered the possibilities offered by blood electrification after reading a short article in 1991 in a journal called Science News .
The Discovery
In the Fall of 1990 , two researchers , Drs William Lyman and Steven Kaali , working at Albert Einstein Medical College in New York City made an important discovery .
They found that they could inactivate the HIV virus by applying a low voltage direct current electrical potential with an extremely small current flow to AIDS infected blood in a test tube .
Initially , they discovered this in the lab by inserting two platinum electrodes into a glass tube filled with HIV - 1 ( type 1 ) infected blood .
They applied a direct current to the electrodes and found that a current flow in the range of 50 - 100 microamperes ( uA ) produced the most effective results .
Practically all of the HIV viral particles were adversely affected while normal blood cells remained unharmed .
The viral particles were not directly destroyed by the electric current , but rather the outer protein coating of the virus was affected in such a way as to prevent the virus from producing reverse transcriptase , a necessary enzyme needed by the virus to invade human cells .
Reverse transcriptase allows the virus to enter a human T cell line ( called CEM - SS ) and commandeer the DNA reproduction machinery .
After using the host cell to reproduce itself into thousands of new virii , the swollen host cell ( now called syncytia or giant cell ) will burst and spew the contents into the bloodstream or lymph system .
This is how the virus spreads , but lacking reverse transcriptase , the HIV virus can't invade the host cell and it becomes vulnerable to destruction by the body 's immune system .
( The details of this experiment can be read from Kaali 's patent application . )
Getting the Word Out ?
A brief announcement of this discovery appeared in The Houston Post ( Mar 20 , 1991 ) , then in Science News ( Mar. 30 , 1991 pg. 207 ) and later in Longevity magazine : ( Dec.1992 pg. 14 ) .
Following their work in the Fall of 1990 , Kaali and Lyman presented their findings at the First International Symposium on Combination Therapies ( an AIDS conference ) in Washington DC on March 14th , 1991 .
Kaali outlined two methods for treating an AIDS patient with this new therapy :
One method involved removing a small amount of blood , electrifying it and then returning it to the patient 's body .
The second method involved sewing a miniature electrifying power supply along with two tiny electrodes directly into the lumen of an artery .
For long term treatment , the mini electrifying unit needed to be removed and relocated to a new artery site after 30 - 45 days since scar tissue and calcification forming around the implant unit would lead to artery blockage .
Kaali ( along with co-inventor Peter Schwolsky ) filed for a patent on this implantable electrifying device on Nov 16 , 1990 and nine months later was granted patent # 5,139,684 on August 18 , 1992 .
It 's interesting to note two things here :
1 . In order to obtain a patent from the United States Patent Office , Kaali and Schwolsky had to prove that the device works as claimed .
Lacking solid proof , patents are simply not granted .
2 . Very often it takes years to obtain a patent , yet this patent was granted in only nine months ; a further indication to me of the strength of their proven claims
It 's also interesting to note that other than the 3 publications mentioned above and the March '91 AIDS conference , nothing again appeared in print , radio , or TV about this important discovery as a potential treatment and cure for AIDS from Kaali and company .
Most knowledgeable observers feel that Kaali and Lyman 's discovery was intentionally suppressed following the March '91 AIDS conference presentation .
If AIDS research was on the level and not the sham that it actually is , this should have made front page news around the world .
By the way , in July ( 2000 ) , a woman with Mycoplsma Incognitus ( Gulf War Illness ) E mailed me and told me ( after reading this story ) that she had called Albert Einstein College and spoke directly with Dr William Lyman , one of the co-discoverers of blood electrification .
She wanted to know how effective he thought blood electrifiation would work against mycoplasma .
Lyman t old her that he had no idea what she was talking about .
He denied knowing anything about blood electrifiction and could n't give her any information about it at all .
Such is the vice grip power of the medical cartel .
Enter Dr Bob Beck
A man named Professor Walter Schnitder drew Dr Robert C. Beck 's attention to the above mentioned item in Science News .
Beck looked up the patent and decided to try and duplicate the therapy , but he wanted to do it non-invasively ; that is by applying the electric current from outside the body .
Now if you apply a direct current ( DC ) potential to the skin , you 're going to get an electrolysis effect and that can cause problems , so Beck designed a circuit that varied the voltage with an alternating current ( AC ) at a very low frequency and avoided the electrolysis problem .
The waveform that Beck chose is not the typical sine wave seen in AC household outlets , but rather is a bi-phasic square wave .
Square waves generate a large number of harmonics .
Harmonics are frequency multibles of the original frequency .
For example , a 4 Hertz ( hz ) square wave can produce harmonics ( with the right equipment ) of 8 hz , 16 hz , 32 hz , etc. right up into the radio frequency range .
Beck finally settled on 3.92 hz as the ideal base frequency and assembled a schematic of the simple square wave oscillator , including a complete parts list .
He used short , one inch lengths of stainless steel welding rods with attached wires for electrodes and started to experiment on himself .
Gradually , he began feeling stronger , had more energy and started losing his excessive weight ( he was over 300 lbs at the time ) .
After a 7 or 8 months , his weight was down to 150 lbs and he felt better than ever .
He went on the lecture circuit , talked for free , and gave the schematic and related construction / protocol information away without charge .
AIDS patients , particularly , experienced dramatic reversals of their deteriorating conditons using the blood electrifier , but the unit seemed to help many other conditions as well , whether autoimmune , viral , or bacterial in origin .
Pulsed , Electro - Magnetic Therapy ( PEMT )
Pulsed - low , mid , and high frequency AC signals , when applied to the body , can produce therapeutic electric / magnetic fields .
Properly configured , they can also produce scalar waves .
The special attributes of scalar waves were first described mathematically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1873 , and later by Nikola Tesla .
A certain type of pulsed electro - magnetic field , with their attendant scalar waves , seems to stimulate re-growth and regeneration in injured tissue .
Covalent waves ( conventional sine waves ) do not have the same effect .
Dr Robert O. Becker , M.D. , discusses this phenomena in two of his recent books that deal with electro - medicine : The Body Electric ( 1985 ) and Cross Currents ( 1990 ) .

Nutritional Therapies
Introduction
" You are what you eat ! " .
Did your mother ever tell you that ?
Well , mine did , but I did n't appreciate the wisdom of those words until I approached middle age .
Today , I realize that the biggest impediment to enjoying a truly robust state of health is the Standard American Diet ( aptly abbreviated , SAD ) .
While we could spend a lot of time on details , a short version of the SAD diet can be summarized as follows : Refined and processed foods can ruin your health and lower your immunity , setting you up for disease conditions .
In order to obtain a higher level of immunity and improved health , it 's necessary to stop eating processed , refined foods and start eating whole , unprocessed raw - as - possible vegetables , beans , grains , nuts , sea plants ( seaweed ) , a small amount of fish life if you want animal protein , and lots of pure , clean water .
Change Gradually
If you try to change everything about your diet all at once , you wo n't stick with it .
Go slow .
Change one item at a time and get accustomed to the healthier alternative before tackling another .
Start with soft drinks ( or soda ) .
All soft drinks are simply ruinous to your health .
Coke , 7 - Up , Pepsi , Sprite , Dr Pepper , etc .
It 's ALL GARBAGE and it's RUINING YOUR HEALTH .
Read the ingredients on the side of a can of soda .
It will usually list 17 - 24 grams of sugar .
That 's the equivalent of 6 - 10 teaspoons of sugar with each and every 12 oz can that you 're guzzling down .
When you ingest refined sugar , you lower your body 's immunity for FOUR HOURS .
If you 're drinking soft drinks here and there throughout the day , then you 're keeping your immunity suppressed all day long .
People with suppressed immunity seem to easily pick up every bug that 's going around .
Have you ever noticed that little connection in people ( especially teenagers ) who drink sodas all day long ?
Another problem with soft drinks is the tremendous amount of PHOSPHOROUS that 's contained in them .
Large amounts of phosphorous are bad news for the body because they combine with other minerals ( like Calcium ) and tie them up for eventual excretion .
Now calcium is a mineral that your body DOES NEED in large amounts in your bloodstream for daily use .
If your soft drink is yanking the calcium out of your blood stream , where does the body get the calcium it needs for everyday jobs ?
Why , it gets it from your teeth and bones !
Women who are worried about osteoporosis would be way ahead of the game by avoiding soft drinks ( and excess animal protein ) , instead of going broke buying calcium supplements at the health food store ( which are mostly exiting out the other end anyway ) .
Replace the soft drinks with WATER .
It usually takes a couple of days to break a sugar addiction ( oh , you never thought of YOU as being addicted to anything ?
Well , answer me this :
Do you have a CRAVING for soft drinks when you do n't have them ?
If you do , then you are definitely addicted ) .
Satisfy your desire for sugar by eating sweet fruit ( like banannas ) during the adjustment period .
Eventually you will come to love drinking water , especially ozonated water . .
The more you drink , the better you 'll feel .
Try it .
To be continued
The Budwig Diet
Germany 's 90 year old Dr Joanna Budwig , nominated 6 times for the Nobel Prize , has made the most remarkable discovery of them all !
After 30 years of research , she has found that 2 simple food items : 1 . Flax Seed Oil ( cold - pressed , unprocessed ) and 2 .
Low Fat Cottage Cheese will CURE or prevent many forms of cancers and a long list of other degenerative disease including cardiovascular diseases and skin diseases !
Unprocessed flax seed oil provides 2 essential fatty acids seriously deficient in the standard American diet : Linolenic and Linoleic acids .
These two unsaturated fatty acids have 3 high - energy double bonds ( pi-electrons ) in their outer electron shells .
These fatty acids affect the membranes of animal cells and permit a thousand - fold increase in oxygen transport and assimilation !
By substantially increasing the oxidation potential within the cell , Dr Budwig proved what her German predecessor , Dr Otto Warburg , had discovered 30 years earlier : cancer cells cannot survive in an oxygen - rich environment .
With sulfur - rich protein and calcium provided by the cottage cheese , all the elements are in place for membrane repair and increased energy transfer .
A 2001 news item posted on the Internet from Duke University caught my attention ( and ire ) claiming to be hot on the trail of a ' new ' discovery concerning the anticancer benefits of flax seed oil .
I contacted the editor and set him straight on a few historical facts .
To recover from cancer , the Budwig Diet needs to be taken in conjunction with a strict , health - promoting diet free of processed , devitalized foods ( see the Gerson Therapy below ) .
Urine Therapy
In 1945 , John W. Armstrong published a book called The Water of Life , A Treatise on Urine Therapy .
The book explored the difficult - to - accept idea that drinking one 's own urine will promote healing and restore health to those afflicted with grave illnesses .
Martha Christy also published a book on this topic titled Your Own Perfect Medicine in the late 1980's .
I highly recommend reading both of them .
Christy 's approach is more technical and includes injections of prepared urine tissue and taking urine drops under the tongue .
Armstong 's approach is simpler :
To resolve life - threatening disease conditions , drink every drop of your own urine and neither eat nor drink anything else until you are completely well !!
In his book , Armstong provides the history of many , many patients with a variety of serious conditions ( cancers , massive infections , heart conditions , etc. ) who were frequently near The End .
In some cases , the patient was so gravely disabled , that he could n't produce any urine of his own .
In those cases , Armstong would ' jump start ' the patient with his own urine .
Afterwards , the patient was able to produce a small amount of his own .
With each subsequent ingestion of urine , the patient would gain in both strength and relief from pain .
For the most serious cases , patients drank nothing but their own urine for periods of 90 , 120 , 150 days !
Some , even longer .
Armstrong points out that rubbing the body with old urine ( for a substantial period of time , E.g.1 - 2 hours ) is a necessary adjunct treatment to ingestion in very serious cases .
In less severe cases , rubbing with old urine will clear up most skin conditions and produce a smooth , blemish - free skin if applied regularly ( ladies , take note ) .
Why this works is explained at length in the books , but briefly the
1. replenishment of vital tissues lost to the ill patient through the urine and the
2. reingestion , refinement , and re-filtering of antibodies and other immune enhancing substances allows the body to exclusively concentrate on destroying , unclogging , and removing the offending organisms and diseased tissue , without the burdens of routine work such as digestion and normal detoxification
Of course , we normally think of both urine and stool elimination as waste , but urine , unlike feces , is totally sterile .
Mind you , it 's the filtrate of your own blood .
Many people in normal health drink urine daily in order to keep their health and maintain physical beauty .
Get the books and read them .
In the event of survival difficulties , this simple technique can save your life .
Beyond the Urine Therapy Story , I knew I had discovered a trusted and kindred spirit when Armstong began the book 's Introduction with the following words : " Owing to the increasing part played by vested interests in many branches of human endeavor , not least in the very lucrative providing of remedies for disease , intelligent members of the public , are growing more and more distrustful of orthodox medical methods . "
He continued the book 's Introduction by asking why , after more than 50 years ( as of 1945 ) , can orthodox cancer researchers only offer the knife , radium , or X - rays to address this malignancy after so much time , money , and effort has been expended to discover its cause and cure ?
The author further inquires , why , after so many letters from doctors testifying to the highly unsatisfactory results of radium treatment ( repeatedly published in the British Medical Journal ) , did the Cancer Ring ( the Cancer Establishment or Cancer Industry as we would refer to it today ) continue to tout radium as the " best " therapy ?
Finally , why , did the Cancer Research Ring , who " still asks the public to donate large sums of money towards the discovery of a cure " , continuously discount and belittle effective treatments for cancer , when those therapies were proposed by practitioners of non-orthodox medicine ?
58 years later , nothing much has changed when it comes to the politics of Big Medicine .
Today , we know the answers to John Armstrong 's questions .
Only the most naive and uninformed among us continue to believe the party line spouted by the pharmaceutical / medical establishment and their propaganda flunkies such as the The American Cancer Society : " The Cure for Cancer is just around the Corner " ; " Get a Checkup and Write a Check " ; " The Race for The Cure " ; " Marathon to Beat Breast Cancer " ; etc .
It 's pure rot : nothing but lies to bilk the trusting and believing public out of their money and fend the appearace of doing honest research .
The promoters and planners of these publicity / fund raising events deserve the greatest possible condemnation for their deceit .

3 And He Shall Lead an Army of Eco-Friendly Child Warriorsâ ¦of Death .

Conservative forum - members would just like you to know that Barack Obama firmly believes the children are our future , and he just wants to teach them well and let them lead the wayâ¦ directly to his herd - culling gas chambers .
Yes , in a move directly parallel to Hitlerâs infamous Nazi Youth Program , Obama wants to pass legislation that would require all children to enroll in his own personal army .
He has cleverly concealed this hideous plot in the form of a program that proposes to give tax breaks to college students in exchange for performing some community service .
The Farthest Right are justifiably outraged about this , because clearly , this is exactly like slavery :

Making college kids do work at a soup kitchen on Saturday mornings in exchange for thousands of dollars in financial aid ?
My god , this is â this is just like that one time , remember ?
When they rounded up all the black people and worked them to death in the fields , giving them absolutely nothing in return ?
This is , in every conceivable way , exactly the same thing as that .
Except that this time the people that suffer wonât be African - Americans , but the polluters and energy wasters .
Itâs like an episode of Reverse Captain Planet , where eco friendly death squads roam the streets and itâs all up to a plucky band of wasteful , but good - hearted Young Republicans to learn the power of teamwork and stop them .
But some posters do n't see this light - hearted , cartoony side , and instead fear the much more ominous possibility that enlisting teenagers to assist the local community could also give Obama unfettered access to his own private army .
Itâs a civilian draft !
You 've probably been hearing a lot of Republican talking points that rewrite history by saying that as soon as Bill Clinton came into office , he adopted a loony left - wing agenda that was rejected immediately , and he suffered for it .
The Villagers and right wingers are thus warning Obama to govern like Republicans ( which , if you think about it , would mean giving the other side of the aisle the hot poker while proceeding with the most extreme agenda imaginable ) .
Bill O'Reilly and his pals are so very afraid of Obama 's upcoming agenda .
After all , look how great our country is running right now after eight years of Bush .
Check out the jobless statistics today .
It 's staggering .
As I see it , Obama is not as progressive as I am , not if you look at his voting record , but is a moderate Democrat and will probably govern that way .
Howie Klein and I wrote a piece back in May that outlined Obama 's record when FOX and pals were trying to scare the country into thinking that Barack was the most liberal Senator in Congress so you should be very afraid .
That argument did n't work too well even to Conservatives .
Nearly Half of Conservatives Confident in Obama
Anatomy of a Right Wing Myth : Obama is the most liberal Democratic Senator Lately John and I have been gnashing our collective teeth every time we see one of the Republican shills on TV repeating , mantra - like , the # 1 GOP Big Lie of the campaign : " Barack Obama is the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate . "
If only !
Actually there are 39 Democrats with more liberal voting records , although Obama does at least beat perennial Bush rubber stamps Holy Joe Lieberman ( CT ) , Ben Nelson ( NE ) and Mary Landrieu ( LA ) .
His voting record -- however you slice it , however you dice it -- points to a solidly mainstream centrist ... read on
I know I 'll disagree with some of his policies as he moves forward , but that 's to be expected .
Digby writes an excellent piece that outlines what happened when Bill Clinton took office .
Jonathan Schwarz addresses this myth that Clinton came in and tried to do all this crazy leftist stuff which resulted in his losing the 1994 election .
It 's driving me nuts : Their latest masterpiece is the Terrifying True Tale of How the Early Clinton Administration Was Crippled by Liberals .
You see , Bill Clinton began his presidency by giving into his wild - eyed leftist instincts .
But the wise American people rejected his class warfare !
They punished him and the Democrats by giving control of congress to Republicans in the 1994 midterm elections .
So Clinton sobered up and governed from the center .
Obama better not repeat Clinton 's mistakes by giving into the left !
The End .
In reality , of course , Clinton knuckled under to the center right — much of which was located within the Democratic party — from the very beginning .
Following their advice , he went all out to pass NAFTA , then failed to pass universal health care .
People who'd been desperate in 1992 saw no economic improvement by 1994 .
And with the low 45 % voter turnout in the midterms , the Democrats lost control of Congress ( mostly via the defeat of center right Democrats ) .
Here 's an especially fine example of the Terrifying True Tale , by John Heilemann in New York Magazine .
Heilemann deserves extra credit for berating people who remember history for not remembering history ... read on
In actuality , it was the moderate members of the Democratic party who helped to derail his agenda .
Many of them wound up being washed out in the 1994 GOP tide their own ineffectiveness helped create .
More Digby :
I 'm not saying that Clinton did n't screw up .
But if you look at what he actually did , it was n't playing too far to the left .
He was one of the architects of DLC corporate politics and made a veritable fetish out of appeasing big business and wingnuts .
It 's that he could n't manage his own Democratic egomaniacs , mostly in the Senate , and he allowed the Republicans and the villagers to poison the public against his program before he even had a chance to implement it , despite his constant capitulation to their demands .
He could never control the narrative and it narrowed his options to small bore , incrementalist centrism , which is as far to the left as the political establishment wants any Democrat to go .
Please read the whole thing .
I believe it 's important because so much of what happened is being left out at a crucial time in our history .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
With mounting job losses and pervasive gloom among consumers , the Commerce Department reported Wednesday that consumer spending fell 1 % in October , the largest decline since September 2001 .
The result matched analysts ' expectations .
Real consumer spending , which is adjusted for inflation , fell 0.5 % .
Personal income rose 0.3 % in October after a 0.1 % gain in September .
Analysts were looking for a 0.1 % income gain for October .
Real disposable income , or after - tax income adjusted for inflation , rose 1 % in October .
As expected by analysts , the core personal - consumption expenditure price index was unchanged in October .
This index gained 0.2 % in September , and is up 2.1 % in the past year .
On Tuesday , the Conference Board reported that persistent job worries pinned down consumer confidence in November at relatively low levels .
Further , consumers ' plans were lower for buying automobiles , homes and major appliances .
The spending downturn may be picking up steam .
The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that consumer spending declined 3.7 % in the third quarter -- the first drop in 17 years , and the largest in 28 years .
" Spending was also negatively impacted by tight credit conditions and further sharp declines in net household worth , " wrote Brian Bethune , U.S. economist with IHS Global Insight .
" Overall conditions for consumer spending in the fourth quarter are challenging , to say the least .
...
The economy is now gripped in the worst phase of the recession . "
With the holiday - shopping season looming , the Federal Reserve announced a plan on Tuesday to help increase lending to consumers and small businesses by backing credit - card and auto loans , along with other debt .
Mr Barroso has been told by British politicians they now favour the euro
The government has denied a shift in policy on the euro after the European Commission 's president said the UK was " closer than ever before " to joining .
Jose Manuel Barroso told French radio that British politicians were considering the move because of the effects of the global credit crunch .
Lord Mandelson said at the weekend that " our aim " should be to join the euro .
But Downing Street said its position on the single currency remained the same and that it had " no plans " to join .
" Our position has n't changed ... we have no plans to join the euro , " No 10 said .
Five tests
In 1997 Gordon Brown , seen as less keen on the euro than Tony Blair , set five economic tests which had to be met before ministers would recommend UK euro entry and holding a referendum .
The key test is whether the UK economy is coming together with those of countries in the eurozone and whether this can be sustained in the long - term .
The second test , linked to this , is whether there is sufficient flexibility to cope with economic change .
I hold to the view that our aim , our goal , should be to enter the single currency
Lord Mandelson
Mandelson on euro , Brown and Blair
The remaining three tests assess the impact of joining the euro on jobs , foreign investment and the financial services industry .
Opinion polls have suggested that any vote on scrapping the pound and adopting the euro would be lost , and in the UK the currency has not been a significant political issue for years .
In his interview Mr Barroso acknowledged " the majority " of British people continued to oppose joining the eurozone .
But he said the recent economic uncertainty had made the currency a far more attractive option .
' Better off '
In the RTL radio / LCI television broadcast , the former prime minister of Portugal said : " We are now closer than ever before .
" I 'm not going to break the confidentiality of certain conversations , but some British politicians have already told me , ' If we had the euro , we would have been better off ' . "
He said the current poor economic situation had emphasised the importance of the euro to the UK , but added he believed a move would not take place in the immediate future .
" I know that the majority in Britain are still opposed , but there is a period of consideration under way and the people who matter in Britain are currently thinking about it , " he said .

The value of sterling compared with other currencies has fallen during the credit crunch , and the UK government has had to spend massively in recent months to try to support the economy .
During the interview , Mr Barroso highlighted the situation in Denmark - an EU state which voted against joining the eurozone in 2000 , but is now considering holding a new referendum on the single currency .
In the daily Brussels briefing later an EC spokesman said " member states would benefit from a country like Britain being in the euro " .
He said the euro could be " an anchor of stability in troubled times ... the advantages are very clear " .
He added that Mr Barroso 's comments were " reflections " and added : " The British are very pragmatic .
When they feel it is right to join the euro , they will join the euro . "
A Downing Street spokesman said : " We have no comment on this .
Our position on the euro is the same .
We have no plans to join the euro . "
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , a former European Commissioner , told Labour 's Progress conference on Saturday : " I hold to the view that our aim , our goal , should be to enter the single currency . "
He added that the government was " obviously not going to take on that challenge " in the current economic climate .
' Hunt them down '
The UK 's opposition Conservative Party opposes adopting the euro .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said : " It is extraordinary that certain politicians are whispering to the EU Commission about joining the euro behind the British people 's backs .
The people who matter in Britain are the people , not the professional political class that Barroso is himself a member of
Nigel Farage , UKIP leader " Keeping the pound is vital for Britain 's economic future .
We need interest rates that are right for Britain , not the rest of Europe .
There are no circumstances in which the next Conservative government will propose joining the euro .
" If Labour ministers still want to get Britain into the euro they should come out and say so .
We will be putting questions to the government to find out what conversations have been going on . "
The leader of the UK Independence Party , Nigel Farage , said " the people who matter in Britain are the people , not the professional political class that Barroso is himself a member of " .
" That ruling elite would love to bounce us into the euro and will grasp at any straw to do so , for it 's a step on the way to their dream and our nightmare , a federal superstate .
" We 're told that some British politicians have said ' If we had the euro , we would have been better off ' .
Whoever these people are we need to hunt them down and explain some simple economics to them . "
He added that if Mr Barroso wanted to test the mood in Britain " then he can call for a referendum on both the euro and the Lisbon Treaty so that the people of Britain can tell him where to go " .

In many domains people are tempted to think , after the fact , that an outcome was entirely predictable , and that the success of a musician , an actor , an author , or a politician was inevitable in light of his or her skills and characteristics .
Beware of that temptation .
Small interventions and even coincidences , at a key stage , can produce large variations in the outcome .
Today 's hot singer is probably indistinguishable from dozens and even hundreds of equally talented performers whose names you 've never heard .
We can go further .
Most of today 's governors are hard to distinguish from dozens or even hundreds of politicians whose candidacies badly fizzled .
In a country where you 're free to say almost anything in the political arena , I think the only real censorship of good ideas is what you could call " censorship by glut " .
If you had a brilliant , absolutely airtight argument that we should do something -- indict President Bush ( or Barack Obama ) , or send foreign investment to Chechnya , or let kids vote -- but you were n't an established writer or well - known blogger , how much of a chance do you think your argument would have against the glut of Web rants and other pieces of writing out there ?
Especially if your argument required people to read it and think about it for at least an hour ?
Perhaps your situation could be compared to that of a brilliantly talented band submitting a song for Matthew Salganik 's experiment .
What Salganik and his co-authors did was recruit users through advertisements on Bolt.com ( skewing toward a teen demographic ) to sign up for a free music download site .
Users would be able to listen to full - length songs and then decide whether or not to download the song for free .
Some users were randomly divided into eight artificial " worlds " in which , while a user was listening to a song , they could see the number of times that the song had been downloaded by other users in the same world -- but only by other users within their own world , not counting the downloads by users in other worlds .
The test was to see whether certain songs could become popular in some worlds while languishing in others , despite the fact that all groups consisted of randomly assigned populations that all had equal access to the same songs .
The experiment also attempted to measure the " merit " of individual songs by assigning some users to an " independent " group , where they could listen to songs and choose whether to download them , but without seeing the number of times the song had been downloaded by anyone else ; the merit of the song was defined as the number of times that users in the independent group decided to download the song after listening to it .
Experimenters looked at whether the merit of the song had any effect on the popularity levels it achieved in the eight other " worlds " .
The authors summed it up : " In general , the ' best ' songs never do very badly , and the ' worst ' songs never do extremely well , but almost any other result is possible . "
They also noted that in the " social influence " worlds where users could see each others ' downloads , increasing download numbers had a snowball effect that widened the difference between the successful songs and the unsuccessful : " We found that all eight social influence worlds exhibit greater inequality -- meaning popular songs are more popular and unpopular songs are less popular -- than the world in which individuals make decisions independently . "
Figures 3 ( A ) and 3 ( C ) in the paper show that the relationship between a song 's merit and its success in any given world -- while not completely random -- is tenuous .
And if you 're a talented musician and you want to get really depressed about your prospects of hitting the big time , Figures 3 ( B ) and 3 ( D ) show the relationship between a song 's measured merit and itsnumber of sales in the real world .
( Although those graphs may cheer you up if you 're a struggling musician who has n't made it big yet -- maybe it's not you , it 's just the roll of the dice . )
As the Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein put it in their all - around fascinating book Nudge , where I first read about the Salganik study :
Is the blogosphere , or the " marketplace of ideas " in general , any different ?
If a random sample of bloggers were rated based on some independent measure of merit -- for example , independent ratings from a random sampling of blog readers , who were looking at the bloggers ' writing samples for the first time , analogous to users in Salganik 's " independent " world -- and then correlate that with the bloggers ' traffic or some other measure of success , it 's not hard to imagine the results would be similar to those of the 8 - worlds experiment : the best often rise to the top , the very worst rarely do , but success in the vast middle would be close to random .
In fact , while music listeners would have no logical reason to like a song just because others did , users in the blogosphere and other public forums would have several rational reasons to cluster around writers who are already popular : ( 1 ) errors are more likely to have been spotted and pointed out by someone else ; ( 2 ) as an extension of that , others are more likely to have provided comments and other value - added content ; ( 3 ) if you are the first person to spot an error , it 's more important on a popular blog to point out the error and stop the misinformation from spreading , than on a minor blog that nobody has ever heard of .
So the " snowball effect " of popularity in the blogosphere would be even more pronounced .
Then why do so many people believe in what Thaler and Sunstein call the " inevitability " of success based on merit , in domains like music , politics , and writing ?
I think it 's because the belief is what scientists call an unfalsifiable one -- if the " best " acts are assumed to be the ones that end up on the top of the pile , then the marketplace has always sorted the " best " content to the top , by definition .
Since the definition is circular , the premise could never be disproved by any amount of counter - evidence -- even if an act that used to be popular , suddenly falls under the radar , that could be seen as " proof " that they lost whatever magic touch they used to have , not as evidence of the arbitrariness of the market !
The only disproof would be an artificial experiment like Salganik 's , showing that once you get beyond a certain threshold of quality , commercial success has little relationship to independently measured merit -- but such experiments , which in Salganik 's case required the cooperation of over 14,000 users , do n't come along very often .
And as long as most people do n't realize how arbitrary the existing marketplaces are , there is n't enough demand to justify building a system that could work better -- indeed , to even justify asking the question of whether a system could be designed that would work better .
And that , I think , is how " censorship by glut " really works .
It 's not just the sheer amount of written content that censors small voices -- if you happen to know about a particular writer that you consider a fount of wisdom , then the existence of a billion other Web pages wo n't stop you from reading that writer 's content .
And it 's not as if there are n't plenty of people who realize that success can be highly arbitrary .
The problem is that as long as most people assume that the existing marketplace of ideas does a good job of sorting the best content to the top , then they 'll be more inclined to stay with the most popular news sites and blogs , and even the minority who know that it 's largely a lottery , will have no effective way of finding the best content among everything else , so they 'll end up sticking with the most popular sites as well .
Worse , as a secondary effect , most people with something useful to contribute wo n't even bother , if they do n't already have a large built - in audience .
I know plenty of people who could write insightful essays about social and technological issues , essays that would give most readers a new perspective such that they would definitely say afterwards : " That was worth my time to read it . "
But it would n't be worth it to the writers , because they know that their content is n't going to get magically sorted into its deserved place in the hierarchy .
( My own favorite blog that nobody 's ever heard of is Seth Finkelstein 's InfoThought , which is usually logical and insightful and is only about 25 % of the time about how " nobody ever reads this blog , so what 's the point " .
His Guardian columns are also good and usually do n't have that subtext , perhaps because it 's considered impolite to use a newspaper 's column - inches ( column - centimeters ? ) to complain that you have no voice . )
So can this problem be avoided , or is inequality and arbitrariness just a permanent part of the marketplace for content and ideas ?
You could create an artificial world that would sort user - submitted content according to some other algorithm -- and even if it did n't give good writers the fame that they theoretically deserved in the larger world , it might still provide them with enough of an audience within the artificial universe , to make it worth their time to keep writing .
One option would be to use Salganik 's " independence " world model , where users would read content without being able to see the ratings that other people had given to it , or without even seeing recommendations from similarly - minded friends within the system .
The trouble is that without any information about what other readers liked , without any starting point to sort good content from bad content , it may not be worth the reader 's time to read through all the dreck to find the occasional buried treasure .
I believe about as strongly as a person can believe , that the existing marketplace for content is far from meritocratic , for example that there are probably thousands of songs on iTunes that I 've never heard of but would nonetheless love -- but even I do n't spend time listening to the 30 - second clips of random songs on iTunes , because it takes too long to find the stuff I would like .
But I submit there is a solution -- a variant of an argument that I 've suggested for stopping cheating on Digg , or building Wikia search into a meritocratic search engine , or helping the best writers rise to the top on Google Knol .
The solution is sorting based on ratings from a random sample of users .
The remainder of this speculation will be very theoretical , and will at times seem like a Rube - Goldberg approach to what should be a simple problem .
But at each juncture , the complications to the algorithm are motivated by an argument that anything simpler would not work .
At many points along the way , it will be tempting to throw up one 's hands and say , " Why go to all this trouble , the existing system works well enough . "
But this statement is hard to quantify with any actual evidence -- unless you 're just using the circular definition above , that whatever rises to the top is automatically the " best " .
For music listeners , the gist of the algorithm is :
When an artist submits a new song in the alt - rock category for example , the song is distributed to a random sample of 20 users who have indicated an interest in that genre .
If the average rating from those users is high enough , the song gets recommended to all of the site 's users who are interested in alt - rock .
If the average rating is not high enough , then the artist receives a notification , perhaps with a list of comments from the listeners suggesting what to improve .
As long as the initial random sample of users is large enough that the average rating is indicative of what the rest of the site 's alt - rock fans would think , the good content will get to be enjoyed by all of the site 's alt - rock customers , while the bad content would fizzle after only wasting the time of 20 people .
If it turns out that a random selection of 20 users are typically too lazy to rate the songs that are submitted to them , you could even make artists submit $ 10 to have their songs rated by the focus group , and pay each of the 20 raters $ 0.50 each for their trouble .
Artists can't withhold payment as revenge for a bad rating , so the average ratings should still be proportional to the song 's actual quality .
At this point , you might object that this system suffers from the same unfalsifiable , circular reasoning as the belief that the marketplace rewards the " best " content , if the best content is the content that wins in the marketplace .
If I define the " best " content to be the content that gets the highest average score in a random focus group , then of course this algorithm sorts the best content to the top , because that 's how " best " was defined !
But this system does actually have a non-trivial property :
If you implement the system in multiple separate " worlds " ( similar to those that Salganik created ) , then provided your focus groups are large enough to provide representative random samples , the same content should rise to the top in each of the worlds , unlike the results in Salganik 's experiment .
This actually would n't be the case if the initial focus groups were not big enough -- then random variations in a few voters ' opinions could cause many songs to succeed in one world and fail in another .
So it 's a non-trivial property that is not automatically true , and would not be true if you made an error in designing the system , like making the focus groups too small .
But the larger the size of the random sample , the smaller the variance in the expected value of the average of their ratings , and the greater agreement you would expect between the results from different worlds .
As Salganik pointed out to me , this system does under - reward songs that might require repeated listenings over time to gain an appreciation of their qualities .
But even this , strictly speaking , can be modeled in exchange for cash -- I 'll pay 20 users $ 2 each if they listen to my song once today , once in three days , and once again a week after that ( the site could stream the song to them to provide at least some likelihood that the users were n't cheating ) .
This assumes some things , such as that repeated exposure has the same growing - on - you effect even if the exposure is forced -- but in the real world , songs often grow on you from repeated listenings that are " forced " anyway , if they 're played in the doctor 's office or on the radio when you do n't bother to change the channel .
And this might be more complicated than necessary -- often when a song grows on you , it at least interests you enough the first time you hear it , that you 'd give it a positive rating on the first listen , which is all that the site requires for the song 's success .
However , if you try to adapt this trick to a meritocracy for written content , you run into different problems .
With a song , if you poll a random sample of users , the odds are very small that anyone being polled will be a vested interest in the success of the song , like one of the band members or one of the song 's producers ( assuming the population of users is large enough , and the song 's producers have not been able to create a huge number of " sockpuppet " accounts to manipulate the voting ) .
So you can assume the ratings will be free of any prior bias .
But with a political post , for example , if you write a pro-Bush or anti-Bush essay , it 's quite likely that among a random sample of users , there will be people who are biased to vote up ( or vote down ) any post that has anything good to say about the President .
The essays voted to the top may not be the best - written ones , but simply the ones that pander to the most popularly held opinions .
But if the " best " essays are not the ones that receive the highest percentage of positive votes , even when polling a random sample of independent users -- which I was advocating as the gold standard for measuring merit -- then how do you define what makes the " best " essays , anyway ?
There are many possible answers , but I suggest : A necessary condition for being among the " best " essays would be to convince the most people of something that they did n't believe before , without resorting to tricks such as blatantly fabricating statistics or attributing made - up quotes .
This is not a sufficient condition for merit -- maybe the point of view that you 're convincing people of , is still wrong -- but I submit that if you 're not at least changing some people 's minds , then there 's no point .
An essay that changes a lot of people 's minds in a random focus group , is usually worth reading , if only to see why it has that effect .
Unfortunately , this does n't suggest a better way to poll users about the merit of an essay , because if you ask users , " Were you a Bush supporter before reading this essay ? " and " Were you a Bush supporter afterwards ? " , Bush supporters are eventually going to figure out that the way to give the essay a high score on the mind - changing scale , would be to ( falsely ) say that they were not a Bush supporter before reading the essay , but they were one afterwards .
So you 'd still end up rewarding the essays that reinforce pre-existing opinions instead of the ones that change people 's minds .
From here the counter - measures and counter - counter - measures get increasingly complicated .
For each category of essays that a user wants to rate , such as Bush opinion pieces , you could require new users to enter their current opinion : either pro-Bush or anti-Bush .
Then if they were asked to rate a pro-Bush essay , they would only be able to vote that the essay " changed their minds " by switching their registered opinion from " anti-Bush " to " pro-Bush " .
But Bush supporters could sign up initially as anti-Bush , just in the hopes of being part of a random focus group so they could cast their mind - changing vote for a Bush essay by changing their registration to " pro-Bush " !
However , each user would only be able to do that once -- or do you allow users , after they 've switched from anti-Bush to pro-Bush , to " reload " by spontaneously switching back to anti-Bush for no reason at all , so they 're all set to cast a mind - changing vote for the next pro-Bush essay ?
Or would they only be allowed to switch back to anti-Bush , by casting a mind - changing vote as part of a random focus group for an anti-Bush essay -- thus giving a boost to an anti-Bush screed , as part of the price they pay for the next vote they cast for a pro-Bush piece ?
Then users could still game the system , by switching to " anti-Bush " when casting a vote for a very poorly written anti-Bush essay that they do n't think anybody else will vote for anyway , and then switching back to " pro-Bush " only for the good essays that have a shot , hoping that their votes will coalesce around the decently - written pro-Bush essays and push them to the front page ...
Am I over - thinking this ?
I submit this is an area where there 's been too much under - thinking .
Have n't we all been tempted to believe that the marketplace of ideas -- not to mention bands , blog posts , and business ventures -- efficiently sorts content to the place in the hierarchy of rewards that it deserves , without having any real evidence for this , except the circular definition of " quality " as being proportional to success ?
And the more people believe this , the more that marginalized voices will effectively be censored , even when they have something brilliant to contribute .
We should at least think about ways that we could do better .
Or else , prove logically that it can't be done ( a logical proof can only approximate the real world , but it could show that such a pure meritocracy would be very improbable , or would n't work well ) .
However I think the ideas above make it seem unlikely that a meritocracy is logically impossible .
Maybe they 're a step in the right direction .
Maybe someone else 's ideas would be better .
The important thing is that a meritocratic algorithm be judged by something other than a circular definition , which simply decrees by fiat that the winning content is the best .
GO FUCK YOURSELF
The following is not about rational discourse .
It is about anger .
I am upset that religious zealots are seeking to control my life .
I am sharing the depths of my frustration and rage at being a 2nd class citizen .
To the Proponents of Proposition 81 ,
You motherfuckers are pretty proud of yourselves , are n't you ?
You beat up on the only minority it is still fashionable to hate .
You were united by the hatred of a common enemy , and you won .
Your hatred of us outshined our hatred of you , and we lost .
{ Do n't try to kid me with that " Love the sinner , hate the fact that he likes it in the butt " nonsense , because I had a big breakfast this morning and I do n't want to vomit .
You hate us .
And we hate you .
Because you are all smug little assholes.}

Obama will nuke Iran if Israel nuked , official says John Byrne
Published : Thursday December 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Clinton also seen backing ' nuclear umbrella ' President - elect Barack Obama intends to offer Israel a " nuclear umbrella " in the event of a nuclear strike by Iran , according to a defense source close to the administration quoted by an Israeli newspaper .
Under such an agreement , the United States would promise to use nuclear weapons against Iran should Israel be atomically attacked .
Obama 's secretary of State , Sen. Hillary Clinton , promised a similar " massive response " should Israel come under attack during the Democratic presidential debates .
" The source , who is close to the new administration , said the US will declare that an attack on Israel by Tehran would result in a devastating U.S. nuclear response against Iran , " the paper Ha'aretz said Thursday .
The source quoted also said that the nuclear guarantee would be backed by a new and improved Israeli anti-ballistic missile defense system , which comes in addition to one the Bush administration helped deploy in the Negev .
Both the ballistic defense system and the comments may suggest that the incoming Administration believes that a nuclear Iran is inevitable .
Soon - to - be Secretary of State Clinton has also proposed that the nuclear shield be extended to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states if they drop their nuclear ambitions .
The United States is a massive supplier of weapons and defense technology to Saudi Arabia ; the Bush administration recently signed a $ 20 billion , 10 - year deal .
The US is also a supplier of covert arms to Gulf Cooperation Council states , which include Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates .
A National Security Council official told Raw Story last year that the $ 20 billion Saudi deal -- along with the covert arms programs -- was aimed at propping up the monarchy and to isolate Iran .
" The Saudis see Maliki as the cat 's paw of Iran and they think we are actively supporting Maliki , " the NSC official said .
" What the monarchy is actively worried about is that guys who got bloodied in Iraq will return home and overthrow them , and that would be very bad for us . "
Obama has said he 'd negotiate with Iran and offered economic aid if they agreed to drop their nuclear program .
Such a move is unlikely , as Iran sees nuclear weapons as a key element in protecting their country against foreign attack and increasing their presence on the world stage .
The paper quoted a " senior Bush administration official " as rebuking the nuclear guarantee .
" Who will convince the citizen in Kansas that the U.S. needs to get mixed up in a nuclear war because Haifa was bombed ?
And what is the point of an American response , after Israel 's cities are destroyed in an Iranian nuclear strike ? "
Even so , Israel may no longer be able to expect " blank cheques " from Washington once president - elect Obama 's administration takes over in January , according to a former US ambassador to the Jewish state .
" The era of the blank cheque is over , " Martin Indyk , director of the Centre for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institute , who is considered close to incoming secretary of state Hillary Clinton , said Sunday .
Dr Haneef intends to seek compensation for his treatment The Australian government has said it will not apologise to an Indian doctor who was wrongly detained and charged over bomb attacks in the UK in 2007 .
Dr Mohamed Haneef demanded an apology after a report on Tuesday found that various mistakes had been made .
But Attorney - General Robert McClelland said the government would not say sorry at this stage , as Mr Haneef 's lawyers intended to sue for compensation .
He said an apology now might influence the claim .
' Totally unacceptable '
Mr Haneef was mistakenly arrested , detained and charged over a failed plot to detonate bombs in London and Glasgow last year .
His ordeal culminated in his deportation , even though terrorism - related charges against him had by that time been dropped .
An Australian judicial inquiry , which published its findings on Tuesday , concluded that mistakes had been made .
Mr McClelland said that " errors were made from ground level to the highest level " .
" A man was wrongly charged ...
A man was detained for longer than was really necessary .
These situations are totally unacceptable and should not have occurred , " he said .
But on Wednesday Mr McClelland said the federal government would not apologise at this stage of the legal process , as it might influence a future claim for compensation .
" Representing the interest of the commonwealth and the taxpayers of Australia , it 's not appropriate for me to make any admissions , " he told ABC News .
Mr McClelland has also that insisted that if anyone should be expressing regret , it ought to be his predecessor in the previous conservative government .
The former attorney - general Philip Ruddock , who was in charge of the justice department when Mr Haneef was arrested last year , has said the doctor did not deserve an apology or financial compensation as officials were simply doing their jobs .
" I do n't apologise for seeking to ensure that the law works as intended , " he told Australian radio .
Mr Haneef 's legal team has said it plans to seek substantial damages for his treatment - including malicious prosecution , false imprisonment and defamation .

Margin Between Two Shrinks to 129 Votes as Number of Challenged Ballots Grows
Official GOP Website Continues Baseless Claims of ' Stolen ' Election ...
Brad Friedman Byon
11/20/2008 , 7:06 pm PT
With just over 40 % of the ballots in Minnesota 's U.S. Senate race between incumbent Republican Sen. Norm Coleman and Democrat Al Franken , the gap has now shrunk to just 129 votes at the end of the second day of counting .
According to tonight 's update of the MN Secretary of State 's " recount " webpage , Coleman has so far lost a total of 212 votes and Franken has lost 126 during the counting .
The net gain is 86 votes for Franken out of the original 215 vote advantage certified by the state for Coleman before counting began yesterday .
The original numbers were based on the tabulations reported by the state 's faulty ES&S and Diebold optical - scanners .
But today 's numbers may be equally misleading , for the moment , as there are some 360 ballots so far challenged by Coleman , and 374 by Franken , which will be judged later by the canvassing board .
Those numbers are not included in today 's totals .
Last night , after the first day 's counting with just over 15 percent of the ballots manually inspected across the state , Franken had a net gain of 43 votes .
Today , with slightly over 40 percent counted , Franken 's net gain has exactly doubled that to 86 votes ...
Screenshot from tonight 's MN SoS " recount " page :
In summary :
AS OF DAY 1
Coleman lost 70
Franken lost 27
Net gain : +43 for Franken
Gap ( as based on original , machine - tallied results ) : 172 for Coleman AS OF DAY 2
Coleman Lost 212
Franken Lost 126
Net gain : +86 Franken
Gap ( as based on original , machine - tallied results ) : 129 for Coleman
County - by - county & precinct - by - precinct results are available here .
GOP Shame ...
Incredibly , the Republican National Senatorial Committee is still updating their shameful conspiracy theory website , which has claimed , since it was set up a week or so ago , that Franken and the Democrats are " stealing " the election .
That , even though they offer no evidence for such claims , or evidence that embarrassingly turns out to be plain wrong ( but brings no subsequent retraction or correction ) .
Remember , this is an official Republican Party website making these claims !
By way of a few of the latest examples , they post an item from someplace called The Skepticians by James Richardson which argues ( without evidence ) :
[ Franken 's ] campaign is determined to win steal Minnesota ’s senate seat by any means necessary
And this from the pathetic and shameless --- and also evidence - free --- tin-foil hatter , John Hinderaker of PowerLine , who avers :
The real problem in our elections , of course , is not the tiny handful of ballots that might be rejected incorrectly , it is the much larger number that are cast illegally .
This year , around 25 percent of all the ballots cast in Hennepin County , where Minneapolis is located , were by voters who registered at the polls .
No one will ever know how many of those votes were illegally cast by illegal aliens , felons , non-Minnesota residents , or people who also voted in other precincts or other states –both of which are absurdly easy to do .
No doubt , Al Franken benefited from thousands of illegally cast votes .
But there is no way to connect a particular ballot with a specific illegal voter , so it is hard to see how these illegalities can ever be remedied .
Many people fear that Al Franken will steal the election in the recount process , but I think it ’s much more likely that he stole it on November 4 .
And it again bears repeating :
This is an official blog site of the Republican National Party !
UPDATE : Given how close this race could end up being if these same numbers hold up , we suspect whichever party that turns out to be the loser of the hand count may want to revisit the advice we offered a week or so ago on what is needed to try to ensure an accurate reconcialition of the final numbers .
For one , we 've recommended public records requests for the invoices of printed ballots to determine how many were actually printed .
Then , we 'd strongly recommend a full count of unvoted ballots .
The total number of voted , spoiled and unvoted ballots should be exactly the same as the number originally printed , as seen on those invoices .
If not , someone has some ' splainin ' to do .
We 'd also strongly recommend , among other things , an immediate court order to lock - down the op - scan memory cards and hard drives for 22 months , as per the federal statute requiring all such materials from elections be retained for that full period .
Unfortunately , memory cards and the like are routinely erased by election officials , incredibly enough .
They should n't be .
For reasons I 've explained previously .
More such advice here , good for any and all parties who wish to try and ensure the most accurate count possible .

111th House Democrats Should Dump Pelosi -Do You Agree ?
Democrats , it ’s time to clean the House .
Start at the top .
When the 111th Congress convenes in January , it is time for a change -- a change of the Speaker of the House .
Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( D - Ca ) in her two years as speaker has enabled a pro-Bush , pro-corporate agenda almost as facilely and frequently as Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
In November 2006 , voters put Democrats in the majority in Congress to end the Iraq occupation and hold Bush responsible for the war .
But the among first things she did when she became speaker was take impeachment off the table , giving Bush a blank check to wage the Iraq war for two more years .
Showing disdain for those opposed the war , Pelosi snubbed peace demonstrators outside her San Francisco home , morphing into Bush who refused to meet Cindy Sheehan and peace protesters outside his Crawford , Texas , compound .
Under Pelosi ’s leadership , Congress gave Bush a half - trillion dollars for the Iraq war Pelosi said she wanted to stop .
More than 1,200 U.S. soldiers and thousands of Iraqi men , women , and children have died since Pelosi became speaker .
Pelosi has refused to sanction hearings to collect evidence about impeachable offenses , and she quashed other House members ’ impeachment efforts .
By last June , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) had compiled at least 35 articles of impeachment for G.W. Bush .
The first 16 articles relate to the Iraq war : for secret propaganda ; deception about 9/11 ; weapons of mass destruction , and illegal spending in an unauthorized and undeclared war .
Pelosi also enabled legislation legalizing warrantless wiretapping and granting immunity not only for telecommunications company executives , but also for Bush , Dick Cheney , and other administration officials .
The law obliterated our Fourth Amendment protections against illegal search and seizure .
Pelosi looked the other way as Bush politicized the Justice Department , using US attorneys to corrupt the voting process and wage political vendettas against Democrats .
Former Alabama Governor Donald Siegelman spent time in federal prison after Karl Rove ’s political associates trumped up charges against him .
Pelosi has let White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolton , now former White House Counsel Harriet Miers , and now former Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove defy congressional subpoenas .
In September , Pelosi joined with Bush to plunder even more of the Treasury for their corporate cronies under the guise of a $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout .
Pelosi with other congressional Democrats stood at the microphones , salivating at the prospect of helping Bush loot the U.S. Treasury .
The scene was sickeningly reminiscent of Senate Democratic leaders Tom Daschle and Richard Gephardt , with presidential ambitions on their sleeves , rush to the White House six years earlier embracing Bush and his illegal and immoral preemptive attack on the people of Iraq .
Instead of educating and leading and representing , Pelosi and her Democratic cohorts quiver at the thought they might be blamed for a terrorist attack or financial collapse if they deny Bush what he wants .
Are Pelosi ’s repeated capitulations to Bush due to complicity -- knowing inside information about 9/11 , torture , and wiretapping ?
If she were compromised , Pelosi could have refused the speaker ’s position .
If she were afraid of political retaliation like that against Siegelman , she could have stepped down .
If Bush et al had threatened another 9/11 or martial law if the Democrats voted against his corporate agenda , the smart , powerful , proactive politician would hold a press conference surrounded with other vulnerable officials and tell the American public the truth .
But instead , Pelosi appears a willing tool .
She has used her position to enrich herself and her family , click here http://onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/printer_4179.shtml
NOT sure
NO the 111th House should NOT dump Pelosi
YES the 111th House should dump Pelosi

( Money Magazine ) --
If you have n't second - guessed yourself yet , maybe you just are n't paying attention .
You always knew stocks would be volatile , but you 've been taught that the market rewards those who stick with it long enough .
So you put equities at the heart of your portfolio .
Well ....
Over the past decade , which sure did feel like long enough , an S&P 500 index mutual fund has lost investors 15 % .
Looking to the future , it 's hard to discern much better news .
The global financial system appears to be broken , and the so - called smart money is hunkered down for hard times .
One way to tell : Yields on bonds issued by anyone other than the U.S.
Treasury have been soaring , which means the market is seriously spooked about companies ' financial health .
" Bonds are priced to say that we 're headed for a depression - something as bad as the 1930s , " observes money manager Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates in Newport Beach , Calif .
So yeah , you 're feeling some doubt .
We are too .
In early November the writers of this story led a personal - finance seminar for a group of young professionals in San Francisco .
The Dow had just dropped 5 % in a day .
( Again . )
We ticked off the usual advice : Do n't panic .
Do n't try to time the market .
Remember that you are in this for the long haul and stick to your plan .
When we finished , a man in the front row raised his hand .
" Just how bad would things have to get , " he asked , " before you guys changed your advice ? "
The glib answer is that falling prices just make stocks a better investment - they 're on sale !
But this is no time to be glib .
After all , judging from the performance of target - date 401 ( k ) funds , many investors only a couple of years from retirement have seen their nest eggs shrink by 25 % or more this year .
The fact is , things are sufficiently bad that we here at Money have had cause to question some of the basic assumptions from which we 've drawn our advice over the past 36 years of publication .
So we decided to take a close , fresh look at the investment case for stocks in individual portfolios .
Nothing we found has us pronouncing the Death of Equities .
Nor will we argue that today is a not - to - be- missed buying opportunity .
To paraphrase F. Scott Fitzgerald , the sensible approach to equities in this market is to hold two ( seemingly ) opposed ideas at once :
Stocks look like a pretty good investment - certainly better than they were a year ago .
You absolutely should n't get out simply because the recent return numbers are scary .
The latest bad news about the economy should n't drive you away either .
Much of that is reflected in prices now .
Even for many not - especially - brave investors , it 's time to consider buying , not selling .
That said , the virtues of equities have often been oversold .
Not just in hindsight - that 's simply too obvious to dwell upon - but also in theory .
Too often , investment advisers and , yes , the financial press have pointed to robust historical returns to suggest that all but the most nervous of Nellies should be heavily into stocks .
But there 's a fair chance that you 've had , and may still have , too much of your portfolio in equities .
This market has been teaching us all some big lessons about risk that you'd be wise to take to heart .
If getting your risk exposure right means holding less money in stocks , so be it .
Why stocks are never a no - brainer ( Not even in the long run )
It 's become one of those things that everybody just knows :
Stocks beat bonds over the long term .
But let 's take a moment to ask the dumb question :
Why exactly should that be ?
The answer , in a word , is risk .
Or to put a finer point on it , relative risk .
When a corporation issues a bond , there 's a chance the firm could go belly up , but as long as that does n't happen , it will pay you your interest and principal .
And not a penny more .
Stock investors , on the other hand , are n't guaranteed anything .
They are entitled to a share of profits that might grow and grow but also might turn to dust .
The market usually sets a price on stocks low enough to compensate you for that added risk .
Patrick Geddes , chief investment officer at Aperio Group in Sausalito , Calif. , puts it elegantly : " You get paid for the strength of your stomach lining . "
But do n't make the leap from this to a slightly different - and dangerous - metaphor : the market as a roller coaster that , despite its gut - wrenching twists and turns in the middle of the ride , will always bring you back safely in the end .
If it were true , the rational move would be to close your eyes and put every dime you do n't need right away in stocks .
And many investors have come awfully close to doing that .
According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute , about 40 % of 401 ( k ) participants within a decade of retirement age had 80 % or more of their accounts in stocks at the start of 2007 .
Many of them will never get the retirement they had expected .
Whether you are saving for retirement or for your child 's college education , you have to think very carefully about the true risks and rewards of stocks .
And to do that , you 'll have to get past three big things that " everybody knows " about the lessons of stock market history .
Everybody knows that stocks give you high - octane returns over the long run .
Since 1926 , the annualized return on blue - chip stocks has been almost 10 % , according to Ibbotson .
That works out to six percentage points above ultrasafe Treasury bills .
There are reasons , though , to suspect that the extra returns of the past - and especially the soaring gains of the ' 80s and '90s - were abnormally high .
To take just one :
The real , inflation - adjusted performance of stocks has typically been lower abroad .
Why should foreign equities be a guide to the U.S. market ?
Imagine you were trying to predict the long - run future return on shares of Microsoft , says London Business School 's Elroy Dimson , a leading authority on world stock market history .
While you might be tempted to rely on the firm 's past growth , that would be a wildly unreliable guide because your numbers would capture the firm 's unrepeatable rise from tiny Seattle software firm to global technology giant .
Instead , the industry or market history might be more useful .
Well , the broad U.S. market , says Dimson , is roughly analogous to Microsoft .
We can't make the trip from emerging market in 1900 to economic colossus in 2008 again .
So it 's better to look at a wider range of experience .
Looking at world asset - price history , Dimson figures a normal long - run return for stocks may be closer to 3.5 points above T - bills , not six .
That 's just one well - educated guess ( plenty of smart people expect more ) , but it suggests that even optimists should diversify into other assets and keep a close eye on expenses that erode returns .
Everybody knows that stocks are n't risky if you plan to hold them for a long time .
Over decades the odds get better and better that stocks will beat a conservative investment like Treasury Inflation - Protected Securities ( TIPS ) .
But there are big caveats to this .
" When you are thinking about tucking away stocks for the long run , you 'd better know that the long run can be very long , " says Jeremy Grantham of the Boston investment management firm GMO .
For the U.S. , the record for negative stock returns is 16 years .
Or consider Japan .
Its market peaked in 1989 and still has n't recovered .
Is n't Japan a lot different from the U.S. ?
Sure , but our future could also be a lot different from our past .
Remember that in the 1980s everyone thought the main difference between us and Japan was that they were the ones who were going to run the world .
The other problem - and this may seem counterintuitive - is that stocks really do n't get any safer if you hold them longer , says Boston University economist Zvi Bodie .
Although the probability that stocks will trail a safe asset like TIPS goes down over time , the potential consequences of such a shortfall get worse and worse .
Think of it this way :
Say you could buy a security that could only rise 5 % or fall 5 % in any given year .
Your worst outcome for one year , of course , would be a 5 % loss .
Yet in theory , your worst outcome over 10 years - however unlikely - could be 10 straight years of losses , for a decline , after compounding , of 40 % .
" People are led to believe there 's a free lunch , that you can earn a risk premium without bearing any risk , " says Bodie .
" That is fundamentally wrong . "
The upshot , Bodie adds , is that investors should think less about time when deciding how aggressively to invest and more about their income sources .
A young person with a secure job has a bond - like income stream and can afford to take more risks with stocks .
Those with uncertain or soon - to - decline salaries - such as entrepreneurs or near - retirees - need more security .
Everybody knows that you can own more stocks if you are tolerant of risk .
This one is perfectly true .
But there 's a catch :
It 's hard to predict how you 'll handle risk until the bad stuff actually happens .
In 2000 every other person you met claimed to be an " aggressive " investor .
By 2002 aggressive - growth funds were selling like steaks at a vegan convention .
Investors did n't regain their courage until last year - just in time for this bear ( see the chart above right ) .
Much of this is psychological .
Yet it is also true , as Brigham Young University personal - finance professor Craig Israelsen observes , that people overestimate how much of their money is really " long term . "
When a bear is coupled with a recession and job losses , investors find themselves wishing they had more emergency cash .
As a result , the returns of hypothetical history are n't what investors actually get .
A study by Ilia Dichev of the University of Michigan found that stocks on the Nasdaq gained an annualized 9.6 % from 1973 to 2002 - but investors in those shares earned just 4.3 % on average .
" People are bad timers , getting in and out of stocks at the wrong times , " says Dichev .
That argues for staying put now .
But if you 've already sold shares because you found out the risk was more than you could stand , do n't berate yourself .
You 've just learned what your true risk tolerance is .
The trick is to correct this once and for all .
So if you think your new , lower allocation to stocks is something you can live with , commit yourself to it even if the market rebounds .
It may help to write down your new plan , your current reasoning and perhaps the emotions you 've been feeling and stick it in an envelope marked " Open at Dow 12,000 . "
You want to persuade the future you to not get carried away again .
Greek rioters blind police succesfully with lasers .

Internet - connected televisions , social media , and the power of simplicity were all cited as launch pads for future innovation in technology , according to a panel of experts that convened at Harvard Business School as part of the HBS Centennial Business Summit in October .
And though advertisers love the Internet , to what extent they can capitalize on these transformations remains an open question .
HBS professor David Yoffie moderated the session on " The Technology Revolution and its Implications for the Future , " with panelists James Breyer ( HBS MBA ' 87 ) , partner of the venture capital firm Accel Partners ; Susan L. Decker ( HBS MBA ' 86 ) , president of Yahoo ! Inc. ; and Eric Kim ( HBS MBA ' 81 ) , senior vice president and general manager of Intel Corporation 's Digital Home Group .
The first computer , the ENIAC , cleared the path for future innovation in the late 1940s , said Yoffie , who set the context for the ensuing discussion .
Today , millions of Web users generate free content , and we are witnessing an " explosion " in video and cell phone use , he continued , with more than 100 million smartphones already in use .
In addition , there is the phenomenon of virtual worlds , where approximately 217 million online players interact .
This is an evolving landscape , with much growth remaining , Yoffie said .
Of 6.5 billion people in the world , about 1.5 billion have Internet access , more than 300 million have broadband access to the home , and 3 billion have cell phones , a growing number of which offer Internet access .
What these statistics suggest is that " the most precious currency today is information , " said panelist Jim Breyer , an early investor in Facebook and a director of Wal - Mart Stores .
" Each year there is more information created on the Web than in all the previous years combined .
Investment initiatives are around participating in the information flow .
We [ at Accel ] are interested in companies that help us understand how to structure information , communicate , categorize some of that self - generated information , and then act on it . "
A sticking point currently for businesses is spanning the gap between the physical and the digital world , he continued .
" Right now there are significant problems understanding how to take what we are getting at point of sale in the physical world environment — very valuable info on customers — and how to integrate it with all the information that is being generated on the Web .
To date , there is no company that allows one to take quickly all this information ' in the cloud ' and integrate it with the vast arrays of information in the physical world . "
Difficulties aside , Breyer said the promise of technology meant that innovation to solve a problem could arrive from any quarter : prominent companies , nonprofit enterprises , " two students in a dorm room , or mothers or fathers after they have done their school pickups . "
He continues to be impressed by businesses that start with little capital — anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 50,000 — yet get to scale quickly and build new applications on the Web .
Sleeping By The Cell Phone
Just as technology is influencing society , society is increasingly making demands on technology , said Sue Decker of Yahoo !
" The way we live , love , communicate , and work will influence technology , and the greater population will be exercising an increasing amount of control , " she said .
Decker cited statistics suggesting that in 2007 , 12 percent of newlyweds met online .
In addition , of the users in the United States , half sleep with a cell phone or other electronic device nearby , and married couples usually do not share cell phones .
Innovation will serve people who want simplicity of technology usage .
As the network gets larger it becomes less relevant to individuals , she said , so people want to organize their experience according to their own interests .
" Companies that will do pretty well will create a dashboard of simplicity that is very open to the whole Internet , not just to the company it may be associated with , and will elevate social connections in a way that drives dollars . "
How exactly social connections will drive dollars remains to be seen , she added .
Although some sites such as Yahoo !
include premium services that require fees or subscriptions , the largest business model by far is advertising : a $ 45 billion industry globally that has been growing about 20 percent per year , said Decker .
Advertising on the Web is very effective in the sense that advertisers can reach great scale and do precision targeting .
The challenge is to discern consumers ' intent .
" Search is unbelievably efficient because you look at a little query box .
You can tell exactly what people care about , and you can serve an ad that is relevant at scale .
In social media , that is very difficult to do .
It 's very hard to know what people care about with respect to buying things , because you are inferring intent , you 're not taking intent directly from the consumer , " said Decker .
" Advertisers really want to be there :
They love the demographics , they are increasingly comfortable with some of the brand risks of what that might mean .
But Internet advertising still does n't perform very well , and that 's a challenge .
How do you serve the right ads to the right user and understand what it is that that individual would be interested in buying ? "
Tv And The Internet
Pressure has been building for a merging of television and the Internet , said Intel 's Eric Kim .
Consumers now expect Internet service everywhere , with implications for entertainment and advertising .
For almost 90 years , the television has been a one - way device , and it should be a two - way device .
" This is not a new idea , " Kim clarified .
" Many attempts have failed .
It primes us for success . "
Prices of televisions are going down , and the industry as a whole is mature , leaving an opportunity for the Internet to disrupt both the value chain and the content industry .
Advertisers , for their part , continue to feel comfortable placing ads on TV , gauging that their dollars will not be wasted .
Emerging markets further propel the growth potential for innovations combining the Internet and television , which is a natural , low - cost , and ubiquitous way for people in emerging markets to engage with the Internet , he said .
" We think there 's a lot of room for innovation here and a lot of room for richness and choices , " Kim concluded .
" There is no silver bullet in a lot of these economic models , " added Breyer .
" It 's almost always the case that the business models shift in every successful company .
I think it 's our job as board members , CEOs , and investors to find breathtakingly brilliant entrepreneurs who then try to find breathtakingly brilliant operating executives who also understand the products , and try to spend a great deal of time finding pockets of monetization .
There will be a great deal of experimentation .
Some of it will work and a lot wo n't .
Five years from now , many of them will have found highly successful business models , " but it is tricky at the beginning of a new venture to predict what those models might be .
A dashboard concept is very important as the key to innovation , said Decker .
" Increasingly , companies will find ways to leverage whatever social networks you 're in , find ways to service those in ways easy for you to access , and try to go for more simplicity , " she said .
" Simplicity is the single thing people really want .
It 's going to get faster in terms of technology .
There 's going to be more opportunities and interconnections .
" But fundamentally , removing the complexity and adding simplicity so you can easily access in an open way everything you want , and leverage a lot of social connections rather than going to multiple ones , is how the user experience will evolve . "

FINANCIAL TURMOIL FINANCIAL TURMOIL
More coverage : Recession is official , economists say DETROIT 
They may be folks you love to hate , but it 's hard not to have sympathy for car dealers these days .
These business owners are manning the bucket brigades in an auto industry meltdown .
" Things are going disastrously , " says Ray Ciccolo , owner and CEO of Village Automotive Group in suburban Boston .
" Most car dealers were down over 30 % last month , and that is a catastrophe . "
Many wo n't survive .
Almost 600 of the about 20,000 U.S. new car dealers have shut their doors this year , and an additional 2,000 will close within 18 months , predicts Mark Johnson , president of a Seattle consulting firm that helps auto dealers buy , sell or merge operations .
In September alone , 61 dealers — two a day — closed shop or downsized to used car lots , says the National Automobile Dealers Association ( NADA ) .
Wounded by gas prices that killed sales of their most profitable SUVs and trucks , dealers are being hammered as the economy depresses sales of all models .
Even people with good jobs feel poorer and less confident to take on years of payments for a big purchase .
Those who still would are finding it harder to get credit — General Motors credit arm GMAC now requires a credit score of 700 or better for a car loan .
Banks ' reluctance to lend also is squeezing the dealers , who need regular loans ( called " floor planning " ) to finance inventory .
" This is a very big , complex issue that 's all wound up around itself , " Johnson says .
" We are definitely up to our neck in this . "
Not helping : September sales showed that despite easing gas prices , many buyers still want gas - stingy and cheaper small cars — which have small profit margins — or demand huge discounts on trucks , SUVs or luxury cars .
That 's if they 're shopping at all .
A poll done by WPP Lightspeed this month found that only 10 % of Americans plan to buy a car in the next three months .
It may be hard not to gloat when a car dealer gets the short end of the deal , but when they go out of business , that can be bad news for consumers .
Fewer dealers fighting for your business means you 'll end up paying more for cars .
The plight of car dealers is being watched closely by economic analysts because vehicle sales are a key indicator of the economy 's health .
The auto industry overall supports one in 10 U.S. jobs , according to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers .
Dealers alone employ more than 1.1 million and generate nearly 20 % of retail sales in most states .
Fewer sales by dealers lead to cuts in auto production .
Fewer hours or jobs for assembly - line workers .
Fewer parts required from supplier companies .
Fewer hot dogs sold to shift workers in plants across the nation .
Not to mention more defaults on mortgages — which got the ball rolling on this economic mess in the first place .
Working harder to close a deal
On a recent Saturday in Los Angeles , the day started slowly at Galpin Ford .
At about 11 a.m. , salesmen in starched shirts and ties chatted in the near - empty showroom .
Terry Miller , the sales manager , says business began drooping last year .
" When the mortgage issues began and gas prices rising began at a similar time … we realized ( there was ) a slowdown . "
Customers trickle in , looking at the new Ford Flex crossovers and largely ignoring closeout 2008 pickups .
By 1 p.m. , most of the staff are trying to work deals .
It 's a challenge .
Many buyers with SUVs to trade in owe more than they 're worth , says Tawny Arnaud , Galpin 's vice president of sales .
They have loans of up to 72 months , even though they 've gotten used to trading in every 36 months , rolling debt from one car into another .
Some owe up to $ 15,000 .
" We do everything we can to structure ( the deal ) so it wo n't happen again , " Arnaud says .
Arnaud says Galpin 's promotions focus on convincing buyers that they can get credit .
Business is slower but has n't died , he says .
" The dealers just have to work that much harder to get their customers into a car . "
For starters , customers need to pony up a bigger down payment .
RDQ Economics , using Federal Reserve data , says the typical loan in August was for 88 % of a car 's price vs. 95 % in July , and a steep drop from 101 % in 2006 — when buyers could wrap taxes , fees and even some of their old car loan into the new loan .
" We 've not had trouble getting customers financed , but terms have been restrictive , down payment requirements higher , " says dealer John McEleney of Clinton , Iowa , new chairman of NADA .
Even creditworthy buyers are being hit with higher interest rates , " And in some cases , that makes the payment go up enough that the customer just can't do it , " he says .
Lenders are unlikely to let buyers borrow more than the car is worth again , says Melinda Zabritski , director of automotive credit for Experian .
Close to $ 25 billion in auto loans are at risk of default , she says , about 3 % of nearly $ 796 billion in open loans .
The quality of credit on open loans also is deteriorating .
People who had good scores when they got a loan have seen those scores drop because of personal financial troubles .
" It 's an alarming trend , " Zabritski says , adding that new buyers with spotty credit are paying higher rates because of this .
Jim Weisbecker , general manager for Belle Glade Chevrolet in West Palm Beach , Fla. , says he 's seeing the effects firsthand .
Customers who could have gotten a loan at 5.5 % just a few months ago now are being offered loans at 8 % to 10 % .
Buyers with typical credit scores of 625 to 725 — scores generally range from 300 ( poor ) to 850 ( excellent ) — got loans easily just six weeks ago , he says .
Now , " It 's shifted radically . "
" The answer is , a whole lot less people are financing , " Weisbecker says , noting that before the credit crisis , about 80 % of his customers took out loans , and those buyers are n't coming in now .
Like consumers , many businesses are just not in the mood to buy cars in the current economy .
Jim Svetz , owner of the Muddy Cup Coffee Houses in Upstate New York , is looking at ways to make the two cars in his fleet , both with more than 100,000 miles , last as long as they can .
" It would be nice to get new cars , but we 're doing the best we can to keep these two going before we even think about affording a new car , " he says .
" As people slow down their spending , we 're looking at hunkering down and hopefully getting through the recession . "
Business buyers also may be reluctant to tap available credit .
Paul Lauttamus , who owns a security and communications company in West Virginia , delayed plans to buy new SUVs so he 'll be able to borrow to buy troubled companies and grow .
" We did n't want to tie up future access to credit , " he says .
Other businesses are having trouble getting good interest rates , or getting approved for credit at all .
That includes dealers .
Some banks are calling dealers and telling them they 'll no longer finance their " floor plans , " the loans that cover the cost of their unsold cars .
That leaves dealers scrambling for alternative lenders or going out of business .
Johnson says he 's consulting with " hundreds " of dealers whose banks called to say their loans soon will go away .
" There 's this mass assault on dealers , mostly the domestic dealers , " whose sales have been hit hardest this year , he says .
Fewer dealerships likely
As sales decline , fewer dealers can remain profitable .
A recent study by consulting firm Grant Thornton showed that for average dealer sales to match last year 's average , about 2,000 dealers need to close .
With sales imploding , the firm has raised the number to 3,800 .
Unfortunately for troubled dealers , that means makers of the cars they sell are n't motivated to prop them up — particularly Detroit 's Big 3 , which have many more dealerships than foreign makers do .
Paul Melville , a partner at Grant Thornton , says they " badly need retail consolidation " to have healthy dealers .
" Significant consolidation is necessary , especially among Ford , General Motors and Chrysler retailers , " he says , " because U.S. sales already have declined more than 1 million units this year . "
The domestic automakers want their dealer numbers to be more like those of Toyota or Honda .
Toyota has fewer than 2,000 U.S. dealers ; Ford , for example , has almost 4,000 .
Result : A typical Toyota dealer sold 1,628 vehicles in 2007 , says Grant Thornton , while Ford stores averaged 236 .
GM dealers averaged 202 .
The average for all new car dealers was 322 .
" All the domestic manufacturers want their store counts and revenue counts to look like Toyota and Honda , because many less dealerships means selling more per outlet , " Johnson says .
Dealer - oriented state franchise laws make forced thinning of the ranks by automakers very expensive .
But now the financial crisis is doing it for them , Johnson says .
It " has really hastened this way beyond their imagination . "
The consumer may not be a winner , however , as less competition allows a rethinking of the common dealer business model : high volume built with aggressive pricing and touted in TV , radio and print ads aimed to draw customers from miles around to a lot with acres of new cars .
That model has led to the big sticker - price discounts shoppers have come to expect but leaves dealers little margin for error .
Just how little was apparent last month when Bill Heard Enterprises , a chain with 13 Chevrolet dealerships from Georgia to Arizona and a 90 - year history , abruptly shut its doors .
The self - described Mr. Big Volume had been weakened by problems including a dispute with consumer regulators but accounted for 7 % of Chevy sales in the USA and had about $ 2.5 billion annual revenue when auto sales were booming .
" The business model of huge , irrational inventories and huge , irrational marketing budgets with razor - thin margins , à la the Bill Heard model , is obsolete , " says Mike Jackson , CEO of AutoNation , the USA 's largest chain of dealerships .
" It 's dead .
It will not survive this downturn . "
Jackson says the future of car sales — coming soon — will be one in which fewer dealerships have less need to wheel and deal .
They can hold the line on price , pumping up the profit per car , and focus on customer service .
" At the dealer level , a shakeout needed to happen , " he says .
" It will be painful .
It will be ugly .
But it is also long overdue . "
Rebound ?
Maybe 2010
The pain looks likely to last through next year .
The current economy makes a sales rebound look unlikely before 2010 , analysts say .
" All the problems of the economy are wrapped up in auto sales , " says Mark Zandi , an economist at Moody 's Economy.com .
Meanwhile , the remaining shoppers are taking their time making a decision and hunting for the best deal .
Eric Marks , CEO of a management consulting firm in Newburyport , Mass. , wants an all - wheel - drive vehicle because he 's having trouble maneuvering out of his driveway in snowy weather .
But he faces the twin problems of higher interest rates for a car loan and lower trade - in values , which drive up the end price for a new car .
He 's also seen the dealer meltdown .
The dealer who sold his wife a Chevy Tahoe a few months ago has gone out of business .
" It was an ah - ha experience " about how bad things are getting , he says .
Even though he wants a new car , he says , he 's determined to get a good deal .
So for now , like many potential car buyers , he says he 'll wait on the sidelines .

ROME  A day after Pope Benedict XVI said he would revoke the excommunications of four schismatic bishops , including one who has denied the Holocaust , concern about the pope ’s decision extended into the Vatican itself .
Cardinal Walter Kasper , the director of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the liaison for Vatican - Jewish relations , said Sunday that he had not been consulted .
“ It was a decision of the pope , ” the cardinal said in a telephone interview .
That Benedict apparently did not widely discuss a matter that has provoked anger among Jewish groups and liberal Catholics was not out of character , however .
It was just the latest example of how the pope is increasingly focused on internal doctrinal issues and seemingly unaware of how they might resonate in the larger world .
As such , it perfectly captured the theological aspirations  and political shortcomings  of his four - year - old papacy .
Frugal Tips : How To Make 10 Ordinary Things Last Longer
We all want to stretch our bucks as far as we can even as we replenish our grocery supplies every week or replace old items that we need to make our lives function smoothly .
It was surprising to me how much money we can save if we just make some everyday things last longer .
Take for instance this 84 year old fellow who has driven the same car all his life : a 1929 Ford Model A with 200,000 miles on it .
Clarence Cleveland Curtiss bought a used car for $ 10 during the Depression when he was 15 in the year 1938 , and has kept it ever since .
And based on these figures , he ’s probably saved at least $ 31,000 by doing so .
So clearly , the bigger the item and the longer you try to preserve its life ( within safety guidelines ) , the less money you ’ll have to fork out for replacements .
Your high interest savings account and the environment will both be happy .
This fellow has a car that is lasting as long as he is !
Frugal Tip : Make stuff last longer !
The biggest savings tip here for anything you own — see if you can consume less than is recommended , just as long as it does n’t affect the potency of the item or material you ’re using .
Other tricks involve caring and maintaining your everyday things in a way that lengthens their shelf life .
Here are a few interesting pointers on how to get the most out of some common household items :
Soap
If you ’re using a soap pump , then try putting a rubber band around the base of the pump , looping it tightly .
This will prevent the pump from going down all the way , but should still cause it to pump out an adequate amount of soap .
Expect this to make the soap in your pump last longer .
I ’ve actually tackled this topic in full in my article : “ Cheap Ways To Watch Your Hygiene ” where you can get even more tips on getting clean the frugal way !
Scented Candles
Get your candles to last longer by chilling them !
This is an old trick that is used by frugal people and the candle companies themselves .
Chilling the candles before you use them makes the wax burn more slowly and evenly .
Some say that the best way to do this is to freeze the candles for 24 hours before burning them .
Others say that just storing them in the refrigerator for eight hours before you burn them is enough to do the trick .
Clothes
The biggest culprits to your clothes ’ wear and tear are what you ’d expect : the acts of drying ( even at low heat ) and washing .
Since fabric does not regenerate , the constant whirl and tumble experienced by clothing in cleaning machines will gradually erode fabric .
If you want to preserve your clothes , then line dry them .
This is n’t the most convenient or practical way to dry your clothes , but it will slow down their wear .
Most of the time you find a hole in a sock , it ’s when you ’re folding it warm from the dryer .
You know all of that lint that you clean from the dryer filter ?
It used to be fibers in your clothing .
Think of how many bags of lint your clothes lose in a year .
Hang your clothes , and you will save them to clothe you another day .
Every wash leeches color and fibers from your clothing .
There is not much you can do to get around this one , unless you want to alienate everyone around you with smell .
You can wash your clothes in cold water .
You can wash them on the gentle cycle with gentle detergent or you can wear them more than once before washing .
Carpet
Cheap carpets will typically last you from 3 to 5 years while good quality carpeting may have a life lasting 10 to 20 years , if you take good care of it .
At this time , our own carpets are approaching 9 years old and they still look pretty good !
These tips should help add some life to your fabric flooring :
Rearrange your furniture , so that wear becomes better distributed .
Vacuum regularly .
Avoid tracking in dirt .
Shampoo your carpets and rugs .
Snip loose threads .
Treat spills and stains quickly .
Designate eating areas .
Car
You can save several tens of thousands of dollars if you decide to drive your car to the ground .
These days , both our cars have logged 100,000 miles each and are still going strong .
There ’s even a used car market out there for cars that have over 200,000 miles in them !
If your car is regularly well - maintained , you ’ll most likely extend your car ’s lifespan :
Change your air filter yearly .
Rotate your tires .
Change the oil regularly : depending on your vehicle , that ’s around 3,000 miles or 3 months to 7,500 miles or 6 months .
Change your transmission fluid generally once every 30 or 60 thousand miles , depending on manufacturer ’s recommendations .
Drain the radiator .
Change your spark plugs .
Check your exhaust system .
Clean your car : wax and wash .
Light Bulbs
The trick to longer lasting bulbs is to simply invest in greener , more efficient alternatives .
I also covered frugal lighting in my article : “ Trim Your Energy Costs ” .
When choosing the greenest option for lighting your home or office , look to the new light emitting diode ( LED ) light bulbs as the next generation green alternative .
Currently , compact fluorescent bulbs ( CFL ) get attention as a lower - energy bulb than traditional incandescent bulbs .
However , new LED bulbs are on the rise as the green bulbs of the future and the replacement for CFLs .
Food
Statistics show that American families end up throwing out 14 % of their food because of spoilage .
So here are some tricks to keep your food fresher , longer :
Store fruits and vegetables separately to slow down the “ ripening ” process .
Store food at proper temperatures .
Vacuum seal food in zip lock bags to better preserve them .
Protect dry goods from insects and pests .
Chill bananas after they ripen .
The peel will darken but the fruit will last longer .
Store leftovers in airtight food containers .
Mattress
Mattresses are expensive — I just bought a couple of twin mattresses for my kids , and it ran me several hundred bucks each .
I ’m hoping I do n’t replace them for a really long time .
To maintain them well , I ’d try this :
Redistribute the mattress wear so you can get the most out of your bedding .
You can flip your mattress every other week or month .
You can also try rotating it without having to flip it .
Also , use a mattress pad to keep the mattress clean and away from stains — a great idea since mattress pads can be laundered .
Flowers
I love fresh flowers and often have them in my home on a regular basis .
We get ours from our garden but once in a while we get them from the local stores as well , where they can cost $ 5.00 and over .
Allow frugal displays to brighten up your room longer by doing the following :
Cut off all leaves that will be submerged in the water before putting flowers in a vase .
Rotting leaves speeds up the deterioration process .
Cut flower stems at an angle for better water absorption by the plant .
Change out the water in the vase or plant container regularly .
Keep flowers away from direct heat or sunlight .
Add flower preservers to your arrangement .
Razor Blades
Anyone who shaves may want to know how to stretch the use of their razor blades .
Here are a few interesting pointers I picked up from a frugal forum :
People try all kinds of tricks to make razor blades last longer , including storing them in oil or even placing them on a prism to channel pyramid power into the blade .
However here is a simple technique that seems to work : dry the blade after use .
According to the Chicago Tribune , the concept is this : razor blade dullness stems more from oxidation and microscopic rusting , rather than from contact with whiskers .
Water that sits on blades between shaves causes the oxidation .
Corrosion can cause metal on the blade to flake off and the edge to become blunted and jagged .
That results in blades pulling and tearing hairs instead of cleanly slicing through them .
By blotting his blades on a towel after use , someone extended the use of a blade from ten days to five months .
Or you can also “ rinse the razor in water , shake excess droplets , dip it in alcohol , give it a good swirl ( it really does clean far more thoroughly than water ) , then shake out and prop it in its holder .
The alcohol drives the water out and then quickly evaporates . ”
All sound easy enough ?
If you ’ve got frugal tricks like these up your sleeve , I ’d love to hear them !

So there we are en route , it ’s closing in on 1 p.m. , and we ’re hungry .
“ Let ’s eat at the next rest stop , ” says my husband .
“ I could really go for a Nathan ’s hot dog or an Arby ’s roast beef sandwich or maybe a Whopper with Cheese . ”
His reference to these items reflects his familiarity with the culinary landscape of the New Jersey Turnpike .
Depending on the rest stop , a traveler can choose from among one of two unholy trinities : Nathan ’s , Burger King , and Sbarro pizza , or KFC , McDonald ’s , and Arby ’s .
These franchises have , I presume , engaged in some high level fast food negotiation so as to divide the Turnpike turf between them .
My husband ’s palate happens to have a chameleon - like versatility .
If we were in Paris , he would go for moules frites or sole meuniere , but given that we ’re heading toward the George Washington Bridge , it ’s Nathan ’s , Arby ’s , or Burger King .
Not me .
Fast food offends me in every possible way .
Shall I review the clichéd litany ?
It is unhealthy , calorific , and overseasoned ; the profusion of paper and plastic is bad for the environment ; and the spaces it inhabits , esthetically repellent — vast trough - like arenas where humanity at its most ungainly congregates in order to stuff itself in record time .
I used to argue for a detour off the highway to seek out a diner , a luncheonette , a roadside restaurant — some place where the food would be prepared rather than mass - produced .
But my husband ( who does the driving and is therefore “ the decider ” ) would have none of it .
He maintains that such places reflect the great service feature of American democracy : the ability to deliver a hearty , relatively inexpensive , not unpalatable , and speedy dining experience .
These franchises are also , he notes , a decided improvement over what was available to highway travelers in his youth .
Just the name of the establishment associated with those childhood journeys is enough to set him going .
Howard Johnson’s .
He recalls vividly the headache - inducing orange and teal décor , the plastic - upholstered booths , the interminable wait to catch the attention of the disturbingly cheerful waitress , the even longer wait for the meal itself — a depressing affair involving dry veal cutlets , overdone string beans , rubbery mac and cheese and , for dessert , crystallized chocolate ice cream .
Those were the days , he reminds me , when having a meal required that all the food groups be represented — meat , a green vegetable , a starch , and a carb for dessert — even if each of these elements had been cooked to resemble sodden cardboard and even if you were delayed three hours on your trip to see Aunt Leona , said to be on the brink of death in Hackensack Hospital .
During the protracted period of waiting for said meal , my husband recalls that his father fought with his mother about why they were visiting her Aunt Leona to begin with ( neither of them liked her ) , while his younger sister , plied with chocolate milk to hold her until the delivery of her mac and cheese , spent an hour in the ladies room due to undiagnosed lactose intolerance .
For some reason , in those days , no one made the logical deduction that a child who got a belly \ache after she drank a glass of milk might be suffering from something other than a stomach bug .
All this is by way of explaining my husband ’s affection for rest stops where a good Nathan ’s hot dog or Whopper with Cheese can be ordered , paid for , and wolfed down in less than three minutes .
Being an understanding wife , I have tried to be game about the whole thing and order one of those McDonald ’s salads ( that look like they ’ve been stored in a vacuum “ to assure freshness ” for two years ) and keep comments like , “ Did you know that a Whopper with Cheese has 39 grams of fat and 770 calories ? ” to a minimum .
But our most recent Turnpike venture brought a surprise .
When we pulled into the Vince Lombardi Service Area near the George Washington Bridge for lunch , there , in place of that old workhorse Sbarro , with its overdone paninis and droopy pizza slices , was another franchise : Popeye’s .
I had heard tell of Popeye ’s from travelers to the southern and western reaches of our great land .
Excellent southern style chicken , I was told by one acquaintance .
Fast food at its best , said another .
The appearance of the unforeseen and the promise of possible quality lifted my spirits .
I felt like I used to feel in airplanes right before they began the “ dinner service ” — a euphemism they do n’t even pretend to resort to any longer , where meals have been eliminated entirely except on trips of 12 hours or more .
Excited by the prospect of sampling the famed Popeye ’s , I immediately got at the end of a line of like - minded enthusiasts .
My husband , not one to deviate from an established idea , went over to Nathan ’s , where he was soon delivered two hot dogs and a small Coke ( which is to say , a Coke appropriate for a small giant ) .
He began to eat , while I stood in the Popeye ’s line .
I was behind a man from Chicago , who now lived in New Hampshire and said Popeye ’s was what he missed most since moving to the Northeast .
This whet my appetite further .
But there appeared to be problems with the Popeye ’s staff .
The two women behind the counter were moving with preternatural slowness .
One was fiddling lackadaisically with the cash register where the receipt spool was jammed .
Those of us in line waited while she fiddled unsuccessfully until , finally , a jolly looking manager appeared , poked around a bit , unjammed the receipt spool , and disappeared , only to have it jam again with the next customer .
Meanwhile , the second young woman appeared to be moving underwater .
She told the man from New Hampshire that the biscuits would be ready in three minutes , then began to brush a tray of biscuits with yellow batter very , very slowly .
He waited .
After all , he ’d traveled all the way from New Hampshire .
Finally , the jolly manager unjammed the cash register for the other server , and I ordered the Deluxe Chicken Sandwich Combo .
Unfortunately , the chicken filets for the Deluxe Chicken Sandwich Combo were still cooking .
They would , the woman said , take three minutes to be ready .
Three minutes appeared to be the temporal coinage of Popeye ’s , and could mean many things , though never three minutes .
Soon , everyone was waiting three minutes for something .
My husband has finished his two Nathan ’s hot dogs and was eyeing me with annoyance .
Finally , the chicken filets for my sandwich were brought out and dumped in a wire rack .
My server slowly drew on a pair of de rigeur plastic gloves and draped my filet onto its toasted bun .
I was given my side dish ( red beans and rice in a little plastic container , so hot I could barely touch it ) and my small ( i.e. , for a small giant ) Diet Pepsi .
I paid my $ 7 and change and proceeded to the table .
My husband had a look on his face that I imagine he used to have in Howard Johnson’s .
“ This better be good , ” he said .
I sampled the Deluxe Chicken Sandwich and give him a bite .
And I am pleased to report that it was good .
For fast food , albeit fast food you have to wait half an hour for , it was damned good .
I would have liked to try the biscuits , but we had to get going and the guy from New Hampshire was still waiting his three minutes when we left the Vince Lombardi Service Area .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Workers at a steel plant near Berlin found 100,000 euros ( $ 128,500 ) in a safe that a bank had sent to be scrapped -- but they did the decent thing and gave it back .
An employee at Germany ’s Postbank had failed to take out the cash before sending the safe to the scrapyard .
Spokesman Ralf Palm blamed “ the carelessness of an employee when a branch office moved in December . ”
Barack Obama was against the Iraq War from the beginning .
Unlike the Senate Representatives , Obama got it .
He understood the consequences of the western - posse mentality that deluded the nation into invading Iraq .
He rejected the deluded idea that much of the nation was under , that “ spread - our - ideals - at - any - cost ” mindset that took - over after 9/11 .
Obama understood this was an irrational and “ dumb ” .
It was the kind of thinking that you saw from Paul Kersey in the Death Wish movies .
The idea that they could single - handedly root out terrorism and inflict a vigilante justice with the use of a gun .
Obama understood this false sense of justice was non-lasting .
Just take a look at his speech from the first Chicago anti-war rally on October 2 , 2002 , when he said ,
“ But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States , or to his neighbors , that the Iraqi economy is in shambles , that the Iraqi military a fraction of its former strength , and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until , in the way of all petty dictators , he falls away into the dustbin of history .
I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length , at undetermined cost , with undetermined consequences .
I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East , and encourage the worst , rather than best , impulses of the Arab world , and strengthen the recruitment arm of al - Qaeda .
I am not opposed to all wars .
I ’m opposed to dumb wars . ”
His rationale , however , proved to be the minority at the time .
Fast - forward six years and Obama has proven himself to be the forward thinker of the Washington bunch .
The forward thinker that was right about Iraq and now stands as a beacon for the sentiment against the war that is held by the majority of Americans .
So the forward thinker was right .
The forward thinker won the election .
Now what ?
What does the forward thinker do ?
What does he want to do ?
What can he do ?
One thing has been clear ; he was against the war and wants out .
But can he do it ?
Obama ’s greatest challenge will now be to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq without leaving it to a civil war that could potentially kill thousands .
He will have to pullout in a way that places the responsibility of Iraq thereafter on its current government .
And he ’ll have to pullout without giving the insurgents who indiscriminately kill civilians through bombings the perception that they were the reason for withdrawal .
He ’ll also have to leave Iraq in a way that supposes the current Iraqi government is strong , and not a puppet for any regional powers like Saudi Arabia or Iran .
Iraq
There is no military solution to this war .
No amount of U.S. soldiers – not 10,000 more , not 20,000 more , not the almost 30,000 more that we now know we are sending– can solve the grievances that lay at the heart of someone else ’s civil war .
Our troops cannot serve as their diplomats , and we can no longer referee their civil war
Reducing troop levels and overall U.S. Presence by 2010
Increased Iraqi self - reliance for security
a phased withdrawal will encourage Iraqis to take the lead in securing their own country and making political compromises
Increasing economic accountability of the Iraqi Government and decreasing US financial assistance to Iraq
set conditions on economic assistance to Iraq .
Conditions that include a dedication of $ 10 billion annually in Iraqi revenue for reconstruction , job creation , and development , a stand - by agreement with the IMF for assistance in Iraq if necessary , and continual progress towards reducing sectarian violence .
The set conditions , however , are not conditional for humanitarian assistance , or assistance regarding security measures
Creating accountability from the United States
References
Obama ’s campaign promises on withdrawal was a reiteration of a bill introduced on January 30 , 2007 , in response to Bush ’s State of the Union statement announcing a troop surge .
The bill introduced was the Iraq War De-escalation Act of 2007 .
So far , it has only been introduced to the Senate floor .
Inherent in the bill is recognition of the need for swift troop withdrawal , and the need for the Iraqi ’s to settle internal sectarian conflicts .
The President - elect recognizes the sectarian conflict may blow over into a civil war , saying “ . ” His ideas have received endorsements from a broad spectrum of supporters , including Iraqi Prime Minister Nour al - Maliki .
The bill can be categorized into four objectives : • Reducing troop levels and overall U.S. Presence by 2010 • Increased Iraqi self - reliance for security •
Increasing economic accountability of the Iraqi Government and decreasing US financial assistance to Iraq• Creating accountability from the United StatesObama ’s plan for Iraq is to get out .
He never wanted to go there , he does not want to be there , and he does not want to stay for the duration of his Presidency .
He has been one of the few Senate members who have been actively against the war from the beginning .
The Iraq War De-escalation
Act would have withdrew troops one or two brigades a month , starting on May 1 , 2007 and ending on March 31 , 2008 .
So far , the Act has only been introduced to the Senate floor , and any dates mentioned would have to be ratified .
But now that he is President - elect , he has proposed withdrawal over 16 months , with a final exit sometime in 2010 .
The plan would see one or two brigades ’ pullout every month , and would see most American personnel leave as well .
A minimal amount of personnel would stay for only three possible reasons , to protect U.S. diplomats and civilians , to Iraqi security forces , or to pursue any terrorists in Iraq .
Obama has pledged to be ‘as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in ’ .
And since he has been quoted as stating the Iraq War was a “ dumb ” war , it is probably safe to say that he will go about the withdrawal very carefully .
Of course , saying “ careful ” could mean a presence past the 2010 objective .
Any longer - lasting presence however , could be triggered by significant escalation of internal conflict .
For instance , if intelligence reports indicate the violence is turning chaotic or destabilizing into a civil war that approaches catastrophic levels , he could be likely to prolong the phase - out or re-examine his exit strategy altogether .
Obama ’s De-escalation
Act has been looked upon favourably by the Iraqi Administration , who see two of their own objectives being met by Obama , by receiving a guarantee of no permanent bases , and a specific timetable for withdrawal .
The basis of this point for Obama is that if the U.S. pulls out , they do so for good .
This means the Iraqi Government must provide security for themselves and the people , and develop their economy without outside assistance .
Obama ’s plan is for the Iraq to have sustainable and confident internal security .
To do this he wants to intensify the training of Iraqi forces so control of the nations security is in capable Iraqi hands .
This mode of action would include leaving some U.S. forces and military personnel in Iraq for training .
The plan would also include the disbanding of militia elements among the security forces .
It would integrate them into the army , and put all potential rogue or dissociative wings under central control .
Obama believes “ ” and that this plan will allow enough time for the Iraqi government to get their act together and start governing with authority and accountability , rather than complacency .
The third objective manifests two important needs , Iraqi accountability , and decreased reliance on the United States for financial assistance .
In terms of Iraqi accountability , Obama ’s plan entails “ . ” Obama ’s objective would also mean an aggressive diplomatic effort to reach out to Iraq ’s neighbors — including Iran and Syria .
The goal here would be to ensure the integrity of Iraq ’s borders , keep neighboring countries from meddling inside Iraq , isolate al Qaeda , support reconciliation among Iraq ’s sectarian groups , and provide financial support for Iraq ’s reconstruction and development .
In terms of economic accountability , Obama wants to forge compromises on oil revenue sharing between all parties involved – i.e , the Shia ’s , Sunni ’s Kurds , Oil developers , etc .
They also want “ equitable provision of services , federalism , the status of disputed territories , new elections , aid to displaced Iraqis , and the reform of Iraqi security forces .
” Obama has tied his Iraqi accountability objectives to his economic goals at home , by stopping the spending of $ 10 billion a month in Iraq on reconstruction and security , and put pressure on the Iraqi government to use $ 10 billion annually from its current $ 79 billion surplus for reconstruction and job creation .
He makes this a key point in his plan to highlight to the American people the necessity to leave Iraq sooner rather than later .
The final objective of Barack Obama ’s comprehensive De-escalation Act would ensure accountability by the U.S. President too .
Obama has promised that under his plan the U.S. President would be required to submit a report to Congress every 90 days describing and assessing the Iraqi government ’s progress in meeting goals .
Obama has argued about the hypocrisy in U.S. policy towards Iraq , which demands the Iraqi Prime Minister to present security and economic measures to its parliament for approval , while the U.S. President is not demanded the to enact the same measures with Congress .
This new accountability measure is part of Obama ’s tying his own economic policy at home to this war , by attempting to curb what he has called “ the Bush Administration ’s blank check approach ” to the situation in Iraq .
As for the humanist side to his policy , Obama has said several times that he believes America has both a moral obligation and a responsibility towards the growing humanitarian crisis in Iraq .
He ’s said he wants to form an international working group to help confront the crisis .
The U.S. would assist by providing at least $ 2 billion to expand services to Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries , and ensure that Iraqis that have remained in Iraq can find sanctuary if necessary .
Obama also wants to work with the international community and Iraqi authorities to hold perpetrators of potential war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide accountable .
He wants to reserve the right to intervene militarily , with assistance from other nations , to suppress potential genocidal violence within Iraq .
So in that regard , he holds the current regime accountable for starting this war , and now finds it his moral and ethical responsibility to both the Iraqi people , and the military forces currently deployed in Iraq responsibly .

Home for retired missionaries loses grant - because it wo n't ask residents if they are lesbians
A care home where elderly Christian residents refused to answer ‘ intrusive ’ questions about their sexuality is at the centre of a bitter legal battle after its council grant was axed .
Brighton & Hove Council told the home to ask pensioners four times a year about their sexual orientation under its ‘ fair access and diversity ’ policies , which stem from New Labour equality laws .
Council chiefs also accused the charity that runs the home of ‘ institutional discrimination ’ , before cutting a £ 13,000 grant towards warden services .
Upset : Pensioners at the care home found the questionnaire intrusive
Pilgrim Homes , which operates ten schemes for elderly Christians across the UK , says it has never breached the law and is now suing the council , accusing it of religious discrimination .
Andrew Jessop , the charity ’s chief executive , said : ‘ The council has taken overzealousness to the extreme .
People in their 90s are very vulnerable and should n’t be treated in this way . ’
Tensions began last year when the council imposed stricter criteria on organisations it supported to ‘ comply ’ with the Equality Act 2006 and the Equality Act ( Sexual Orientation ) Regulations 2007 .
It circulated a questionnaire to the Pilgrim Home in Egremont Place , Brighton , which houses 39 single Christians aged over 80 , including former missionaries and a minister .
Phil Wainwright , director of human resources for Pilgrim Homes , said he was told by the council the home had to ask residents if they were lesbian , gay , bisexual , heterosexual or ‘ unsure ’ , even if they objected .
Many of the elderly rebelled , however , and the home wrote to the council saying residents did not want to participate .
Mr Wainwright said : ‘ There was a strong feeling among people in the home that the questions were inappropriate and intrusive .
They felt they had come to Pilgrim Homes because of its Christian ethos and were upset they were not protected from such intrusions . ’
But Brighton & Hove Council complained about the home ’s ‘ negative response ’ and argued that because the home had a Christian ethos , gay people might be deterred from applying .
Criticised : A Pilgrim Homes leaflet
It cited the ‘ resistance ’ to using images of elderly gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transgender people in the home ’s leaflets , saying this meant gays and lesbians ‘ would not feel comfortable ’ applying for a place .
The council then announced it was axeing the grant because there had been ‘ limited progress ’ in making the home accessible to the homosexual community .
Mr Wainwright said the charity was open to anyone with orthodox beliefs .
He said : ‘ We have every reason to believe that we have given places to gay Christians , and no questions were ever asked .
The council has n’t demonstrated any discrimination on our part .
We believe it is Brighton Council that is institutionally discriminatory . ’
MPs last night backed the charity , which fears other councils that provide it with grants totalling more than £ 100,000 , could follow Brighton ’s lead .
Ann Widdecombe , former Tory Home Office Minister , said : ‘ The equality law does not oblige anyone to ask intrusive questions .
This sort of thing needs to be nipped in the bud . ’
David Davies , Tory MP for Monmouth , said : ‘ It is absolutely disgraceful that the council has tried to get 90 - year - olds , from a generation that was n’t obsessed with sex , to put intimate information on to one of its forms . ’
But Brighton & Hove Council said : ‘ We have never expected any residents to answer questions about their sexuality if they preferred not to do so .
‘ The Government specifically states the home must be open to the gay and lesbian community and that it must demonstrate this to qualify for funding .
In the absence of any willingness to do this , funding has been withdrawn . ’
Ball - Point Pens for the Astronauts
When NASA started sending astronauts into space , they quickly
Discovered that ball - point pens would not work in zero
Gravity .
To combat this problem , NASA scientists spent a
Decade and $ 12 billion developing a pen that writes in zero
Gravity , upside - down , on almost any surface including glass
And at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 C .
The Russians used a pencil .
Your taxes are due again — enjoy paying them .
[ The Moscow Times , 2000 ]
There is a charming anecdote that roams from e-mail box to e-mail box around the world about how , at the height of the space race , the Americans and Soviets approached the same problem : how an astronaut ( or cosmonaut ) could use a pen to write in zero gravity .
As the story goes , the Americans spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on an ambitious , gravity - immune ballpoint pen ; they successfully developed such a pen ; and this pen went on to become a massive commercial success in the private sector .
The Soviets — with the simple elegance their scientists are so rightly famed for — opted instead to use a pencil .
The lesson of the infamous “ space pen ” anecdote related above , about NASA ’s spending a small fortune to develop a ballpoint pen that astronauts could use in outer space while completely overlooking the simple and elegant solution adopted by the Soviet space program ( give cosmonauts pencils instead ) , is a valid one : sometimes we expend a great deal of time , effort , and money to create a “ high - tech ” solution to a problem , when a perfectly good , cheap , and simple answer is right before our eyes .
As good a story and moral as that may be , however , this anecdote does n’t offer a real - life example of that syndrome .
Both U.S. astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts initially used pencils on space flights , but those writing instruments were not ideal : pencil tips can flake and break off , and having such objects floating around space capsules in near - zero gravity posed a potential harm to astronauts and equipment .
( As well , after the fatal Apollo 1 fire in 1967 , NASA was anxious to avoid having astronauts carry flammable objects such as pencils onboard with them . )
When the solution of providing astronauts with a ballpoint pen that would work under weightless conditions and extreme temperatures came about , though , it was n’t because NASA had thrown hundreds of thousands of dollars ( inflated to $ 12 billion in the latest iterations of this tale ) in research and development money at the problem .
The “ space pen ” that has since become famous through its use by astronauts was developed independently by Paul C. Fisher of the Fisher Pen Co. , who spent his own money on the project and , once he perfected his AG - 7 “ Anti-Gravity ” Space Pen , offered it to NASA .
After that agency tested and approved the pen ’s suitability for use in space flights , they purchased a number of the instruments from Fisher for a modest price .
This is how Fisher themselves described the development of their Space Pen :
NASA never asked Paul C. Fisher to produce a pen .
When the astronauts began to fly , like the Russians , they used pencils , but the leads sometimes broke and became a hazard by floating in the [ capsule ’s ] atmosphere where there was no gravity .
They could float into an eye or nose or cause a short in an electrical device .
In addition , both the lead and the wood of the pencil could burn rapidly in the pure oxygen atmosphere .
Paul Fisher realized the astronauts needed a safer and more dependable writing instrument , so in July 1965 he developed the pressurized ball pen , with its ink enclosed in a sealed , pressurized ink cartridge .
Fisher sent the first samples to Dr. Robert Gilruth , Director of the Houston Space Center .
The pens were all metal except for the ink , which had a flash point above 200°C .
The sample Space Pens were thoroughly tested by NASA .
They passed all the tests and have been used ever since on all manned space flights , American and Russian .
All research and development costs were paid by Paul Fisher .
No development costs have ever been charged to the government .
Because of the fire in Apollo 1 , in which three Astronauts died , NASA required a writing instrument that would not burn in a 100 % oxygen atmosphere .
It also had to work in the extreme conditions of outer space :
In a vacuum .
With no gravity .
In hot temperatures of +150 °C in sunlight and also in the cold shadows of space where the temperatures drop to - 120 °C ( NASA tested the pressurized Space Pens at - 50 °C , but because of the residential [ sic ] heat in the pen it also writes for many minutes in the cold shadows . )
Fisher spent over one million dollars in trying to perfect the ball point pen before he made his first successful pressurized pens in 1965 .
Samples were immediately sent to Dr. Robert Gilruth , Manager of the Houston Space Center , where they were thoroughly tested and approved for use in Space in September 1965 .
In December 1967 he sold 400 Fisher Space Pens to NASA for $ 2.95 each .
Lead pencils were used on all Mercury and Gemini space flights and all Russian space flights prior to 1968 .
Fisher Space
Pens are more dependable than lead pencils and cannot create the hazard of a broken piece of lead floating through the gravity - less atmosphere .
Paul Fisher continues to market his space pens as the writing instrument that went to the moon and has spun off this effort into a separate corporation , the Fisher Space Pen Co. :
Sightings :
This legend was referenced in an episode of NBC’s The West Wing TV series ( “ We Killed Yamamoto ” ; original air date 15 May 2002 ) :
New York Times foreign - affairs columnist and author Thomas Friedman is a favourite of centrist media types , who enjoy his sunny views on globalization and his glib theories in such books as The World Is Flat and The Lexus and the Olive Tree .
For instance , he has suggested that two countries with McDonald ’s restaurants wo n’t go to war .
More recently , he has discovered the energy crisis , which is the subject of his latest book , Hot , Flat , and Crowded : Why We Need a Green Revolution and How It Can Fix America .
But he ’s deeply loathed by left - wing anti-imperialists , who despise his support for the Bush administration ’s attack on Iraq in 2003 .
In this clip from a Charlie Rose interview on YouTube , Friedman maintained that he still feels that the war on Iraq was justified .
Friedman explained that there were three big “ bubbles ” of the 1990s : the " NASDAQ bubble " ( which culminated in the dot - com crash ) ; the " corporate - governance bubble " ( which culminated in corporate criminals such as Conrad Black and Bernie Ebbers going to jail ) : and the " terrorism bubble " .
Friedman claimed that the first two bubbles were based on creative accounting ; the third was grounded in moral creative accounting .
According to him , the terrorism bubble suggested it was okay to fly planes into the World Trade Center .
It was okay for preachers to support this idea in Muslim countries .
It was okay for charities to raise money to finance this terrorism .
And , Friedman emphasized , this so - called terrorism bubble was a “ fundamental threat to our open society ” .
And that ’s why he felt America needed to burst this bubble because otherwise , the terrorists would feel they could use suicide bombers to level the balance of power between them and the United States .
The only way to do it , Friedman added , was for the United States to go into the Muslim world .
“ What they needed to see was American boys and girls going from house to house , Basra to Baghdad , and basically saying , ” ˜Which part of this sentence you do n’t understand ?
You do n’t think we do n’t care about our open society ?
You think this bubble fantasy -- we ’re just going to let it grow ?
Well , suck on this .
Okay ’ , ” Friedman said .
“ That , Charlie was what this war was about .
We could have hit Saudi Arabia .
It was part of that bubble .
We could have hit Pakistan .
We hit Iraq because we could .
That ’s the real truth . ”
There are people out there who think that vaccines are linked to autism .
They are wrong .
There is no evidence to support their belief , and tons of evidence against it .
However , because they have celebrity spokespeople who are loud but appealing , and because their targets are worried parents , they have made seriously headway in society .
For that reason , I consider antivaxxers to be one of if not the largest health threat in the US .
We have already seen a drop in vaccinations in the US and UK and an increase in measles outbreaks due to their efforts ( pertussis is on the rise , too , though the cause is as yet unclear ) , and while there have been few deaths from their antiscientific crusade so far -- and even one is too many -- you can bet there will be more .
Many more .
And now there may be a further impact .
It appears some insurance companies are refusing to pay for some vaccinations .
It 's not clear if this is due to the drop in requested vaccinations because of antivax efforts , or if rising costs and the usual insurance company reluctance to provide actual coverage is to blame .
The survey on which this article is based does n't say , but it would be an excellent idea to find out why this is happening .
If we start to see an even higher increase in childhood diseases -- and fatalities -- that can be traced to the exhortations of Jenny McCarthy and Andrew Wakefield , then it is critically important that parents of young children know exactly what and who is behind the problem .
Speeding Up DNS Access In Regions With Very Low Infrastructure
Introduction
Let 's say you are on an expensive satellite link that can barely provide enough bandwidth for your company 's Internet access and you will want to do whatever you can to get as much as possible out of this link .
Moreover , occassionally you lose power from the utility company , long enough for your UPS to run out .
There are a few things you could do to get a lot more from your link .
In this article , we will be looking at speeding up your dns requests by keeping a cache of responses to your dns requests on your hard disk .
Subsequent dns request are then served from the cache and because a copy is on disk , you do n't lose it when there is a power outage or a reboot .
The updated version of this document is at : www.httpcompression.net.
Analysis
Do I need this ?
Well let 's see .
From your Linux issue the following command :
dig www.httpcompression.net
Among other things I get the following result :
;; Query time : 583 msec
After a few seconds I issued the command again and got :
;; Query time : 612 msec
Obviously my ISP 's dns servers simply forwards the requests to the US ( I am in Accra , Ghana , West Africa , connecting to the Internet over submarine fibre optic cable SAT3 ) .
Apparently , the results of the first request was not cached .
If it was , it had timed out by the time of the second request .
Certainly , such an environment is a perfect candidate for this setup .
HowTo
I am working on an Ubuntu server .
The software we will be using is pdnsd .
The website has this to say about pdnsd :
" pdnsd is a proxy DNS server with permanent caching ( the cache contents are written to hard disk on exit ) that is designed to cope with unreachable or down DNS servers ( for example in dial - in networking ) .
Since version 1.1.0 , pdnsd supports negative caching . "
From your Ubuntu or any other Debian based distribution issue the following command :
apt - get install pdnsd
A configuration page came up with three options " resolvconf / Use root servers / Manual " .
I selected " Manual " and continued with the installation .
The default installation has a configuration file , parts of which have been remarked .
A line is remarked out with " // " whilslt multilines are remarked with " /* */ " . Eg : "
//
This is a remarked line in the conf file .
/*
These are remarked lines in the coniguration file .
*/
Use your favourite text editor to edit the following configuration files :
/etc/default / pdnsd
Edit the line with START_DAEMON as follows : START_DAEMON=yes
/etc/pdnsd.conf
In the global stanza you may want to change the following setting : server_ip = 127.0.0.1 ;
This is the ip on which pdnsd can be reached .
If the address is left at the default of 127.0.0.1 , only programs on the server itself can access the pdnsd server .
However , if you want other servers and PCs to use this pdnsd installation as their dns server , then you should change the ip address to the appropriate ip address on your server that you will want your clients to use .
Use the server stanza to set the dns servers that the pdnsd will consult to resolve domain names .
There are two server stanzas which are commented out by default .
The opendns servers are very reliable and popular , you may want to use them : server { label= " opendns " ; ip = 208.67.220.220,208.67.222.222 ; } Make sure the server stanza is not commented out .
If your ISP has a reliable dns server , you may use it instead .
As much as possible , spare the root servers .
/etc/resolv.conf
This file contains the dns servers that programs on your server ( say squid , apache ) will normally consult for name resolution .
Now , you will want to consult the local pdnsd server you have just installed , so you enter the ip address of your loopback interface ( lo ) namely 127.0.0.1 .
This should be the only entry in this file .
127.0.0.1
Tests And Conclusion
Now start you pdnsd server :
/etc/init.d / pdnsd start
Now issue the following command and look out for the Query time : in the response to determine how well you are doing :
dig www.httpcompression.net
; DiG 9.4.2-P2 www.httpcompression.net ;;
Query time : 3323 msec ;; SERVER : 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1 ) ;;
WHEN : Mon Nov 3 20:02:37 2008 ;; MSG SIZE rcvd : 71
After a while , issue the command again :
dig www.httpcompression.net
; DiG 9.4.2-P2 www.httpcompression.net ;;
Query time : 1 msec ;; SERVER : 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1 ) ;;
WHEN : Mon Nov 3 20:03:07 2008 ;; MSG SIZE rcvd : 71
From the two results above , the first query took 3323 msecs whilst the second , 30 seconds later , took only 1 msec to resolve .
Now after a reboot of the server :
dig www.httpcompression.net
;; Query time : 3 msec ;; SERVER : 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1 ) ;;
WHEN : Mon Nov 3 20:06:38 2008 ;; MSG SIZE rcvd : 71
After the reboot the query took only 3 ms to resolve .
We did not loose our cache .
You may want to read the manual and change some settings to suit your situation .
A few of these setting are : Advertisement Advertisement
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama ’s pledge to seek a worldwide ban on weapons in space marks a dramatic shift in U.S. policy while posing the tricky issue of defining whether a satellite can be a weapon .

Moments after Obama ’s inauguration last week , the White House website was updated to include policy statements on a range of issues , including a pledge to restore U.S. leadership on space issues and seek a worldwide ban on weapons that interfere with military and commercial satellites .
It also promised to look at threats to U.S. satellites , contingency plans to keep information flowing from them , and what steps are needed to protect spacecraft against attack .
The issue is being closely watched by Lockheed Martin Corp , Boeing Co , Northrop Grumman Corp , the biggest U.S. defense contractors , and other companies involved in military and civilian space contracts .
Watchdog groups and even some defense officials welcomed the statement , which echoed Obama ’s campaign promises , but said it would take time to hammer out a comprehensive new strategy .
Enacting a global ban on space weapons could prove even harder .
For instance , it was difficult to define exactly what constituted a “ weapon ” because even seemingly harmless weather tracking satellites could be used to slam into and disable other satellites , said two U.S. officials involved in the area who were not authorized to speak publicly .
Michael Krepon , co-founder of the private Henry L. Stimson think tank on space , cited recent reports that the Pentagon was using two smaller satellites launched in 2006 to fly near a dead missile - warning satellite and investigate what happened .
The Defense Support Program satellite , DSP - 23 , built by Northrop , failed on orbit in mid-September .
“ This incident clarified how important it is to have rules of the road for technologies that could have many different applications , ” Krepon said .
“ There are lots of benign reasons to have a closer look at an object in space .
But we all know that when satellites make close passes they could also do things that are not benign . ”
Two years ago , China used a missile to destroy one of its own satellites in a test that raised worries about a new arms race in space .
The incident may have created thousands of pieces of debris .
Last year , the United States also destroyed one of its own satellites , saying its toxic fuel tank could pose a danger if it fell to Earth .
MORE COOPERATION ?
A defense official , who also asked not to be named , said the Obama administration had not yet held briefings for top officials working on military space issues , but it was clear that the focus would shift toward more diplomatic initiatives .
Work on classified projects involving an “ active ” military response to attacks against U.S. satellites might be halted in favor of more monitoring and passive protection measures , he said .
He declined to give any more details .
The Obama administration also faces tough decisions on many multibillion - dollar satellite programs facing cost overruns and schedule delays , particularly at a time when rapid increases in military spending are grinding to a halt .
“ There ’s still a lot of wiggle room ” in the administration ’s statement on military space , said analyst Victoria Samson with the private Center for Defense Information .
“ But just the sheer fact that they are discussing it represents a real shift from the Bush administration . ”
“ It ’s not going to happen immediately , but it seems as though the wheels are in motion to initiate some sort of cooperative measure , ” Samson said .
Another defense official , who asked not to be named , said the new administration would work through the complex military space issues during a defense review to be completed by September , and as part of a space report due in December .
The new policy language used by the Obama administration was “ impossibly broad , ” the official said .
It also failed to acknowledge recent work by U.S. officials on guidelines for space debris and conduct by nations active in space .
Even Obama acknowledged during his election campaign that achieving a global treaty banning weapons in space could be a daunting challenge .
A simpler and quicker solution , he suggested at that time , might be a “ code of conduct for responsible space - faring nations . ”
In response to questions from the Council for a Livable World , Obama said one key element of any such code would be “ a prohibition against harmful interference against satellites . ”

Claiming that inequality is the greatest threat to liberty could easily be misunderstood , yet I proudly and sincerely make that claim .
I do not mean it in the as common as ignorant state socialist kind of way : that everybody should have exactly the same amount of assets .
In essence , such a statement calls for violent and forceful redistribution from the industrious to the lazy , and how such a state of things could ever be called equality is not within my intellectual capacity to understand .
No matter how hard I try , all I see arising from this state socialist utopia is inequality , hierarchy , and power .
What I mean when claiming inequality is the greatest threat to liberty is that we will not see liberty or freedom for as long as people accept the notion that some people are superior to others and also have superior rights .
The threat to liberty is first and foremost a malign state of mind , not a state of society .
In a society where people accept that some " special " people have the right to treat others in a way that nobody else can -- and nobody ever , from a moral point of view , should -- freedom does n't stand a chance .
Only in a society where nobody accepts that some take the right to elevate themselves at the expense of others , where self - proclaimed masters and their designated slaves are denounced and condemned , can the tree of liberty strike root and grow tall .
Equality in the minds of the people is a necessary condition for liberty and freedom ; without equality , there can never be justice , and without justice , there will never be freedom .
The recent wave of unwarranted taserings of innocent people is a great example of why we do not have liberty .
It is not only true that police officers are given the power to use tasers and never have to take responsibility for their use of violent measures on their fellow men and women ( often without reason ! ) ; they are also automatically acquitted in the minds of most people .
The fact that they have a shiny ( but not golden ) badge on their uniform is by most people accepted as a guarantee for " justice " -- and it is a trump card to be used and abused without consequence .
If someone kills another person , he is a murderer .
If someone with a badge kills another person , he is a man of the " law " and has the " right " to do so .
He might even be called a " hero . "
The examples of this kind of thinking are plentiful .
People tend to accept a great number of infractions and violations by the police ( public or secret ) or military ( public or secret ) simply because they are " officers " and have a state " license " to hunt down , abuse , oppress , and -- yes - - slaughter .
Nobody else could do anything like the horrible things these people sometimes do without being prosecuted and publicly condemned by each and every one of us , but as long as you wear a state uniform , everything is just fine .
This kind of inequality exists only in the minds of people .
One might accept that someone licensed by the state can carry a gun , but to abuse and assault innocent people ?
To tase someone for speeding or parking tickets ?
If such behavior is accepted by people in general , there is no reason to expect we are anywhere close to freedom or liberty .
As long as this kind of behavior is accepted , even defended , or simply does not arouse anger among a sufficiently large part of the general public , there is no chance for liberty .
This is why equality is a necessary condition for freedom :
If some people , be they licensed by the government or not , are allowed to act in whatever oppressive and inhumane ways -- if such behavior is accepted or tolerated -- we do not as a people deserve liberty .
And we will not see it .
Liberty has to be defended every day and every minute to survive .
The existence of power means there is inequality , and with inequality there can not be justice .
As long as there is someone who can pretend to be the master and take the right to call someone else his slave , there is no room for liberty .
Equality is necessary for liberty and consequently , inequality is a threat .
Even if only in the minds of people .
Pall Hangs Over Detroit Auto Show
Car companies show off new vehicles , but will anyone be buying ?
Jan. 11 , 2009  --
It 's the unspoken topic of this year 's North American International Auto Show :
How are struggling carmakers going to convince tapped - out consumers that their cars are worth buying ?
" The mood here is a nail - biter , " said Jean Jennings , president and editor - in - chief of Automobile Magazine .
" The only car segment that had growth was small cars and that growth went to nothing the minute gas was under $ 3 a gallon .
Nobody is selling anything right now .
What is the problem ?
It 's a credit problem . "
A credit problem combined with an economic crisis contributed to a 30 percent decline in auto sales last month and a 20 percent decline in sales for 2008 .
" We are looking at sales dropping even further next year , " said Chris Denove , vice president of J.D. Power & Associates .
" Sales could be down to 11 or 12 million units .
You 've got to go back to 1982 before sales were that low , and when you think about it , there were a lot fewer drivers on the road then . "
The Detroit auto show has often been a time for the auto industry to shine and flex its muscles , but with sales so weak , this year will be different .
" This year the vibe is n't going to be that strong .
Its going to be more of a get - back - to - basics , " said Denove .
" It 's going to be about business .
It 's going to be about the cars .
You 're not going to see as many dancing girls and light shows .
Part of this is that Detroit and the automakers want to give the impression that they are being serious , but the reality is they just do n't have a lot of money to spend on the show this year . "
And with U.S. automakers at the mercy of taxpayer bailout funds , the pressure to make cars Americans want is high .
Congress and President - elect Barack Obama are demanding that car companies invest in more fuel - efficient and green technologies .
Not everyone who follows the industry thinks that 's a good idea .
" Government is on the wrong track because they are dictating fuel economy without energy policy , " Jennings said .
" If gas is cheap hybrid vehicles are not going to sell .
And yet they are forcing the car companies to spend billions of dollars in development cost for a technology that might be way ahead of what people want and wo n't intersect . "
Still virtually every car maker at this weekend 's show is delivering new and innovative hybrid vehicles .
Toyota has a newly designed Prius , while Ford is debuting the Fusion Hybrid that gets close to 40 miles per gallon .
Although the theme this year is all about green , there is still something for the car enthusiast .
" You 've got Chevrolet 's new Camero .
You 've got Ford introducing the next - generation Mustang and Dodge with its brand new Challenger , " said Denove .
" All three hark back to the muscle car era of the early ' 70s and this is the first time the consumer is going to have a chance to look at all three vehicles side - by - side . "
“ I ’ve never agreed with psychiatry , ever . ”
“ And I know that psychiatry is a pseudo science . ”
“ There is no such thing as a chemical imbalance . ”
If any of those quotes sound familiar to you , you probably watched ( or later read about ) Matt Lauer ’s awkward interview of Tom Cruise on The Today Show back in 2005 .
That interview was just the cherry on a cake baked with so many ingredients explaining why I ’m not a fan of Tom Cruise ; specifically related to this subject , the whole “ Brooke Shields should n’t be taking antidepressants for postpartum depression ” thing .
I do n’t care if Shields got to have her say , and I do n’t care if Cruise later apologized to her ; I ’m still carrying baggage .
Judging from this morning ’s interview , however , it seems that Lauer and Cruise have made up .
Cruise stated that looking back at the earlier interview , he saw that he “ came across arrogant , ” it was not what he “ intended , ” and he could have “ handled it better . ”
During the interview , Lauer asked Cruise how he emotionally dealt with all the blows the media started delivering to him a few years ago , and Cruise admitted he “ took responsibility for it ” and “ learned a lesson ” about the proper “ time and place ” to talk about his humanitarian issues .
Well , that ’s good .
Cruise clearly still prescribes to Scientology ’s stance on psychiatry , and that ’s totally fine by me .
I ’ll be the first to defend that we ’re all entitled to our own beliefs .
I ’ll also even defend another Cruise quote from the earlier interview : “ The ideal scene is someone not having to take antipsychotic drugs . ”
That is the ideal scene , is n’t it ?
Many people would probably rather manage their various mental health problems ( and physical health problems , for that matter ) without having to reach for the prescription bottle .
But , in this day an age , I think it ’s a bit arrogant ( and ignorant ) to scoff at the successes at managing mental illness so many people have with a combination of medication and lifestyle changes .

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown will today call for the economic crisis to be used to create a “ new global order , ” and a new form of internationalism , a mantra that is becoming all too familiar as globalists exploit the very problem they created to centralize power into fewer hands .
“ In a speech , he will urge countries to avoid “ muddling through as pessimists ” and “ make the necessary adjustment to a better future and setting the new rules for this new global order ” , according to his office , ” reports AFP .
Brown will argue against the risk that the crisis could “ start a retreat from globalisation ” and instead will urge that it be seen as nothing more than “ difficult birth - pangs of a new global order ” .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Bilderberg member Brown has previously called for a “ a new financial architecture for the global age ” , stating that the Bretton Woods system devised after the second world war was out of touch with the new world order .
Brown ’s call for a new global order is one of countless similar statements he and many other top globalists have made in the past .
The “ solution ” being proposed to fix the problem is merely a greater dose of what caused the catastrophe in the first place .
They created the problem of wildly irresponsible fractional reserve banking , the debt bubble and the credit crunch by ceaselessly inflating the money supply and promoting the debt culture .
Now they are going to offer their solution to the crisis – the further centralization of global economic power into fewer hands .
Appointing the former CEO of Goldman Sachs to oversee the bailout and ensure the bankers divvy up the spoils of the greatest stick - up heist in history amongst themselves was not enough for these fascists – they want to go full board and exploit the crisis they caused to advance the stuttering agenda for world government that has been in the works for the best part of 100 years at least .

Using motion and weight sensors , this hi-tech slab gives gamers their BMI readings and encourages them to leave the sofa to take part in virtual step classes , ski-jumping competitions , running groups and yoga sessions .

Mario Kart Wii ( £ 39.99 ) , with its wheel controller and high - speed action has been a triumph while Steven Spielberg made his gaming debut with Boom Blox ( £ 39.99 ) , a Jenga - style family title he made because , he says : " I am a gamer myself , and I really wanted to create a video game that I could play with my kids . "
On the DS , three titles showed the way in which video games are evolving .
Korg DS - 10 ( £ 29.99 ) is a sophisticated piece of software that packed the musical power of a Korg synthesiser into a DS cartridge .

Despite taking a back seat to the touch - screen charms of the DS , in March the PSP was given a shot in the arm courtesy of God of War : Chains of Olympus ( £ 14.99 ) .
The first hand - held version of the excellent gods - bothering console series , Chains of Olympus is an accomplished action adventure that punches above its weight .
Meanwhile , the hand - held market was changed forever when Apple launched its App Store for the iPod Touch and iPhone 3G .
According to Greg Joswiack , vice - president of iPod and iPhone product marketing : " The iPod Touch is the future of gaming .
Our competitors are scrambling . "
From free puzzle titles to costlier versions of big - name games – Super Monkey Ball ( £ 4.99 ) , Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D ( £ 3.49 ) – and part- versions of new releases such as Spore Origins ( £ 3.99 ) , it 's obvious that if 2008 was big for Apple gaming , 2009 will be huge .
The annual battle between Pro-Evo ( PC and all consoles , from £ 29.99 ) and Fifa ( PC and all consoles , from £ 29.99 ) was as closely fought as ever , with supporters in each side cheering on their chosen champions .
And a relatively new rivalry – Rock Band vs Guitar Hero – became more intense with the release of Rock Band 2 ( Xbox 360 , £ 49.99 excluding instruments ) and Guitar Hero : World Tour ( all consoles , £ 149.99 ) , the first Guitar Hero title to feature a full band .
Neither title comes cheap and since both require a considerable amount of floor space , it will be interesting to see how sales of plastic axes and dummy drums continue next year and beyond .

Call of Duty : World at War ( PC and all consoles , from £ 34.99 ) offers another dose of Second World War action , this time based in the Pacific , while the second World of Warcraft expansion pack , Wrath of The Lich King ( PC , Mac , £ 24.99 ) , sold 2.8 million copies within 24 hours , making it the fastest - selling computer game of all time .
Those looking for something different were also well served in the last 12 months .
The most ambitious has to have been Spore ( PC and Mac , £ 39.99 ) , designed by gaming luminary Will Wright , which allows players to create a species , guiding it from single - celled organism to space - travelling civilisation .
Despite heavy - handed digital rights management software , the game is epic in its scale and a delight for armchair megalomaniacs .
Mirror 's Edge ( PC and all consoles , from £ 34.99 ) , a sleek free - running title also released by EA was less well received despite being the first big game dedicated to parkour .
Sony's LittleBigPlanet ( PS3 , £ 44.99 ) was another true original , blending traditional platform elements with a hugely creative design ethos which made this a video game like no other .
Customisable to the nth degree , its hero , Sack Boy , is fast on the way to becoming a gaming icon , despite the game 's delayed launch .
But LBP 's tardiness was nothing compared to the late arrival of Home for the PS3 .
The Beta version of this Second Life - alike social networking hub finally saw the light of day in December .
Whether it can eclipse Linden Lab 's finest remains to be seen but it 's certainly a console first .
" Grand Theft Auto is going to break all records , " said then - senator Barack Obama of the launch of GTA IV ( PC , PS3 , Xbox 360 , from £ 34.99 ) .
" Now , it is n't intended for kids . "
He was n't wrong , on either front .
This year 's stand - out game sold 3.6 million copies on its first day and is unashamedly adult , from the multi-layered story arc to the grim reality of life in America 's cities , the endless violent altercations and the streetwalkers living a life of vice .
Rockstar 's genius lies in making games that are gritty , grown - up , intelligent and every bit as involving as great cinema .
GTA IV is no exception and has exceeded its predecessors in both scope and sophistication .
It 's about as good as gaming gets , but with God of War 3 , Alan Wake , Halo 3 : ODST and BioShock 2 slated for release in 2009 , it could be a very happy new year too .
How to Organize Mental Clutter
Photo by Lucia Holm
Do you ever feel like you have a hundred things to get done and not enough time to do half of them ?
We are all busy people , but sometimes we get so caught up with ‘ catching all the falling plates ’ that we sacrifice doing the things we really want to be doing , the things that align with our desires and contribute most to our personal wellbeing .
We sometimes make the mistake in thinking that we are ‘ super human ’ and will be able to juggle it all with great success .
“ No need to write it down .
I can handle it ! ”
As more tasks get piled on , soon we become bombarded by the thoughts of tasks yet to be completed .
And this added pressure will distract us in ways that are counterproductive to our goals .
Not writing these tasks down is just part of the problem ; even if we wrote it all down , what if several tasks are equally important or dependant on one another ?
How do we prioritize conflicting to - do’s ?
After all , we only have so many hours in a day .
How do we break out of this cycle helplessness caused by an overwhelming number of priorities waiting to get done ?
How can we better manage and execute the activities that matter to us , such that we feel empowered and in control ?
Backgrounds : A Personal Story
The past few months have been a period of adjustment for me , as several changes in my life took place simultaneously – I left my day job , ended a relationship , moved into a new living arrangement , got a second dog , and traveled to remote western China .
Marching through the jungle that has become my house , with the new puppy circling around my feet ( biting everything in sight ) and with many things still packed in boxes , I ca n’t help but to feel a little irritable , unsettling and unwell as I notice all the clutter covering every possible surface .
“ It will take days , if not weeks to get this all sorted out and organized . ”
I would say to myself , each time I ’m reminded that I really should be cleaning and de-cluttering my living space .
What I really want to focus on is my writing , that and potty - training the new dog .
But , I feel conflicted .
On one hand , it ’s tough to focus on writing ( or anything else ) if my environment is cluttered .
On the other hand , since cleaning and organizing will take ‘ forever ’ , I ’d rather spend the time writing first .
And thirdly , I have another list of pending responsibilities and promises that needs to be fulfilled .
As a result , I do a little of everything that tugs at my attention , not getting very much accomplished .
Observing myself , I felt bothered and a little helpless .
Last week , I came to a breaking point , “ I ’ve had it ! ! ” I said to myself , and proceeded to spend the next 3 hours with my nose buried in a notepad , pen scribbling at accelerated speeds – as I collected and re-arranged my thoughts on paper .
As a result , I came up with an organized solution to solve my problem .
I felt instantly relieved and no longer helpless , because now … I had a plan !
Let me share it with you .
A Closer Look
Before diving into the solution which worked for me , let ’s highlight some observations .
1. Behavioral Pattern
In my scenario above , my exterior clutter was preventing me from focusing on my passion .
I felt hesitant to proceed , because I was unsure which to focus on first , they both seemed important to me .
Not making significant progress with either priority left me feeling unbalanced and uneasy .
Another possible scenario of a similar pattern is : the long hours I need to put into work are preventing me from focusing on my health and building an exercise routine .
I feel hesitant to start my exercise routine , because I do n’t feel like I have enough time in the day .
Yet , conflictingly , if I incorporated exercise in my day , I would have more energy and would n’t need as many hours at work .
It is not a matter of procrastination .
It is the mental pressure of knowing that we need to do something which makes us hesitant to proceed , yet failing to proceed prevents us from doing something else that is a priority to us .
We all have different scenarios and things that when left uncompleted make us feel unwell .
Maybe clutter does n’t bother you .
What is it for you ?
What , when left undone , affects your emotional wellbeing ?
2. ‘ Action Alone is Not Enough ’
We may be moving about in the act of living a balanced life , yet we can still feel mentally cluttered .
This is because , when we have many pending to - dos , it is important to dump them out of our heads , and to track them with a system we regularly review .
Planning is more important than just taking blind action .
3. ‘ We ’ll Never Have Enough Time ’
When we ’re busy and engaged in one area of our life , we tend to think that “ we ’ll have time someday ” to do those things that really matter to us .
But someday will never come if we do not consciously plan to integrate those things into our daily life .
It quickly becomes just another excuse to prolong us from doing those things .
“ Conditions are never perfect .
‘ Someday ’ is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you .
If it ’s important to you and you want to do it ‘ eventually ’ ,
just do it and correct the course along the way . ”
~ Tim Ferriss
6 Step Solution to Manage Mental Clutter
Photo : Cindy Loughridge
It was really just a matter of dumping all the information I had lingering in my mental space , and organizing that dumped information in a cohesive fashion .
Here we go !
Step 1 : Brain Dump
List out all the tasks you need to do , which are running through your head right now .
Write the list down ( or type it out ) as it comes to you .
We do n’t need to be complete with this step .
This list just gives us an idea of the types of things that have been bothering us .
The act of writing this list down also serves as a mental relief .
Step 2 : Brainstorm Life Categories
Looking at the above list , come up with a list of categories or life areas that are important to us .
The categories will encapsulate the items from the list and future tasks not yet on the list .
Additionally , if we ignored any of the life areas , we would be left feeling unbalanced or unwell .
For me , the life areas important to me right now are :
Work – sample activities : Writing , emails , interview questions , etc .
– sample activities : Writing , emails , interview questions , etc. Personal Wellbeing – sample activities : meditation , reviewing goals / schedules / plans , reading something inspirational , exercise , etc .
– sample activities : meditation , reviewing goals / schedules / plans , reading something inspirational , exercise , etc . Household – sample activities : cleaning , organizing , training dogs , grocery shopping , paying bills , running errands , etc .
– sample activities : cleaning , organizing , training dogs , grocery shopping , paying bills , running errands , etc. Personal Projects – sample activities : working on my personal blog , sorting travel pictures , learning hobbies ( salsa dancing , language skills ) , budget & financial planning , etc .
Step 3 : Understanding Each Category
For each life area , use a new sheet of paper .
At the top of the page , write “ Life Area : < fill in > “ , where < fill in > is the name of the life area .
“ , where < fill in > is the name of the life area .
Title the first half of the page “ General Tasks “
“ Title the second half of the page “ Pending Task List “
“ In the first section , General Tasks , list in bullet points all the possible activities that would fall into this category .
For example , for my Life Area : Work , some activities include : Answering emails Creating new articles Advertising inquires Site improvement and updates Accounting Reviewing and Setting Monthly Goals
In the second section , Pending Task List , list in bullet points all the current to - do tasks that you can think of that would fall into this category .
Take this opportunity to move the mental reminders out of your head and onto paper .
For example , my Life Area : Work , includes some of the following : Complete interview question for person X
Get back to Y company with the requested Bio and Picture Complete the article on topic Z which I started last week
Do this for each life area from step 2 .
Feel free to use more paper if you run out of room .
Keep the list as visually organized as possible .
The point of this exercise is three fold :
To clear up mental clutter , by moving all the self reminder thoughts onto paper .
It ’s easier to track and manage tasks when it ’s all laid out in front of us .
To see which life area has the most pending to - dos , thus requiring more time and attention .
Step 4 : Budget Time for Each Category
Daily Estimate – Look at your daily habits and schedule , how many hours a day will you have in total to devote to all of these areas ?
Example , my productive day generally goes from 10 am to 8 pm , which gives me 10 hours a day devoted to the life areas .
The remaining 14 hours is for other activities such as sleeping , commuting , eating , watching TV , doing nothing .
– Look at your daily habits and schedule , how many hours a day will you have in total to devote to all of these areas ?
Example , my productive day generally goes from 10 am to 8 pm , which gives me 10 hours a day devoted to the life areas .
The remaining 14 hours is for other activities such as sleeping , commuting , eating , watching TV , doing nothing .
Weekly Estimate – 10 hours x 7 days = 70 hours a week to divide up between the four areas of my life that ’s important to me .
10 hours x 7 days = 70 hours a week to divide up between the four areas of my life that ’s important to me .
Budget Workable Hours – Review each of the life areas and its pending tasks from step 3 .
Estimate how much time to give it , on a weekly basis .
From looking at my own lists , I know that the area of Household has priority , since there ’s a lot that needs to be done and not doing them affects my sense of wellbeing and my work ; thus I should give it more time .
My weekly budget at the moment looks something like this for each of my four life areas : Household – 20 hours Work – 25 hours Personal Projects – 15 hours Personal Wellbeing – 10 hours
– Review each of the life areas and its pending tasks from step 3 .
Estimate how much time to give it , on a weekly basis .
From looking at my own lists , I know that the area of Household has priority , since there ’s a lot that needs to be done and not doing them affects my sense of wellbeing and my work ; thus I should give it more time .
My weekly budget at the moment looks something like this for each of my four life areas : Daily Breakdown – Roughly estimate how many hours a day to give each life area on a daily basis .
It helps to draw out a table , with days of the week along the top row and life area names along the left column .
My estimate looks something like this : Weekdays : Work 5 hours , Household 2 hours , P. Project 2 hours , P.Wellbeing 1 hour .
Weekends : Household 5 hours , P.Project and P.Wellbeing 2 - 3 hours each .
– Roughly estimate how many hours a day to give each life area on a daily basis .
It helps to draw out a table , with days of the week along the top row and life area names along the left column .
My estimate looks something like this :
Step 5 : Doing
As we are going about our day working on each of the life areas , flip to the page for that life area and pick the item under Pending Task List that has the highest priority to do first .
When working on one task .
Focus completely on that task .
If more to - do reminders come to mind , add them instantly into the Pending Task List for the appropriate life area .
Step 6 : Tracking
Refer to your time budget several times throughout the day .
Remember to be flexible .
Nothing is set in stone .
The time budget is there to help us as a guide , not as an unbreakable schedule .
Take note how much time you are spending in each life area , and adjust appropriately .
Remember to be gentle with yourself .
Notice all the improvements you ’ve made and how much better you feel .
As we change , so will our priorities .
Make sure to revisit our time budgets regularly and update time devoted to each of the life areas , as our life situation changes .
What is bothering you right now ?
What are some things that you are putting off , that if you just got them done , will contribute significantly to your state of wellbeing ?
What are some life areas most important to you ?

Meet America 's First Transgender Mayor Stu Rasmussen won election after campaigning in a dress and with implants .
Nov. 8 , 2008  --
The first time Stu Rasmussen was elected mayor of Silverton , Ore. , he wore shirts and pants .
This time around , after a landslide victory , he will be stepping into office donning a dress and makeup .
Rasmussen was recently elected as America 's first transgender mayor .
Rasmussen told " Good Morning America " that the town went through the transition with him .
" Obviously , it was shocking to them , " he said .
" We all kind of went through it together .
It was pretty obvious I was making a change , it had to happen in my head .
They were ready before I was . "
In a world where politicians can catch serious criticism for simply not wearing an American flag lapel pin , Rasmussen knew he was going to face a challenge .
" I think the first courageous act was coming out in the first place , " he said .
" The community was very receptive and accepting , with a few exceptions . "
Though the transgender candidate faced unique problems , his platform was simple .
" My primary platform was low growth , " he said , referring to his support for keeping the town small .
" We had other issues I thought were not being properly addressed . "
Rasmussen said the voters did not focus on his appearance .
" It 's a rural or a community considered more conservative , " he said .
" They judge people on talent and ability rather than their shape . "

Subpoenas issued in US Attorney firings probe : report Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday December 3 , 2008
Print This Email This
The federal prosecutor appointed by Attorney General Michael Mukasey to examine the " haphazard , arbitrary and unprofessional " conduct of his predecessor Alberto Gonzales and others related to the firings of nine US Attorneys has " been meeting with defense lawyers , dispatching subpoenas and seeking information about the events , according to legal sources familiar with the case , " Wednesday 's Washington Post reports .
In September , the Department of Justice 's Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility released a nearly 400 - page report on the US Attorney firings , which found the process was " fundamentally flawed " and placed the blame at the top of the department .
It recommended appointing a special prosecutor to continue its examination , which was hampered by the IG 's inability to issue subpoenas to officials who had left the deparment .
" By naming a federal prosecutor to determine whether crimes have been committed , the attorney general ensured that authorities would have the power to compel testimony and documents , " Carrie Johnson reports for the Post .
" [ Nora R. ]
Dannehy , a longtime assistant U.S. attorney in Connecticut , in recent weeks has met with lawyers and government officials involved in the case .
A grand jury in the District has issued subpoenas , the sources said . "
At TPMMuckraker , Zachary Roth points to an " interesting nugget " in the Post report .
" D. Kyle Sampson , who served as the chief of staff to Gonzales until his March 2007 resignation , recently took a leave from his job as a partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams while the investigation proceeds , " Johnson reported .
" A spokeswoman for the law firm said he is on leave " ' pending admission to the D.C. bar . ' "
Roth notes that the DOJ's Inspector General report " found that Sampson 's testimony was ' not credible ' and ' unpersuasive . ' "

Johnell arrived Friday after his father waved down Suffolk Police Officer Steven Naso .
" The driver was screaming and waving out the window , ' My wife is having a baby , ' " Naso said .
" He was in a panic and obviously in a rush . "
Naso , 33 , delivering his first baby , put down a blanket in the car and positioned the soon - to - be mother across the folded - down seats , Newsday reported Sunday , noting three pushes later and the baby slid into Naso 's hands .
" I was really blessed .
It was such an experience , " said Ross , thanking Naso for his assistance .
Russia is not the Soviet Union , but what is it ?
A recovering world power — or a corrupt oligopoly with a market economy of sorts ?
Arkady Ostrovsky explains why it is both
AFP
ON DECEMBER 25th 1991 the Soviet flag above the Kremlin was lowered for the last time and the last president of the Soviet Union , Mikhail Gorbachev , made his resignation speech .
“ The totalitarian system has been eliminated … free elections … free press , freedom of worship , representative legislatures and a multi-party system have all become reality . ”
A few hours later , America 's then president , George Bush senior , declared victory in the cold war .
“ For over 40 years the United States led the West in the struggle against communism and the threat it posed to our most precious values …
That confrontation is now over .
The United States recognises and welcomes the emergence of a free , independent and democratic Russia . ”
The collapse of the Soviet empire was inevitable , rapid and largely bloodless .
In its aftermath the world watched , with a mixture of hope and despair , the emergence of a new country that turned out a lot less free and democratic than advertised .
Confrontation with America did not disappear but took on a new meaning .
In early August this year the Russian army , for the first time since the Soviet collapse , crossed an internationally recognised border and fought a short , victorious war : with Georgia .
Russia 's leaders said they were defending two breakaway territories , Abkhazia and South Ossetia , from Georgia 's aggression .
But at home they also hinted that this was a proxy war with America which had tried to muscle its way into what Russia calls “ the region of privileged interest ” .
It was a defining moment for Vladimir Putin , Russia 's president until the election in March this year of Dmitry Medvedev and still the man who , from his new job as prime minister , holds the reins of power .
To many , the conflict brought back memories of the cold war and portrayed Russia as a Soviet Union mark two , trying to regain its former territories .
All the signs appear to be in place : Russia is ruled by former KGB men like Mr Putin who see enemies everywhere ; its political opposition is crushed ; independent journalists occasionally get killed ; and the state media pump out anti-American propaganda .
Once again military parades are being held in Red Square .
And in his belligerent state - of - the - nation address on November 5th Mr Medvedev threatened to station short - range missiles in the Kaliningrad region , aiming them at Europe , unless America backed off from its plan to put a missile - defence system into eastern Europe .
But the parallels with the cold war are misleading .
Russia is not the Soviet Union .
It does not have a communist ( or any other ) ideology , nor does it have much faith in central planning .
It has private businesses , a free market of sorts and a great taste for consumption .
Russian firms are listed on foreign stock exchanges .
Their managers fly business class to factories in the Urals , read financial newspapers and labour over spreadsheets on their laptops .
Members of the country 's elite have many personal ties with the West : they own property in London , send their children to British and American universities and hold foreign bank accounts .
But none of this stops the Kremlin from being anti-American and autocratic .
So far the state has not interfered in people 's personal lives .
It gives them freedom to make money , consume , travel abroad , drive foreign cars and listen to any music they like .
They are even free to criticise the Kremlin on radio , in print and on the internet , though not on television .
And although Russia 's elections are stage - managed , the support for Mr Putin is genuine .
During the war in Georgia it hit almost 90 % in opinion polls .
The biased television coverage plays its part , but unlike Soviet propagandists , who told people what to think , Russian propagandists tell people what they want to hear , says Georgy Satarov , who used to be an aide to a former president , Boris Yeltsin , and now runs INDEM , a think - tank .
What people want to hear , especially as they are getting richer , is that their country is “ rising from its knees ” , sticking its flag in the Arctic Circle , winning football games and chasing the Americans out of Georgia .
Mr Putin has positioned himself as the symbol of a resurgent nation recovering from years of humiliation and weakness .
In fact , few Russians in the 1990s brooded on such feelings ; most were too busy getting on with their lives .
But there was one group that had good reason to be aggrieved : members of the former KGB .
When Mr Putin came to power in 2000 , they projected their views onto the whole country .
America 's hawkishness towards Russia made their job easier .
Mr Putin also accurately sensed and cleverly exploited nostalgia for Soviet cultural symbols .
One of the first decrees of his presidency in 2000 was to restore the Soviet national anthem .
Soviet icons were revived not because of their connection with communism but as symbols of stability , continuity and power .
A TV show , “ The Name of Russia ” , based on a British programme , “ 100 Great Britons ” , lists Joseph Stalin as one of the country 's five all - time greats .
Most Russians associate him not with repression and terror but with the power and respect which their country once commanded .
“ Our foreign policy is clear .
It is a policy of preserving peace and strengthening trade relations with all countries …
Those who want peace and seek a business relationship with us will always find our support .
And those who try to attack our country will be dealt a deadly blow , to deter them from sticking their snouts into our Soviet backyard . ”
Stalin made this speech in 1934 , reflecting on a recent world economic crisis which , as he explained , “ spread to credits and liquidity , turning upside down financial and credit relationships between countries …
Amidst this storm … the Soviet Union stands separately , like a rock . ”
Similarly , in reaction to the current economic turmoil , Mr Putin declared the Russian economy to be a “ safe haven ” for foreign capital .
On the other hand , “ the trust in America as the leader of the free world and free economy is blown for ever . ”
A love - hate relationship
The paradox of Russia 's nationalism is that its patriotic zeal closely follows the American model .
One of the biggest pop hits in Russia a few years ago was a song called “ I Was Made in the USSR ” , first performed in 2005 in the Kremlin , in front of Mr Putin .
“ Ukraine and Crimea , Belarus and Moldova — it is my country … Kazakhstan and the Caucasus as well as the Baltics — it is my country … I was born in the Soviet Union ; made in the USSR , ” its lyrics go .
As the audience rose to applaud , it was perhaps unaware that the tune was the same as Bruce Springsteen 's “ Born in the USA ” .
Konstantin Ernst , the boss of Russia 's main TV channel , which churns out nationalistic , anti-American propaganda , worshipped Francis Ford Coppola , an American film - maker .
These days he produces American - style blockbusters on a Russian theme and sells distribution rights in Hollywood .
The loudest anti-Americans in Russia are not the unreformed communists but the well - dressed , English - speaking speechwriters from the perestroika era .
The Kremlin 's confrontation with the West is based not on differences of ideology or economic systems but on the conviction that Russia is no different from America and that the West 's values are no stronger or better than Russia's .
Any public criticism by Western leaders of Russia 's behaviour is therefore seen as deeply hypocritical .
America looms much larger in Russia 's mind than Russia ever did in America's .
To compete with America , Mr Medvedev even scheduled his recent state - of - the - nation address to coincide with the American election .
Russia wants to be like America and follows in its footsteps .
Unfortunately , says one American former official , “ they followed our mistakes and not our system of governance . ”
Russia 's war in Georgia and its unilateral recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia copied the West 's recognition of Kosovo in the Balkans , even though only a few months earlier Mr Putin had said that unilateral recognition of Kosovo was “ immoral and illegitimate ” .
Conversations with Russian officials often end with the plaintive question : “ What have we done that you have n't done ? ”
Igor Shuvalov , the first deputy prime minister and Mr Putin 's right - hand man , was in London ( where his son studies ) when Georgia erupted .
The war showed that Russia and the West are now cemented together , he argues .
“ It showed that all our values are exactly the same .
Russia is a civilised country , we all want to live well , like ordinary Americans , we want to protect ourselves from external threats like you do …Perhaps we do not have such a sophisticated democratic infrastructure , but in essence American presidential elections are no different from ours . ”
The confrontation between Russia and the West is not about different values , he says , but about different interests , financial and geopolitical .
“ Friends are only friends until you start splitting the money .
These [ Western ] countries need to have access to oil and gas , and to get it they are prepared to use any means , including accusations that Russia has a different system of values .
All … Russia is doing is defending its interests .
We want to live peacefully , but the West cannot tolerate the idea that we are an equal partner , that we are the same .
Now there is no more time for niceties . ”
Yet although the Russian elite has adopted a Western lifestyle , it rejects key principles of Western governance .
Lilia Shevtsova of the Carnegie Moscow Centre , a think - tank , argues that “ hostility towards America and the West sustains the authoritarian and corrupt rule of the rent - seeking elite which portrays its narrow corporate interests as the interests of the nation . ”
In Georgia , Russia was defending not so much the separatists but its own ruling class and its value system .
By imitating and repelling America at the same time , Russia tries to ward off a hostile value system that includes democracy and the rule of law .
The Kremlin sees its relationship with the West as a zero - sum game : if it resurges , America will decline .
A long way to go
A few years ago Mr Putin said Russia 's national idea was to be competitive .
The Kremlin asserts that Russia has regained its status of “ a mighty economic power ” .
Its goal is to achieve economic and social development which befits “ a leading world power of the 21st century ” by 2020 .
This special report will draw attention to the many things that stand in its way .
The country is beset by chronic and dangerous weaknesses .
Its economy depends on natural resources and cheap credit , and its private business , which pulled the country out of the 1998 crisis , is constantly being harassed by the state .
Corruption is so pervasive that it has become the rule .
Russia 's population is shrinking by 700,000 a year .
And its neocolonial methods of governance in the north Caucasus have created a tinderbox .
The gap between rich and poor is growing .
Moscow 's exclusive outskirts look like American suburban shopping malls writ large , yet villages not far away lie abandoned .
The rich and powerful are steeped in luxury , yet the average Russian earns a mere $ 700 a month .
Russia is building pipelines to Europe but much of its own country has no gas or even plumbing .
Russia 's “ great leaps forward ” have rarely benefited its own people , who have traditionally been seen as a resource .
Most Russians grumble about their lives , but see “ international prestige ” as a consolation prize .
Russia has the potential to develop into a strong and prosperous nation , but the Kremlin 's nationalism , hostility towards the West and authoritarianism make the task more difficult .
A two - minute video made by a Russian soldier captured in Georgia ( now on YouTube ) illustrates the point .
As they smash up neat Georgian barracks , the Russians curse their own poverty and hail their victory in the same breath .
“ They [ the Georgians ] had everything , ” one Russian soldier says .
“ They had nice barracks , good furniture , and we live like tramps .
But they got screwed . ”

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican police on Sunday found nine decapitated bodies and the army identified eight soldiers who had died fighting powerful drug gangs and whose murders were seen as a brazen challenge to the government .
The bodies showed signs of torture .
They were left on the side of a highway about an hour north of the tourist resort of Acapulco in the southern state of Guerrero , state police said .
Their heads were stuffed in a plastic bag and left outside a shopping center .
Mexico ’s President Feline Calderon has deployed tens of thousands of troops and police since 2006 to take on drug cartels .
The defense ministry vowed not to back down despite its latest losses .
“ They are trying to scare the military .
Regardless , the ministry promises to continue fighting , ” it said in a statement .
The ministry released the names of eight decapitated soldiers but said one of them was recovered on December 9 .
Drug killings throughout Mexico have more than doubled to over 5,300 this year , scaring off investment and tourists .
The United States has sent hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to help its southern neighbor fight the cartels .
The Mexican army has made some prominent captures , but the cartels seem able to quickly replace their losses .
Meanwhile , a growing number of police have been gruesomely murdered .
A note left with the severed heads warned of more decapitations , the state police said .
The last time his parents saw Liao Mengjun alive , he was heading to school to pick up his junior high school diploma .
A few hours later , they were called to the morgue .
They found that their lanky 15 - year - old son ’s forehead had been bashed in .
His right knee jutted through the skin .
Both his arms had been broken .
He had several stab wounds , internal injuries and a swollen foot .
His index finger was slashed , suggesting his tormentors had tried to make him write something in his own blood .
As if things could be worse , writer Liao Zusheng and his wife , Chen Guoying , concluded that they knew who had killed their son : his teachers .
And they believed they knew why : because of their bitter , public complaints about unauthorized fees and systemic corruption in schools and across Chinese society .

Corruption is an everyday experience for millions of Chinese that taints not just schools , but relations in business , on farms and in factories , and potentially any contact citizens have with officialdom .
Foshan appears no more corrupt than any other city in China , experts say .
It is noteworthy only as an example of a pervasive problem that threatens China ’s stability and political system .
Senior Communist Party officials know that decades of remarkable economic progress are at risk if graft and bribery stretch the chasm between the haves and have - nots too wide .
But they have limited room to maneuver .
Any meaningful effort to crack down endangers the party ’s monopoly on power .
The system depends on legions of police , local party and government officials to enforce Beijing ’s policies and quash dissent .
All too often , critics say , local officials regard their position as a license to steal .
Throughout the country , the prodigious rate of economic growth has created a gold rush mentality .
Absent both the strictures and the social safety network of Mao Tse - tung ’s rigid system , millions of people are seeking ways to prosper -- legally or illegally .

Corruption accounts for an estimated 3 % to 15 % of a $ 7 - trillion economy , and party membership can be an invitation to solicit bribes or cut illegal land deals .
Membership hit 74 million at the end of 2007 , a 10 % jump from 2002 , as moneymaking opportunities increasingly trumped ideology .
Nearly 5,000 officials at the county level or above were punished for corruption over the last year , state media reported Friday .
“ Of course everyone hates corruption , ” said Qiao Zhanxiang , a Beijing lawyer who took on the Ministry of Railways for alleged price gouging and lost .
“ But everyone also wants to be a part of it . ”
The result is a growing divide between those who benefit from corruption and their victims .
It is at the grass - roots level where this chasm is most harshly felt , among those abused by the system , like Liao and Chen , or others who have simply been left behind .

“ Common Chinese people are in hell , ” said Ai Xiaoming , a documentary film producer and professor at Zhongshan University in the neighboring city of Guangzhou .
“ Hell is not some future .
It ’s right now . ”
Foshan
Foshan , or “ Buddha Mountain , ” is the ancestral home of martial arts star Bruce Lee , the place where severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS , was first observed , and the source of some of the worst air pollution in the Pearl River delta industrial heartland .
Factories produce ceramics , furniture , toys and household appliances , including items sold by Wal - Mart , Kmart , Avon and Home Depot .
Advertisement
But if you spend time in Foshan , a city of 5.9 million residents and 2.3 million migrant workers , you find it ’s also a place where bridges and houses collapse ; where half - finished skyscrapers sit empty and tilting dangerously .
It ’s a place where counterfeit currency shows up in ATMs and pay packets .
It ’s a place where factory workers from inland provinces can be shaken down , beaten -- and allegedly sometimes even killed by brutal auxiliary police .
It ’s a place where a cash - stuffed “ red envelope ” can ensure that doctors do their best in the operating room , or that you ’ll pass your driving test even if you never leave the parking lot .
Advertisement
In China , it ’s also unremarkable , said Ren Jianming , vice director of the Clean Government Research Center at Beijing ’s Qinghua University : “ What you observed in Foshan can be seen to a certain extent everywhere . ”
To play -- or not
Liao , a former soldier and a longtime Communist Party member , and his wife say officials at Huangqi Middle School turned against them after he spoke out against a $ 3,900 “ selection fee ” the school tried to charge without a receipt .
He also posted several essays on the Internet on corruption and waste in China .

Frustrated by what they said was systemic police harassment and stonewalling , including refusal to release their son ’s autopsy report , Chen and Liao decided to investigate the death themselves .
They said the information they gathered before witnesses were intimidated by police convinced them that the dean of Mengjun ’s class , two teachers and a guard attacked him that evening two years ago .
It is difficult to verify the parents ’ account because witnesses often stay quiet for fear of reprisals .
There is no independent police , courts or media .
Foshan ’s propaganda ministry said Mengjun was caught stealing , attacked his teachers and committed suicide .
Police and the head of a government team dealing with the case declined to comment .
One of the teachers , Liang Xibo , said he was in his office that day but did n’t see or hear anything .

But local officials offered the couple large amounts of money to end their quest for justice .
First it was $ 20,000 .
Then $ 50,000 , if they destroyed all the evidence and stopped talking about the case .
Finally , it rose to $ 70,000 , several years ’ income for the family .
They also urged Chen , 42 , and Liao , 38 , to have a “ replacement ” child under China ’s strict one - child policy to “ ease their grief . ”
Liao is n’t interested .
“ It ’s blood money , ” he said .
But many others decide early on to play the game .

Like most parents , Lily , a 40 - something Foshan stay - at - home mother , wanted the best for her only son -- and that meant giving bribes .
Sipping a cup of tea , Lily explained that bribery is something of an art form and described how she went about it :
Nine years ago , when her son was ready for primary school , she found a friend who knew a senior local education official .
Lily , who asked that her family name not be used , went to the man ’s office with about $ 370 , did n’t say much and left the money .
Her son was accepted .
A couple of years ago , he was ready for junior high school , but did n’t do well on his entrance exams .
Several friends were enlisted to wine and dine key people , she said , seeding the ground for her to distribute $ 1,200 among education officials and make a $ 1,600 “ donation ” to the institution .
Recently , Lily ’s son entered senior high school .
Despite spending thousands of dollars on gratuities , her connections were n’t strong enough and she had to settle for a less prestigious school .
Advertisement
Lily said she still considers it money well spent , even though any parent knows that getting in is only the first step .
Families face unauthorized demands for book , uniform and lunch “ fees . ”
With all sides complicit , most go unchecked , including the pressure to deliver red envelopes , particularly to teachers whose subjects feature prominently on college entrance exams .
“ If there are 50 students and 40 give gifts , you definitely do n’t try very hard with the other 10 , ” said one education industry official , who is also a parent .
“ Unfortunately , that ’s our system . ”
‘ Numb ’
Tao Jun says he has seen the same process play out in a new arena of wealth and opportunity : private business .

Executives say government and party officials demand payments and abuse their power to award contracts or issue permits .
Companies that lowball or otherwise anger officials learn quickly that the most routine inspection can turn into a nightmare .
“ Even if you lease a building for 50 years , they can take it back tomorrow , ” said one Foshan businesswoman , who like others interviewed declined to be identified or discuss details for fear of repercussions .
Though cash is straightforward , executives said gifts of department store and restaurant vouchers are more difficult to trace , as are artwork and stock , paid “ study ” trips , prostitutes or paying overseas tuition for officials ’ children .
High tax rates exert further pressure , said Tao , an activist who once worked as a general manager of an Internet company in Foshan .
The company handed out $ 140 in bribes each month to avoid $ 1,400 in taxes , he recalled .
Advertisement
“ I know because I signed the vouchers , ” Tao said .
“ It ’s hard to be a good person in China .
The system makes you numb to what ’s right and wrong . ”
Companies bribe each other , passing on the cost to customers , and use payoffs to cut corners , accelerate growth or box out competitors .
Occasionally , scandals become public , suggesting how much money is at stake .
In one high - profile case here in recent years , industrialist Feng Mingchang was implicated in a $ 1.2 - billion loan scandal in which he reportedly bribed 223 bankers and government officials .
He was sentenced to life in prison , and one of his bankers received the death penalty .
But sometimes , business executives can turn the tables on corrupt officials .

Lin Ze , a law professor at the Central Party School in Beijing , said businessmen would treat officials to lavish meals , foot massages , saunas and other entertainment , and secretly tape it .
“ Then once you do n’t do things according to their plan , they turn you in . ”
‘ Corruption tour ’
In Lichong , a village incorporated into greater Foshan , residents lead a visitor on what they call a “ corruption tour . ”
They point out a five - story pink - and - white mansion .
And a two - story house nestled behind a large gate .
And a villa with closed - circuit cameras and palm trees in a gated community .
And a couple of prominent businesses .
Advertisement
All of those , they say , belong to local Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanxi , whose official salary they estimate at $ 450 a month .
Chen Liujuan , a member of the village ’s party committee , has three houses and one commercial property , they say .
One of them is a three - story residence with Greek columns and cascading terraces .
In the Communist - run nation , land still is collectively owned , with proceeds going to village coffers .
In practice , however , officials and their inner circle have enormous opportunities to enrich themselves .
The Lichong officials declined to respond to accusations of corruption .
And as in so many other corners of China , a lack of public records makes verification of villagers ’ claims difficult .
But although it ’s illegal for them to make copies , some residents report having seen party records .
Documents seen by The Times show an internal party investigation into the alleged diversion of funds involving dubious accounts by Lichong officials .
Advertisement
Villagers say they doubt that much of anything can check the power of their local officials .
In almost any showdown , here or elsewhere in China , police will support local authorities , in part because a riot could weaken the party ’s political position .
“ Even if the central government wanted to see justice carried out at the village level , it is afraid of losing the support of local officials , ” said Tang Jingling , an activist based in Guangzhou .
“ They need them to control society since they ’re scared to death of any sort of unrest .
And to do that , they must let them run their fiefdoms . ”
In the past , officials have acknowledged that many land protests turn violent .
A survey last year of 90 cities found that 22 % to 80 % of new land projects were illegal , according to the official New China News Agency .
In Lichong , villagers say , the gold rush began in 1988 , when officials built seven porcelain factories .
They promised jobs to displaced farmers , but the factories lost money , were stripped of value and were sold back to the government .

As Foshan has expanded , the value of land has skyrocketed .
By law , the proceeds should be distributed among Lichong ’s 2,300 resident - shareholders .
The main cooperative project is a complex of apartment buildings up to 23 stories high near a planned subway stop that will link the area with Guangzhou .
Villagers say their share of the profits was arbitrarily cut to about 35 % .
Even then , they should be doing well .
But local party officials say the cooperative is almost broke and give them each no more than $ 107 a month .
Later it became clear where at least some of the money had gone .
Officials had deposited more than $ 1.5 million in a postal bank , pocketing portions of the interest and principal .
However , the bank allegedly operated a Ponzi scheme that siphoned off as much as $ 240 million .
Farmers have fought back in several villages .
They say several of their leaders have been beaten and imprisoned on trumped - up charges .
One farmer from nearby Sanshan died in custody .
A few continue to work the land among the factories , bulldozers and housing projects .

Chen Qixi , 38 , raises ducks on a few acres of flooded land beneath an elevated highway .
As he tended his flock recently , unemployed villagers looked on .
Chen Rutian , 65 , said his ancestors had worked this land for 23 generations .
“ We ’ve seen emperors come and go , ” he said .
“ Now these local officials are driving us off a cliff . ”
Old age
Bare feet , shabby clothing and communal cooking pots sully the marble floors , chandeliers and wood paneling of the five - story office building in Foshan ’s Xiantang village .
According to Chinese tradition , old age should be a time of respect and security .
But in an act of defiance , dozens of neighbors , most of them elderly , stormed the building in July 2007 .
Advertisement
Their anger was sparked by a demand that they move their shops from land they collectively own to a private market where they would have to pay rent .
The new market was part of a five - story condo development on land the village of 3,700 people had recently sold to a developer .
At the same time , villagers say officials dole out just $ 8 a month to most residents , an amount that has remained constant since the early 1980s .
“ I want to get my money back , ” said toothless , 91 - year - old Cui Neng .
Other protesters guarded 11 boxes of documents bound with tape and locked in a disabled van near a picture of Mao .
The boxes contain evidence , they believe , that officials embezzled more than $ 5 million over the last decade .
Advertisement
It ’s illegal for them to examine the documents , they said , so they wait and hope that the central government will send someone to investigate .
This past July , a year after the protest started , village elections were held .
But villagers said the new party leader just bought the position from his predecessor .
For months , tattered red protest banners fluttered listlessly outside the village hall .
One read : “ Officials should go and collect pig manure if they wo n’t work for the people . ”
Though the banners have come down , the protest continues .
Some say it ’s the longest sustained act of civil disobedience in the history of Communist China .

var M1 = $ M ( [ [ 1,7,3 ] , [ 9,4,0 ] , [ 2,7,1 ] ] ) ; var M2 = $ M ( [ [ 6,2,8 ] , [ 9,1,3 ] , [ 0,7,6 ] ] ) ; var M = M1. x ( M2 ) ; // M is the matrix // 69 30 47 // 90 22 84 // 75 18 43

IN no time flat after Suns owner Robert Sarver excused Mike D’Antoni from the final two years of his contract to sign with the Knicks , he sold his Scottsdale home and all its contents for a princely profit to the second prospective buyer ( rolling in cash ) who walked through the door .
He could n’t wait to skate .
“ Break - ups are hard to handle , ” the Knicks coach said earlier this week , releasing a sad groan .
I would n’t know , I replied , facetiousness he failed to follow .
“ You need to get out of your house more often , ” he jabbed .

Without any prompting D’Antoni has agreed to discuss what went wrong at the end of his almost unflawed six - year relationship with the Suns , as well as his frame of mind regarding Monday night ’s return to a hot spot where he enjoyed so much success , everything but win a title .
“ It really burned that we had four straight years of competing at the highest level , yet , in the end , ( management ’s ) attitude was like we did n’t win a championship so we did n’t do nothing , ” declared D’Antoni , whose teams during that stretch averaged 58 victories .
“ That really burned me more than anything ! ”

When did you know you were n’t being fully appreciated by ownership or GM Steve Kerr or the fans , I wondered ?
Was there a certain instance that you recognized it was time to get out of Dodge ?
“ Things began to unravel toward the completion of the opening round against the Spurs , ” D’Antoni said , still grieving the Game 1 loss .
“ Had we won , it would ’ve changed the complexion of the series .
But five or six minutes to go they hit a killer 3 when someone did n’t switch out and then [ Tim ] Duncan hit that unbelievable three , his first of the season , I believe , to put it into overtime
Then we get crushed in [ the ] second game . ”
Next thing you know , D’Antoni was being criticized from within for the first time and he admittedly was feeling the pressure .
“ At that point it kinda got out in the papers that an internal difference of opinion and philosophies existed concerning defense and discipline .
Between Games 3 and 4 I started to think seriously it was over .
I was not definitive about leaving .
But after we got knocked out I reassessed everything and felt it would be fair to no one to try to put it back together again . ”
Particularly because there was at least one major condition attached to remaining “ in charge . ”
Though it ’s true Sarver gave D’Antoni the option to stay ( after giving him permission to interview for the Bulls and Knicks ) it was clear management wanted more of a commitment defensively should he continue .
That almost surely would have meant having to add a defensive coach to his staff .
Head coaches , especially one who recorded 232 triumphs in four seasons and another 26 in the playoffs , take solemn exception to being told anything , much less how to run their fiefdom .
D’Antoni felt he sufficiently focused on defense .
He preached , practiced and presented concepts on film to his middle - of - the - pack team and tried to conserve players ’ energy for crunch time when stops counted most .
“ I ’m a head coach , ” D’Antoni said defiantly .
“ I ’m neither an offensive nor a defensive coach .
I ’m a basketball coach .
Maybe I should go to a seminar .
But I think I know how to guard a guy .
How do I get a player to guard a guy ?
Well , that ’s harder to do . ”
Sarver and Kerr also thought D’Antoni was too lenient .
They wanted him to crack down on players for breaking rules .
“ I told them we ’re too far along , we ’re not going to change their personalities .
As long as they apologized I treated them like men . ” he said .
“ Guys would occasionally be late for something , or they ’d get upset about whatever , but it never became a big problem .
Then , it comes out I did n’t punish a player for doing something in 2005 , or I did n’t fine a guy for doing something in 2006 .
Come on , that ’s weak .
That stuff was thrown out there simply to try to justify their position .
“ I ’ve been on teams with a problem .
The Suns were never a problem , ” D’Antoni said with emphasis .
“ There were nuisances .
Players had quirks .
Some guys might not have liked their role , might not have liked playing second fiddle , might not have been happy campers all the time .
But , you know what , you win and it all goes away .
“ Management had a different philosophy .
I wanted to tweak things .
If you ’re going to make me change this and change that the players would ’ve caught on and said , ‘ Who ’s in charge ?
Who ’s really coaching the team ? ’
At that point , the determining factor was , am I in position to do a good job ?
I was too close to the players to go into something that did n’t work .
I definitively did n’t want to put anybody in that position . ”
In closing , D’Antoni defends the Feb. 28 decision to trade Shawn Marion for Shaquille O’Neal .
“ We had gotten stale the way we were .
I felt the best way to win a title was to do what we did .
And I ’d do it again , ” he said .
“ I know Shaq ’s presence changed our style .
But we needed a defensive presence to match up with Duncan , and we needed more second chances .
Shaq provides both elements .
I would n’t have done it if Steve ( Nash ) was n’t on board .
Who knows , maybe I convinced him .
Maybe he convinced me .
I thought about it a week and said , ‘ Yeah , let ’s do it . ’
Shaq gave us the best chance to win .
I still believe it and I still believe we did everything possible to make it work . ”
Then again , after repeatedly sticking to that story throughout most of two interviews , D’Antoni abruptly went the other way on me .
“ Had Shawn ’s contract not become an issue , I would not have done it .
You cannot tell a player he ’s not as good as he thinks he is ( Kerr ’s message the first time the new and naive GM met Shawn to negotiate an extension ) and expect no carryover of negative feelings .
We needed Shawn 110 percent .
That ’s where the unhappiness started .
“ Shawn deserves blame , too .
He was in a great situation and earning a great salary .
At some point you ’ve to understand what a great life you have .
On the other hand , you ’ve got to make him feel important .
That ’s when we got stale .
If he were happy , we would n’t have gotten Shaq .
We had a great style and players who were perfectly compatible with it . ”

Why Mr. McCain would want to pander to right - wing activists  who helped George W. Bush kill off his candidacy in the 2000 primaries in a particularly ugly way  is baffling .
Frankly , they have no place to go .
Mr. McCain would have a lot more success demonstrating his independence , and his courage , if he stood up to them the way he did in 2000 .
As far as we can tell , Mr. McCain and his aides did almost no due diligence before choosing Ms. Palin , raising serious questions about his management skills .
The fact that Ms. Palin ’s 17 - year - old daughter is pregnant is irrelevant to her candidacy .
There are , however , very serious questions about her political past and her ideology , including her links to a party advocating Alaska ’s secession from the nation .
If Mr. McCain wanted to break with his party ’s past and choose the Republicans ’ first female presidential candidate , there are a number of politicians out there with far greater experience and stature than Ms. Palin , who has been in Alaska ’s Statehouse for less than two years .
Before she was elected governor , she was mayor of a tiny Anchorage suburb , where her greatest accomplishment was raising the sales tax to build a hockey rink .
According to Time magazine , she also sought to have books banned from the local library and threatened to fire the librarian .
For Mr. McCain to go on claiming that Mr. Obama has too little experience to be president after almost four years in the United States Senate is laughable now that he has announced that someone with no national or foreign policy experience is qualified to replace him , if necessary .
With the median price of Southern California homes down more than 40 % from its peak , the housing market has now slid further than most economists expected .
The median sales price for homes in the region fell to $ 300,000 in October , a level not seen since 2003 and a 41 % drop from the peak price set in the spring and summer of 2007 , according to San Diego - based MDA DataQuick .
Los Angeles County ’s median home sales price was $ 355,000 , down 29 % from a year ago .
Prices were dragged down by the large number of foreclosed homes on the market .
For the first time since the slump began , repossessed properties in October accounted for more than half of residences sold .

Low prices did drive sales up 56 % from a year ago .
But a market bottom remains elusive , and a rebound in prices is not on the horizon .
Unemployment is rising and consumer spending has slowed , adding another dimension to the crisis and making it even harder to find a light at the end of the tunnel .
Just a year ago , several market analysts interviewed by The Times predicted that Southern California home prices would drop 15 % to 25 % from their peak .
It took only until July for the median price to fall 25 % below its 2007 peak of $ 505,000 , and it has kept falling since .

Barring a dramatic economic reversal , the median sales price is on track to slip below $ 300,000 when November sales are calculated next month .
Thomas Davidoff , a UC Berkeley economist , said he and others underestimated the drop in value because it was tougher a year ago to know just how many people had mortgaged their homes for more than they could really afford .
Those earlier forecasts proved off because “ it was hard for people to get their arms around just how bad lending standards had gotten , ” Davidoff said .
During the real estate bubble , banks and brokers offered mortgages that required little or no money down , minimal proof of income and “ teaser ” mortgage rates that lowered initial monthly payments but later jumped to a much higher rate .

Last year , it was unclear how many of those loans would default .
But much of that mystery has been solved by now , as massive numbers of homes have been repossessed .
In October 2007 , 16 % of the homes sold in Southern California had been foreclosed , compared with 51 % last month .
Mounting foreclosures flooded the market with discounted repossessed homes , further depressing home values .
The ripple effect from that put even more homeowners underwater -- owing more on their homes than they were worth -- and led to more foreclosures .
Now , “ we ’re probably seeing an over - correction ” in the most depressed inland areas , Davidoff said .
In communities overrun by foreclosures , “ you could n’t build a house for less than what [ existing homes ] are selling for , ” he said .

Christopher Thornberg , principal of Los Angeles consulting firm Beacon Economics , is among those who predicted a 25 % price decline last November , making him one of the more bearish forecasters at the time .
By March , he was estimating a 40 % decline .
Now he predicts that prices will keep dropping throughout 2009 , until they ’ve fallen 55 % from their peak .
Owners of higher - priced homes may put off selling during the early phases of a downturn , causing more expensive homes to decline in value at a slower rate .
But eventually many high - end owners have to sell at prices well below peak levels , Thornberg said .
Last month ’s Case - Shiller Home Price Index , which tracks home sales by price tiers , showed that Los Angeles - area homes priced in the bottom third of the market had fallen 42 % from their peak prices by late last summer -- but those in the top third had dropped 21 % .
In Southern California , Orange County posted the smallest price decline , with October prices 27 % below a year ago .
San Bernardino County ’s 39 % decline in October from October 2007 was the largest price decline , MDA DataQuick reported .

Nationwide , the National Assn. of Realtors reported Tuesday that home sales prices fell in 80 % of U.S. metropolitan areas in the third quarter .
Foreclosures accounted for 35 % to 40 % of homes sold in the quarter .
The National Assn. of Home Builders also reported Tuesday that its index of builder confidence hit its lowest level since its 1985 creation .
The index is based on a survey of builders ’ views on sales conditions for new homes .

Here ’s how you might create a messagebox ( image in previous post ) :
@mb = RubyCurses :: MessageBox.new do title " Color selector " message " Choose a color " type : custom buttons % w[red green blue yellow ] underlines [ 0,0,0,0 ] end
If you want one with an input box :
message " Enter your name " type : input default_value " rahul "
This will give an OK and Cancel button .
There are other types for OK , Yes / No , Yes / No / Cancel etc .
The “ underline ” property will underline the given index in the name .
Since ncurses underline does not work on my terminal ( Highline does ) , I ’ve changed the color .
The normal key as well as Alt / Meta key is used as a hotkey .
For input dialog boxes , the normal key will be processed by the edit box so the meta key was required .
Creating a form and fields :
@form = Form.new @win r = 1 ; c = 22 ; %w [ name age company ] . each do |w| field =
Field.new @form do name w row r col c display_length 30 set_buffer " abcd # {w} " set_label Label.new @form , {' text ' => w} end r += 1 end
A form takes a window parameter , and manages painting and navigation of its focusable fields .
We ’ve also tied in a label with the field , so it can put a default location for it .
All all properties of a field can be modified at any time .
The given name parameter can be used to recall them .
@form.by_name [ " age " ].display_length = 3 @form.by_name [ " age " ]. maxlen = 3 @form.by_name [ " age " ] . set_buffer " 24 " @form.by_name [ " age " ].chars_allowed = /\d/ @form.by_name[ " name " ] . set_buffer " Not focusable " @form.by_name [ " name " ].set_focusable( false ) @form.by_name [ " company " ].type ( : ALPHA )
Defining variable fields and tying them to widgets
$ results = Variable.new $ results.value = " A variable " var = RubyCurses :: Label.new @form , {'text_variable ' => $ results , " row " => r , " col " => 22}
This label changes whenever the value of result is changed .
Events
The form and fields have events such as ENTER and LEAVE .
@form.bind(: ENTER ) { |f| f.label.bgcolor = $ promptcolor } @form.bind ( : LEAVE ) { |f| f.label.bgcolor = $ datacolor }
Buttons
Notable is the text and command .
ok_button = Button .new @form do text " OK " name " OK " row 18 col 22 end ok_button .
command { | form| $ results.value = " OK PRESS :" ;form.printstr(@window , 23,45 , " OK CALLED " ) }
The name property of widgets is only for recalling them by name .
Radio Buttons
Here we create a label ( using a hash , instead of the DSL way for a change ) .
Radio buttons are tied together by a Variable .
On selection , the variable contains the value .
Label.new @form , {' text ' =>
" Select a language : " , " row " => 20 , " col " => 22} $ radio = Variable.new radio1 = RadioButton.new @form do text_variable $ radio text " ruby " value " ruby " row 21 col 22 end radio2 = RadioButton.new @form do text_variable $ radio text " java " value " java " row 22 col 22 end
Listboxes
Do n’t flee out of boredom .
Just a minute more !
I create an array , and then set it in the listbox call .
At a later point , i insert some more data into offset 5 . Data may be deleted or inserted externally .
mylist = [ ] 0.upto( 100 ) { |v| mylist << " #{v} scrollable data " } field = Listbox .new @form do name " mylist " row r col 1 width 40 height 10 list mylist end field .
insert 5 , " hello ruby " , " so long python " , " farewell java " , " RIP . Net "
Checkboxes
I have lazily tied the box to the same Variable , you need n’t .
checkbutton = CheckBox.new @form do text_variable $ results #value = true onvalue " selected cb " offvalue " UNselected cb " text " Please click me " row 17 col 22 end
Now those configuration screens should be easier to build .
Multi-line fields
texta = TextArea.new @form do name " mytext " row 1 col 52 width 40 height 20 end texta << " hello there " << " we are testing deletes in this application " texta << " HELLO there " << " WE ARE testing deletes in this application "
Menubars , menuitems
Since my pickaxe had no samples of Tk Menu ’s , I pulled out my old Java Swing book from my attic , and implemented menus the way those fellers do .
@mb = RubyCurses :: MenuBar.new filemenu = RubyCurses :: Menu.new " File " filemenu.add( item = RubyCurses:: MenuItem.new ( " Open " , 'O ' ) ) item.command(@form ) { | form| form.printstr(@window , 23,45 , " Open CALLED " ) ; } filemenu.insert_separator 1 item.accelerator = " Ctrl - X "
Now to post pictures of the screen .
Its not well presented , since i’ve been busy creating widgets , but still …
Being a good Samaritan in California just got a little riskier .
The California Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a young woman who pulled a co-worker from a crashed vehicle is n’t immune from civil liability because the care she rendered was n’t medical .
The divided high court appeared to signal that rescue efforts are the responsibility of trained professionals .
It was also thought to be the first ruling by the court that someone who intervened in an accident in good faith could be sued .
Lisa Torti of Northridge allegedly worsened the injuries suffered by Alexandra Van Horn by yanking her “ like a rag doll ” from the wrecked car on Topanga Canyon Boulevard .
Advertisement
Torti now faces possible liability for injuries suffered by Van Horn , a fellow department store cosmetician who was rendered a paraplegic in the accident that ended a night of Halloween revelry in 2004 .
But in a sharp dissent , three of the seven justices said that by making a distinction between medical care and emergency response , the court was placing “ an arbitrary and unreasonable limitation ” on protections for those trying to help .
In 1980 , the Legislature enacted the Health and Safety Code , which provides that “ no person who in good faith , and not for compensation , renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency shall be liable for any civil damages resulting from any act or omission . ”
Although that passage does not use the word “ medical ” in describing the protected emergency care , it was included in the section of the code that deals with emergency medical services .
By placing it there , lawmakers intended to shield “ only those persons who in good faith render emergency medical care at the scene of a medical emergency , ” Justice Carlos R. Moreno wrote for the majority .
Advertisement
The high court cited no previous cases involving good Samaritan actions deemed unprotected by the state code , suggesting the challenge of Torti ’s rescue effort was the first to narrow the scope of the law .
The three dissenting justices argued , however , that the aim of the legislation was clearly “ to encourage persons not to pass by those in need of emergency help , but to show compassion and render the necessary aid . ”
Justice Marvin R. Baxter said the ruling was “ illogical ” because it recognizes legal immunity for nonprofessionals administering medical care while denying it for potentially life - saving actions like saving a person from drowning or carrying an injured hiker to safety .
“ One who dives into swirling waters to retrieve a drowning swimmer can be sued for incidental injury he or she causes while bringing the victim to shore , but is immune for harm he or she produces while thereafter trying to revive the victim , ” Baxter wrote for the dissenters .
“ Here , the result is that defendant Torti has no immunity for her bravery in pulling her injured friend from a crashed vehicle , even if she reasonably believed it might be about to explode . ”
Advertisement
Both opinions have merit , “ but I think the majority has better arguments , ” said Michael Shapiro , professor of constitutional and bioethics law at USC .
Shapiro said the majority was correct in interpreting that the Legislature meant to shield doctors and other healthcare professionals from being sued for injuries they cause despite acting with “ reasonable care , ” as the law requires .
Noting that he would be reluctant himself to step in to aid a crash victim with potential spinal injuries , Shapiro said the court ’s message was that emergency care “ should be left to medical professionals . ”
Torti ’s liability has yet to be determined in court , and if the Legislature is unhappy with any judgment arising from the immunity denial , it can revise the code , he concluded .

Torti , Van Horn and three other co-workers from a San Fernando Valley department store had gone out to a bar on Halloween for a night of drinking and dancing , departing in two cars at 1:30 a.m. , the justices noted as background .
Van Horn was a front - seat passenger in a vehicle driven by Anthony Glen Watson , whom she also sued , and Torti rode in the second car .
After Watson ’s car crashed into a light pole at about 45 mph , the rear car pulled off the road and driver Dion Ofoegbu and Torti rushed to help Watson ’s two passengers escape the wreckage .
Torti testified in a deposition that she saw smoke and liquid coming from Watson ’s vehicle and feared the car was about to catch fire .
None of the others reported seeing signs of an imminent explosion , and Van Horn said in her deposition that Torti grabbed her arm and yanked her out “ like a rag doll . ”
Van Horn ’s suit alleges negligence by Torti in aggravating a vertebrae injury suffered in the crash , causing permanent damage to the spinal cord .
Advertisement
Neither Torti nor her attorney , Ronald D. Kent , could be reached immediately .
Kent ’s Los Angeles law office said he was in meetings on the East Coast and may not have seen the decision .
Van Horn ’s attorney , Robert B. Hutchinson , disputed the notion that the ruling could have a chilling effect on laymen coming to the rescue of the injured .
Good Samaritan laws have been on the books for centuries and state that “ if a person volunteers to act , he or she must act with reasonable care , ” Hutchinson said .
“ Ms. Torti ran up in a state of panic , literally grabbed Ms. Van Horn by the shoulder and yanked her out , then dropped her next to the car , ” he said , deeming Torti ’s assessment of an imminent explosion “ irrational ” and her action in leaving Van Horn close to the car inconsistent with that judgment .
Hutchinson said it was too early to say what sum Van Horn might seek in damages ; her original suit was summarily dismissed in Los Angeles County Superior Court before he could arrange expert assessments of the costs of her life care and loss of potential income .
It was her ambition to become a Hollywood makeup artist -- a dream no longer achievable , the lawyer said .

THE WERTHER EFFECT
Some of our misconceptions are formed in school but most of us see the world through television , movies , newspapers , magazines and books .
That 's a problem because of the phenomenon some psychiatrists call the " Werther Effect "
Werther was the hero of a novel written by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe more than two hundred years ago .
The book winds up with a passage in which Werther dresses in boots , a blue coat and a yellow vest , sits at his desk with an open book , and shoots himself .
In the next few years so many young men dressed themselves as Werther and sat at a desk with an open book to shoot themselves that the book was banned in several countries .
In April of 1994 singer Kurt Cobain shot himself .
For the rest of the year a surprising number of teen - age suicides played Cobain tapes as they killed themselves , and some left notes naming Cobain .
In May of 1998 one fan killed herself and two others tried to at the funeral of Japanese rock star Hideto Matsumoto , a few days after Matsumoto hung himself with a towel .
Psychiatrists know that one suicide in a mental hospital is liable to be followed by others , and more than 20 years ago American sociologist David Phillips found that the same pattern holds in the outside world .
At the time the U.S. suicide rate averaged 1,200 to 1,700 every month , depending on the time of year and other factors .
Phillips found an average increase of nearly 60 in the month after any suicide reported on the front page of either the New York Times or the New York Daily News .
Some suicides have more impact than others .
In 1962 the death of Marilyn Monroe apparently triggered nearly 200 suicides in the next month .
Human beings are herd animals and we like to do the things our leaders do .
That 's one of the reasons advertisers pay small fortunes to sports celebrities , rock stars and other media - created " leaders " to " endorse " their products .
I know that a hockey player is no better judge of hair shampoo than I , and that he may not even use the shampoo he recommends .
Personally I can't imagine anyone buying shampoo on a hockey player 's say - so , but I know that hard - headed people who measure their results pay big bucks for the hockey player 's endorsement .
I use that shampoo because it just happened to catch my eye at the drug store .
It 's pretty good .
We learn by watching others and , sometimes , by imitating them .
A baby watches its parents and as it develops the ability it imitates their movements , their speech patterns and ultimately their relationships .
As we grow up we learn from our peers and authority figures , but the peers and the authority figures of millions of North Americans are the heroes and heroines of TV soap operas and sitcoms .
Millions more identify with or take their cues from pop singers or fictional characters in books .
And most of the models are deliberately abnormal .
They have to be , to stand out in a competitive marketplace .
Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra sang about love and lived relatively normal public lives .
Rock groups like Dismember , Pungent Stink and Verbal Abuse do not .
Sherlock Holmes used his brain to solve cases in which something was stolen , and perhaps one person was killed or threatened .
Today 's fictional detectives are more likely to use machine guns to fight off baddies who plan wholesale slaughter .
And it will get worse , because life imitates art .
Movies set standards for real - life bad guys to aspire to , and when real life catches up with movie villains the movie villains become even more extreme to maintain the shock value of films .
We all know that the films and the characters are fictional but one of the most common failings of memory is what psychologists call " source amnesia " , when we remember something but are not quite sure where or how we learned it .
One common example is the face that 's familiar , but you do n't know where you know it from .
Psychologist Daniel Schacter of Harvard University says all our memories , whether we remember the source or not , are subject to what he calls " leakage " .
When we recall a scene or an event we may include details from a different scene or event .
And we may remember some events that never happened at all .
In her book { The Myth of Repressed Memory} psychologist Elizabeth Loftus proves that most of us can confuse fiction with fact .
One who did was French psychologist Jean Piaget , a world leader in developmental psychology .
As quoted by Loftus , Piaget recalls a clear memory of the time his nurse fought off a man who tried to kidnap him .
Piaget was five years old at the time .
When he was 15 the nurse admitted that the story had been a fabrication , made up to impress Piaget 's parents .
In fact Piaget remembered only the nurse telling his parents about the supposed incident , and his parents relating it as an anecdote , but for years he thought he remembered a real event .
In several public speeches former U.S. president Ronald Reagan cited an act of heroism in which a U.S. Navy pilot won the Congressional Medal of Honor .
The incident he referred to was part of a movie , but Reagan remembered it as real life .
Loftus also cites the results of a an incident in February 24 , 1984 , in which a sniper shot at children in a school playground in Los Angeles .
Later , when psychologists from UCLA interviewed the children , several of them had clear " memories " of things they could not possibly have seen .
Some of the most detailed first - hand recollections of the event were among children who had not been at school that day .
The children really did remember , but the memories were false .
Loftus once challenged her students at the University of Washington to implant false memories in friends and relatives .
About one - quarter of the implants were successful .
Student Jim Coan convinced his 14 - year old brother Chris that when Chris was five years old he had been lost in a shopping mall in Tacoma .
It never happened , but with little effort Jim was able to give Chris a memory that Chris could not identify as false .
Once the source of a memory is forgotten we find it hard to distinguish between our memory of an actual event and that of an event we have only heard about .
We can even accept fictional events as real .
Because of that millions of North Americans live in a world in which the warped beliefs , attitudes and behavior of the characters in fiction represent a slice of real life .
Millions think human love is the kind of warped sadomasochistic circus portrayed by romance novels and millions more -- including some working policemen -- think " real " policemen behave like the psycho-neurotics of movies like { Lethal Weapon , Die Hard} and even , God help us , the { Police Academy} series .
An un-armed man was shot by police in Toronto last year because the policemen who thought he was a drug dealer were play - acting roles as movie cops when they tried to arrest him .
The man was unarmed and he made no attempt to escape or resist but during the arrest an undercover policeman chose to break his car window by hitting it with a pistol .
Other policemen who were pumped up for a gunfight heard the glass break , thought the suspect was resisting , and riddled him with bullets .
There was no need to break the car window but policemen in movies and TV break things , and the Toronto cop thought he should too .
The other policemen were ready for a shootout because they have all seen it happen , many times , in movies and on TV .
But the problem of entertainment goes beyond sex and violence .
All fiction is suspect .
Some school - teachers tell us that fiction teaches us about the real world .
That 's wrong .
A fiction writer may pretend to model real life but in fact he makes his characters fit a pre-ordained plot .
Even within the needs of the plot , writers have to make their characters and the world behave in ways that will please an audience already shaped by misconceptions and sated by excess .
They must also cater to the preconceptions of their audience and the stereotypes of the day .
In the American south in the 1920's or South Africa in the 1960's a story or play that portrayed even one Negro as noble or intelligent would not have been accepted by the general public .
Today 's fiction reflects different stereotypes but they are still stereotypes .
That 's a problem because modern TV , movies and even books portray the world with such clarity and simplicity that most fiction is more vivid than real life .
Because of that many of us pay more attention to the antics of fictional characters on movies and TV screens than we do to real people in the real world , and the lessons we learn from fiction may carry more weight than the lessons we learn from real people .
Thanks to the wonders of modern media , many of us have a distorted view of the world .
If we grow up with movies and TV , we may also have trouble communicating with others .
Psychologists tell us that about 70 % of social communication is through body language , and most of the rest is through tone of voice .
Words carry less than 10 % of the message .
We learn to read non-verbal cues from our peers but when we get a significant portion of our human inter-action from television , we learn wrong .
When Joe Virile looks into Jane Fertile 's eyes and tells her he loves her , he 's lying .
In fact he may hate her , and in any case he is following a script .
But to millions of budding Jane Fertile 's his love is real , and they watch every nuance of body language and facial expression .
Joe is faking but he is setting the standard by which real - life lovers will be judged , and if they do n't fake it they may not be believed .
If Joe Virile is a good enough actor he may try to mimic the body language of true love , but there 's very little chance that he will get it right .
He will do better as an actor , in fact , if he mimics a parody of the real body language -- because a parody will have more impact in the fictional setting .
That 's a real problem because most children will probably see more intense human inter-action in the thirty hours or so of television they watch every week than they will in real life , and they pay more attention to TV than they do to real life .
That creates another danger , because some modern entertainment is blatant propaganda .
People who follow TV serials all know about the brave woman pioneer doctor of the old west and the half - witted men in her life , about the heroic warrior princess who battles against evil men , and other unreal caricatures .
When the CBC made a pseudo - historical movie about the development of the Avro Arrow fighter plane the producers chose to make a non-existent woman engineer one of the driving forces behind the project .
The reason shows in the credits , where we see that a feminist propaganda group helped finance the film .
Propagandists may say that they adjust our perception of the world for our own good , but they define my good by their standards -- and all I know for sure is that their standards do not include a high regard for the truth .
Televised propaganda is a serious danger to our society because TV represents the world , to many of us .
When we sit with people to watch TV we are there to watch TV , not to sit with people .
If we read a book rather than talk to friends , we choose the characters in the book as our friends .
If I live in the real world I will model my behavior and expectations on the real world , and I may eventually learn to deal with the real world .
If I live in a world of fiction I will learn from fiction , and I will learn only to deal with the world of fiction .
If the people I meet have been exposed to the same fiction or the same propaganda as I have it might work out all right , in some cases at least .
If I model my behavior on one fictional character , perhaps they will model theirs on another .
But what if real human reactions creep into the interchange ?
If I am too wrapped up in fictional emotions and reactions , will I be able to deal with the real thing ?
Or will I feel so uncomfortable with the real world that when one of my fictional heroes commits suicide , I may think about following his lead ?
Perhaps not , but there is evidence that one common characteristic of people who can't make it in school or in life is an inability to read body language .
If they had spent more time with real life , and less with fiction , they might do better .
Thanks to the power of modern media and the skill of modern writers and actors a significant part of our population has a warped view of the world , and millions of people are not able to communicate effectively with one another .

Capitalist crisis stirs
protests in E. Europe
( front page )
 Eastern Europe is heading for a violent spring of discontent ,  said the British newspaper The Observer , after a string of protests took place in Latvia , Lithuania , and Bulgaria .
In Vilnius , the capital of Lithuania , 7,000 gathered January 16 to protest government cuts in wages and benefits , and tax increases .
Three days earlier 10,000 people protested in the Latvian capital , Riga , against an austerity package announced in December as part of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union for loans .
Government officials in Lithuania have said they need to impose budget cuts in order to avoid seeking a bailout from the IMF .
Farmers protesting low prices for their produce and government corruption , joined student protests January 14 in Sofia , Bulgarias capital .
The protests have been met by government repression in all three countries , turning into street battles with dozens injured and arrested by the cops .
Up until the world economic downturn took another dip in the later part of last year , the three countries had registered steady economic growth buoyed by foreign investment and a housing boom .
Latvias economy , which had grown at an 11 percent rate in 2007 , came to a jarring halt in the third quarter in 2008 as it shrank by 4.2 percent , the sharpest economic contraction in the European Union , said the BBC News .
Housing prices have dropped 24 percent in the last three months .
Thousands now face layoffs and wage cuts .
According to recent estimates , the economies of some Eastern European countries , after registering double - digit growth for nearly a decade , are expected to contract by up to 5 percent this year , with inflation rates rising by more than 13 percent , reported the Observer .
Krisjanis Karins , a member of the Latvian parliament and leader of the opposition New Era party , told the New York Times that the crisis had injected a new vehemence into old political complaints . 
Protests in Latvia tended to follow a pattern of standing , singing and just going home ,  said Karins .
But now they seem to think the Greek or French way of expressing anger is better .
Who are these people ?
Where did they come from ?
In the midst of this brewing social crisis , rightist and incipient fascist forces are playing on the disappointments and resentments of middle - class layers and better - off sections of the working class , fueling chauvinist , antiforeigner , and racist attitudes against national minorities and others .
In the Czech Republic , which has also been badly hit by the economic downturn , a march of 700 members of the far - right Workers  Party in the town of Litvinov battled police , who succeeded in preventing the rightists from marching into a predominately Roma ( Gypsy ) area .

Talking with Americans about voting fraud – or more correctly : voter registration fraud – gets you roughly two kinds of answers , depending on whether you talk to a Republican or a Democrat .
It happens on a large scale , is a scandal , and surely indicates that there must be a problem with actual voting fraud as well .
Or it ’s a hype , stirred up by a losing party eager to avoid facing up to its failure ; something that only occurs on a small scale and does n’t affect the actual election results anyway .
Either way , the subject ’s offered much fodder for controversy .
Well , here ’s a reality check from Hungary .
You thought you may have a problem ?
Police probe fake candidate petition slips in Budapest local constituency More than 2,200 fake candidate petition slips were discovered in Budapest ’s ninth district , where parliamentary constituency elections are due to be held on January 11 [.. ] .
Under Hungary ’s electoral system , it is necessary to collect 750 slips showing support among the local public before standing a candidate . [..]
The forgeries involved the conservative opposition Democratic Forum ( MDF ) , non-parliamentary radical nationalist MIEP and the non-parliamentary radical nationalist Hungarian Social Green Party ( MSZZP ) [.. ] .
The National Printing Office [..] has examined the slips received and found that 1,152 of those given for the MSZZP candidate had been forged while only 13 were genuine .
There were 669 fakes out of 1,015 slips sent in for MDF ’s candidate , and 415 fakes out of a total of 781 MIEP slips . [..]
Parties which had qualified to stand a candidate were the Humanist party , the Free Democrats , the Hungarian Communist Workers ’ Party and Fidesz - KDNP .
13 out of 1,152 genuine !
I mean , wow .
It actually gets a little more byzantine than that .
Note these paras :
Mihaly Dezsi , who failed to meet the requirements to stand as MDF ’s candidate by Friday ’s deadline , said he would file charges against an unknown perpetrator [.. ] .
Dezsi , a former police spokesman , said there is suspicion that someone had gained access to databases and used personal data when filling in fake petition slips .
He said the bulk of the slips had been found in the local party office ’s mail boxes .
They had not been collected door - to - door by party activists .
In short : was the MDF in fact set up by one of the other parties ?
One competing for the same votes , perhaps , or one viscerally opposed enough to the MDF to want it out of the race ?
Fill in enough fake slips , dump them into the mailbox of the rival party , and hope it will be gullible enough to depend on them .
To appreciate the full dose of deceit this little story offers , by the way , consider the chutzpah of the far right nationalists who use a splinter party masquerading under the moderate sounding moniker “ Social Green ” .
( A more common practice than you might think , in Eastern Europe but not exclusively there ; in the Netherlands the leading far right parties of the 1980s were called Centre Party and Centre Democrats . )
For bonus conspiracy theory points , note that the country ’s second largest party , the Hungarian Socialist Party , is not standing in these by - elections , presumably supporting the Free Democratic candidate instead .
And that the abbreviation of the Socialists ( and as in much of Europe , political parties here are usually referred to by their abbreviation ) is MSZP .
And that the “ Hungarian Social Green Party ” abbreviates as MSZZP .
Were they trying to get some stray votes from the MSZP ’s pensioner voter base – old folk looking for MSZP on the ballot and not noticing the extra Z ?
The MSZZP candidate was Tamas Polgar , better known locally as the rabble - rousing blogger Tomcat , so who knows .

Mathematics is the supreme nostalgia of our time .
Although more of an investment guru than a management guru , Warren Buffett ( born 1930 ) made his billions ( and became the second richest man in the world after Bill Gates ) from the success of the companies held by his investment vehicle , Berkshire Hathaway , a publicly quoted company .
He has described the extent of his involvement in these companies as being limited to the allocation of capital and people .
“ Charles T. Munger , Berkshire Hathaway 's vice - chairman , and I really have only two jobs , ” he once said ( Charles T. Munger being his long - time closest associate ) .
“ One is to attract and keep outstanding managers to run our various operations .
The other is capital allocation . ”
That includes setting the compensation of the chief executive .
Buffett is known as “ the Sage of Omaha ” , after the town where he was born and where he has spent most of his life , and much is made of his small - town homespun values .
He likes to play the ukulele and he plays bridge ( with Bill Gates , among others ) in his modest home in Omaha .
His one conceit is a corporate jet , but that is second - hand and named “ The Indefensible ” .
Buffett , however , is not really the small - town boy made good .
His father , Howard Buffett , was a stockbroker who won a seat in Congress when Warren was a boy , and the family moved to Washington , DC , for a while .
Then Buffett went to the Wharton School in Philadelphia , the top business school in the United States for finance and for those heading for the higher reaches of Wall Street .
He left before he completed his course , but finished his studies at New York 's almost equally prestigious Columbia Business School .
From there , in 1951 , he started to make his living from investing on the stockmarket , and was greatly influenced by Ben Graham , who wrote a classic book on investment , “ Security Analysis ” ( 1934 ) , and had been his tutor at Columbia .
As a group lemmings have a rotten image .
But no individual lemming has ever received a bad press .
Buffett famously avoided the high - tech sector during the turn - of - the - century dotcom boom and bust , but in recent years he has suffered from a high involvement with the less - than - stellar insurance industry .
Berkshire Hathaway 's annual report contains a closely observed “ letter to shareholders ” , written by Buffett , which is a mixture of homespun wisdom and market savvy .
The company 's annual meeting is held in the Q - West centre in downtown Omaha and is attended by as many as 20,000 investors from all over the world .
“ We have embraced the 21st century , ” wrote Buffett in one of his letters , “ by entering such cutting - edge industries as bricks , carpets , insulation and paint — try to control your excitement . ”
In June 2006 he gave Berkshire Hathaway shares worth over $ 30 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the biggest single charitable donation in history .

Because a 102 ( g ) defense can be used in litigation whereby the defendant shows prior invention and diligent reduction to practice without suppression or concealment .
If some element is secret , however , then 102 ( g ) may not apply because of suppression .
The point of the “ junk method ” is to “ arbitrage ” a defendant ’s trade secret even if it is invented prior to that of the plaintiff .
Essentially the plaintiff insidiously co-opts the defendant ’s trade - secret by discovering and patenting it .
Since the “ junk patent ” method claim does n’t distinguish relative dates of invention ( or avoids merited rejections ) , a 102 ( f ) may preclude obtaining an enforceable patent , as I posted above .
Hence the method is not - enabled ( one of the steps requires obtaining a patent ) .
Note that secrecy of an element by itself to avoid 102 ( g ) is not enough , there must be intentional suppression as in a trade secret :
“ Intentional suppression occurs when an inventor ‘ designedly , and with the view of applying it indefinitely and exclusively for his own profit , withholds his invention from the public . ’

COMMENT

Note the attempted anti-Bilski structure of the independent claim grounded in physical transformation , yet still capturing the essence of the benefit .
Many financial trading business method patents can follow the same pattern whereby the terminal position can be claimed as something physical which is transformed by at least one physical step such as a transaction .
The extra-solution - activity problem is turned on its head by making it the principle of the claim .
Business methods , essentially designed to make money , should not directly claim the method , but rather the physical changes to financial accounting arising inherently from the method .
In other words , do n’t claim a method of making money , but rather a method to change the recording of your bank account arising from the method .
Money is real , because eventually your financial institution says it is .
So just prove it to the Federal Circuit and think about claiming that way .
Paul Gardner correctly suggests we not wallow , but start to find ways around Bilski .
Robert Mulligan , who received an Oscar nomination for directing To Kill a Mockingbird , has died of heart disease at his Connecticut home at the age of 83 .
Known for his diffident nature and sensitivity toward players , Mulligan directed five different actors in Oscar - nominated performances : Gregory Peck and Mary Badham in Mockingbird ; Natalie Wood ( Love with the Proper Stranger ) ; Ruth Gordon ( Inside Daisy Clover ) ; and Ellen Burstyn ( Same Time , Next Year ) .
Peck won the Oscar for his lead role as attorney Atticus Finch in Mockingbird .

Mcor Technologies recently launched a brand new rapid prototyping machine .
The Mcor Matrix forgoes the standard of expensive and rare build materials by using A4 office paper .
The machine selectively deposits glue on the sheet of paper : more glue on the cross-section , less on the waste .
It then uses a blade to cut out the part profile .
The vertical resolution is determined by the paper thickness .
You can use either 20lb paper , which has a thickness of .1 mm , or 40lb , which is twice as thick , so it will build twice as fast .
The final part can be sanded and painted like wood .
The idea is similar to LOM , but those machines require specialized paper .
It ’s nice to see a company intentionally target a low cost of ownership .
If they had used a laser though , you ’d only have to worry about sourcing the glue .
Machine and material prices have yet to be announced .
[ via Fabbaloo ]
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A research group in Germany has discovered a semiconducting material that can switch its semiconducting properties -- turning from one type of semiconductor to another -- via a simple change in temperature .
This intriguing behavior may make the material useful in efforts to create better performing integrated circuits , which form the backbone of almost all electronic devices .
Semiconductors are essential to integrated circuits , and any significant advances in semiconductor materials could mean big changes for the future of electronic technologies .
For example , this new finding may further developments in data - storage technology .
At a more fundamental level , the material could change how semiconductor chips are designed .
" This new material may be able to help simplify chip production in the future , " the study 's corresponding researcher , chemist Tom Nilges of the University of Muenster , in Germany , said to PhysOrg.com .
" Instead of using two materials to build transistors for integrated circuits , there is now a reasonable chance that this job could be performed by a single material . "
The material is a compound containing silver , tellurium , and bromine , abbreviated Ag 10 Te 4 Br 3 .
At three distinct temperatures — 290 degrees Kelvin ( K ) , 317 K , and 390 K ( 62 , 111 , and 242 degrees Fahrenheit , respectively ) — the material changes from a p- type semiconductor ( excess positively charged " holes , " or electron absences ) to an n - type ( excess negative carriers ) , and back to a p-type .
These changes are reversible .
Silver - based semiconducting compounds tend to have many interesting electrical properties , mainly because they can conduct both electrons and silver ions exceptionally well .
This makes them useful in a variety of electronics applications .
For example , they are being eyed as good candidates for a certain type of memory device .
Another possible application for these materials is in the relatively cheap production of electricity without the simultaneous emission of planet - warming greenhouse gases .
Ag 10 Te 4
Br 3 may be particularly suited to this , as it has interesting thermal properties .
For example , over the temperature range 355 K - 410 K , the material displays a strong and broad endothermic response , meaning it absorbs a large amount of heat from its surroundings .
In addition , it does not rapidly adjust its temperature in relation to its surroundings -- it has a very low " thermal diffusivity " -- and displays a huge thermopower drop , meaning the voltage across the material changes rapidly in response to changing temperature .
Such a large thermopower change has not before been observed .
The ability of Ag 10 Te 4
Br 3 to switch from p-type to n- type and back again is the result of several complex structural changes it undergoes in response to the changing temperature .
In combination , these changes allow the material 's electrical properties to morph so dramatically .
Some of the tellurium ions form mobile chains ; the silver ions coordinate to those chains .
There is also a shift in the concentration of charge carriers — electrons and holes — which is connected with the chain - forming tendency of tellurium .
Future research into Ag 10 Te 4
Br 3 may focus on its potential to allow fine - tuning of its physical properties , beyond the changes caused by temperature alone .

WINDSOR , Ont. --
The potential to make more money , an abundance of patients and a great working environment are just some of the benefits American - trained doctors say lured them to practise medicine in the Windsor , Ont. , area .
Despite many misconceptions in the U.S. about the Canadian health - care system , U.S. doctors say they are starting to see southern Ontario as a great place to work , especially in family medicine .
Of the last 100 doctors recruited to the Windsor area , 36 came from the U.S. , according to Joan Mavrinac , head of the local physician recruitment office .
About half of the doctors who are now considering practising in the region are from the U.S .
Family ties drive a number of U.S. doctors to relocate to the Windsor region , but they say job satisfaction and financial gain encourage them to stay .
Dr. John Samoila , who was trained in the U.S. and initially thought he'd never come back to Windsor where he was raised , said his experiences and research have led him to believe that doctors can do " very , very well " financially in Canada .
He said the universal coverage the provincial government provides to all Ontario residents means doctors do n't have to wrangle with insurance companies in order to get paid for their services and deal with " a lot of red tape . "
Dr. Kristen Kupeyan , who completed her residency training in South Carolina and has been working in Windsor for the past 16 months , said the high cost of starting up and maintaining a practice in the U.S. is one of the reasons she chose to work in her hometown .
Doctor 's offices in the U.S. require more staff to handle billing , insurance claims and deal with the health maintenance organizations , which provide health - care plans .
-- Canwest News Service
The cost of malpractice insurance in the U.S. can reach $ 200,000 a year for some specialists .
" There is a lot less paperwork here than in the States , " said Kupeyan , whose husband plans to join her in Windsor when he completes his medical training in Michigan .
" It makes things a lot simpler . "
In addition to the financial incentives , U.S. doctors have found other reasons to cross the border in search of employment .
" In Canada , there is no shortage of patients , " said Dr. Danish Mazhar , who lives in the Detroit area and commutes across the border to work .
" So many of my patients tell me ' Thank you so much for coming here . '
I was needed in Canada more than I was needed in the States . "
Mazhar said he would " definitely recommend " Canada to other U.S. doctors but would like to see the Ontario government make the accreditation process easier .
" It took three or four months for me to get approval to work here , " he said .
" A lot of paperwork . . . and a 32 - page application form .
They want a lot of details , a lot of forms .
That was the most frustrating part .
I did it all , but some people may give up . "
Working in Canada has also become more appealing to U.S. doctors because of a change in attitude toward family medicine , said Dr. Timothy Hogan .
Hogan finished medical school in Ontario and kept up his Ontario medical licence , but went on to establish a family practice in Ohio , where he still works part - time .
" The Canadian government has realized that family practice has changed a lot over the years and is very important , " Hogan said .
" The family health team models seem to be working very well . "

The end of days must be closer than I realized .
Conservative stalwart Fox News is not only taking on the officialdom , it is going after Republican authorities .
This is almost as much fun as learning that J. Edgar Hoover was a cross -dresser .
But then again , Fox is going after the AIG rescue and the TARP , which have made peculiar allies of the left ( who see it as an almost no strings attached subsidy to the big end of the financial sector that created this mess ) and the right ( who see it as creeping socialism and profligate use of tax dollars ) with plenty of company in the middle ( non-ideological types who are appalled by the lack of planning and controls ) .
So this move represents the vein of conservative thinking that sees big- spending Bush as a traitor to the cause .
It ’s no wonder the Treasury has tried the “ just say no ” approach .
The more light shed on the bailouts , the less flattering the picture that is likely to emerge .
But unlike the Bloomberg effort to compel the Fed to disclose information about the various Fed lending programs ( exactly what collateral the central bank is taking and from whom ) ,
Fox ought to have decent odds of winning the fight .
The Fed has contended that FOIA does not apply because the loans come out of the New York Fed , which is not a government body .
while Treasury would appear to lack an easy out .
Go Fox !

Seller financing is a method of buying / selling a home that does not involve banks and cash offers .
It is one of a few different methods of selling a house for homeowners that need a way to get out from under a property .
In a deal where the seller is financing a property , the seller and buyer agree on a price for the property that will ultimately be paid after a term .
Let ’s say a house is worth $ 100,000 .
If the seller is desperate , they may agree to sell the house at $ 90,000 with a seller finance deal .

IF one of the things that convinced you to vote Labor at the last Federal election was the party 's promise to deliver a top - of - the - line broadband network across the nation , you'd be feeling a bit disappointed about now .
Broadband was a bit of a line - ball issue between the major parties last year .
The Coalition had a relatively straightforward promise that would have had super - fast broadband across all the Northern Rivers ' regional centres within a year , with what most locals would imagine as ' normal ' broadband to most other areas and an unfortunate few having to make do with dodgy satellite connections .
Unfortunately Labor 's promise did n't take into account the crankiness of Telstra , which really has nothing to gain and everything to lose from
enhanced internet .
Ever since the internet began to evolve into something more than a toy for geeks , Telstra has done its best to discourage it .
Telstra 's core business is telephones and its traditional strength has been in home telephones connected by its copper - line network .
The internet does a fair job of undoing that .
Even without the innovation of net - based phone services such as Skype , the internet 's core strength is allowing people anywhere in the world to communicate with each other free .
Most web - based email services now even come with the ability to video - conference free in real time .
The only thing now holding us back from Jetsons - style communications is bandwidth and download limits .
Labor 's promised broadband revolution seeks to close that gap by allowing everyone access to internet speeds that would easily allow , as one of its many benefits , seamless video -
conferencing .
It seems to me that many of Telstra 's problems , and the reasons underlying its ' joke '- to quote Optus - bid , are its ownership and control of , and thus its need to protect , its copper - wire network .
It is the privatisation of that network that was the former Howard Government 's greatest communications failure .
Interestingly , a dark - horse bid , headed by former Telstra honcho Doug Campbell for a company called Acacia , seems to have come up with a realistic solution .
Acacia proposes to build the new broadband network and then run it as a wholesaler , thus removing the conflict of interest that is causing such problems with Telstra .
We may yet get a worthwhile super broadband network at prices we can afford .

MEXICO CITY — Indiscriminate kidnappings .
Nearly daily beheadings .
Gangs that mock and kill government agents .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
This is n’t Iraq or Pakistan .
It ’s Mexico , which the U.S. government and a growing number of experts say is becoming one of the world ’s biggest security risks .
The prospect that America ’s southern neighbor could melt into lawlessness provides an unexpected challenge to Barack Obama ’s new government .
In its latest report anticipating possible global security risks , the U.S. Joint Forces Command lumps Mexico and Pakistan together as being at risk of a “ rapid and sudden collapse . ”
“ The Mexican possibility may seem less likely , but the government , its politicians , police and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels , ” the command said in the report published Nov. 25 .
“ How that internal conflict turns out over the next several years will have a major impact on the stability of the Mexican state . ”
Retiring CIA chief Michael Hayden told reporters on Friday that that Mexico could rank alongside Iran as a challenge for Obama _ perhaps a greater problem than Iraq .
The U.S. Justice Department said last month that Mexican gangs are the “ biggest organized crime threat to the United States . ”
National security adviser Stephen Hadley said last week that the worsening violence threatens Mexico ’s very democracy .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff recently told The New York Times he ordered additional border security plans to be drawn up this summer as kidnappings and killings spilled into the U.S .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
If California expands its renewable power generation to be a third of electricity delivered in the state by 2020 , it may cost $ 60 billion , the state ’s utility regulator said in a report issued on Thursday .
It is more costly to make electricity with renewable power -- solar , wind , geothermal and other sources that emit no or low amounts of global - warming greenhouse gases -- than with natural gas , nuclear and coal power plants .
Renewable power in 2007 accounted for about 12 percent of the electricity delivered in the state , compared with 45 percent for natural gas , 17 percent for coal , 15 percent for nuclear and 12 percent for large hydropower projects .
Large hydropower projects are not counted in California ’s so - called renewable portfolio standard ( RPS ) goals .
“ Reaching a 33 percent target will require procurement of more expensive renewables -- preliminary analysis indicates that such a target may require a state investment of about $ 60 billion in generation and transmission from 2010 to 2020 , ” said the report issued by the California Public Utilities Commission .
The Cal PUC said California ’s legislature should stiffen the requirement for renewable energy to 33 percent of total power generation by 2020 .
Currently , the state requires a 20 percent target by 2010 , but the utilities will not meet that goal until 2013 , it said .
The target of 33 percent renewables by 2020 has the backing of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and is expected to be debated in the next state legislative session .
The California Public Utilities Commission has yet to determine how much more it will cost retail electricity customers to increase renewable power .
A 33 percent target by 2020 would mean the construction of seven major transmission lines costing about $ 6.4 billion .
On Tuesday , California voters overwhelmingly -- 65 percent of the vote -- rejected a statewide ballot measure that would have required 50 percent of power to be generated from renewables by 2025 .
The measure was fought by both environmentalists and utilities because , they said , it was poorly drafted and would hinder renewable power development .
Reaching the 33 percent target would mean 70,000 gigawatt - hours of renewable power , the report said .
While renewable power one day may compete with baseload power sources such as natural gas , coal and nuclear , it currently is more costly , and much less dependable .
“ If the state is required to generate 33 percent of its energy from renewable resources by 2020 , then all new procurement of new energy resources between now and 2020 must be entirely renewable energy , except some new fossil for peaking capacity and to replace aging fossil plants critical to renewable integration , ” the report said .
The California Public Utilities Commission ’s staff is studying the costs of implementing a tougher target as well as methods to alleviate the hurdles to attaining that goal .
“ The Cal PUC has identified a number of barriers affecting current RPS ( renewable portfolio standard ) projects , including extension of the federal production tax credits , transmission , developer inexperience , financing , site - control , price , military radar , technology , fuel supply , equipment procurement , and other sources of risk , ” the report said .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - NASA is still unable to say for sure whether its Phoenix lander has found a place where life could have existed on Mars .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
But scientists working with the U.S. space agency said on Monday computer models they have been using to predict what the weather would be like on the Red Planet are wrong , and more accurate models would give a better picture of its past .
Speaking at the opening day of the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco , Phoenix mission scientists laid out the early harvest from five months of robotic operations on the northern polar region of Mars .
In addition to analyzing ice and soil samples for organic material , a process that is still under way , the Phoenix science team collected daily weather reports , information considered critical to learning if the planet could have supported water long enough for life to evolve .
“ It ’s a very active weather environment , ” lead investigator Peter Smith told reporters in a teleconference .
“ It ’s a bit of a mystery how this is happening . ”
Phoenix saw dusty summer days slip into cloudy fall , replete with ground fog , snow and frost .
“ Global climate models that are running on Mars would not predict this , ” Smith said .
“ What we ’re learning now about the polar region is going to force us to make changes . ”
More accurate computer models would give scientists a clearer picture of what happened in Mars ’ past , particularly when the planet ’s axial tilt , or obliquity , was greater than it is now .
Without a large moon for stabilization , Mars ’ polar regions periodically shift off axis by more than 35 degrees .
During those times , the sun would rise higher in the sky above the Martian poles , making for warmer summers .
Scientists are trying to determine if there was ever a period of time when it would have been warm enough for water , considered a key ingredient for life as we know it .
“ We ’re really trying to understand if this was ever a wetter environment , ” Smith said .
“ If we can update these global circulation models and we can understand better about the polar weather , then we can look back in time to see if liquid water was ever a dominant influence on this soil in this location . ”
The Phoenix team also is on the hunt for evidence of minerals affected by water .
Scientists had problems delivering soil samples into Phoenix ’s tiny ovens for analysis because the soil turned out to be rather clumpy , not dry and dusty like the soil at sites where other probes have landed .
Though frustrating , the discovery also spurred new questions about how water is moving through the ice , soil and atmosphere .
“ Something is taking the wind - blown material and mildly cementing it , ” said Ray Arvidson , of Washington University in St. Louis , who served as the lead scientist for the lander ’s robotic arm .
More results from the Phoenix mission are expected next year .

MySQL 5.1 is now out , but not everyone is happy about this oft - delayed open source database release .
I 've been hearing about MySQL 5.1 since at least 2006 and over the last two years there have been a few dates I 've been told when it would be released .
Earlier this year the plan was for it to be out by June , then that got bumped back .
Last month , a Sun spokesperson told me the release would be generally available ( GA ) on December 9 , but apparently MySQL 5.1 is now already generally available .
One of the reasons , I 've been told over the years as to why MySQL 5.1 has been delayed is to ensure the quality of the release and to learn from mistakes made in the MySQL 5.0 release .
It 's an argument that MySQL founder Monty Widenius now disagrees with .
" The reason I am asking you to be very cautious about MySQL 5.1 is that
there are still many known and unknown fatal bugs in the new features
that are still not addressed , " Widenius blogged .
Widenius argued that there are still at least 180 serious bugs in the MySQL 5.1 release - ( as evidence of his allegation he points to a bug tracking page that shows many of the bugs ) .
He also lists a litany of other errors that in his view should have been caught and corrected prior to a generally available ( GA ) release .
The reason for the flaws is not due to developer dedication , according to Widenius , but rather due to the conditions in which the developers work .
North Korea has announced that it will close the land border and cut non-military phone links with South Korea .
North Korea 's army has told the South " to strictly restrict and cut off all the overland passages " across the fortified border from 1 December .
A Red Cross office in the North with the only civilian phone link will shut .
If implemented the move will be a blow to inter-Korean relations which have deteriorated since South Korean President Lee Myung - bak came to office .
And it comes despite some progress in international negotiations over dismantling North Korea 's nuclear programme .
The border closure decision had been taken because " reckless confrontation " from South Korea was " beyond the danger level " , according to the North 's official KCNA news agency .
The agency report added : " The South Korean puppet authorities should never forget that the present inter-Korean relations are at the crucial crossroads of existence and total severance . "
The phone lines from the Red Cross office in the border village of Panmunjom were the only non-military link between the countries .
Phone and mail links between ordinary people have been cut since the end of the 1950 - 53 war .
Announcing the closure of the government - controlled Red Cross office , the North criticised the South for co-sponsoring a United Nations resolution criticising its human rights record .
" It is really appalling that the puppet regime is taking a leading role in the racket of a so - called UN resolution on human rights in the North , " the statement carried by KCNA said .
A vote on the resolution is expected later in November .
It comes a month after a UN human - rights investigator strongly criticised North Korea , urging it to end public executions and provide food for the people not just the elite .
' Negative impact ' South Korea 's unification ministry 's spokesman Kim Ho -Nyoun said he did not believe the North intended a complete border closure .
" If the North carries them out , it would have a negative impact on what has been achieved in inter-Korean relations , " he said .
South Korea has funded the Kaesong industrial complex just over the border in the North , and a ban on border crossings would make it very difficult for the plant to continue operating .
Some 30,000 North Korean workers are employed by South Korean companies at the complex , and jobs there are highly prized .
Relations between the Koreas have become increasingly strained since February when conservative President Lee Myung - bak took office in Seoul , pledging to get tough with Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programme .
Last month North Korea threatened to reduce the South to rubble unless it stopped activists sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets attached to balloons into the communist state .
Speculation Despite the hostile turn in inter-Korean relations , North Korea has continued to make progress in six-nation talks over its nuclear programme despite frequent setbacks .
It says it is disabling its main nuclear plant at Yongbyon after the US removed the North from a blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism .
The latest escalation in tension comes amid speculation that North Korea 's leader Kim Jong - il may have suffered from a serious stroke , though the North has insisted he is in good health and still firmly in charge .

The picture perfect storm : Photographs capture the terrifying beauty of clouds gathering over Greenland
These incredible photographs look more like a scene from the end of the world than a winter sunrise .
The dramatic pictures were taken in north west Greenland by British Arctic photographers Bryan and Cherry Alexander and show a storm brewing over an Inuit community .
Clouds gather over Inglefield Bay at dawn , which in Greenland occurs at about 10 am during the winter
The award - winning photographic pair were staying in Qaanaaq , about 800 miles from the North Pole , when the apocalyptic cloud colouring began over Inglefield Bay .
' It was just before dawn , around 10 am , when an Inuit friend of mine whose house I was staying in came to my room and suggested that I take a look at the sky , ' Mr Cherry said .
' I went outside and was stunned by the beautiful and dramatic cloud formation .
I just could n't believe my eyes .
I have worked in the Arctic regularly for the past 37 years and I had never seen the sky like it . '
The pictures show a thin layer of medium - level cloud that has been pummeled by winds churned up between the glaciers below .
' You often see clouds repeating the shape of the ground below , ' a spokeswoman from the Met Office said .
' The wind comes in from one side , is lifted up over the mountains and hits the clouds before coming down again .
It 's a dramatic example of what is known as an orographic effect . '
The angle of the rising sun helped to highlight the different colours and intricate patterns .
An elderly Inuit hunter said he had never seen such a sky before in all his life
' It looked apocalyptic and like a scene from one of the Lord of the Rings movies , ' Mr Cherry said .
' Because of the northern winter , the sun rises later and later the nearer you are to the North Pole .
That 's why even though the pictures were taken at dawn , it was actually ten in the morning . '
For Mr Cherry , it was a once - in - a - lifetime photographic event .
The drama , above , lasted about an hour and then dissolved , leaving behind a normal , cloudy autumn day
He said : ' I grabbed my cameras and photographed for about an hour as the cloud formation changed and the colour of the clouds turned from grey to pink as the rising sun 's rays caught them .
' An hour or so later the drama was gone and it became just another cloudy autumn day in North Greenland . '
But it was not just the Alexanders who were blown away by the natural wonder unfolding in front of them .
Mr Cherry said : ' Just about everybody in the village was amazed , including an elderly Inuit hunter who told me that he had never seen anything like that before in his life . '
The Alexanders have travelled to the region almost every year since the early 1970s , exploring it extensively to document the life of the North 's native peoples .
However , in all that time they said they had never seen anything close to the incredible skies they witnessed this autumn .

Government financial bailout now most expensive endeavor in U.S. history … tops even WWII
So why is no one worried about inflation ?
Chris Mayer on the “ reflation ” of 2009
Market volatile as ever …
Surprising places where the “ smart money ” is seeking profits
Bill Bonner on a very rare occurrence in stocks and bonds
Plus , “ If you ’re so smart , what ’s your solution ? ” a reader asks …
The 5 responds , below
Wow .
The U.S. government has now thrown more money at this “ credit crisis ” than it did fighting the entire Second World War .
By CNBC ’s estimation , the cost for World War II — adjusted for inflation — was $ 3.6 trillion .
At $ 4.2 trillion , the credit crisis of 2008 clocks in as the most expensive endeavor in American history .
That ’s a lot of moola getting pumped into the system .
In ordinary times , the meters would be screaming , “ Inflation ! ”
But we assure you , there are few warm bodies in Washington who care about inflation .
The “ consensus ” agrees with Ben Bernanke and Hank Paulson that government should spend whatever it takes to reinflate the economy .
On the surface , the latest producer price index ( PPI ) , a measure of prices at the producer level , indicates the “ consensus ” might be right not to worry about inflation .
The PPI fell by a record 2.8 % last month .
According to the Labor Dept. this morning , gasoline prices for wholesalers fell by 12.8 % — their biggest drop in 22 years .
Food prices fell for the first time in eight months , down 0.2 % .
Thus , producer inflation rose 5.2 % over the last 12 months — steep , but not as bad as the Street anticipated .
Sigh .
However , if you strip out energy and food costs , which economists are wont to do , given their volatility , “ core ” PPI rose 0.4 % — more than anticipated .
The “ core ” inflation rate has now risen 4.4 % in the last year — its fastest rate since the Berlin Wall fell .
The Fed is n’t out of the woods , by any means .
“ I think we ’re set up for some huge reflation in 2009 , ” asserts our managing editor Chris Mayer .
With the latest Grant ’s Interest Rate Observer in hand , Chris passed on a few inflationary notes we ’ve become all too familiar with :
The Fed ’s balance sheet has grown by 133 % in the past 12 months .
Traditionally , growth over 10 % was seen as too aggressive
The Fed ’s balance sheet crossed $ 1 trillion for the first time in September .
It then broke through $ 2 trillion Nov. 5 .
And according to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates , it could top $ 3 trillion by 2009
Federal Reserve bank credit is up 1,560 % from this time last year .
“ Our Federal Reserve seems hellbent on making Argentina look like Switzerland in terms of monetary restraint .
Why is this ballooning balance sheet inflationary ?
The Federal Reserve increases its assets by buying stuff — financial assets of banks and others .
The Federal Reserve pays for these assets by creating money that did not exist before .
That ’s it .
Simple as pie .
“ Of course , our government is not acting alone .
Central banks across the globe are doing the same thing , if with somewhat lesser vigor , at the moment .
“ In any event , it means paper money will buy less .
We may see nominal prices — for oil and gold and metals — continue to fall in the short term , but long term , look for huge reflation in 2009 . ”
In the market … another day , another roller - coaster ride for U.S. equities .
Traders started the week in a bad mood , due mostly to business as usual on Wall Street , but especially after Japan officially declared recession .
Stocks drifted up late morning , but quickly reversed on news of massive Citigroup job cuts , more signs of distress from automakers and lousy industrial output data .
All of the S&P ’s 10 sector groups fell , but financials , consumer discretionary and materials led the way .
In such turbulent markets , what are the “ smartest guys in the room ” doing ?
John Paulson , arguably the smartest investor of 2007 , is buying securities backed by residential mortgages .
Paulson , who personally earned $ 3 billion last year after betting against subprime , started buying up these toxic assets last week after the Treasury announced it was no longer interested in using TARP money to buy asset - backed securities .
Paulson manages over $ 36 billion .
In a similar fold , Marty Whitman , one of the modern heroes of value investing , is ramping up his contrarian purchasing .
The manager of the famous Third Avenue Value Fund scooped up truckloads of MBIA , Ambac and GMAC shares and notes .
“ Distress securities seem to be trading at ultra attractive prices , ” he told his shareholders this week .
“ Discounts have widened appreciably for the common stocks of very well - capitalized companies where the common stocks trade at meaningful discounts from readily ascertainable net asset values ( ‘ NAVs ’ ) ; and where the prospects appear good that over the next five years , such NAVs will increase by not less than 10 % per annum compounded .
“ I have the unique perspective of being a distressed investor for many decades , and safe and cheap [ investing ] on a long - term basis seems to be about as attractive as it was in the 1970s . ”
Another smart fellow , Warren Buffett , is buying Big Oil .
Berkshire Hathaway told the SEC this week it had quietly acquired 66 million shares of ConocoPhillips , making BRK its biggest shareholder .
Buffett also commanded Berkshire to pick up a big stake in Eaton , an aero and auto parts manufacturer , and more shares of NRG Energy , a power producer .
On the other side of the ledger , Buffett reduced holdings in Bank of America by nearly half , and sold just a little bit of his beloved Wells Fargo .
All told , we see Buffett is taking the “ buy stocks ” advice he gave in The New York Times last month …
BRK purchased almost $ 4 billion in equities during the third quarter , while selling “ only ” $ 300 million .
Also , it might not be a bad time to pick up shares of Warren Buffett himself .
Berkshire Hathaway
A shares have fallen below $ 100,000 for the first time in two years .
If you ’ve got $ 95,000 you ’re just dying to invest , we could certainly think of worse places to put your greenbacks .
Despite falling 32 % this year , BRK is still outperforming the S&P 500 by nearly 10 % .
“ There ’s still more downside potential for most stocks , ” cautions our new options adviser , Wayne Burritt .
“ As you can see from this daily chart of the S&P 500 — a good stand - in for the broader U.S. stock market — U.S. stocks continue to slide .
In fact , a break below 849 — the red dotted line on the chart — is now very likely .
And that means key near - term support is pretty much out the window .
“ Below that , my technical signals tell me the S&P 500 wo n’t likely find support until 769 , or 7,197 on the Dow .
Those are the October 2002 lows that sparked the latest bull run that ended last October .
“ In other words , the market is on course to give back everything it gained in the latest , five - year long bull run .
And it will likely do so in a fraction of the time . ”
“ Stocks are down so much , ” notes Bill Bonner , “ that dividend yields are beginning to look respectable again — averaging about 3.8 % .
For the first time in 50 years , you can get more yield from a stock than from a 10 - year U.S. Treasury bond .
You remember , stocks were supposed to pay lower dividends because stockholders are supposed to earn capital gains , as well as dividends .
The combination of capital gains and dividends gives investors a total return greater than bonds ; this is the ‘ risk premium ’ that you get to compensate you for periods when stocks go down .
What happened to the risk premium ?
Here it is !
“ When is the risk premium at its lowest ?
At the very moment when investors believe it is highest .
That is , at the end of the ’90s , investors came to believe that they could n’t go wrong with stocks .
They were so sure that stocks were the way to go that they willingly bought stocks that paid little or nothing in dividends .
They thought the price of the stock would go up ; so they did n’t need dividends .
“ But stocks have gone nowhere since the mid-’90s .
Now investors want dividends . ”
In markets today , traders are keeping an eye on Capitol Hill .
The House Oversight Committee is concluding its week of economic harassment by grilling the bigwigs : Hank Paulson , Ben Bernanke and FDIC chief Sheila Blair are all testifying today .
Any hints into the details of the TARP or the confidence and capabilities of this panel could shake up the stock market .
We ’ll include a “ best of ” in tomorrow ’s 5 .
And across the hall , the Senate Democrats proposed legislation yesterday that would lend $ 25 billion to the Big Three automakers .
If passed , the bill would simply take a chunk out of the TARP ’s $ 700 war chest and send it off to Detroit .
Opposition among the Republicans and in the White House is significant , and this one looks like it will end up a stalemate .
Still , Majority Leader Harry Reid is pushing for debates and test votes this week , so we ’ll keep an eye on it .
In the oil patch , light sweet crude fell to a 22 - month low of $ 54 a barrel today .
Like last week , traders are selling oil in anticipation of Wednesday ’s Energy Dept. inventory report .
Like the previous seven weeks , the government is expected to report more excess supply and weaker demand for oil and gas .
The only real buying pressure we ’ve seen has come courtesy of … ummm … pirates ?
Yarrr !
We come for ye crude !
Well , not exactly .
The modern pirate is an angry Somali armed with RPG ’s and motorboats .
Somali rebels pulled off an impressive heist Monday , jacking a Saudi supertanker hauling about $ 100 million in oil .
We ’re not sure what they plan to do with it , as the ship is kind of … huge :
The hijacking added about $ 1 to oil ’s price in New York yesterday , but traders have since shrugged it off and sold crude back down to $ 54 .
If you plan on sailing off the coast of Africa with valuable cargo , you ’ve been warned .
But as oil prices fall , so does your price at the pump .
The national average is quickly closing in on just $ 2 a gallon .
Considering the rate of decline lately , and today ’s national average of $ 2.06 a gallon , the average American will be paying less than $ 2 a gallon by this time next week .
Gasoline is at its lowest retail cost since March of 2005 , over $ 1 cheaper than this time last year .
Gold continues to consolidate into a tighter and tighter range .
It ’s been stuck between $ 730 - 750 all week , and currently sells for $ 738 an ounce .
“ It is very easy to be critical , ” writes another , “ of Obama ’s wanting to spend money to invest in energy development and infrastructure to try to kick - start the economy .
Investors have been putting money into pushing paper around .
They are not interested in taking the risk , but will be glad to take over the investment when they can privatize profits .
“ Have you looked at your portfolios lately ?
How well are your suggestions for investments doing ?
If you stopped all government spending today , there would be a complete economic tsunami tomorrow .
What is your solution to turn this ship around ? ”
The 5 : The problem with running deficits as a matter of course , as the U.S. has done for the better part of the last 40 years , is when there ’s a real crisis , the government is short on resources .
Where is the $ 4.2 trillion we led off today ’s 5 with going to come from , for example ?
The government , under Barack Obama ’s leadership , should tighten its belt ; balance the budget ; and set up tax incentives to encourage saving and investment in productive assets locally , be it alternative energies , infrastructure or otherwise .
Hmmn … seems like we just said that yesterday .
Oh yeah , we did .
Instead , what the “ consensus ” wants it to do with all this borrowing and spending is reinflate the fictitious paper and consumer economy .
Trouble is if they ’re successful , they ’ll have to keep it alive on government support .
Then you can kiss the dollar goodbye .

Apparently , the Motion Picture Academy agrees … I.O.U.S.A. was shortlisted for the Oscar yesterday .
That means , among all 94 documentaries that qualify for an Oscar nod in 2008 , the Academy has whittled down the 15 it ’s willing to consider for the final nominations on Jan. 22 .
Five films will be chosen on that date .

Andrew Appel Answers to Official Smears from Sequioa Voting System's VP , Spokeswoman Michelle Shafer
' False Assertions ' Made in Wake of Prof 's Court - Ordered Report Finding Major Flaws in Company 's Voting Machines ...

Guest blogged by John Gideon , VotersUnite .

In an October BRAD BLOG article we reported that a court - ordered report highly negative of Sequoia Voting Systems products being used throughout New Jersey could soon be released to the public .
Prior to the release date , and then again last week , Sequoia Voting Systems attacked both the report and its author , Princeton University computer science professor Andrew Appel .
On December 18 , Sequoia issued a press release with a misleading title and subtitle :
PLAINTIFF'S EXPERT , PRINCETON'S ANDREW APPEL , TWICE VIOLATES COURT'S PROTECTIVE ORDER IN ELECTRONIC VOTING CASE INVOLVING THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY AND SEQUOIA VOTING SYSTEMS Appel ordered by judge to apologize and pay motion legal fees to Sequoia Voting Systems in Reed Guscoria , et al. , Plaintiffs vs. James E. McGreevey , et al. , Defendant
And , on the company 's blog , written by VP of Communications and External Affairs Michelle Shafer , she continues the lie :
VIOLATION OF PROTECTIVE ORDER IN NJ BY PRINCETON'S ANDREW APPEL , AN APOLOGY AND PAYMENT OF LEGAL FEES TO SEQUOIA .
In an email to this writer , Professor Appel responded to what he says are " false statements about me in two recent press releases " from Sequoia .
The BRAD BLOG posts his response in full below , with his express permission ...
Sequoia Voting Systems , Inc. has made false statements about me in two recent press releases .
They claim that I violated a Protective Order ; they claim that I was ordered to apologize to Sequoia ; and they claim that the Court ordered sanctions against me .
None of these is true .
On November 21 , 2008 , I agreed to a consent decree , apologizing to the Court , not to Sequoia , " to the extent the terms of the protective order were not complied with . "
Judge Feinberg said on the record that this is " not a sanction . "
Judge Feinberg never concluded that I violated the order , notwithstanding her preliminary statements ( quoted by Sequoia ) about her preliminary inclinations prior to the full hearing .
The Protective Order in question is a complicated and ambiguous document ( much more so than other Protective Orders that I have been bound by when serving as an expert witness in other cases , such as the New York v. Microsoft antitrust case ) .
The P.O. has two goals , broadly speaking : ( 1 ) for an unlimited time , to prevent leakage of Sequoia 's trade - secret Source Code and other trade - secret Confidential Information
( 2 ) for a limited time , to prevent the release of , and public discussion of , the conclusions of my examination -- until 30 days after I delivered it to the Court , to the State defendants , and to Sequoia -- so that those parties could have time to prepare their response .
I have never leaked Sequoia 's trade - secret Source Code .
I did not release my report before the date ordered by the Court .
I did not discuss my conclusions in the media before that date .
Sequoia is making its accusations based on two incidents that Sequoia interprets as violations of the Protective Order , but that I do not believe are violations .
( 1 ) In August 2008 , I asked Professor Edward Felten , who was also serving as an expert witness for the Plaintiffs , to review my report .
Since the report did not contain trade - secret information , and since his review of my report did not constitute " publicizing in any media " , there is no violation there .
( 2 ) One day before the authorized release date , in an affidavit filed in a Louisiana Court , I mentioned the existence of that report and characterized in one or two sentences one conclusion of that report ; this conclusion overlapped with statements I had already in public over a year previously .
There was no public discussion of this affidavit either in the media or in the blogosphere , and certainly not in the 24 hours between the time it was filed in a Louisiana Court and the time that the New Jersey Court authorized public release of my report .
Thus I believe there is no violation there either .
Sequoia may believe that these are violations ; the Court did not reach any such conclusion .
Sequoia should not continue to falsely claim that the Court sanctioned me for these incidents , nor that the Court ordered me to apologize to Sequoia , or that I did so .
None of these assertions is true .
Andrew W. Appel
Princeton , New Jersey
December 24 , 2008
Appel 's analysis of New Jersey 's Sequoia Advantage ( touch - screen ) voting systems was ordered by a court following problems with the system during the state 's Super Tuesday primary in dozens of counties were vote totals were misreported .
In March of this year , Sequoia threatened Appel with a lawsuit if he dared carry out an inspection of their faulty systems , as requested by NJ 's county clerks .
In April of this year , the problems on NJ's voting systems were found by another Princeton scientist to be worse than originally thought .
Beyond NJ , it was a very bad year for Sequoia ( and for the voters forced to use their systems ) .
Following the problems in NJ , their own website was hacked .
Late this year , the D.C. Board of Elections found their paper - based optical - scanned system added thousands of " phantom votes " in a single precinct , and in Palm Beach County , FL their op - scanners had trouble counting the same ballots the same way twice .
Appel has long been a thorn in Sequoia 's side .
In February of 2007 , after buying several Sequoia Advantage systems online for $ 86 ( the state had paid more than $ 8,000 for each of them ) , he was able to hack them in minutes time .
And just last week , Appel posted a video showing how he was able to easily defeat security seals used by Sequoia to protect their systems from malicious tampering .
Furthermore , in an investigative BRAD BLOG exposé last May , we revealed the fact that Sequoia does not even own the intellectual property rights to its own voting systems , despite their claims in public and in the courts .
Rather , those rights are owned by the Brazilian firm Smartmatic , which Sequoia had claimed to divest from following a federal probe last year .
A powerful Iranian cleric Friday warned President Obama to stay away from the harsh rhetoric of the Bush administration in dealing with the Islamic Republic ’s nuclear program .
Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former Iranian president now head of two important religious councils , told thousands gathered for a weekly sermon before prayers in Tehran that Iran was listening closely for signs of change from Washington .
“ We are still waiting for the new U.S. administration to declare its wise stand , since otherwise they would waste another few years of our time by repeating Bush ’s words regarding the need for Iran to halt its nuclear program , threatening us , or offering impractical , unclear promises , ” said Rafsanjani , according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency .
He said that if Obama improves relations with Iran , the U.S. could count on “ Iran ’s cooperation ” in resolving “ regional problems . ”

Rafsanjani spoke two days after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran would be open to talks provided the U.S. changes its Mideast policies .
Rafsanjani is considered a relative moderate within Tehran ’s circle of power and a rival to Ahmadinejad .
On Thursday , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters in Washington that Obama “ has n’t changed his viewpoint that he should preserve all his options ” regarding Iran ’s nuclear program .
Gibbs also rebuffed a report in Britain ’s Guardian newspaper citing unnamed diplomats describing several draft letters to Iran being pondered by the White House and State Department to break the diplomatic ice with the Islamic Republic .
The Guardian report said the letter would be a response to a congratulatory note from Ahmadinejad .
Relations with the U.S. are a hot - button issue in Iran ahead of the May presidential vote ; Ahmadinejad confirmed this week that he would seek reelection .
Polls have shown that most Iranians favor better ties .
Ever wonder whether the people who brag about their small business wealth are really living the high life ?
Most of what you read on the web about starting your own business tends to be over glorified because everyone is always trying to sell you something .
When all you see are get rich quick tag lines everywhere , it ’s no wonder that many people have misconceptions about what it ’s like to run your own business .
I ’ve already given you a sneak peek into my glamorous life as a small business owner .
Do n’t get me wrong though , I ’m absolutely 100 % pro-entrepreneurship and pro-small business .
But while I strongly advocate giving entrepreneurship a chance , I do n’t think it ’s the right choice for everyone .
There are many trade offs involved .
Depending on what you value in your lifestyle , these trade offs may or may not be worth it to you .
Based on my own experiences , I will try and provide you with an honest account of the lifestyle trade offs I make from day to day .
I will begin with the negative aspects since you ’ve probably heard the positives ones many times already .

The Payouts Are Unpredictable
One of the biggest negatives about depending on income made from your own business is that your earnings are inherently unpredictable .
Especially if your business is brand new , chances are that you ’ll have absolutely no clue how much you will make in any given month .
This makes expense planning and budgeting extremely difficult , not to mention stressful .
Imagine having to cover your mortgage , education and everyday expenses based solely on sales projections and guesswork .
Imagine trying to make a large purchasing decision that requires financing when you have very little idea whether you ’ll be able to make the monthly payment .
My wife and I would like to buy a house one of these days .
The problem is that we can never be 100 % sure how much we can afford because the revenue from our linens store is extremely bursty .
For example , most of our business is made during the wedding and holiday season and the periods in between can be slow .
( This is when my neurotic side kicks in ) .
I ’m hoping that with time , we ’ll be able to accurately predict our revenues , but right now we ’re not quite there yet .
Fortunately , I still have my day job which makes our income somewhat more predictable .
Emergencies May Take You Away From Leisure
Every business will have its share of fires that need to be put out .
Sometimes these fires can come at inopportune times .
For example , my wife and I have had to wake up extremely early in the morning on a Saturday in order to prep emergency orders for our customers .
Sometimes , we screw an order up and have to rush things in order get a replacement product out to the customer .
There have been times when these fires have prevented us from going out with our friends .
For example , we had to cancel our child ’s play date several weeks ago because we had to deal with a bridal emergency .
Granted , these fires do n’t pop up very often , but they can be extremely disruptive to your plans .
In the beginning when you are trying to establish your business from scratch , you can pretty much kiss your social life goodbye .
My wife and I probably went about 3 months without seeing any of our friends in order to launch our store .
Fortunately , this start up phase is only temporary and once you are past it , things start to settle down .
You Have To Deal With Customers
Depending on the nature of your business , you may have to deal with customers directly .
While I ’d say 99 % of our customers are extremely pleasant to work with , the 1 % that are unpleasant are the customers that l remember the most .
If you want to know about some of the customers that we deal with on a day to day business , be sure to check out our customer stories .
In any case , dealing with customers can be extremely draining and humbling .
You may have to endure bouts of verbal abuse .
You may have to bend over backwards to make a customer happy .
Sometimes , you ’ll get tormented .
We had one customer who threatened to bad mouth our store all over the internet if we did n’t agree to his ridiculous terms .
If you are not used to dealing with this sort of abuse , then you could be in for a shock .
Fortunately , I was married for 3 years prior to starting the business so I was prepared : )
You Feel Personally Responsible
With a regular day job , you never feel personally responsible for things that are beyond your control .
For example , if you ’re an engineer and your company ’s marketing team makes a critical mistake in positioning the product that you designed , you might be disappointed but you probably would n’t lose sleep over it .
When you own your own business though , you ’ll stress out over everything , even the things that are beyond your control .
Your livelihood depends on the proper execution of your business plan so there are no excuses .
Every little thing becomes your problem and you have to suck it up and deal with it .
Your Hours Are Unpredictable
Unlike a day job , there is no notion of a weekend .
In fact , all of the days kind of blend together .
You will need to put in as many hours as necessary in order to accomplish your goals .
Our wedding linens business requires about 3 hours a day of my wife ’s time on average .
She has to put in these 3 hours on weekends as well .
If business is especially strong , sometimes she ’ll work for 8 hours .
Sometimes , it gets so busy that both of us have to put in longer hours as well .
The time we devote to the business is inherently unpredictable .
The main advantage of the business is that we can time shift all of the work .
For example , we can save up 3 days worth of work and put in a single 9 hour work day .
This gives us the flexibility to manage our time as we see fit .
The other advantage is that we can hire people to help us out .
Imagine trying to hire someone to do your job for you at your day job .
It just would n’t fly .
Is It Worth It ?
As a wise Bleu Panda once said about his day job
It appears to me that although your hours working on the business may be long , you are spending that time much more purposefully .
It ’s like while I am renting time from my life , you are investing time into yours .
There is a lot of truth in this statement .
Any improvements that you make to your business tend to translate directly into your topline .
Your earning potential is virtually unlimited and you have the option of working at your own pace .
You will also experience a sense of personal satisfaction when you run your own business as well .
Even though I have to deal with irate customers from time to time , I also get to speak with extremely thoughtful customers as well .
Some of these customers have said such nice things about our store that I ’ve blushed while on the phone .
In retrospect , while I can acknowledge the disadvantages , the positives of running your own business far outweigh the negatives .
Give it shot !
Worse case scenario , you ’ll learn something about yourself that you never knew before .

Labyrinths and mazes can be found around the world and they are important cultural works , offering rich insights into our history and the human psyche .
In Greek mythology , the labyrinth was designed by Daedalus to imprison the Minotaur ; but the labyrinth serves a symbolic meaning , as well .
“ Walking the labyrinth ” is said to be a deeply personal and revealing meditative experience by which a person gains insights into their true nature .
Mazes , by contrast , are designed to be a strategic challenge ; they are one of humankind ’s original physical puzzle games .
Unlike a labyrinth , which is designed to be contemplative but easy to complete , a maze is intentionally difficult to navigate .
Both labyrinths and mazes symbolically reveal two sides of the human spirit : complexity and simplicity ; mystery and design ; intuition and sensory experience .
They are emblematic of the eternal philosophical tension between free will and fate .
Here are some of the most complex , beautiful , and creative mazes and labyrinths around the world .
Dole Plantation
( Image via cosmickid99 )
The world ’s longest maze is at the Dole Plantation on Oahu , Hawai’i .
Comprised of 11,400 tropical native plants and covering 3.11 miles , Dole has not only created the largest maze on earth ; the company has taken it online where you can attempt to navigate the maze virtually .
Reignac - sur - Indre
( Image via lesbazeilles )
Called the largest plant maze in the world , the ever - changing maze at Reignac - sur - Indre , France blossoms into a brilliant field of sunflowers in summer and in winter is remarked and sown to reappear as a new design in spring .
In 1996 , the maze ’s debut year , over 85,000 people attempted to find passage through the 10 - acre puzzle .
Cherry Crest Adventure Farm
( Image via Amazing Maze )
The corn field maze at Cherry Crest is so challenging , two full time “ Maze Masters ” remain on site to guide lost tourists attempting to solve the puzzle and make their way through the maze ’s 2.5 miles of paths , bridges and twisty turns .
Snakes ‘n Ladders
( Image via Daily Mail )
A creative twist on the standard maze , one enterprising designer , Michael Blee , built the world ’s largest snakes ‘n ladders game – it covers a 6 acre plot ( it ’s his tenth and largest to date ) .
The hedges are all at least 9 feet high , assuring a very challenging game for those who play .
Davis Mega Maze
The Davis Farmland Mega Maze is unique in that it changes completely from year to year !
Whether it ’s a king ’s crown , a dinosaur or a city skyline , visitors never know what they ’ll be navigating next .
Longleat
( Image via Longleat )
Longleat ‘s classically beautiful 16,000 yew trees form a hedge maze in the U.K. that covers 1.48 acres and nearly 2 miles of paths .
The wooden bridges built into the massive puzzle reveal an unusual feature : Longleat is a three - dimensional maze .
Ashcombe
The famous maze at Ashcombe is Australia ’s oldest maze , and there ’s plenty to do there along with the challenging maze .
Nearby gardens offer a rose maze in addition to the traditional hedge mazes that have evolved over some 30 years of development .
Richardson Castle
( Image via Richardson Farm )
The Richardson Farm has a number of large corn mazes , but the fairy tale castle is perhaps the most … enchanting .
The mazes change annually , and this castle is now closed , but it ’s thrilling to view regardless .
Hampton Court Maze
The oldest hedge maze in Britain is the Hampton Court maze ; not so huge , perhaps , but amazing considering that it was built in 1689 and is written about in novels and poems .
Hundreds of thousands of people visit this maze that was created during the time of William of Orange .
The Imprint
The Imprint is an homage to the original mythical story of the maze : the foot is meant to represent a colossus , or minotaur ’s foot .
Built in 1975 in Gloucester , The Imprint receives thousands of visitors every year .
Grace Cathedral
( Image via Grace Cathedral )
The Grace Cathedral labyrinths in San Francisco , CA show the varied forms that mazes and labyrinths can take .
Rather than taking organic forms in plants or trees , these architecturally designed stone and tile labyrinths – both an indoor and outdoor labyrinth are located at the cathedral – offer an inspiring chance for spiritual contemplation in the midst of the bustling city .
Lands End Labyrinth
Also in the Bay Area is the famous Lands End Labyrinth .
From this stunning vista one can see the Golden Gate Bridge , all of the Bay , Angel Island , and the San Francisco skyline .
It ’s known the world over to spiritual seekers and labyrinth lovers as a place of unsurpassed beauty and tranquility .
The Movie
( Image via source and astrolog )
Technically this was mere set prop , not a permanent labyrinth , but the 1986 movie starred Jennifer Connelly , so it ’s surely worth inclusion .
Victoria Park Water Maze
( Image via knautia )
This water maze is beautiful when filled with rainwater .
It is distinctive because it is a Chartres Maze .
This special type of maze is based upon Christian mythology , and it features a clear cross - like symbology ( at right , below ) which the believer is meant to walk in a particular pattern ( as shown at left below ) .

Brick Maze of Capri

This impressive brick maze is n’t so tricky to navigate , perhaps , but it was certainly tricky to build .
Stone masonry and careful engineering design have resulted in a beautiful feat of maze architecture on the famed resort island of Capri .
The Sirius Star made its maiden voyage in March of this year Somali pirates have seized a giant Saudi - owned oil tanker in the Indian Ocean and are steering it towards Somalia , the US Navy reports .
The Sirius Star is the biggest ship ever to be hijacked , with a capacity of 2 m barrels - more than one - quarter of Saudi Arabia 's daily output .
The vessel was captured on Saturday some 450 nautical miles ( 830 km ) off the Kenyan coast .
Its international crew of 25 , including two Britons , is said to be safe .
US
Navy officials said the hijacking was unprecedented and marks a fundamental shift in their capabilities .
' Holding hostages ' Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , said the pirates were well trained .
" They 're very good at what they do , " he told a Pentagon briefing in Washington .
" Once they get to a point where they can board , it becomes very difficult to get them off , because , clearly , now they hold hostages . "

Life in Somalia 's pirate town From cutlass to AK - 47 The US Navy said the ship was " nearing an anchorage point " at Eyl , a port often used by pirates based in Somalia 's Puntland region .
War - torn Somalia has not had an effective government since 1991 .
News of the attack raised crude oil prices on global markets following an earlier slump , Reuters news agency reported .
The capture , south - east of Mombasa , is highly unusual both in terms of the size of the ship and the fact it was attacked so far from the African coast , BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says .
He says that such hijackings are usually resolved peacefully through negotiations but , given the high profile of this event and the value of the cargo , there is always the possibility of some kind of military response .
Attacks on shipping off the Horn of Africa and Kenya by mainly Somali pirates seeking ransoms prompted foreign navies to send warships to the area this year .
A number of vessels and their crews have been held captive for months , including the Ukrainian freighter MV Faina , seized in September .
' Crew safe '
The supertanker was heading for the US via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa , Reuters reports .
THE SIRIUS STAR
Nearly the length of a US aircraft carrier Weighs more than three times as much as a carrier when loaded Can carry 2 million barrels of oil - more than 25 % of Saudi Arabia 's daily output
Is third tanker , and biggest vessel , to be hijacked in the region
Life in Somalia 's pirate town
The route around the Cape of Good Hope is a main thoroughfare for fully - laden supertankers from the Gulf .
With a capacity of 318,000 dead weight tonnes , the ship is 330 m ( 1,080 ft ) long and is classed as a Very Large Crude Carrier .
It is about as long as a US aircraft carrier and , when loaded , weighs more than three times as much .
" It 's the largest ship that we 've seen pirated , " said Lt Christensen .
The South Korean - built Sirius Star , owned by the Saudi company Aramco , made its maiden voyage in March 2008 .
The ship 's operator , Vela International , said that all of the crew were reported to be safe .
" Vela response teams have been mobilised and are working to ensure the safe release of crew members and the vessel , " it added .
Confirming that two Britons were aboard the tanker , the UK Foreign Office said it could not give any details of their role on the ship .
" We are seeking more information on the incident , " a spokesman said .
The other crew are said to be from Croatia , the Philippines , Poland and Saudi Arabia .
Captive vessels Figures from the International Maritime Bureau show that attacks in the area - the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean off the African coast - have made up one - third of all piracy incidents worldwide in 2008 .
In the first nine months of the year 63 incidents were reported .
As of 30 September , 12 vessels remained captive and under negotiation with more than 250 crew being held hostage .
Pirates remain active and regularly strike in the region .
In the past week alone : • A Russian warship in the Gulf of Aden drove off pirates who tried to capture the Saudi Arabian merchant ship Rabih • Pirates hijacked a Japanese cargo ship off Somalia • A Chinese fishing boat was seized off the Kenyan coast • A Turkish ship transporting chemicals to India was hijacked off Yemen • The UK's Royal Navy shot dead two suspected pirates attacking a Danish cargo - ship off the coast of Yemen

Terje Isungset 's instruments all have a tale to tell .
The Norwegian composer 's mouthharp is made of metal taken from a second world war German bomber .
His double - bass was bought off a barfly for two beers .
Then there 's the instrument with the longest story of all , an instrument that has to be kept in a freezer .
So what does a trumpet carved from a 2,500 - year - old glacier sound like ?
" Very warm , " says Isungset , rummaging in the deep freeze at the lockup near his house in Bergen .
He keeps some ice shards in there , too ; they 're played like tubular bells .
" They have deep , rich tones .
When I first heard them , I was eager to experiment . "
Isungset is in the UK this Christmas , for a rather unlikely gig : he 's performing his music in an adaptation of Cinderella at the Lyric in London .
To bring out the story 's mystical ice element , his on - stage arsenal includes a glass drumkit , waterphone ( an arrangement of brass rods and water that is drummed or bowed ) , ram 's horn , the ice trumpet ( which has been treated so as not to melt , or freeze to his lips ) and bicycle wheel , as well as stones , wood , mouth harp and piano frame .
" We try to create music , magic moments together .
We try and tune in to each other , " says Isungset of his relationship with the cast .
How Isungset came to play and record with ice is a long story that began two decades ago , when he was in his mid-20s .
After working with 14 bands , he decided to completely " dismantle " his life as a drummer .
" I had this feeling I was n't giving music something that was n't already there , " he says .
" I started to search , working hard at the idea of balance with the body - making the instrument and myself a unit .
Trying , for instance , to hit the drum with my hands , without hurting myself .
I abandoned all musical rules .
Just pure expression : trying to lose the ego and the thoughts . "
Isungset realised that if he truly wanted to escape musical traditions , he would have to transform his instruments .
He started tinkering with the " found " sounds of stone and glass , building them into what became totally improvised performances .
Today , he works with bands as diverse as Enslaved ( prog metal ) and Groupa ( traditional Swedish songs ) , but this time the deal is clear : " They do n't ask me to play like any other drummer .
They know my sound . "
It 's a sound that seems to take you outdoors and into the elements , wherever you are .
Stone and metal give off long , primal resonances , while ice adds warmth .
Some years ago , Isungset was commissioned to write a work for the Frozen Water Fall festival in Lillehammer , a lakeside town ringed by mountains .
Keen to use materials from the surrounding area , he tried ice - and got hooked .
Since then , he has recorded five " ice " albums , including Iceman Is , which features a number of great Scandinavian jazz players : Arve Henriksen on ice trumpet , Iro Haarla on ice harp , trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg and vocalist Lena Willemark .
In 2007 , Isungset 's album Igloo was nominated for a Norwegian Grammy .
" We build igloos to record in , " he explains .
" The nice thing about them is the total silence inside .
Some of the ice sounds are so delicate , I have problems with noises my stomach makes : you can hear it grumbling .
At least you know when to stop for lunch . "
The normal logistics of performing music are tricky enough ; Isungset 's approach , requiring him to be a slave to nature , adds quite an extra burden - but it's one that he relishes : " We travel to a place , find ice , then carve the instruments there , play the concerts , and then give the instruments back to nature where they belong .
You can have 100 pieces of ice ; they will all sound different .
Perhaps three will sound fantastic .
Nature decides whether it 's possible to play or not : if it 's too mild or windy , we can 't . "
Climbing back up to his house , which backs on to the woods embracing Bergen , Isungset stops and says : " I come here and listen to the distant city .
There 's a big orchestra going on down there , with different soloists . "
A woodpecker gives a call .
" Birds - great jazz musicians .
I did a concert using birdsong once . "
Next year , Isungset will be playing at an architectural conference , making music out of building materials , " wearing a hard hat , of course " .
In the meantime , if he comes across Cinderella 's glass slipper , chances are he 'll get a tune out of it .
Cinderella is at the Lyric Hammersmith , London W6 , until January 3 .

Border agents would need to be able to say why they suspect an American has committed a crime before searching their laptops and smartphones and could not make copies of any information without a court order , if legislation introduced this week gains passage .
The so - called Travelers ' Privacy Protection Act ( .pdf ) , introduced in the Senate by Senators Russ Feingold ( D - Wisconsin ) and Maria Cantwell ( D - Washington ) on Monday , would roll back portions of the current policy , which gives border agents the right to search or seize anyone 's laptop as if it were just another piece of luggage .
“ Most Americans would be shocked to learn that upon their return to the U.S. from traveling abroad , the government could demand the password to their laptop , hold it for as long as it wants , pore over their documents , e-mails , and photographs and examine which websites they visited – all without any suggestion of wrongdoing , ” Feingold said .
Homeland Security recently published its official guidance ( .pdf ) to inspectors on its website , making it clear that inspectors do n't need any reason at all to inspect a traveler 's electronics .
Civil libertarians contend that a laptop is closer to an extension of a person 's mind , rather than an analog of a luggage bag .
Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff says the current practices at the border closely track what Feingold wants and that the procedures are legal and necessary to enforce the law .
Federal appeals court have largely backed the government 's position that the border searches are reasonable .
Feingold 's bill would require a court order to hold a laptop for longer than a day and restricts when the government can keep and share copies of a traveler 's data .
But Chertoff opposes new rules , saying they would lead to crippling litigation , restrictive policies and eventually a terrorist attack .
Rep. Adam Smith ( D - Washington ) introduced an identical bill in the House .
Given the little time left in this year 's Congress , there 's little chance the measure will become law before 2009 , but its introduction makes it clear that the issue remains alive and will be revisited next year , regardless of who wins the presidency .

heya -unify : back to JS --
As programmers we rarely have a luxury to write a project from scratch .
Usually we have to retrofit existing projects with all cool things we need .
If a new component , or a library we want to use introduces new concepts that bleed outside its boundary , we have a “ culture clash ” , when old code is unaware about new concepts have to work with it anyhow .
Sometimes the clash is so bad that we have to give up on using shiny new things , or have to significantly rework their code , which requires time and efforts we cannot afford .

heya-unify : incomplete objects -- Incomplete objects allow us to concentrate on important properties of JavaScript objects ignoring the rest : we do n’t need to specify every single property , and we can deal with cyclical graphs .
Incomplete arrays is a complimentary feature to inspect only the first few array items .
Both features are very useful for patterns , and heya - unify provides rich facilities to automate creating incomplete objects : they can be marked up explicitly on per-instance basis , recursively with a special utility , and we can specify how to deal with objects by default during unification .

heya-unify : custom unification -- Custom unification in heya - unify allows us to deal with our specific objects in JavaScript , create unification helpers , and even custom logical conditions .
It is there to bridge unification with our existing projects .
Looking at the 1st part and the 2nd part of the series is recommended before diving into details .
Custom unification Unification makes comparing simple objects a cinch no matter how complex they are , and we can easily apply it to JSON - like trees as is .

Unification for JS -- Unification is a very interesting programming tool .
Originated from logical programming ( its the foundation of Prolog ) and used in functional programming ( e.g. , Haskell ) it helps to compare objects for equality , identify known patterns , and reassemble results differently .
Wikipedia gives a somewhat complex definition of unification , but many people see it as an extended equivalence comparison , a pattern matching tool , and some even find parallels with XPath queries , CSS , and even jQuery , all operating on regular objects .

Serve files with nginx conditionally -- Time and again working on big web applications we customize files based on user ’s platform , and their preferences .
We can send different files to legacy browsers , different CSS and JS to mobile browsers depending on their form factor , different images to accomodate bandwidth requirements , and so on .
This post was prompted by my desire to serve sprites produced by grunt - tight - sprite as WebP images to WebP - capable browsers falling back to “ classic ” image formats for the rest using nginx .

CG : code generation in JavaScript ClubAjax invited me to speak about technologies behind Heya , specifically about code generative solutions behind heya - pipe .
Pipes are built on a firm foundation of functional programming ( FP ) , and it allows us to use a wide range of technologies to optimize their performance including generating code on the fly ( code generation AKA CG ) .
As soon as we are talking about CG , the first question to ask is : “ How to debug such code ?

Switched to Octopress After 8 years I decided to switch to Octopress .
Being a server - less framework , it allows my web site to scale better , and , the most important thing for me , reduces expences on administring an active server ( less active components to update ) .
An additional bonus is that it reduces requirements for a web site host , which allows me to be more flexible when selecting a hosting company .
All old links are supposed to work as they used to be redirecting to new URLs .

A man from Minnesota , who just came out of a detox center , decided to still a car that belonged to an undercover deputy .
According to Crow Wing County Sheriff 's Department the 20 - year - old Christopher Wayne Schwarz simply wanted to get home but chose the wrong method .
The man was arrested after being chased for less than half an hour , reported the Brainerd Dispatch .
Schwarz faces charges of fleeing a peace officer and stealing a motor vehicle .
Sheriff Todd Dahl said that in case one wants to find the shortest way to jail than the method applied by the young man is probably the quickest .
" You always read about something like this happening somewhere else , or see it on television , but you 'd never think it would happen here , " he said .
Originally the man was arrested at the county detox center .

Dahl stated that the center 's staff called policed to help get the man into a seclusion room .
In the mid-afternoon Schwarz was released , United Press International reports .
The sheriff said that someone forgot to take the keys out of the car 's ignition , which led to Schwarz using the keys to make his getaway .
Fry ’s Electronics Inc. , known as a nerd nirvana for its quirky stores and vast gadget selection , has fired a top executive accused of taking more than $ 65 million in kickbacks from vendors to finance his high - rolling lifestyle and pay gambling debts .
In a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in San Jose this week , the Internal Revenue Service said Ausaf Umar Siddiqui , 42 , set up a shell company to conceal the payments from five Fry ’s vendors from January 2005 to November 2008 .
The IRS alleges that Siddiqui cut side deals with suppliers to buy their goods at higher prices and in larger quantities than the retail chain normally would have .
An employee of the privately held chain tipped off the IRS in October after stumbling on spreadsheets detailing the kickbacks in Siddiqui ’s office , the IRS said .
Siddiqui , who goes by Omar , was vice president of merchandising and operations at Fry ’s and oversaw the team responsible for buying the goods sold in 34 stores in nine states .
He was arrested at the company ’s headquarters in San Jose on Friday and appeared in court Monday , said Arlette Lee , spokeswoman for the IRS ’ Criminal Investigation division .
His attorney , Sam Polverino , declined to comment .

Siddiqui ’s money troubles came to light in a San Jose federal courtroom as defense lawyers argued for lower bail because of liens against his Ferrari and $ 1 - million Palo Alto condominium .
Siddiqui was released on a $ 300,000 bond and was ordered to wear an electronic ankle bracelet .
The source of his troubles appears to be gambling .
Siddiqui paid $ 122 million in three years to entities related to Las Vegas Sands Corp. , owner of the Venetian Casino Resort , and the MGM Grand casino , according to bank statements cited in the complaint .
The casinos declined to comment .
Siddiqui ’s arrest stunned management and employees at Fry ’s , company spokesman Manuel Valerio said .
But the alleged kickback scheme did not cause “ irreparable harm ” to the company ’s finances and did not result in customers paying more for products , he said without further explanation .
Fry ’s is cooperating in the investigation “ to expose any others involved in this illegal activity , ” Valerio said .
It will continue to do business with the vendors who allegedly paid kickbacks unless it learns something “ troubling or improper , ” he said .

The vendors were not named as defendants and could not be reached for comment .
The IRS plans to interview them , Lee said .
According to Forbes magazine , in 2007 Fry ’s had 14,000 employees and revenue of $ 2.35 billion .
The retailer was founded in 1985 in Sunnyvale , Calif. , by three Fry brothers , John , Randy and Dave , and family friend Kathy Kolder , as a one - stop shopping destination for discerning techies , taking high - tech gadgetry to a new plane .
Fry ’s sells more than 50,000 electronics items in stores that range in size from 50,000 square feet to more than 180,000 square feet and have different themes such as outer space or the Wild West .
The company established itself as a major player in the increasingly rough - and - tumble electronics and computer - parts market in large part thanks to the sales acumen of John Fry .
Fry ’s shelf space is of great value to vendors because of the famously heavy foot traffic .
Siddiqui , who was hired in 1988 as a computer salesman , worked his way up to becoming vice president of merchandising and operations in 2003 .
In that capacity , he supervised a staff of 120 and earned an annual salary of $ 225,000 , according to the complaint .

His employment contract prohibited him from receiving kickbacks from vendors , and Fry ’s was unaware of the backroom deals Siddiqui struck , the IRS said .
Siddiqui persuaded
Fry ’s executives to allow him to act as the middleman between vendors and Fry ’s , a task usually performed by independent sales representatives , the complaint said .
Independent contractors are typically used so that neither vendor nor retailer receives favorable treatment ; they usually receive commissions from 3 % to 8 % .
Siddiqui guaranteed that he would keep vendors ’ products on shelves at Fry ’s in exchange for commissions of as much as 31 % paid to a shell company he set up called PC International , the IRS alleged .
The documents found on Siddiqui ’s desk detailed 70 wire transfers from five suppliers , the complaint said .
The IRS said it also uncovered evidence from Siddiqui ’s trash .

A criminal complaint is the first step in securing an indictment .
Lee said the government had 20 days to file formal charges .
Siddiqui is expected to be charged next month on counts of money laundering and wire fraud .
A spokesman for the U.S. attorney ’s office declined to comment .

Analemma Over the Porch of Maidens
Credit & Copyright : Anthony Ayiomamitis ( TWAN )
Explanation :
If you took a picture of the Sun at the same time each day , would it remain in the same position ?
The answer is no , and the shape traced out by the Sun over the course of a year is called an analemma .
The Sun 's apparent shift is caused by the Earth 's motion around the Sun when combined with the tilt of the Earth 's rotation axis .
The Sun will appear at its highest point of the analemma during summer and at its lowest during winter .
Today , the Winter Solstice day in Earth 's northern hemisphere , the Sun is at the bottom of the analemma .
Analemmas created from different latitudes would appear at least slightly different , as well as analemmas created at a different time each day .
This particular analemma was built up by 46 separate Sun photographs taken during 2003 in Athens , Greece .
Pictured in the foreground of this composite image are pillars called the Porch of Maidens , part of the ancient Erechtheum which was completed in 407 BC .

Women and War : A Myth in the Making
April 29 , 2003
by Carey Roberts
A new tale is being spun in the the never - ending saga of female victimology .
This new chapter of feminist " herstory " advances the thesis that women are the primary victims of war .
The myth started back in 1998 , when Hillary Clinton said this humdinger at the First Ladies ' Conference on Domestic Violence : Women have always been the primary victims of war .
Women lose their husbands , their fathers , their sons in combat .
Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known .
Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes , more frequently in today 's warfare , victims .
Two years later , this viewpoint reached the highest levels , when the UN Security Council passed Resolution Number 1325 .
This Resolution expressed the " concern that civilians , particularly women and children , account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict " .
And the United Nations Development Program now makes this claim about the situation in Iraq : However , as is often the case in times of crisis , women are bearing the brunt of years of war and sanctions in Iraq .
These statements reek of terminal silliness .
First , almost all combatants in war are male .
Therefore , military men ( and sometimes boys ) bear the direct health consequences of war -- death , dismemberment , and lingering psychological disability .
Second , innocent civilian men are often targeted by opposing forces for elimination , in order to prevent these men from later taking up arms to defend their womenfolk and children .
Dr. Adam Jones has documented this recurring tragedy in Indonesia , Bangladesh , Cambodia , and Rwanda .
More recently , a Men's Health America report documented the selective brutalization of innocent civilian men in Afghanistan .
And third , men are the primary victims during reconstruction efforts before unexploded ordnance can be cleared out .
For example , one Red Cross report documented that 93 % of landmine victims in Afghanistan were male .
It 's often true that among war refugees , women outnumber men .
But amidst the haunting pictures of female misery and despair , persons often forget the reason for this gender imbalance is that so many civilian men already have been killed off .
These men have lost what former UN Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson once called " the most precious of rights " -- the right to life .
According to the recent WHO World Report on Violence and Health , 233,000 males died of war - related injuries in 2000 , compared to 77,000 females .
That 's a 3:1 ratio that disadvantages males .
This disparity is even more pronounced in the 30 - 44 year age group , the age when fathers are busy providing for and raising their families .
If civilian females really were the primary victims of war , then surely women would be taking to the streets , waving their placards and chanting their slogans , demanding that they be sent off to war .
And Martha Burk would be protesting the Pentagon 's misogynistic policy of excluding women from front - line combat roles .
The evolving myth that women are the primary victims of war illustrates how radical feminists work to construct a separate reality .
They can't afford to let logic and common sense stand in the way of a rich opportunity to once again , depict women as unwitting victims of patriarchal oppression .

Vinay Gupta is a man with a novel approach to disaster relief and emergency shelters .
The Red Cross is interested .
FEMA is interested .
Does OpenSource architecture and peer - to - peer emergency response hold the key to effectively meeting people ’s needs in a disaster ?
In an interview with TreeHugger , OpenSource designer Vinay Gupta had this to say :
“ The idea that the U.S. might have to handle a city worth of refugees very suddenly should n’t be a strange thing to anybody who ’s aware of the fact that there is some risk of terrorism on a mass scale .
An organization like FEMA really has the responsibility to be able to evacuate a city worth of Americans in 24 hours if they have to be able to do so .
That capability had not been developed so it could n’t be deployed . ”
Implementing Gupta ’s emergency response plan and simple disaster shelters could develop that capability , working with FEMA , the Red Cross , and other local aid organizations .
Looking at the events surrounding the Katrina disaster , I ’d say we really need to have a plan that works next time .
The Hexayurt sounds like a phenomenal answer for sheltering displaced people , quickly .
It ’s a public domain project , OpenSource and ready to be taken to the next level .
A hexayurt is a 166 square foot “ microbuilding ” assembled from one to
two dozen 4′ x 8 ′ panels .
These panels are typically off - the - shelf
polyisocyanurate building insulation boards , as commonly found at Home
Depot and other building supply outlets for around $ 15 ea .
Harsher
climates and longer term use requirements can be met by custom runs of
this material .
The building geometry is extremely simple : the roof is
made from half - panels , and the walls are made from full panels – an
entire building requires only six straight cross - panel diagonal cuts .
There
are no framing timbers or other structural components .
The pieces are
then joined using an off - the - shelf 6 ″ wide 600 lb breaking strain
industrial box closure tape or a custom adhesive .
The entire process –
from panels in a truck to a ﬁnished building – takes about two hours the
ﬁrst time and more like one hour with an experienced team of ﬁve or six .
The design is in the public domain so can be used by anybody .
The Hexayurt ( about $ 200 to build ) is only one piece of the puzzle in coping with the emergency needs of displaced people .
The rest of the infrastructure ( sanitation , power , heat , communications ) comes next .
Take 100,000 hexayurts and an open field .
Ship no infrastructure and you have an immediate problem : open sewers contaminating any local water supplies you have .
People start dying in groups within days .
– Vinay Gupta
That infrastructure could cost as little as $ 100 per unit .
With composting ( or even bucket ) toilets , a shared solar power source with rechargers for batteries , solar water pasteurizers , solar hot water , and wood gasification stoves for heating , the temporary shelter becomes less of a hardship and more of a home base for the families .

Peer - to - Peer Emergency Response – Disastr
Disastr is a simple , clear , logical proposal for evacuating whole cities in the event of terrorism or natural catastrophe .
It is a last ditch sheltering solution for hundreds of thousands to tens of millions .
We may never need this plan , but if we do , it may save lives one day .
It relies on peer - to - peer disaster relief and commercial supply chains to provide housing , and the power of the network to coordinate relief efforts .
There is an opportunity for a major tech company ( Amazon , Google , Yahoo etc. ) to provide this service using their redundant computer clusters .
Disastr has no official status , but has been positively reviewed by the American Red Cross and FEMA .
Networked Domestic Disaster Response is a low cost approach to handling millions or tens of millions of domestic refugees in the event of a natural disaster , epidemic , industrial accident , WMD or other event .

Before They Were Famous Guess Who ?
01/26/2009
This Academy Award winning actress was voted " Best Looking " in high school .
She was named one of People magazine 's 50 most beautiful people in the world in 2001 .
He mother is Norwegian and her father is Swiss .
After graduating college with an English degree , she worked as a cocktail waitress in a strip club while trying to catch her " big break " in acting .
In one of her first film roles she appeared with another up - and - coming actor - Matthew McConaughey .
Her first high - profile romance was with actor / comedian Jim Carrey .
She once gained 20 pounds for a film role after being told she was too skinny .
* She is one of five actresses to have won the Academy Award , BAFTA Award , Golden Globe Award and SAG Award for the same performance .
The first time she won a Golden Globe Award ( she has currently won three ) , she was in the bathroom when she was announced as the winner .
Who is she ?
Continue reading for the answer .
Renee Zellweger appeared in the 1994 film " The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre " with Matthew McConaughey .
In 2000 , she starred opposite Jim Carrey in " Me , Myself & Irene , " and soon after began dating Carrey .
The two denied their relationship at first , but finally gave in and admitted it .
During casting for " Bridget Jones 's Diary , " Zellweger was told she was too skinny to play the chubby Bridget , so she very quickly embarked on gaining the required weight and learned an English accent .
She gained 20 pounds in order to complete her transformation to Bridget Jones .
In 2004 , she won the Academy Award , BAFTA Award , Golden Globe Award and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actress in the film " Cold Mountain . "
* The other four actresses are Julia Roberts for Erin Brockovich ( 2000 ) , Reese Witherspoon for Walk the Line ( 2005 ) , Helen Mirren for The Queen ( 2006 ) and Jennifer Hudson for Dreamgirls ( 2006 ) .
She won her first Golden Globe Award for her role in " Nurse Betty , " but was in the bathroom when Hugh Grant announced her name .
She later said , " I had lipstick on my teeth ! "
The Demise Of The ' Genetic Blueprint ' Metaphor
Metaphors are dangerous things .
On the one hand , it seems pretty much impossible to avoid using them , especially in rather abstract fields like philosophy and science .
On the other hand , they are well known to trick one ’s mind into taking the metaphor too literally , thereby creating problems that are not actually reflective of the reality of the natural world , but are only perverse constructs of our own warped understanding of it .
Take the metaphor of living organisms as analogous to complex artifacts , which led William Paley to articulate the most famous argument in favor of Intelligent Design -- an argument that , incidentally , has not changed in its broad philosophical outline since the early 18th century .
David Hume -- rather presciently , since he wrote before Paley -- pointed out that the metaphor is flawed .
Hume argued that living organisms are not like watches , to use Paley ’s analogy .
They are not machines that are assembled , but organic beings that develop gradually over time .
Accordingly , the ID argument of “ irreducible complexity , ” as it is known nowadays , does n’t make sense because it is based on the machine metaphor .
To put it another way , biochemist Michael Behe does n’t understand how the bacterial flagellum could have evolved because he does n’t understand evolution and insists in thinking of the flagellum as a “ propulsion engine ” analogous to those built by Evinrude .
Yet , even serious biologists ( i.e. , unlike Behe ) have been guilty of enthusiastically pushing what is clearly a flawed metaphor : the idea that the DNA sequence of an organism ’s genome is analogous to a computer “ program , ” and that it provides the “ blueprint ” for building said organism .
Hence the wild ( and , as it turns out , completely unfounded ) claim a few years ago that sequencing the human genome will tell us everything there is to know about “ making ” a human being .
The human genome has been sequenced , and what we have found is that genes , though playing a crucial causal role in development , are just one piece of a vast and as yet largely unresolved puzzle .
Ironically , the harbinger of the demise of the genetic program - blueprint metaphor is the serious study of genomics itself .
A recent article by Tanguy Chouard in Nature ( 20 November 2008 ) explains why .
Researchers are finding out that what matters is not so much individual genes , but the way networks of genes function together .
Take the example of the Bicoid gene in Drosophila : it was thought to be essential in establishing the form of the body in all insects , based on its effects on the development of body shape in fruit flies .
No such thing , as it turns out .
Once scientists looked for Bicoid - like genes in other insects they simply did not find them !
Turns out that Drosophila is an exception ( ah , the perils of “ model ” organisms ) , and that in species from wasps to beetles the job carried out by Bicoid is achieved by minor rearrangements of a large regulatory network encompassing a myriad of other genes .
According to the same article , biologists are even beginning to document how evolution transitions from one regulatory network to another .
Phylogenetically informed investigations conducted with different species of yeast , for instance , show nice intermediate stages from one arrangement to another , demonstrating that major changes at the genetic level can occur with minimal disruption of physiological or other phenotypic features .
Finally , researchers have modeled the evolution of large regulatory networks and found that any particular phenotype can be underlined by a huge number of functionally equivalent genotypes , which implies that evolution of genetic networks can often be semi-neutral with respect to the organism ’s fitness .
All of this should dispatch once and for all ideas like “ genetic program ” and “ genetic blueprint , ” thereby also dramatically undercutting any claim to genetic determinism ( as opposed to more mild “ genetic causalism , ” for lack of a better term ) .
There is no program or blueprint because the developmentally - relevant information is distributed among different levels of organization , including but not limited to the level of gene networks .
So phenotypes are truly emergent properties of gene - gene ( and of course , gene - environment ) interactions .
This is completely different from the case of human - made programs and blueprints , which feature a relationship between input and output that is much closer to a simple one - to - one mapping .
This is why living beings can evolve one complex feature after another without having to be “ redesigned ” from scratch .
Hume was right : machines are simply not good metaphors for organisms , and it is time for stubbornly reductionist biologists to move on and search for better metaphors .
In Italy , all the ancient artifacts found are considered the property of the state and should be reported to the authorities .
The law forbids selling such items and the sentences are quite harsh .
Yet , that 's exactly what a farmer in the southern part of the country did .
As he was carrying his works , he came upon a hoard of old items belonging to a 2,600 - year - old sanctuary , some of which he took home and tried to sell .
The hundreds of items were seized by the art division of the Carabinieri and the man was placed under investigation .
The discovery was made by a small lake , just outside of the town of Aprilia , about 25 miles ( 40 km ) south of the modern capital city of Rome .
A team of archaeologists will continue the dig works professionally in order to get more insight on the finding , which is believed to be a sanctuary from the 7th or 6th century BC .
Stefano De Caro , the Italian Culture Ministry 's director of archeology , thinks the pottery , part of which seems to have been brought from Greece , was a gift to a local deity , probably associated with the lake .
" These were poor people , they gave thanks for a good harvest or they prayed that there would n't be a drought , " explained De Caro for the Associated Press , as cited by MSNBC .
" At the time there were no aqueducts , so the lake meant life . "
The specialist estimates that this hoard of delicate pottery would have brought the farmer several hundreds of thousands of Euros on the black market .
The Carabinieri paramilitary police descended into the man 's house after observing some bits of pottery in the soil he dug , and they confiscated over 500 items , such as cups , consecrated vases and perfume vials .
The experts hope that these artifacts will shed more light on the activity in the region during the period before the Roman rule , when people who spoke Latin called it their home .
They were under the influence of the Etruscans , a civilization that controlled the central parts of Italy .
Now that a European Court has decided that the retention of the DNA of innocent people is illegal - what should you do now ?
Earlier this month , 17 judges on the Grand Chambers of the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) ruled unanimously that the UK is in violation of the right to respect for private and family life ( Article 8 ) by retaining the fingerprints , DNA samples and profiles of Messrs S and Marper .
Mr S was arrested at the age of 11 and charged with attempted robbery .
Mr Michael Marper was arrested and charged with harassment of his partner .
Both were arrested in 2001 , and both had their fingerprints and DNA samples taken .
Later that same year Mr S was acquitted and the case of Mr Marper was formally discontinued , as he and his partner had become reconciled and the charge was not pressed .
The court found
that the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the powers of retention of the fingerprints , cellular samples and DNA profiles of persons suspected but not convicted of offences , as applied in the case of the present applicants , fails to strike a fair balance between the competing public and private interests and that the respondent State has overstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation in this regard .
Accordingly , the retention at issue constitutes a disproportionate interference with the applicants ' right to respect for private life and cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society .
Let 's look at the consequences of this ruling .
What you can you do - as soon as you 've finished reading this article - and what is the likely impact on legislation and policies ?
Do n't delay - delete your DNA today
The ruling clearly affects the retention by England , Wales and Northern Ireland police forces of fingerprints and DNA samples , and derived DNA profiles of both those who have been acquitted and those for which a decision of no further action ( NFA ) was taken .
If you are among the estimated 573,639 to 857,366 innocents whose DNA profile is on the National DNA Database ( NDNAD ) , you should act now .
Do n't wait until the time the police will have to weed out these records and samples .
Writing to the chief of police
The first step is to write to the chief of police of the force that arrested you .
This may seem obvious , but several responses to freedom of information ( FOI ) requests we sent out as part of the research for this article , before the outcome of the S and Marper UK case was known , reveal that few individuals have gone to the trouble of asking .
At one extreme , the Warwickshire Police force has not received any requests in the last three years even though they contributed 12,263 DNA profiles to the NDNAD in the same period .
At the other end of the scale , the Metropolitan Police , which in the past three years has contributed 85,305 DNA profiles , close to a fifth of the DNA profiles added by all English and Welsh forces to the NDNAD , received only 23 , 64 and 110 requests for the removal of DNA profiles from the NDNAD , and granted 11 , 18 and 21 of these respectively for 2006 , 2007 and 2008 ( up to the end of November ) .
Even though the West Midlands Police has in recent years arrested for recorded crimes about a third the number the Met has , it has received a similar number of requests for removal : 58 , 49 and 83 , and granted 25 , 7 and 28 of these respectively for 2006 , 2007 and 2008 ( to November 21 ) .
For forces with fewer arrests such as the Cheshire , Durham or Gwent Constabularies , you can count the number of requests granted , since recording them started , on one hand .
Police guidelines ( the Retention Guidelines for Nominal Records on the Police National Computer ) ensured that received requests to get off the NDNAD were granted only exceptionally .
As a consequence of the ruling , the exceptional will have to become the norm .
Several forces do not keep a tally of the requests they receive .
For example , the Northamptonshire Police responded to our request for details : " There is no single database holding the information requested .
Some information may be held on individual custody records but manual examination would take the request over the cost limit and any results would not be conclusive in any case . "
One force , the Derbyshire Constabulary decided " As a result of your request [ I ] have asked the staff who deal with exceptional cases to consider making a record of requests and decisions . "
Dr Helen Wallace , Director of GeneWatch UK , a not - for - profit organisation that monitors developments in genetic technologies from a public interest perspective , which provided expert evidence on behalf of Messrs S and Marper to the ECHR , commented on the ruling : " [ This ] landmark decision vindicates all those innocent people who have struggled to get their DNA destroyed .
It means that there must be strict new rules to limit DNA retention and prevent misuse . "
How to write a formal request
Having decided to write to request destruction of your fingerprints and DNA samples , deletion of your DNA profile and deletion or updating of any other database records linking to this information , the next step is to figure out what you should write .
You need to include enough information so the police can identify you , the circumstances in which you were arrested ( and your fingerprints and DNA samples were taken ) , details of the NFA decision or of your acquittal , and the reason you are requesting your records to be deleted and your samples to be destroyed .
This initial letter does n't have to be long but it must be precise otherwise the police wo n't be able to deal with it .
In its FOI response , the Cheshire Constabulary explained that it " receives numerous ' requests ' for the removal of DNA , [t ] he majority of which could not be considered formal request as when asked why we should consider their request , they simply do not respond or they actually mean something different .
We would seek to clarify requests to establish the identity of the requestor and the reasons why they are requesting removal of data .
This is well before we can actually consider the merits of a request and whether or not it fits the requirements of the Exceptional Cases procedure . "
GeneWatch suggests this as a reason to " [ a ] sk for them to remove your records and destroy your DNA in the light of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights " .
You may want to send a copy of the letter to your MP and a copy of any reply to GeneWatch ( and let us know how it goes as well ) .
Another suggestion is that you may also want to argue for the police to remove your records and destroy your DNA samples in " other cases ( e.g. cautions , final warnings , spent minor convictions ) " .
Although the ECHR decision only covers people who have not been convicted , it makes clear that an interference with personal informational privacy such as the retention and use of profiles and samples must be indispensable and proportionate with the legitimate aim of the criminal justice system ( i.e. , the seriousness of the offence ) .
The Court cannot , however , disregard the fact that , notwithstanding the advantages provided by comprehensive extension of the DNA database , other Contracting States have chosen to set limits on the retention and use of such data with a view to achieving a proper balance with the competing interests of preserving respect for private life ...
The Court considers that any State claiming a pioneer role [ as the UK is ] in the development of new technologies bears special responsibility for striking the right balance in this regard .
If you 're in a situation where you find this balance has not been achieved , for example the indefinite retention for children given reprimands , then you may also benefit from this ruling .
Taking into account the ECHR ruling , the police are now likely to accept all legitimate requests as they would be in a very weak position if an innocent person were to seek a judicial review in case of refusal .
Due to the small number of requests granted prior to the ruling , the actual deletions from the NDNAD and the Police National Computer ( PNC ) and destruction of samples is a very ad - hoc process .
The Met promised a process last year and eventually did publish one ( pdf ) , but it was not worth the wait .
Here 's the process they go through : " If the decision to delete has been made , the Exceptional Cases Unit will contact the respective departments and agencies to ensure that the DNA , fingerprints and PNC records are deleted / destroyed accordingly . "
The National Police Improvement Agency ( NPIA ) realises that " following the judgement last week in the S & Marper case heard at the European Court of Human Rights the DNA sample retention and destruction requirements are being reviewed . "
At least , once a DNA profile has been deleted from the database , it would appear that these transactions are propagated to all backups in short time :
The NDNAD has both a regular internal and a regular off - site back - up procedure .
All transactions carried out on the NDNAD are backed up each working day .
The deletion of profiles from the NDNAD would be treated the same as any other NDNAD transaction within this back - up procedure .
Any record of a DNA profile will also be removed from all back - up media within 10 days of its deletion from NDNAD .
Until a comprehensive process is published giving stronger confidence in the deletion process , once you get confirmation that your request has been granted you may want to ask to be present when the physical samples are destroyed and electronic data is deleted and updated .
If you go for this , ask speedily or possibly even with your request letter , as in my case the deletion process was started before informing me of the decision !
Observing the process by a large number of individuals would be costly in time and money ; an easier alternative would be for the labs used by the police to generate DNA profiles from the samples taken from individuals to systemically destroy the DNA samples once a DNA profile has been derived .
The DNA samples are not used for identification .

Comcast does n't really have a good reputation in the BitTorrent community and it's getting worse by the day .
They now have plans to cooperate with the RIAA and disconnect alleged copyright infringers .
A worrisome development , especially since they have a tendency to accuse innocent customers .
As we have reported many times before , gathering evidence against copyright infringers is not an exact science .
Most recently , Comcast sent out an infringement notice to an innocent subscriber because their administration was not up - to - date
Dave Satz wrote in to inform us that one of his friends was served with a DMCA takedown notice a few weeks ago .
His friend , John Aprigliano , had allegedly downloaded a CAM release of “ Cadillac Records ” , without ever having heard of the movie .
Although these takedown notices are just a formality and intended to scare the recipient , John decided to contact his ISP and ask for clarification .
After four calls to Comcast support the truth came out .
The infringement notice was forwarded to the wrong person because the MAC - address of John ’s old modem was still linked to his account .
The Comcast techs eventually corrected the mistake , but this case yet again shows how inaccurate takedown notices can be .
Of course , this is just an exception , without any serious consequences .
But what if John had lived in Ireland or New Zealand ?
He could have lost his Internet connection because of a mistake like this .
Not to mention that if Comcast does n’t screw up , the companies that collect the so called evidence might – it would n’t be the first time .
The RIAA is currently trying to get ISPs all across the world , including Comcast , on board for their “ three - strikes ” or “ graduated response ” scheme .
Earlier this week ZDNet reported that AT&T and Comcast are seriously considering teaming up with the RIAA later this year to hunt down illegal filesharers .
Let ’s hope Comcast has fixed its administration by then .
The O word :
The word ' obese ' is banned from letters to parents of fat children in case it upsets them
Ministers banned the word ' obese ' on letters to the parents of fat children - because focus groups did not like it , England 's chief medical officer said today .
Professor Liam Donaldson revealed that the term was replaced on letters to parents by ' very overweight ' over fears it would upset and stigmatise fat children .
Writing on the BBC News website he said obesity had become a taboo word or an ' O word ' .
Parents of fat children will now get a letter from their school informing them their offspring are ' very overweight ' ( file photo )
The Department of Health announced in August that for the first time parents would be routinely informed if their child was clinically overweight .
Children are weighed on entering primary school ( at age four or five ) and in their final year ( aged 10 or 11 ) as part of the National Child Measurement Programme .
Parents can opt out of having their child weighed if they wish , but the vast majority do not .
Letters are then sent out to make parents aware of potential problems with their child 's weight so they go and see their doctor about it if needed .
But Professor Donaldson said that in the planning stage , a ' stumbling block ' was the wording of the feedback letter .
' At an earlier stage , some child health professionals had argued against the idea of a school - based weighing and measuring scheme because it would stigmatise overweight or obese children and lead them to being bullied .
' When the letter was field - tested with parents in focus group interviews there was a clear message that the term " obese " was unpopular .
They felt they were being personally blamed for their child 's health , and that their child would be " labelled for life " .
' The majority of these parents felt that using the term " very overweight " in combination with the associated health risks was a better approach .
Suddenly , we had stepped on eggshells . '
He added : ' Obesity has become the new cancer .
A word that is taboo , that intimidates , strikes fear , that promoted softer euphemisms .
In effect it has become an " O " word .
At the time , the National Obesity Forum described the Government 's decision not to use the word obese as ' prissy and namby pamby ' .
Professor Donaldson said it was not just children who appeared not to like being branded obese .
He recounted a meeting in 2006 which was held to discuss action on obesity .
He described it as ' downbeat ' , with people saying very little .
' After the meeting broke up , one person crept back into the room and whispered to me : " We could n't talk about it properly because someone obese was in the room " , ' he recalled .
' Today , the word obesity arouses deep feelings and provokes strong opinions .
It influences in ways that can't always be predicted . '
Prince Harry should face disciplinary action for calling an Asian soldier " our little Paki friend " , critics said last night .
The third in line to the throne apologised after film footage emerged of him making the racist comment while training at Sandhurst military academy .
The film was recorded by the prince himself three years ago when he was 21 .
Another video showed him describing another officer cadet a " rag-head " .
Campaigners said the apology did not go far enough and he should be reprimanded by the Army for his behaviour .
Other soldiers would be asked to resign immediately , critics said .

The comments triggered fresh criticism over his suitability as an Army officer .
Prince Harry , who once went to a fancy dress party as a Nazi , has rehabilitated his image in recent years , including carrying out a tour of duty on the frontline in Afghanistan .
St James 's Palace insisted that although the terms were used without malice , Prince Harry understood how offensive the term " Paki " was .
The film was obtained by the News of the World .
Prince Harry was heard speaking behind the camcorder as he videoed different colleagues .
When he passed over an Asian soldier he stopped , zoomed in , and is heard to say : " And here is our ' Paki ' friend . "
Then he moved on to someone else .
The trainee officer – identified as " Ahmed " – was unaware of the racist comment .
In a separate incident , Prince Harry , about to start training as a combat helicopter pilot , was heard saying to another officer cadet : " Fuck me , you look like a rag - head " .
The video reportedly showed the Prince on manoeuvres while still an officer cadet at Sandhurst .

The newspaper also said the Prince was filmed being disrespectful to his grandmother , the Queen , the Commander in Chief of the Army , in front of other cadets .
With his Army friends watching , he is filmed making a joke call to her , saying : " Granny , I 've got to go , got to go .
Send my love to the corgis and Grandpa . "
He signs off by saying in front of them : " Bye. God Save You ... yeah , that 's great . "
Responding to his use of the word " Paki " , a spokesman for St James 's Palace said : " Prince Harry fully understands how offensive this term can be , and is extremely sorry for any offence his words might cause .
However , on this occasion three years ago , Prince Harry used the term without any malice and as a nickname about a highly popular member of his platoon .
There is no question that Prince Harry was in any way seeking to insult his friend . "
The spokesman added : " Prince Harry used the term ' rag - head ' to mean Taliban or Iraqi insurgent . "

Royals behaving badly : A collection of princely blunders
January 2002 Prince
Harry admits smoking cannabis , but is not charged .
October 2004
The prince is involved in an altercation with a photographer outside a London nightclub .
January 2005
Harry , now aged 20 , wears a Nazi swastika , on a German Afrika Korps - style uniform , to a fancy dress party .
March 2007
After nearly coming to blows with another photographer , Prince Harry falls into a gutter outside Boujis nightclub , where he had spent the evening downing cocktails .
April 2008 Prince William uses a military Chinook helicopter to fly himself to a 72 - hour stag party for cousin Peter Phillips on the Isle of Wight , costing £ 5,000 an hour .

They were some of the most promising medicines of the 1990s -- wonder pills that appeared to fight cancer , heart disease , stroke and other ailments .
Laboratory tests and initial studies in people suggested that lowly vitamins could play a crucial role in preventing some of the most intractable illnesses , especially in an aging population .
The National Institutes of Health gave them the same treatment as top - notch pharmaceutical drugs , investing hundreds of millions of dollars in elaborate clinical trials designed to quantify their disease - fighting abilities .
Now the results from those trials are rolling in , and nearly all of them fail to show any benefit from taking vitamin and mineral supplements .
This month , two long - term trials with more than 50,000 participants offered fresh evidence that vitamin C , vitamin E and selenium supplements do n’t reduce the risk of prostate , colorectal , lung , bladder or pancreatic cancer .
Other recent studies have found that over - the - counter vitamins and minerals offer no help in fighting other cancers , stroke or cardiovascular disease .
Research has even suggested that in some circumstances , the supplements can be unsafe .
Some physicians now advise their patients not to bother with the pills , and to rely instead on a healthy diet to provide needed vitamins and minerals .
“ These things are ineffective , and in high doses they can cause harm , ” said Dr. Edgar R. Miller , a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore .
“ People are unhappy with their diets , they ’re stressed out , and they think it will help .
It ’s just wishful thinking . ”
Yet faith in vitamins runs deep .
The Council for Responsible Nutrition , a trade group in Washington , estimates that 64 % of American adults take vitamin and mineral supplements .
Despite the steady drumbeat of reports questioning their efficacy , sales have risen steadily , from $ 5 billion in 1995 to $ 10 billion this year , according to the Nutrition Business Journal .
Scientists remain convinced that vitamins are essential to health .
But they have puzzled over how their obvious benefits could be so elusive in randomized controlled trials , the gold standard of medical research .
“ You really do need vitamin E . You really do need vitamin C .
You really do need selenium , ” said Jeffrey Blumberg , director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s Antioxidants Research Laboratory at Tufts University in Boston .
“ Without them , you die . ”
Blumberg and others now believe that a combination of factors -- including the versions of vitamins that were tested and the populations they were tested in -- probably doomed the studies from the start .
“ In retrospect , maybe the expectations were a little bit unrealistic , ” said Blumberg , whose research has been funded in part by supplement makers .
Unlike observational studies , which look backward at groups of people to identify factors that are associated with a particular disease , a forward - looking randomized controlled trial has the power to show whether a particular factor can prevent the disease .
The studies rely on thousands of participants who are randomly assigned to receive a medicine or a placebo .
Researchers carefully track the participants so they can account for other factors that might affect health outcomes , such as age , diet and amount of physical activity .
After several years , the researchers compare the number of people in each group who developed a particular disease and use statistical tools to see whether the medicine made a difference .
Vitamin A and beta carotene were the first supplements to be tested that way .
In observational studies from the 1980s , researchers noticed that people who ate lots of vegetables rich in beta carotene , a form of vitamin A , were less likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer and other cancers compared with people who did n’t .
Thus , they reasoned , the vitamin supplements probably reduced the risk of lung cancer .
The thinking was , “ Let ’s get a bunch of people who smoked for 30 years and see if it ’s going to be a magic bullet for them , ” said nutritionist Andrew Shao , a vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs for the Council for Responsible Nutrition , a trade association for the supplement industry .
“ We were all guilty of wanting to go for that home - run - style randomized trial that would validate everything once and for all . ”
It did n’t .
One trial that followed 29,000 male smokers in Finland for an average of six years found that men who took beta carotene were 18 % more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer and 8 % more likely to die during the study than men who did n’t .
A second trial involved 18,000 American men and women who were smokers or former smokers or who were exposed to asbestos at work .
That study found that after an average of four years , lung cancer rates were 28 % higher among those who took beta carotene and vitamin A , and their overall risk of death during the trial jumped by 17 % .
Further research revealed that beta carotene curbs the body ’s ability to metabolize vitamin A , which is needed to keep cancer cells in check , Shao said .
Researchers tried again and again with other combinations of vitamins and minerals .
Among the multimillion - dollar studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health :
* The Women ’s Health Study followed 39,876 women for an average of 10 years .
Those who took vitamin E were just as likely to develop heart disease , stroke and a variety of cancers as the women who took a placebo , according to results published in 2005 in the Journal of the American Medical Assn .
* The Women ’s Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study tested the effects of vitamins C and E and beta carotene in 8,171 women with signs of heart disease for an average of 9.4 years .
None of the supplements had any effect , according to results published in 2007 in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
* The Physicians ’ Health Study tested vitamins C and E in 14,641 male doctors for an average of eight years and found the supplements did n’t make their hearts healthier .
The results were published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Assn .
* The Women ’s Health Initiative tracked 36,282 women for an average of seven years and found that vitamin D plus calcium did n’t protect against invasive breast cancer , according to results published last month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
Previous studies of these women found that the supplements offered modest protection against hip fractures but did n’t prevent other bone fractures or colorectal cancer .
* The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial tested those supplements in 35,533 men for more than five years and found that they did n’t reduce the risk of prostate cancer , according to results released this month in the Journal of the American Medical Assn .
The trial was halted early , in part because the supplements were associated with a slight increase in the risk of prostate cancer and diabetes .
For several reasons , researchers say , vitamins do n’t lend themselves to randomized controlled trials .
Chief among them is that there is no true placebo group when it comes to vitamins and minerals , because everyone gets some in their diet .
“ For drugs , someone either has [ the anti-impotence drug ]
Cialis in their system or he does n’t have Cialis , ” said Paul Coates , director of the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements in Bethesda , Md. But with vitamins , “ there ’s a baseline exposure that needs to be taken into account .
It makes the challenge of seeing an improvement more difficult . ”
A vitamin ’s benefit may become apparent only if people are n’t getting enough of it .
That could explain why vitamin D has been linked to reduced rates of heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
“ Most people are vitamin - D - deficient , and that ’s not true for vitamin E , ” Blumberg said .
Randomized clinical trials are designed to test one factor at a time , but vitamins and minerals consumed as part of a healthy diet work in concert with each other .
“ You do n’t eat a food that just has beta carotene in it , ” said Dr. Mary L. Hardy , medical director of the Simms / Mann UCLA Center for Integrative Oncology , who focuses on the importance of diet and supplements for cancer patients .
What ’s more , she said , vitamins manufactured into pills are not identical to vitamins that occur naturally in foods , so the clinical trials do n’t test the exact compounds that may have been key in earlier studies .
“ Is this apples and apples , or is this apples and crab apples , or is this apples and peaches ? ” said Hardy , who sits on the scientific advisory board of the company that sells Nature Made and other brands of vitamins .
“ It ’s hard to know what to say . ”
The observational studies that originally linked vitamins to better health may have been biased because people who take supplements are often healthier overall than people who do n’t .
“ They tend to be more physically active , better educated , eat better diets , and tend not to be smokers , ” Coates said .
“ So you ca n’t say for certain it ’s your item of interest that causes ” the health benefit .
The data collected by these big studies are n’t useless .
Researchers said they could spend years slicing and dicing the data to see if they can tease out a positive effect in a subgroup , such as black men over 65 or women with a family history of osteoporosis .
But no one expects the NIH -- or anyone else -- to launch studies on vitamins until more is understood about how to measure their effects in the body .
“ We clearly do n’t have much enthusiasm for investing huge amounts of money in clinical trials that are n’t going to work , ” Coates said .
Instead , some researchers have turned their attention to biomarkers that provide reliable indicators of disease risks , such as the prostate - specific antigen protein that is used to screen for prostate cancer .
Advances in personalized medicine may also allow doctors to identify people with genetic mutations that make them more likely to benefit from specific vitamins and minerals , experts said .
In the meantime , researchers will return to traditional observational studies to learn more about the role of nutrition in fighting disease .
“ I ’m really comfortable telling you to eat whole grains and fruits and vegetables and cut back on saturated fats , ” Blumberg said , “ even though we do n’t have clinical trials showing that . ”

America ’s wars of aggression against Viet Nam and Iraq might not have been waged if there had not been widespread suppression of the true story of the atrocities American troops committed in the Philippines at the end of the 19th Century .
America ’s invasion of the Philippines in 1898 in the Spanish - American War and the suppression of that nation ’s independence fighters afterwards resulted in the deaths of 4,374 U.S. troops --- about as many as have been killed in Iraq .
It also led to the deaths of 16,000 “ guerrillas ” ( indigenous Filipino resistance fighters ) and at least 20,000 civilians , writes Stephen Kinzer in his new history , “ Overthrow : America ’s Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq ” ( Times Books , Henry Holt and Co. )
The atrocities by U.S. forces , including a dreadful form of “ waterboarding , ” were so ubiquitous that novelist Mark Twain suggested redesigning the American flag by painting the white stripes black and replacing the stars with the pirate skull and crossbones .
In a review of Kinzer ’s book , Dean Lawrence Velvel of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover notes , “ The disappearance of the episode from our history books paved the way , of course , for the imperialism , and the repetition of disaster , which reached their zeniths in the disasters of , first , Viet Nam , and now Iraq , ” Velvel writes .
“ It is another of the gross distortions of the history profession … . ”
As Kinzer writes , “ The scandal over torture and murder in the Philippines , for example , might have led Americans to rethink their country ’s worldwide ambitions , but it did not .
Instead , they came to accept the idea that their soldiers might have to commit atrocities in order to subdue insurgents and win wars . ”
Despite the suppression of atrocity reports during the first half of the war , reporters got the sordid details from returning veterans .
As the Philadelphia Ledger reported in 1901 : “ Our men have been relentless ; have killed to exterminate men , women , children , prisoners and captives , active insurgents and suspected people , from lads of ten and up , an idea prevailing that the Filipino , as such , was little better than a dog …
Our soldiers have pumped salt water into men to ‘ make them talk , ’ have taken prisoner people who held up their hands and peacefully surrendered , and an hour later , without an atom of evidence to show that they were even insurrectos , stood them on a bridge and shot them down one by one … ”
Velvel writes that America made war on Spain in 1898 as part of its search for influence .
“ Christianizing heathen nations , building a strong navy , establishing military bases around the world , and bringing foreign governments under American control were never ends in themselves .
They were ways for the United States to assure itself access to the markets , resources , and investment potential of distant lands . ”
Although the U.S. economy grew tremendously during the last quarter of the 19th Century , Velvel continues , the fruits were distributed unevenly .
“ Conditions for most ordinary people were steadily deteriorating .
By 1893 , one of every six American workers was unemployed , and many of the rest lived on subsistence wages .
Plummeting agricultural prices in the 1890s killed off a whole generation of small farmers ” and “ strikes and labor riots ” broke out from New York to California . ”
American leaders clamored for an imperialist policy on grounds the country needed to resolve its “ glut ” of overproduction when , in fact , Americans lacked the means to consume .
“ The surplus production from farms and factories could have been used to lift millions out of poverty , but this would have required a form of wealth redistribution that was repugnant to powerful Americans .
Instead they looked abroad , ” Velvel writes , adding that today ’s “ globalization ” is imperialism by another name .
Velvel is cofounder of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , a law school purposefully dedicated to the education of minorities , immigrants , and students from working - class backgrounds who would otherwise not be able to embark on a legal career .
The school is famed for providing an affordable , quality education and widely regarded as a leader in the reform movement to make legal education more practicable .

Who am I to argue with the Madison Avenue suits who coined the phrase “ diamonds are a girl ’s best friend ” ?
If only diamonds were all we believe them to be .
The violence resulting from the diamond mining and trading industry is , in a word , tragic .
And , as it turns out , diamonds are n’t even as valuable as we ’ve been told .
First , a little primer :
The U.S. happens to be the largest consumer of conflict diamonds , purchasing over $ 33.7 billion dollars ’ worth of the rocks in 2005 .
Wondering what conflict diamonds are ?
I ’m no fawning fan of DiCaprio , but the film “ Blood Diamond ” is nowhere near as fictional as we ’d like it to be .
Conflict diamonds involve abuse , corruption and death .
There goes that gorgeous , shimmery , sparkling stone set in platinum I ’ve been dreaming about .
Here are several important reasons you should never , ever buy ( or accept ) a diamond :
We ’ve been conditioned to want a diamond .
Pavlov much ?
Who is n’t tired of the advertising and marketing ploys used to brainwash us into believing our value as women rests on the size of our…gem ?
( Toss that in with measurements and marital status and we ’ve got an endless supply of not - good - enough . )
Marketers have thrown us a giant , glittering bone , and watched the profits pile up as we ’ve chased , fetched and rolled over in order to conform to what we ’ve been conditioned to believe is the only acceptable standard .
Diamond prices have been artificially inflated by the diamond cartel .
The average diamond sold in the U.S. has been over - graded in quality by 2 grades , and the average U.S. couple pays twice what they should for an engagement ring .
Do you really want to enter into a lifelong commitment with a man who ’s willing to waste his hard - earned cash on a diamond , especially when said diamond is ridiculously overpriced ?
Okay , well , me too .
Forget number 2 and let ’s move on to the third reason to avoid diamonds .
Diamonds are anything but an “ investment ” .
A 1 - carat diamond will set him back about $ 5,000 , which amounts to $ 710,000 per ounce .
Worse even than a car once it ’s driven off the sales lot , a diamond will never be worth what you ’ve paid for it .
Try to trade it or sell it or pawn it and you ’ll be sorely disappointed .
Do you know why ?
Because their “ worth ” has been artificially inflated !
Diamonds are n’t scarce or rare .
Just do n’t tell him this until after it ’s on your finger .
( Kidding ! )
Conflict diamonds .
Any lover shallow enough to buy you a diamond to “ make up ” for misbehavin ’ ways is indeed dumb enough to think that the name “ conflict diamonds ” refers to relationship issues .
Ditch that man and his diamonds … fast .
Blood diamonds have resulted in over 4 million deaths in Angola , Sierra Leone , Liberia and the Ivory Coast .
One shiny rock , 4 million lives .
Diamonds with strings attached .
Did you know that only 11 % of U.S. jewelry stores practice a conflict diamonds policy and 67 % wo n’t even discuss the topic when asked if they have one ?
Just because he bought you dinner , I mean a diamond , does n’t mean you have to marry him .
Presents are n’t promises , and kisses are n’t for keeps .
Diamond mines damage the environment .
This is important , even though it ’s true of all types of mining , not just diamond mining .
Mines are dangerous for workers ( including children ) and threaten our planet , too .
I wish there were a way to dig that deep without so much damage .
And last but definitely not least …
A diamond is not forever .
Nothing is forever , my friends .
Engagements , marriages , jobs , you name it .
If they happen to last a long time , then you are indeed a very lucky person .
Why do we kid ourselves into believing that a sparkling rock , delivered to us on the backs of the abused , purchased for more than it ’s worth , marketed for more than it means and obtained at the expense of our own dear planet will keep love alive ?
And please tell me why I still melt , just a little , at the sight of a beautiful , shimmering diamond ring perched on a shelf in a store window .
( Lastly , did you know ?
There are some great alternatives : you can buy vintage diamonds – at a fraction of the cost !
– and retailers like Brilliant Earth and Green Karat are eco-friendly and cruelty - free , too . )

Originally called WirelessMAN , WiMAX ( Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access ) is the El Dorado of wireless data transmission , with versions of it providing both high - bandwidth point - to - point links and mobile cellular - type access .
It ’s potentially a viable wireless alternative to cable and DSL .
In the last 12 months , several WiMAX trials and actual commercial networks have been initiated worldwide for last mile broadband connectivity for both the consumer and enterprise segments .
Until now , however , America has lagged behind the rest of the world in terms of WiMAX build - out and adoption .
This article originally appeared in the October issue of Internet Telephony magazine .
Originally called WirelessMAN , WiMAX ( Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access ) is the El Dorado of wireless data transmission , with versions of it providing both high - bandwidth point - to - point links and mobile cellular - type access .
It ’s potentially a viable wireless alternative to cable and DSL .
In the last 12 months , several WiMAX trials and actual commercial networks have been initiated worldwide for last mile broadband connectivity for both the consumer and enterprise segments .
Until now , however , America has lagged behind the rest of the world in terms of WiMAX build - out and adoption .
The WiMAX standard originated with the IEEE 802.16 wireless broadband committee .
Conformance and interoperability testing was formalized with the industry group known as the WiMAX forum ( founded in 2001 ) formulated a set of product guidelines based on the 802.16 standards or “ WiMAX profiles ” .
At the moment there are two versions of WiMAX : Revision D is based on the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard .
It is only for fixed applications .
Revision E , based on IEEE 802.16e-2005 , supports fixed and mobile applications and has a more sophisticated radio interface .
These two forms of WiMAX are incompatible , so , given that the future of telecom is definitely rooted in mobility , much of the wireless industry has only paid lip service to Revision D and has instead focused on developing products adhering to Revision E ( 802.16e ) .
At the moment , Pakistan enjoys the world ’s largest WiMAX network .
Wateen Telecom rolled out WiMAX in 17 cities throughout Pakistan on a platform built with Motorola equipment .
Indeed , Motorola is one of the companies at the forefront of WiMAX development .
Motorola ’s Fred Wright , Senior Vice President for Cellular Networks & WiMAX , says , “ We now have many commercial contracts for WiMAX in a number of markets around the world .
A few months ago , we were in a kind of transition stage .
We ’re now moving from the trial phase with a number of customers to commercial contracts , and we have a number of systems under construction or we will be getting them under construction fairly quickly .
Today , we also have , in general , commercial service with a number of customers around the world .
Customers are building out networks such as Embratel in Brazil , Axtel in Mexico , and Wateen Telecom in Pakistan is expanding and reinforcing the capacity of their network .
We ’re building with a telco in Saudi Arabia too , as well as Mena Telecom in Bahrain .
We have project after project .
The technology is real , it works .
We have commercial grade software out there in the field that is supporting customers .
And we periodically win new contracts with new customers . ”
“ The WiMAX Forum has a certification program that subjects products to intensive , rigorous testing to assure everyone that they have the ability to interoperate with WiMAX devices from other vendors that have the same certification , ” says Wright .
“ In June , Motorola ’s WiMAX WAP 25400 base station passed the interoperability and conformance tests and thus received the WiMAX Forum Certified seal of approval for operation .
So we now have certification on our most popular base station product , called a Diversity Access Point , for customers around the world .
This is the access point or the base station that has the power amplifiers and antennas combined into a single unit to make it nice and compact .
It has a minimal footprint , which means that it only needs a small common equipment cabinet that sits at the base of the tower , that can be mounted on a wall or a post or potentially placed inside of a building . ”
“ Right now we also in the process of getting a number of our Customer Premise Equipment [ CPE ] units going through the certification process , ” says Wright .
“ We have both indoor and outdoor customer premises equipment that we sell around the world .
We ’re just about commercially ready with a PC dongle , a USB connector that plugs into a PC and provides full mobile WiMAX functionality .
We ’ve gone through all of the shakedown tests and so forth .
That product is now in a state where it should be commercially ready very soon . ”
“ So , Motorola has a good portfolio , not only of base station products operating in the 2.3 , 2.5 , 3.5 GHz frequency bands , but we also have a fairly significant variety of customer premise equipment , both indoor and outdoor varieties that come with different features .
Some of them are data - only , some of them also have a voice port in them , so you can just plug an RJ - 11 connector from a desktop phone into the CPE unit and you can do VoIP calling on the customer ’s network .
Of course , you ’ve got to connect to a VoIP switch , which is part of what we ’re interfacing into with various customers .
Our Motorola wi4 WiMAX CPEi 750 Desktop CPE won TMC ’s 2008 WiMAX Distinction Award . ”
Motorola ’s rival , Nortel , is also aggressively pursuing early market opportunities for WiMAX .
For example , they recently announced that Comstar United Telesystems , Russia ’s leading integrated telecom service provider , has selected Nortel ’s WiMAX solution to provide wireless broadband in Moscow , which has the highest penetration of mobile phone subscribers of any major Russian city ( at over 150 percent ) and the highest Internet penetration .
( Rethink Research Associates Ltd. estimates that the number of WiMAX subscribers in Russia will grow to 1.7 million in 2010 and 4.3 million 2012 . )
The Nortel WiMAX solution sold to Comstar includes the WiMAX BTS 5020 ( mobile WiMAX base station ) , compliant with WiMAX Forum and RosSvyaz standards .
Comstar will initially deploy over 160 mobile WiMAX ( 802.16e ) base stations ( BTS 5020 ) .
The network will also include Nortel ’s the Access Services Network Gateway ( ASG ) 5100 , devices such as USB adapters , indoor and outdoor gateways , Business Support System ( BSS ) and Operational Support System ( OSS ) platforms as well as Nortel Global Services for WiMAX such as network design and training .
This is Nortel ’s first mobile WiMAX win in Russia and should be a major boost for Nortel ’s 4G strategy , which includes a strategic WiMAX agreement with Alvarion , is helping Nortel to bring WiMAX to market faster to customers .
Is Good Old Voice the WiMAX “ Killer App ” ?
Carriers and service providers have been searching for the next “ killer app ” for years .
Voice , however , remains the time - honored moneymaker .
WiMAX providers have found that voice doubles the average revenue per user , gives the service provider a bundled and branded service , broadens their market reach and decreases their cost to acquire new customers .
This probably helps to explain the popularity of Alianza ’s hosted voice platform among WiMAX service providers , which gives service providers the ability to offer a wide range of voice features and functions to small business and residential users - up to 120 different functions .
Since it is a fully integrated SaaS ( Software as a Service ) platform with a simple interface , providers can be up and running in 30 to 90 days .
Moreover , Alianza ’s SaaS - based pricing model eradicates capital expenditures and slashes operating expenses .
The simple plug & play implementation also eliminates the need to recruit an engineering team capable of building , integrating , and maintaining a tier - 1 platform .
It gives providers the ability to create custom products tailored for specific markets niches ( e.g. , residential , SMBs ) .
The service provider can provision directly using proprietary telecommunications carriers .
Thus , the service provider can focus on core competencies and increasing revenue .
Alianza now offers services in North America with plans to expand throughout South America , Europe , and APAC over next 6 - 18 months .
Recent customers include DigitalBridge Communications and MVS in Mexico .
Getting the Nitty - Gritty Right
Everything about WiMAX is more sophisticated than , say WiFi .
Researchers and service providers soon realized that high - performance , flexible yet cost - effective antenna solutions capable of handling coverage and interference issues were necessary for the successful deployment of WiMAX .
Companies such as PCTEL , Inc. have thus stepped forward with their innovative antenna solutions and software - based radios .
Its portfolio includes a broad range of antennas for WiMAX , Land Mobile Radio , GPS , telemetry , RFID , WiFi , indoor cellular , and mesh networks .
PCTEL ’s products are sold worldwide through direct and indirect channels .
PCTEL is now working with several leading WIMAX OEMs to develop both point - to - point and point - to - multipoint antenna solutions .
PCTEL has also devised scanning solutions to test for coverage and identify problem areas in a network .
The more sophisticated the antenna and radio interface demanded by WiMAX also results in a more sophisticated testing regimen .
As Graham Celine , Senior Director of Marketing at Azimuth , says , “ The key component from our perspective is that wireless technology – and it really does n’t make any difference what particular wireless technology – went through a paradigm shift when it transitioned from a single antenna to multi-antenna architecture .
Doing so made it more complex .
This has happened in many different technologies .
In fact , it started in the WiFi realm when it moved from the single antenna 802.11a / b/g to the multi-antenna 802.11n .
Similarly , in the WiMAX space , 802.16 has always been defined from pretty much Day One as multiple antenna - capable , with the first standardization of the multi-antenna form being 801.16e , or the ‘ Mobile WiMAX ’ .
As you look forward , the cellular technologies such as GSM and CDMA are essentially converging .
They managed to say apart in the 3G world with UMTS and 3GPP2 and EVDO type of technologies , but as mobile is moving to 4G today , such as the upcoming WiMAX and LTE , once again we ’ve moved back to multi-antenna form factors . ”
“ That ’s where we ’ve really been involved in WiMAX , ” says Celine .
“ We ’re a test equipment company and so our involvement consists of determining how we can support the companies that are developing things such as base stations or subscriber stations to properly validate these products before they ’re rolled out into the field .
We figure out how to save providers time , money and time - to - market in producing these products .
The biggest challenge for providers is that there ’s a real - world environment which involves multiple signal paths .
If you have a mobile or stationary multi-antenna device with two antennas and a multi-antenna base station with two antennas , the signal paths multiply in both directions .
In the real world , that changes .
Each one of those signals goes through multiple paths and the signal gets replicated through reflection and is subject to fading in that it varies in signal strength because of those reflections and other disturbances in the path . ”
“ That ’s why we ’ve developed a channel emulator which essentially connects between the base station and the subscriber station and , through statistical modeling , recreates those over - the - air conditions , ” says Celine .
“ That really allows a vendor to do robust testing in the lab , so they can do product or radio conformance testing , or just straight functional testing .
It could be throughput performance testing , or most important , interoperability testing .
This can all now be done in a real - world scenario without ever having to leave the test lab .
They can run this for many hours .
They can create different statistical models and they can run them for a relative long period of time .
Then if they detect any discrepancies in the device behavior , they can go back and they can repeat precisely the same situation where it happened . ”
WiMAX
When ?
While Pakistanis luxuriate in WiMAX wireless broadband , we Americans await the big commercial rollout of Sprint - Nextel ’s Xohm WiMAX service .
WiMAX is appearing here and there in North America , and the ball is slowly beginning to gather momentum .
Still , I ’m itching to trade in my EVDO card .

Livingstone was a Scottish missionary and one of the greatest European explorers of Africa , whose opening up the interior of the continent contributed to the ' Scramble for Africa ' .
David Livingstone was born at Blantyre , south of Glasgow on 19 March 1813 .
At 10 he began working in the local cotton mill , with school lessons in the evenings .
In 1836 , he began studying medicine and theology in Glasgow and decided to become a missionary doctor .
In 1841 , he was posted to the edge of the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa .
In 1845 , he married Mary Moffat , daughter of a fellow missionary .
Livingstone became convinced of his mission to reach new peoples in the interior of Africa and introduce them to Christianity , as well as freeing them from slavery .
It was this which inspired his explorations .
In 1849 and 1851 , he travelled across the Kalahari , on the second trip sighting the upper Zambezi River .
In 1852 , he began a four year expedition to find a route from the upper Zambezi to the coast .
This filled huge gaps in western knowledge of central and southern Africa .
In 1855 , Livingstone discovered a spectacular waterfall which he named ' Victoria Falls ' .
He reached the mouth of the Zambezi on the Indian Ocean in May 1856 , becoming the first European to cross the width of southern Africa .
Returning to Britain , where he was now a national hero , Livingstone did many speaking tours and published his best - selling ' Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa ' ( 1857 ) .
He left for Africa again in 1858 , and for the next five years carried out official explorations of eastern and central Africa for the British government .
His wife died of malaria in 1862 , a bitter blow and in 1864 he was ordered home by a government unimpressed with the results of his travels .
At home , Livingstone publicised the horrors of the slave trade , securing private support for another expedition to central Africa , searching for the Nile 's source and reporting further on slavery .
This expedition lasted from 1866 until Livingstone 's death in 1873 .
After nothing was heard from him for many months , Henry Stanley , an explorer and journalist , set out to find Livingstone .
This resulted in their meeting near Lake Tanganyika in October 1871 during which Stanley uttered the famous phrase : ' Dr Livingstone I presume ? '
With new supplies from Stanley , Livingstone continued his efforts to find the source of the Nile .
His health had been poor for many years and he died on 1 May 1873 .
His body was taken back to England and buried in Westminster Abbey .
A spokeswoman from the Department for Children , Schools and Families ( DCSF ) said : " We lay down clear guidance for schools so they have strong internet policies , on internal and external websites , which protects young people from inappropriate material – and we have launched the groundbreaking UK Council for Child Internet Safety to monitor and protect young people from unsuitable web material .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - The London Stock Exchange LSE.L suffered its worst systems failure in eight years on Monday , forcing the world 's third largest share market to suspend trading for about seven hours and infuriating its users .

The problem occurred on what could have been one of London 's busiest trading days of the year , as markets rebounded worldwide following the U.S. government 's decision to bail out mortgage companies Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N .
“ We have the biggest takeover in the history of the known world ... and then we ca n’t trade .
It ’s terrible , ” one trader said .
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange , which uses the LSE ’s trading platform TradElect , also suspended trading .
“ This halt today clearly has once again damaged ( the LSE’s ) reputation as a leading exchange , especially on a day like today , highlighting that it may have been unable to handle the volumes this morning , ” added another trader .
The exchange would not say whether volume was the issue and declined to give details on what had caused the problem .
But angry customers were demanding an explanation .
“ We want answers as to how this happened in the first place and reassurances that it will not happened again , ” said Angus Rigby , chief executive of brokerage TD Waterhouse .
The LSE , the world number - three exchange by traded volume in the first half of this year , opened for trading as usual at 0700 GMT , but connectivity problems left some brokers unable to trade .
It was then forced to suspend trading to ensure some market players were not disadvantaged .
The Exchange finally got trading going at 1500 GMT -- half an hour before it was due to close .
“ We had to sit on our hands and wait for fragmented and at times ambiguous announcements as to when the LSE would be up and running ...
It ’s ironic that since 2:30 today we ’ve been able to trade , and get a fair market value on Barclays or any other ADR ( American depository receipt ) on the New York Exchange , but not on the LSE , ” said Rigby .
The UK Financial Services Authority , in its Financial Risk Outlook 2008 report , says the risk of such infrastructure failures is growing with the rise of electronic trading and straight - through processing .
SYSTEMS UPGRADES
The LSE plans a series of system upgrades and is migrating Italian equities to its trading platform TradElect this month .
Monday ’s trading suspension was the longest suffered by the exchange since April 5 , 2000 , when problems with an older trading system led to an eight - hour suspension .
On June 17 , the Milan Stock Exchange , which the LSE acquired in October 2007 , suspended trading due to technical difficulties .
On November 7 last year the LSE itself experienced a connectivity problem with its real - time market data system Infolect which connects to TradElect .
The outrage came at an embarrassing time as the LSE fights new entrants .
In a letter to the Financial Times on Monday LSE Chief Executive Clara Furse defended the exchange ’s position , describing TradElect , which the bourse introduced last year , as “ the cutting edge ” .
Nasdaq OMX Europe , a cash equity platform set up by transatlantic exchange group Nasdaq OMX NDAQ.O to rival European bourses such as LSE and Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn .
DE , will start on September 26 .
NYSE Euronext NYX.
NNYX .PA said it will launch a pan-European market in November .
The LSE faces growing competition from new entrants and its share price has fallen sharply as a result this year .
Turquoise , a cash equities trading venue backed by nine investment banks , as well as Chi-X Europe , owned by Nomura 8604.
T and investment banks , are both gaining market share .
Both said on Monday they were trading normally .
The LSE outage coincided with a system failure at the Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N ( ICE ) , which shut trade across London commodity markets for more than an hour .
According to an ICE official there was no apparent link between the two .
The Federal Reserve took extraordinary actions Tuesday to revive the feeble U.S. economy .
USA TODAY reporters Sue Kirchhoff and John Waggoner answer questions about the Fed 's moves : Q : What 's the good news in the Fed 's actions ?
IN WASHINGTON : Fed cuts interest rates to near zero A : The Fed 's decision to nudge its key fed funds rate to a range of zero to 0.25 % — along with its plans to buy securities that are backed by mortgages — should mean lower consumer interest rates , particularly mortgage rates .
Low mortgage rates mean that more people can afford to buy houses , which will help revive the moribund housing market .
A drop in mortgage rates will also allow homeowners to refinance their loans at lower rates , easing some of the burdens of their debts .
Low rates also make it cheaper for companies to borrow and expand .
That , in turn , is a powerful economic stimulus .
Most major banks , including Bank of America and Wachovia , lowered their prime lending rate to 3.25 % from 4 % Tuesday .
The Fed also signaled that it is willing to try other things to stimulate the economy , including buying Treasury securities .
" They 're saying , ' We 're going to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes , ' " says John Silvia , chief economist for Wachovia .
Q : What 's the bad news ?
A : The Fed would n't lower rates this far and signal its willingness to take a host of unconventional actions if the economic situation were n't so dire .
The nation is entering the 13th month of a recession , and the unemployment rate hit 6.7 % in November , up from 4.7 % a year earlier .
The Fed is worried about an extremely severe recession and the outlying possibility of deflation — a persistent decline in prices .
In a deflationary period , the value of assets falls , but debt payments become more onerous .
At this point , deflation is not a major concern .
But the Fed is monitoring conditions .
Q : Are n't such low rates and policies inflationary ?
A : In theory , they can be .
But at the moment , inflation is deader than King Tut .
The government 's consumer price index fell 1.7 % in November , the second - consecutive record decrease .
Q : Will lower rates hurt the U.S. dollar ?
A : They did on Tuesday : The dollar weakened against the euro and Japan 's yen .
Should those countries lower their interest rates , however , the dollar would likely rebound .
Money typically flows to the currencies with the highest interest rates and the greatest safety .
Q : The Fed has never targeted an interest rate range before .
Why now ?
A : More as a practical matter than anything else .
A zero -percent interest rate is hard to achieve .
The range gives them a small margin of error .
Further , as the Fed has dramatically expanded lending to financial firms and its balance sheet , it has also become harder to manage the funds rate .
Q : Does the Fed have a target in mind for mortgage rates ?
A : No , but there 's little doubt that the Fed would like lower mortgage rates , which is why the Fed is considering buying mortgage - backed securities .
If banks can sell their mortgage loans to investors — including the Fed — they will have more money to make new mortgages .
A senior Fed official , who would not speak for attribution , told reporters Tuesday that it could be self - defeating for the Fed to set a target for mortgage rates .
Instead , the Fed will monitor housing and economic developments to determine future actions .
Q : What does this mean for savers ?
A : Lower returns .
Rates on bank CDs and money market mutual funds closely follow the fed funds rate .
Money funds , which invest in short - term , interest - bearing securities and distribute the income to investors , might be particularly squeezed .
The average taxable money fund aimed at individual investors charges 0.86 % a year in expenses .
Three - month Treasury bills yield 0.03 % .
Q : What is the Fed trying to do ?
A : The Fed is pulling out all the stops to revive business and consumer lending and get the economy moving .
The central bank is particularly focused on the wide difference , or spread , on interest rates between supersafe Treasury bills , for example , and market - based loans for autos , homes and other purchases .
Fed officials think the wide spreads are due to a lack of liquidity , as lenders pull back .
They hope that by flooding markets with cash , using such strategies as buying mortgage - backed bonds , they can bring interest rates down and relieve such pressures .
The Fed has so far confined its programs to making loans by using high - grade securities as collateral .
It could consider dipping into some riskier markets going forward , but only with backing from the Treasury Department to absorb some losses .

Geneticists are now estimating that the Spanish Inquisition led to large amounts of intermarriage between nominally converted Muslims and Jews with Catholics in Spain after 1492 .
From that date , the Spanish state forbade all religions but orthodox Catholicism in Spain , making Jews and Christians who chose to remain convert .
A new study finds that 1 in 10 of Spanish men has haplotypes ( genetic patterns ) on the y chromosome identical with that of North Africans ( i.e. Moroccans , Algerians , Tunisians ) .
And this study suggests that 1 in 5 have haplotypes identical with Jewish males .
The evidence with regard to Spanish women is inconclusive .
( This article does n’t seem to realize it , but this is because only a minority of Jewish women have ‘ Palestinian ’ patterns in their mitochondrial DNA ; male Jewish merchant communities established around the Mediterranean from about the 800s AD took local wives and converted them , so the majority of Jewish women do n’t have distinctive genetic markers . )
I ’m not so sure that the Inquisition can explain these results , since the numbers seem incommensurate with the result .
There were about 100,000 Marranos or forcibly - converted Jews in Spain after 1492 ( many Iberian Jews fled to Holland , North Africa or Istanbul to retain their faith ) .
There were initially some 315,000 Moriscoes or forcibly - converted Muslims in the 1500s .
But at the beginning of the 1600s , these were expelled , as well .
By 1609 it is estimated that all but 10,000 to 15,000 of these Catholic secret Muslims had been expelled ( France , Italy , and North Africa were the major destinations of the victims of this ethnic cleansing ) .
Spain ’s population in the 1500s was about 8 million .
So I do n’t see how 50,000 Marranos males could produce a situation where 1/5 of the present - day male population is descended from them .
And , the huge Arab and Berber population of medieval Spain and even the 300,000 there in the 1500s , with whom there would have been intermarriage , should have left a larger genetic heritage in Spain than just 1/10 .
Moreover , I would challenge the idea that most of the mixing only came after the conversions post - 1492 .
People sleep with each other across cultural boundaries and do n’t tell the historians about it .
And , people convert from Islam to Catholicism and pretend they ’d always been Catholics , something that could have been going on surreptitiously all through the centuries of the Reconquista .
Anyway , the haplotypes distinctive to Sephardic Jews are indistinguishable from those of Palestinians and Lebanese .
So my guess is that the geneticists are finding descendants from the Phoenicians and from Arab populations that invaded North Africa and then Spain , along with descendants of Jews .
Work on the genetic history of the Phoenicians in the Mediterranean is now also being pursued .
If you follow Jeff Atwood ’s blog , then you probably already have seen his post about how his awesome Christmas turned into a tragedy all because Lenovo has decided that they want screw him over with insanely priced hard drives and hard drive trays that they wo n’t sell to their customers .
I mean honestly , this is exactly the kind of horrible business practices that company ’s get skewered over .
What made me laugh though was that only a few short hours after he put up the post , I searched for “ Lenovo server drive tray ” on Google and got this back :
It seems that these days when you decide to screw over a customer like that , you might want to google them beforehand .
You never know who might be buying your products and what kind of audience they might have .

Dear Cecil : Without gravity , how do female astronauts menstruate while in space ?
Gayle , Ventura , CA
Cecil replies :
For a while there , Gayle , the question was n’t how women would menstruate in space but whether it was too risky to find out .
Although the first female cosmonaut , Valentina Tereshkova , had flown in Vostok 6 in 1963 , women were excluded from the U.S. space program during its early years .
The official reason for this was that , as a matter of policy , U.S. astronauts were drawn from the ranks of military test pilots , and all the test pilots were men .
If you ask me , though , the real reason was American male panic about women and their mysterious inner workings .
Several plane crashes in the 1930s had involved menstruating female pilots , and experts — male experts , of course — suggested that putting a woman with “ menstrual disturbances ” in the cockpit was an invitation to disaster .
Eventually the more hysterical fears receded , but some space medics still harbored serious concerns about menstruation when NASA began planning to put women in space in the 1970s .
From a certain point of view , I suppose , these concerns were n’t completely crazy .
When a woman has her period , normally the menstrual flow is forcibly expelled from the cervix .
However , given the low - gravity environment of space , some scientists wondered about the possibility of “ retrograde menstruation , ” the backward flow of menstrual blood up into the fallopian tubes .
This occurs sometimes on earth and is thought to lead to endometriosis , a disorder in which tissue that normally lines the uterus grows where it should n’t .
Prior to the 1983 space shuttle flight by Sally Ride , the first U.S. woman to exit our atmosphere , consultants told NASA that female astronauts should take hormones to manage their menstrual cycles to reduce flow volume and ideally avoid having a period while in space .
Unsurprisingly , to women anyway , most of the anticipated problems never materialized .
There ’s no evidence retrograde menstruation occurs in space , and even if it did , it probably would n’t cause endometriosis : reverse flow seems to trigger this condition only in those who experience it chronically .
Returning women astronauts who ’ve menstruated in space report that everything worked the way it usually does .
The mechanics of a zero - G period have n’t been fully explicated in the scientific literature , but according to Principles of Clinical Medicine for Space Flight ( 2008 ) , astronauts have “ access to multiple sanitary products for menstruation , including pads , mini-pads , and tampons in plain and deodorant versions , ” and presumably capillary attraction accomplishes what the lack of gravity can’t .
( We might have predicted as much , since bedridden women usually menstruate OK . )
Incidentally , for times when going to the bathroom is impossible for an extended period , such as launches , spacewalks , and landings , “ crewmembers of both sexes have available a maximum absorbency garment ( MAG ) that can retain up to 2000 ml of urine , blood , or feces . ”
Not your ideal working conditions , but a small sacrifice to make for the world ’s coolest job .
Female astronauts do face some challenges in space .
Internal medicine specialist and space buff William Rowe notes that women are more likely to develop decompression sickness during their periods .
That ’s a problem mostly during space walks , so he suggests any excursion by a woman be timed for a different part of her cycle .
Before you peg
Rowe as a chauvinist scumbucket , note that he also thinks women are , on the whole , better suited than men to a low - gravity environment .
In a 2004 article in the Journal of Men ’s Health and Gender , he argues that for long - term space exploration an all - female crew might be the best bet .
His reasons :
(1) Menstruation rids the body of iron .
That ’s a good thing , because space flight can reduce one ’s production of a protein that normally sops up excess iron , and “ increased free iron can be extremely toxic . ”
(2) Women produce a lot more estrogen than men , and they also have lower epinephrine levels .
For reasons we need n’t get into , these factors reduce the likelihood of heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems while in space .
(3) Some of the Apollo 15 astronauts experienced pain and swelling of their fingertips while on the surface of the moon .
Rowe hypothesizes that this is less likely to happen to women because “ estrogen reduces vascular smooth muscle tone . ”
It might also be pointed out that women on average take up less room in cramped spacecraft cabins , consume fewer resources , and are more inclined to ask for directions when lost .
Finally , to be blunt , who would you rather have up there : female astronauts who , worst case , are hormonally challenged on a fairly predictable schedule once a month , or male astronauts subject to random testosterone attacks any time at all ?

The American public may never learn the full extent of fraud and abuse committed by a former top CIA official , and uncovered through a years - long federal investigation .
In a ruling filed Wednesday , a federal judge denied a request by federal prosecutors to release portions of secret grand jury transcripts which , the lawyers alleged , would allow the public to see a fuller measure of the crimes of Kyle " Dusty " Foggo , who resigned from the CIA in 2006 .
" It is the public that is the victim of this fraud , and the public should have an opportunity to consider all of Foggo 's conduct , " the prosecutors argued .
Foggo 's lawyer said prosecutors were just " looking to make a big public splash " by releasing the material , which could include gossip and speculation .
Foggo pled guilty last September to a single count of wire fraud .
In exchange , prosecutors dropped over two dozen other charges against him , including money laundering and conspiracy .
Federal prosecutors and agents from the FBI , IRS , and Department of Defense spent over two years building their case against Foggo , who rose to the third most powerful post in the Central Intelligence Agency under former director Porter Goss .
Foggo resigned in 2006 after investigators raided his home and office .
Foggo Faces Sentencing
Foggo is slated to be sentenced February 19 .
According to the terms of his plea agreement , prosecutors have promised not to seek a prison term longer than 37 months .
Prosecutors said they sought to use the grand jury material to argue for a stiff sentence .
Judge James C. Cacheris of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that prosecutors could use the transcripts , but they could not be released to the public .
In their 2007 indictment of Foggo , prosecutors said he steered several business deals , including one worth $ 132 million , to companies run by a childhood friend , who had promised Foggo a job after he retired from the agency and lavished him with gifts , expensive meals , visits with prostitutes and vacations .
In one email from Foggo quoted in the indictment , the former top official promised his friend , Brent Wilkes , he would apply " grease " to move a contract deal along .
Wilkes was convicted in November 2007 on 13 felony counts of bribery , conspiracy , fraud and money laundering relating to his bribery of former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham .
Wilkes was released earlier this year , after posting a $ 2 million bond , while he appeals his 12 - year sentence .
Cunningham is serving an eight - year , four - month sentence after pleading guilty to taking $ 2.4 million in bribes in exchange for fraudulent earmarks .

That emergency appeal for humanitarian aid for Gaza that the BBC refuses to broadcast ?
Watch it for yourself :
The video was made when the death toll was " just " " a few hundred " and it is completely apolitical ( the word " Israel " does n't even appear in the script ) .
The power of its images alone is self - evident , making it clear why the BBC does n't want it seen .
Reality , in this case , has an anti-Israel bias .
The decision provoked protests across Britain .

Clever magicians practice the art of misdirection -- distracting the eyes of the audience to something attention - grabbing but irrelevant so that no one notices what the magician is really doing .
Look over at that fuchsia scarf , up this sleeve , at anything besides the actual trick .
The campaign promoting Proposition 8 , which proposes to amend the state Constitution to ban same - sex marriages , has masterfully misdirected its audience , California voters .
Look at the first - graders in San Francisco , attending their lesbian teacher ’s wedding !
Look at Catholic Charities , halting its adoption services in Massachusetts , where same - sex marriage is legal !
Look at the church that lost its tax exemption over gay marriage !
Look at anything except what Proposition 8 is actually about : a group of people who are trying to impose on the state their belief that homosexuality is immoral and that gays and lesbians are not entitled to be treated equally under the law .
That truth would never sell in tolerant , live - and - let - live California , and so it has been hidden behind a series of misleading half - truths .
Once the sleight of hand is revealed , though , the campaign ’s illusions fall away .
Take the story of Catholic Charities .
The service arm of the Roman Catholic Church closed its adoption program in Massachusetts not because of the state ’s gay marriage law but because of a gay anti-discrimination law passed many years earlier .
In fact , the charity had voluntarily placed older foster children in gay and lesbian households -- among those most willing to take hard - to - place children -- until the church hierarchy was alerted and demanded that adoptions conform to the church ’s religious teaching , which was in conflict with state law .
The Proposition 8 campaign , funded in large part by Mormons who were urged to do so by their church , does not mention that the Mormon church ’s adoption arm in Massachusetts is still operating , even though it does not place children in gay and lesbian households .
How can this be ?
It ’s a matter of public accountability , not infringement on religion .
Catholic Charities acted as a state contractor , receiving state and federal money to find homes for special - needs children who were wards of the state , and it faced the loss of public funding if it did not comply with the anti-discrimination law .
In contrast , LDS ( for Latter - day Saints ) Family Services runs a private adoption service without public funding .
Its work , and its ability to follow its religious teachings , have not been altered .
That San Francisco field trip ?
The children who attended the wedding had their parents ’ signed permission , as law requires .
A year ago , with the same permission , they could have traveled to their teacher ’s domestic - partnership ceremony .
Proposition 8 does not change the rules about what children are exposed to in school .
The state Education Code does not allow schools to teach comprehensive sex education -- which includes instruction about marriage -- to children whose parents object .
Another “ Yes on 8 " canard is that the continuation of same - sex marriage will force churches and other religious groups to perform such marriages or face losing their tax - exempt status .
Proponents point to a case in New Jersey , where a Methodist - based nonprofit owned seaside land that included a boardwalk pavilion .
It obtained an exemption from state property tax for the land on the grounds that it was open for public use and access .
Events such as weddings -- of any religion -- could be held in the pavilion by reservation .
But when a lesbian couple sought to book the pavilion for a commitment ceremony , the nonprofit balked , saying this went against its religious beliefs .
The court ruled against the nonprofit , not because gay rights trump religious rights but because public land has to be open to everyone or it ’s not public .
The ruling does not affect churches ’ religious tax exemptions or their freedom to marry whom they please on their private property , just as Catholic priests do not have to perform marriages for divorced people and Orthodox synagogues can refuse to provide space for the weddings of interfaith couples .
And Proposition 8 has no bearing on the issue ; note that the New Jersey case was n’t about a wedding ceremony .
Much has been made about same - sex marriage changing the traditional definition of marriage .
But marriage has evolved for thousands of years , from polygamous structures in which brides were so much chattel to today ’s idealized love matches .
In seeking to add a sentence to California ’s Constitution that says , “ Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized , ” Proposition 8 supporters seek to enforce adherence to their own religious or personal definition .
The traditional makeup of families has changed too , in ways that many religious people find immoral .
Single parents raise their children ; couples divorce and blend families .
Yet same - sex marriage is the only departure from tradition that has been targeted for constitutional eradication .
Religions and their believers are free to define marriage as they please ; they are free to consider homosexuality a sin .
But they are not free to impose their definitions of morality on the state .
Proposition 8 proponents know this , which is why they have misdirected the debate with highly colored illusions about homosexuals trying to take away the rights of religious Californians .
Since May , when the state Supreme Court overturned a proposed ban on same - sex marriage as unconstitutional , more than 16,000 devoted gay and lesbian couples have celebrated the creation of stable , loving households , of equal legal stature with other households .
Their happiness in no way diminishes the rights or happiness of others .
Californians must cast a clear eye on Proposition 8 ’s real intentions .
It seeks to change the state Constitution in a rare and terrible way , to impose a single moral belief on everyone and to deprive a targeted group of people of civil rights that are now guaranteed .
This is something that no Californian , of any religious belief , should accept .
Vote no to the bigotry of Proposition 8 .
John McCain Saturday Night Live Video
John McCain with Tina Fey as Sarah Palin on SNL November 1
With just three days left until Election Day , John McCain made a final campaign swing on Saturday Night Live .
In a skit with Tina Fey once again portraying Sarah Palin , McCain asks , " Look , would I rather be on three major networks ?
Of course , but I 'm a true maverick -- a Republican without money . "
The sketch has McCain and Palin hawking items to commemorate the campaign on QVC .
" This has been an historic campaign , so why not remember it with our line of collectible products , " McCain says , " Such as ten commemorative plates that celebrate the ten Town Hall debates between Senator Obama and myself .
They 're blank ; he would n't agree to those debates .
Too bad .
They 're still nice plates .

While the auto industry meets in DC with Congress , I thought I would bring you the story of the auto industry , in the form of a three part play .
From the comments yesterday :
THE TRAGEDY OF THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY : A Play in Three Acts
Dramatis Personae
BIG THREE , a manufacturer of automobiles
UAW , Big Three ’s employee
MITT ROMNEY , an idiot
ACT ONE
BIG THREE : I have plans to build automobiles , but I need labor to do so !
UAW : I will labor for you if you will pay me $ 40 per hour .
BIG THREE : I will not pay you $ 40 per hour .
UAW : But I need to save for my inevitible retirement , and any health concerns that may arise .
BIG THREE : I will pay you $ 30 per hour , plus a generous pension of guaranteed payments and health care upon your retirement .
UAW : Then I agree to work for you !
ACT TWO
UAW : I am building cars for you , as I have promised to do !
BIG THREE : I am designing terrible cars that few people want to buy !
Also , rather than save for UAW ’s inevitible retirement when I will have to pay him the generous pension of guaranteed payments and health care that I promised , I am spending that money under the dubious assumption that my future revenues will be sufficient to meet those obligations .
ACT THREE
UAW : I have fulfilled my end of the deal by building the automobiles that you have asked me to build .
BIG THREE : Oh no !
I am undone !
My automobiles are no longer competitive due to my years of poor planning and poor judgment !
MITT ROMNEY : This is all UAW ’s fault !
Green Laser Pointer
A New Class of Quantum - State Laser Energetics to Eliminate Embedded , Toxic Electromagnetic Fields in Your Body and targeted areas for healing .
A laser ( light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ) is a device which uses a quantum mechanical effect , stimulated emission , to generate a coherent beam of light from a lasing medium of controlled purity , size , and shape .
For qualified and product trained practitioner use .
Unmodified Lasers
Due to the intrinsic nature of the typical soft laser ( i.e. unidirectional monochromatic light ) , we do NOT recommend using one that has not been spectrally - modified .
Unmodi fied soft lasers do not have the capacity to unencode and break the artificial EMFs surrounding many objects .
In fact , energetic testing of a common soft laser shows that its use weakens body tissue .
Before using this laser , please read the following : Caution :
Do not shine the light from the laser in your eyes .
If it is shined continuously into the eye for up to 6 minutes , it may cause eye damage .
However , if the light briefly enters the eye momentarily ( from moving the laser around in the room ) , this is not a problem ( although it is still best to avoid shining the light into the eye ) .
Be Prepared with an Extra Set of Batteries
In addition , do not forget that when you first receive your new laser , be sure to buy two extra AAA batteries and treat them immediately with the laser .
This will en sure that when the current batteries need replacement , the newer sets will already be un-encoded and ready for use .
Product comes with batteries .
Functional Programming Unit Testing - Part 4 Sunday , December 21 , 2008
In our previous installment , we talked about bringing together the traditional xUnit tests and QuickCheck property - based tests together in a single cohesive step .
For this installment , let 's talk about test coverage .
But , before we continue , let 's get caught up to where we are today :
Code Coverage
Code coverage is an important metric used as part of our design process to describe to what degree our source code has been tested .
The code coverage tools inspect the code directly as a form of white box testing of your code .
I believe having a high code coverage percentage is important , although such hard - line stances of 100 % path code coverage required is most often unnecessary and is evil .
However , for some applications , such as safety - critical , some form of 100 % coverage should be considered .
What do we consider as part of the criteria when we 're calculating code coverage ?
Function coverage
All functions in the program called ?
All functions in the program called ?
Statement coverage
All lines in the program called ?
All lines in the program called ?
Branch coverage
All control structures such as if / then / else evaluated to true and false ?
All control structures such as if / then / else evaluated to true and false ?
Condition coverage
All boolean sub-expressions evaluated to true and false ?
All boolean sub-expressions evaluated to true and false ?
Path coverage
All possible routes through the program called ?
All possible routes through the program called ?
Entry / exit coverage
All possible call and return of the function executed ?
Of course some of these are connected in some way such as the following :
Decision coverage includes statement coverage since exercising every branch must lead to exercising every statement .
Path coverage includes branch coverage .
Where should we focus ?
Using such things as statement coverage , decision coverage , and / or condition / branch coverage , around 80 - 90 % of code coverage would suffice .
Getting to 100 % test code coverage is unrealistic and does n't always ensure quality , and the amount of energy required for this is wasteful .
The number we 're looking for is somewhere greater than 80 % .
We can use above metrics to determine how well we 're writing our tests for our applications .
For many algorithms , it 's important to ensure that we have our edge cases covered , especially those in safety - critical systems .
Let 's walk through an example in Haskell for code coverage .
Code Coverage with Haskell Program Coverage ( HPC )
The Haskell Program Coverage ( HPC ) tool is a built - in extension to the Haskell compiler used to record and display the parts of the code that were executed during a run of your program .
With the criteria given above , we are able to record which functions , branches , expressions among other things were evaluated .
The HPC tool is designed to give you the following metrics :
Expressions used ( Function coverage )
Boolean coverage Guard coverage if confitions Qualifiers
Alternatives used
Local declarations used
Top - level declarations used
Let 's walk through an example of how to use this tool to your advantage .
In the previous post , I 've shown some QuickCheck code that does n't give 100 % code coverage so that I can show you how to better achieve it .
Let 's look at the example again .
First , let 's look at the implementation of the ROT13 algorithm again :
-- file Encryption.hs
module Encryption ( rot13 ) where
import Data .
Char
rot13 :: String ->
String
rot13 =
map mapRot
where mapRot :: Char ->
Char
mapRot c | c >= ' A ' && c <= ' Z ' = rot ' A ' c
| c >= ' a ' && c <= 'z ' = rot ' a ' c
| otherwise = c
rot :: Char -> Char ->
Char
rot b c = chr $ ( ord c - ord b + 13 ) `mod` 26 + ord b
Now , let 's look at our QuickCheck property - based tests to perform to ensure the correctness of our algorithm .
-- file EncryptionTests.hs
import Data .
Char
import Data .
List
import Encryption
import Test .
Framework
import Test .
Framework .
Providers .
QuickCheck
import Test.
QuickCheck
instance Arbitrary Char where
arbitrary = elements ( [ ' A ' .. ' Z ' ] ++ [ ' a ' .. 'z ' ] )
-- Equal
prop_rot13_equals s =
rot13 s == rot13 s
-- Single is inequal to original
prop_rot13_single_notEquals s =
rot13 s /= s
-- Double is equal to original
prop_rot13_double_equals s =
( rot13 . rot13 ) s == s
-- Distribution shapes should be equal
prop_rot13_group_equals s =
get Distro s == get Distro ( rot13 s )
where getDistro = sort .
map length .
group .
sort
tests = [
testGroup " ROT13 Tests " [
testProperty " prop_rot13_equals " prop_rot13_equals ,
testProperty " prop_rot13_single_notEquals " prop_rot13_single_notEquals ,
testProperty " prop_rot13_double_equals " prop_rot13_double_equals ,
testProperty " prop_rot13_group_equals " prop_rot13_group_equals ]
]
main = defaultMain tests
In order for us to capture the test coverage data from HPC , we need to add the - fhpc flag to the command - line for compiling our tests such as this :
> ghc - fhpc EncryptionTests.hs -- make
After instrumenting the code , we then run our code in order to capture the results .
You may have noticed that it created a .hpc folder with a .mix file .
When we run our code , we get the following results as usual .
> EncryptionTests
ROT13 Tests :
prop_rot13_equals : [ OK , passed 100 tests ]
prop_rot13_single_notEquals : [ OK , passed 100 tests ]
prop_rot13_double_equals : [ OK , passed 100 tests ]
prop_rot13_group_equals : [ OK , passed 100 tests ]
Properties Total
Passed 4 4
Failed 0 0
Total 4 4
You will also note that it created a . tix file which captures the actual code coverage metrics .
Let 's now analyze the results of our run :
>hpc report encryptiontests
97 % expressions used ( 95/97 )
33 % boolean coverage ( 1/3 )
33 % guards ( 1/3 ) , 1 always True , 1 unevaluated
100 % ' if ' conditions ( 0/0 )
100 % qualifiers ( 0/0 )
66 % alternatives used ( 2/3 )
100 % local declarations used ( 3/3 )
100 % top - level declarations used ( 8/8 )
Analyzing the results , we realize we 've made a mistake .
If you look back at our Arbitrary Char instance , we 're only using alphabetic characters .
The problem arises is that we 're not testing a portion of our rot13 function which takes a character that is n't alphabetic .
But , when we change this , we have to be mindful that our tests will have to change as well .
Why ?
Because the inequality check will not be successful if there are not letters involved .
Let 's make some changes and then check the results again .
instance Arbitrary Char where
arbitrary = elements ( [ ' A ' .. ' Z ' ] ++ [ ' a ' .. ' z ' ] ++ " !@ #$ %^&* ( ) " )
-- Single is inequal to original
prop_rot13_single_notEquals s =
any is Alpha s == > rot13 s /= s
Now we can recompile our code once again as we did above and do the run once more .
>hpc report encryptiontests
100 % expressions used ( 99/99 )
66 % boolean coverage ( 2/3 )
66 % guards ( 2/3 ) , 1 always True
100 % ' if ' conditions ( 0/0 )
100 % qualifiers ( 0/0 )
100 % alternatives used ( 3/3 )
100 % local declarations used ( 3/3 )
100 % top - level declarations used ( 8/8 )
Much better !
Now we have 100 % coverage on our ROT13 implementation .
We also have the ability to dig deeper into the analysis through the use of the markup command .
This will generate web pages which contain drill - down information about our code metrics .
Below is a sample screen shot of my final results of my last run .
This tool is quite powerful for the code analysis we need to ensure that we 're writing the right kind of tests for our specifications and implementations .
Now , let 's turn our attention to the F# world .
What options do we have ?
Code Coverage with TestDriven.NET and NCover
Once again , the TestDriven .NET addition to F# saves us once again when it comes to code coverage .
With the integration of NCover , we have the ability to perform rather rich analytics on our code much like above using HPC .
Let 's take the code from the previous post and look at the relevant parts .
# light
namespace CodeBetter .
Samples
module EncryptionTests =
open System
open FsCheck
open FsCheck .

open Xunit
open Encryption
open ListExtensions
open FsCheckExtensions

let prop_rot13 _equals s =
propl ( rot13 s = rot13 s )
[< Fact >]
let test_prop_rot13_equals ( ) =
check config prop_rot13_equals
let prop_rot13_double_equals s =
propl ( ( rot13 >> rot13 ) s = s )
[< Fact >]
let test_prop_rot13_double_equals ( ) =
check config prop_rot13_double_equals
let prop_rot13_single_notEquals s =
propl ( rot13 s <> s )
[< Fact >]
let test_prop_rot13_single_notEquals ( ) =

let prop_rot13 _group_equals s =
let getDistro = ListExtensions . defaultSort >>
ListExtensions . group >>
List . map List .

ListExtensions .
defaultSort
propl ( get Distro s = getDistro ( rot13 s ) )
[< Fact >]
let test_prop_rot13_group_equals ( ) =
check config prop_rot13_group_equals
In order to get the code metrics we need , simply right - click on the project and click Test With => Coverage .
This will bring up NCover explorer .
We can then browse our results to once again see our mistake .
Now that we realize our mistake of not including normal characters , let 's make two changes .
First , let 's remove the char generator because the default should suffice .
Unlike the Haskell version , FsCheck comes with an arbitrary char instance already created .
Also , let 's ensure the success of the prop_rot13_single_notEquals function by ensuring that it contains at least one letter such as the following :
let prop_rot13_single_notEquals s =
List .
exists Char .
IsLetter s == >
propl ( rot13 s <> s )
This ensures that if we have at least one letter , we can ensure that the ROT13 transformation will make sure the two strings are not equal .
We can now prove our success by once again running the Test With =>
Coverage option and see the results as below .
Conclusion
Tools such as NCover and the Haskell Program Coverage tool , it can ensure our honesty when it comes to tests , and we get a glaring reminder when we do n't .
These tools , when combined with our traditional xUnit and property - based tests with saturation test generation can be a satisfying experience .
We 've now covered the creation and combination of traditional xUnit tests with property - based tests and how to leverage code coverage as a tool for refining .
There is still more to be covered in this series which includes refactoring .

Heidi Klum ’s Annual Halloween Party
Heidi Klum always manages to show up in the most outrageous , over the top , super unique yet very cool Halloween costumes for her annual Halloween parties .
This year was no different .
Her party was held Friday night at at 1 Oak in New York City .
Here is some pictures of Heidi with her man Seal and also a pic of Pink who attended the bash .
UPDATE : Heidi Klum explains how they came up with the idea of her costume :
“ It was actually my assistant ’s idea .
My husband [ Seal ] and I were in India last year , so she said , ‘ Why do n’t you do an Indian goddess ?
Like a scary Indian goddess ? ’
And I said ‘ OK !’
“ So then she Googled around and she found Kali and showed me a picture , and I loved it , ” Klum said .
“ I loved it because she ’s so mean and killed all these different people and [ had ] fingers hanging off [ her ] and little shrunken heads everywhere . ”

( CNN ) --
After eight years as senator from New York , Hillary Clinton is trading places , moving from Congress to the incoming administration .
Former President Bill Clinton has been mentioned as a possible replacement for his wife in the Senate .
On Monday , President - elect Barack Obama announced that he asked his former rival to be his secretary of state .
That means the scramble begins to replace Clinton on Capitol Hill .
Among those mentioned to take her seat as New York 's junior senator is her husband , former President Bill Clinton .
At a news conference in Chicago , Illinois , on Monday , after Obama announced her selection , Clinton said she wanted to " thank my fellow New Yorkers who have , for eight years , given me the joy of a job I love with the opportunity to work on issues I care deeply , in a state that I cherish . "
Clinton added that " leaving the Senate is very difficult for me . "
The task of choosing a successor falls to David Paterson , New York 's Democratic governor .
Whomever he picks would serve for two years , before a special election in November 2010 to decide who fills the last two years of Clinton 's term .
Paterson has a strong bench to choose from .
There are a number of contenders , including at least eight members of New York 's delegation in the House of Representatives , New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown , Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion , Nassau County Executive Thomas Suozzi , Caroline Kennedy , and her cousin , Robert Kennedy Jr.
" This is not an election .
This is not a campaign .
It 's a constituency of one .
David Paterson .
It 's all about what the governor wants to do , " said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg , editor and publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report .
" Paterson has said he would prefer someone from upstate New York , or a woman or an Hispanic candidate , " Rothenberg said .
As for some of the more unconventional picks , Rothenberg said Paterson could " try to make a splash with a big name like Robert Kennedy Jr. " or a " quirky interesting pick " of someone like Caroline Kennedy , who is not a politician .
But some are suggesting the former president should take his wife 's seat .
In an op - ed column last week in The Washington Post , journalists Karl Meyer and Shareen Blair Brysac urged Paterson to " send Bill Clinton to the Senate . "
If that happened , Clinton would become the third former president to go from the White House to Capitol Hill .
President John Quincy Adams lost his re-election bid in 1828 .
Two years later he returned to Washington after winning election as a congressman from his home state of Massachusetts .
He served in the House of Representatives until his death in 1848 .
President Andrew Johnson also served as a Senator from Tennessee in 1875 , 7 years after the Senate acquitted him of impeachment charges .
He died a few months after taking office .
Bill Clinton would bring gravitas to the job , and he obviously knows his way around Washington .
But some Democratic strategists who used to work for Bill Clinton do n't think the former president would want to go from leader of the free world to being the junior senator from New York .
Clinton 's office deferred to Paterson 's office when asked for a comment .
In a statement released Monday in which he praised the choice of Hillary Clinton for the nation 's top diplomatic post , Paterson said , " In order to appoint the best possible candidate to replace Sen .
Clinton , I am consulting with a wide variety of individuals from all across New York State .
" I expect to announce Sen . Clinton 's replacement when the position becomes officially vacant , " he said .

How do you like paying for education , health care , housing and safety - net benefits for illegal aliens that are streaming into America by the millions ?
How do you like our open border policy and the lack of enforcement of existing laws that have become the magnet for those millions to come here in the first place ?
And how do you like the fact that politicians in both parties purposely allow these things to happen , for the sole purpose of increasing their base of future voters ?
To make matters worse , under the current regime , ( socialist administration ) amnesty for illegals is coming our way very soon , no matter how most Americans will object .
After all , these politicians know what is best for us , do n’t they ?
How do you like individuals being appointed by the new president to become Secretary of the Treasury , who will oversee the IRS , when the appointee has cheated on his income tax , hired illegal aliens as house keepers and some other little misdeeds he was purported to have committed ?
How do you like an individual ( Holder ) with an avowed mindset against individual gun ownership , being appointed to the top American Justice official , attorney general of the United States ?
How do you like your tax dollars being used in foreign aid , that is given to dictators , despots and other cretins who use our money for their own enrichment and trickle only a few of our dollars to their “ subjects ” ?
Did you know that your current socialist president is now pushing for 0.7 % of our Gross Domestic Product ( GDP - $ 14 Trillion ) to be paid out in foreign aid , because that is what the United Nations says is the fair amount for America ?
Did you know that 0.7 % of GDP is just shy of $ 100,000,000,000 ( billion ) dollars of our tax money going offshore , and for what ?
This is nothing more than government forcing you to be charitable to the entire world , at the point of a gun .
( Do n’t think so ?
Try not paying your taxes . )
National Health Care is coming whether we like it our not .
Did you know that Obama ’s current stimulus package of almost $ 1 Trillion dollars , sets aside $ 600,000,000 to prepare for National Health Care ?
If they are spending this kind of money for preparation , you can bet we will get National Health Care .
How do you like government telling you what to eat , what to wear , where to live , where to work , what to drive , or being forced to not drive at all and paying for government mega- projects that always come with huge cost overruns , where they have to go back to the taxpayer for more money to finish the project ?
Happens every time .
Government is the epitome of waste , fraud , abuse and corruption .
How do you like your government telling you that you have to get off of oil , drive your car less and decrease your carbon foot print to save us from the dire predictions of the fraud that is man-caused global warming ?
How will you like the cost of everything increasing because of government ’s headlong drive to decrease man-caused CO2 emissions and engage in the insanity of cap and trade policies ?
How do you like your government telling you that you have to subsidize highly inefficient wind and solar power , that is but a small fraction of what oil and coal produce ?
How do you like the fact that environmentalists and government have stood in the way of clean nuclear energy for 30 years ?
How do you like government telling you what you can or cannot do with your land ?
And you rural landowners , how do you feel about being asked to bear almost the entire burden of environmental protection , while your city brethren get off virtually scot - free ?
These same city folks who have the majority votes to elect the politicians that pass the environmental laws that only affect rural landowners .
That ’s fair , is n’t it ?
No it is n’t fair and in fact , violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution .
How do you like your federal government sticking their fingers into local public schools and mandating , with federal law , socialism , radical environmentalism , multi-culturalism and the one - world - order being taught to your children in those schools ?
How do you like the fact that the federal government prints the books that teach our children about our form of government , but those books teach that our form of government is a Constitutional Democracy , not a Constitutional Republic ?
The distinctions between a Democracy and a Republic are a canyon wide .
Does brainwashing and indoctrination come to mind ?
How do you like the fact that the injustices that were being inflicted on the colonials in 1776 , that caused them to revolt against the tyrannical rule of England , are now the very same injustices Americans are being accosted with , by their own government , for the last 80 to 100 years ?
How do you like the fact that under the current Obama administration and a very liberal congress , those injustices will increase at an accelerated rate ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The giant question is , how long will freedom - loving Americans take it ?
How long will the producers put up with paying for the non-producers and outright billion - dollar gifts in foreign aid ?
How long will those brave Americans who are embedded with the song of liberty , take the theft of their sweat , blood and tears , before they say , enough is enough ?
Which of the injustices we are now enduring , will be the trigger that will send a large percentage of these Americans over the edge and declare civil war against the non-producers , who leverage government with their majority vote , to fill their government - sponsored “ pig trough ” ?
Or , how long will it be before the producers of our society , either “ check out ” , or declare war on their own government for these injustices ?
The current direction of America will and is producing mediocrity , self - loathing and a decline in production and morality .
These cultural maladies will only get worse on this path we take .
Predictions of future events is a dicey game .
Many have tried but predictions , throughout history , turn out to be mostly inaccurate ..... the Mayans , Nostradamus and a few others have been given marginal credit .
But we will take a stab at some general predictions .
The hard truth is , we are headed for a civil war .
Nevertheless , rest assured , this will not be the civil war of 1861 , wherein brother rises up against brother and state declares war against another state or states .
This war wo n’t be fought with larger - than - life generals , unless nationwide anarchy ensues .
As the liberals in the current administration squeeze Americans with their socialist , radical environmental and one - world - order agenda , as they work towards dismantling American sovereignty , even more so than previous administrations have done , small armed revolts will begin to appear in isolated areas .
These small revolts will be immediately squashed by local law enforcement .
Even so , the small revolts will grow and become larger ones .
There will be individual attacks on other individuals for perceived threats or revenge for acts of violence .
Occasions of Hatfield and McCoy feuds will grow .
There will be attacks by individuals on government institutions , as more and more folks let their growing frustrations morph into violent acts .
There will be individual and multiple violent attacks on illegal aliens .
Still , other non-violent revolts will come in the form of silent and noisy protests .
Some revolts will come in the form of disobeying the law and withholding taxes .
These are already happening .
Some will come in the form of increased lobbying of politicians and rising numbers of court cases to undo what the liberals have done and are doing .
But even worse , some will come in the form of wholesale cheating .
The prevailing attitude will be , if the government can cheat , abuse our trust and their power and corrupt our institutions , why should individual Americans be any different ?
A breakdown in morality , honesty , integrity and honor will accelerate .
This breakdown is already well underway .
Large infusions of borrowed or printed dollars for government stimulus packages and outright handouts , will accelerate inflation and / or end up in hyper inflation .
This will lead to rising hunger as it takes more dollars to buy the necessities of life .
Rising hunger will trigger more government intervention and the requirement for more taxes .
Taxes will rise accordingly .
More banks will fail .
A deep depression could be just around the corner .
In some of these occurrences , the government will declare martial law and they will suspend constitutional protections , like Habeas Corpus , as did President Lincoln during the Civil War .
All these things will come to pass in one form or another , because “ We The People ” have allowed government to become all powerful and corrupt and this corruption has infected a large percentage of the American population .
Should we not return to the principles of our constitution , should we not re-claim our morality , and soon , as a country and as a free society we are doomed to fail and ultimate disintegration .
If were trying to fail , we are doing an excellent job .
In spite of these dire predictions , there is still time to save America , if only the millions of Americans who cherish freedom , will rise up individually and collectively and get involved in the hard work of preserving , protecting and defending our Constitution and giving aid and comfort to those organizations that are working valiantly on their behalf .
And to that end , have you GIVEN YOUR DOLLAR FOR FREEDOM today ?
A bipartisan report released by Sens. Carl Levin and John McCain blames former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other high - level officials for interrogation abuses .
Based on an 18 - month investigation by the Senate Armed Services Committee , the report determined that prisoner abuse “ was not simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own , ” as the administration has claimed .
New York Times :
The report also rejected previous claims by Mr. Rumsfeld and others that Defense Department policies played no role in the harsh treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in late 2003 and in other episodes of abuse .
The abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib , the report says , “ was not simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own ” but grew out of interrogation policies approved by Mr. Rumsfeld and other top officials , who “ conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees . ”

" The maps are not definitive works on the etymological roots of geographical names but more of a stimulus , and a very amusing one at that , to make us think about why places are called as they are , " explains Sean Quigley of Outstanding Map Distributors , the firm which has brought the maps to Britain from Germany , where they were originally published .
If you follow my Skeptoid podcast at all , you probably know that my all - time leading episode , by number of comments posted to the web site , is the one about MonaVie .
It was actually about “ superfruit ” juices in general , but MonaVie distributors are the ones who have been pounding the site like a horde of Mongols and posting their comments .
I graciously call it “ posting comments ” , it ’s really more like harling .
Harling , for those perhaps unfamiliar with the term , is the process of refinishing the walls of a Scottish castle by harling , or throwing , a handful of plastery weatherproofing ( called harl ) at the wall .
Manure was a prominent ingredient in some harl .
So I like to describe what the MonaVie distributors do as “ harling ” their comments at my site .
And , for some reason , I ’m still constantly amazed at how many people in my neighborhood buy into MonaVie , both literally and figuratively .
Without exception they parrot what they ’ve been told ; that it gives them more energy , it prevents illness , and generally promotes better health .
How does it do this ?
If pressed for an explanation , they best they can come up with is that the açai from which it ’s made ( in part ) is high in antioxidants and / or vitamins .
Thus MonaVie ’s comically high price is justified ( a variety of similar juices are available in supermarkets at about a tenth the price , just without the fancy wine bottle and high school dropout pyramid business model ) .
This health claim is , as the saying goes , “ so wrong it ’s not even wrong ” .
At every level , this logic fails .
It is based on the following assumptions :
MonaVie is high in antioxidants .
Antioxidant supplementation has beneficial effects .
We are all suffering from some antioxidant and / or vitamin deficiency .
1 . We know that açai juice is not especially high in antioxidants ( see this study by Australia ’s consumer publication Choice ) .
Eating an apple gives you more antioxidants than drinking a serving of any popular açai juice .
And açai is only one of MonaVie ’s 19 fruit concentrates ( the rest of its ingredients are sweeteners and preservatives , like most similar fruit juices ) .
2 . We know that antioxidant supplementation has , so far , not been shown to have any health benefits ( see this analysis of current research by Dr. Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch ) .
The oxidation of molecules is an important metabolic process .
It makes no sense to try to attack it with antioxidants , just because you heard “ they prevent aging ” or some such nonsense .
3 . We know that vitamin supplementation has no plausible value for people not suffering from a deficiency .
With few exceptions , almost nobody who eats most of their meals in an industrialized country is likely to have a vitamin deficiency .
And if you did , you ’d be symptomatic , you ’d know it , and it would show up on a blood test .
If that ’s not the case ( which it ’s probably not for anyone wealthy enough to own a computer on which to read this ) , your body already has all the vitamins it requires , and your regular diet already delivers more than your body uses .
It ’s like a car with a full tank .
Overfilling the gas tank , so that it spills on the ground , is not going to give your car superpowers or super speed or super endurance or “ more energy ” .
More vitamins than your body needs constitute just one thing : Waste .
Your car ’s gas tank ca n’t be fuller than full , and your body ca n’t be healthier than healthy .
You either have an illness , or you do n’t :
You ca n’t have a super duper lack of illness .
Sometimes when a friend boastfully tells me that he had his MonaVie shot this morning , I ’ll react with mock horror and say “ Oh my gosh !!
How terrible ; what did your blood test show ? ”
Nothing ?
What did he think he was treating ?
Health ?
Success has many fathers ; failure is an orphan .
Then there is Bank of America 's acquisition of Merrill Lynch , a deal skating dangerously close to the definition of failure after last week 's announcement that BofA would take $ 24 billion more in government support from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , in addition to a $ 118 billion backstop for bad debts .
The core problem remains unexplained and inexplicable : How did Merrill 's troubled assets plummet in value so quickly that the firm posted a $ 15 billion loss in just three months ?
And why did neither BofA nor Merrill provide any word ?
Associated PressTraffic passes a Bank of America branch in New YorkAnd now the deal 's fathers are stepping back .
This Wall Street Journal article shows that cracks are starting to show in the already - tenuous alliance between Merrill and BofA .
Merrill directors complain that Chief Executive John
Thain never informed them of steep losses before government intervention .
Greg Fleming , the president of Merrill Lynch who urged John Thain to speak with BofA CEO Ken Lewis , has left .
The bankers are washing their hands .
BofA advisers Christopher Flowers and investment bank Fox -Pitt Kelton say they did n't see either company 's books after the deal was announced on Sept. 15 .
Shareholders and analysts are livid .
BofA is tenuously capitalized , in the opinion of Friedman Billings Ramsey analysts , going into 2009 with just $ 61.7 billion of pro forma tangible common equity supporting $ 2.4 trillion of tangible assets .
And the whole brouhaha is wrapped in an ironic ribbon : the U.S. federal government , which has for upward of 70 years urged ever more transparency for publicly traded companies , did n't feel the urge to tell of a mid-December financing agreement that affected the future and value of two of the U.S 's biggest financial institutions .
And remember , the federal government owns 35 % of Bank of America 's pro forma tangible equity .
BofA moved up its earnings announcement to Friday in order to soothe investors and clarify the situation .
Unfortunately , investors wanted more information than BofA provided .
The result ?
Bank of America 's shares have plummeted , costing as much as $ 20 billion of market value in two trading days .
The stock fell nearly 30 % Tuesday to $ 5.10 .
What is puzzling is that none of Merrill 's rivals , including Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley , experienced anything nearly as severe in asset devaluations in December -- the period that BofA is saying that Merrill assets plummeted in value .
The biggest credit crisis in the markets was in late September , after Lehman Brothers Holdings collapsed .
Investors are left asking what comparable event in December would have led Merrill to triple its quarterly loss .
In short , it has been an object lesson in ' How Not To Communicate With Shareholders .
' What makes it all the more puzzling is that there are precedents for the markets severely punishing banks that did not give enough reliable or timely information about their financial situation : think Bear Stearns and Lehman .
And we know how those turned out .
There is only next step for Bank of America : come clean , and fast .
If BofA and Merrill Lynch do n't shed some light on which of Merrill 's bad assets are causing the trouble and why things went so badly so quickly , investors will continue to subtract every bit of value -- and more -- that Bank of America received from buying Merrill in the first place .
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
What is next ?
If the " Great Depression 2 " scenario plays out , what 's after 2011 ?
Recovery ?
A new bull ?
How can you protect your money ?
Or are we all helpless victims of the raging winds of fate and Wall Street 's self - serving brand of capitalism .
Let 's review several scenarios in the bright lens of Akira Kurosawa 's classic 1950 film , " Rashomon , " at once an ancient Kabuki morality play , a tense modern courtroom drama , and a revealing documentary on human psychology .
In " Rashomon " we witness the murder of a Samurai warrior and a rape through the eyes of several witnesses , each swearing they saw what " really happened . "
We " see " these tragedies in a forest through the eyes of a Woodcutter , Priest , Samurai 's Wife , the accused Bandit , and the Samurai , speaking through a Medium .
But as " the facts " unfold , the lies and contractions of biased minds are exposed and the truth becomes increasingly blurred .
In the end , we are still wondering : What really happened ?
Similarly , today we 're asking ; " What really happened to America , so fast ? "
With Bush , Paulson , Bernanke and their Reaganomics ideology ?
To my 401 ( k ) , my CDs , my kid 's college fund , my retirement nest egg .
To the great American dream ?
What happened ?
Nightmare scenario No. 1 : No exit , a never - ending disaster
Remember former Goldman Chairman John Whitehead ?
He " sees " a tragic ending : This Reagan Deputy Secretary of State and former New York Fed chairman " sees " America burning through trillions , over many years : " Nothing but large increases in the deficit ... worse than the Depression . "
See previous Paul B. Farrell .
He worries that " tomorrow is the day Moody 's and S&P will announce a downgrade of U.S. government bonds . "
Politicians and public are delusional , promising huge new programs plus tax cutting : " This is a road to disaster . '
Like Sartre 's existential tragedy , " No Exit , " he says : " I do n't see a solution . "
If this dialogue emerged in " Rashomon , " deep in the forest , I could " see " Whitehead pointing a finger at Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , accusing him of terrible deeds .
Nightmare scenario No. 2 : Washington 's unsustainable deficits
True to the " Rashomon " narrative Warren Buffett " sees " America sinking in a swamp of unsustainable debt to justify our excessive spending -- government , consumer , corporate .
Remember Buffett 's famous farmer 's story : " We were taught in Economics 101 that countries could not for long sustain large , ever - growing trade deficits . "
America " has been behaving like an extraordinarily rich family that possesses an immense farm .
In order to consume 4 % more than they produce , that 's the trade deficit , we have , day by day , been both selling pieces of the farm and increasing the mortgage on what we still own . "
See previous Paul B. Farrell .
Like his farmers , we borrowed $ 700 billion a year to live high on the hog , selling off American assets .
Now foreign sovereign funds own trillions of our assets .
Today Uncle Warren 's story is less a children 's fairy tale and more a " Rashomon " tragedy .
Nightmare scenario No. 3 : The endless 100 - year bear market
Robert Prechter 's a brilliant market forecaster and editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist newsletter .
As early as 1978 he predicted the " raging bull market of the 1980s . "
Many laughed .
Then tech roared and he became " Guru of the Decade . "
In the " Rashomon " cast he 's credible .
And ahead again : He " saw " the future in his " At the Crest of the Wave : A Forecast of the Great Bear Market . "
Today 's darkening markets ride his " wave " theories : Rapidly unfolding , accelerating and intensifying economic cycles .
First the dot - com crash , then the subprime housing bull , the credit meltdown , now the coming " Great Depression 2 . "
In the '90s , Prechter had another vision from deep in the forest .
Again we ignored him .
No more .
The same wisdom that let him " see " the 1980 's bull years before it took off , may accurately predict the coming 100 - year bear market well ahead of time .
See previous Paul B. Farrell .
Nightmare scenario No. 4 : Pentagon ' warfare defines human life '
In " Rashomon " they see all , we nothing .
In courtrooms , lawyers deceive , suppress the truth .
Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke are masters of deception in the courtroom of public opinion , as descendents of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
One intentional leak ( obviously designed as a tactic to stoke public fear and create budget support for the DOD 's war machine ) surfaced in the early days of the Iraq War .
Fortune analyzed a classified military report , the Pentagon 's " Weather Nightmare : " " Climate could change radically and fast .
That would be the mother of all national security issues ... massive droughts , turning farmland into dust bowls and forests to ashes ... by 2020 there is little doubt that something drastic is happening ... an old pattern could emerge ; warfare defining human life . "
See previous Paul B. Farrell .
Today , as a " Great Depression " and a " 100 - year Bear Market " become more real than a " Rashomon " sequel , ask yourself :
Are there too many people ?
Too few resources ?
Too many competing special interests ?
In America ?
Worldwide ?
Are we all too greedy to compromise ?
Are we then left vulnerable to Paulson 's multiple Reaganomics " weapons of financial mass destruction , " land mines surviving his exit in bailout " sleeper cells , " left to sabotage government budgets , taxpayers and the future of America ?
Nightmare scenario No. 5 : Too many people , too few resources
The Earth supports 6.5 billion people .
The United Nations predicts there will be 9.1 billion by 2050 , all competing against 400 million Americans for ever - scarcer resources .
The L.A. Times says that a U.N. report " paints a near - apocalyptic vision of Earth 's future : hundreds of millions of people short of water , extreme food shortages in Africa , a landscape ravaged by floods and millions of species sentenced to extinction . "
Today 's news suggests we may already be there , for the population explosion is the mother of all bubbles , a " nuclear " bomb that will explode all other bubbles , ushering onto the " Rashomon " stage a reality far beyond a 100 - year bear , on a desolate , post - apocalyptic WALL -E planet Earth .
See previous Paul B. Farrell .
Nightmare scenario No. 6 : Star Trek 's bold new 'end of days '
One " Star Trek : The Next Generation " episode haunts me , much like " Rashomon . "
In it past and future collide .
Set in the 23rd century , " Inner Light " gives us a brief end - of - days look at the star - crossed future of two civilizations , one boldly exploring new worlds , the other leaving behind but a small sad trace of its mysterious disappearance .
Two planets , which is our metaphor ?
See previous Paul B. Farrell .
The Enterprise encounters a probe floating in space .
Suddenly an energy beam zaps Captain Picard .
He wakes up on an alien planet .
Recovering from a fever he is " Kamin , " ca n't recognize his " wife . "
Friends think he 's delusional , mumbling about being a starship captain .
Trapped in this parallel universe , time passes .
Memories of his prior life fade .
He falls in love with his wife , raises a family , kids , grandkids , lives the peaceful life he only imagined in space .
But his new planet 's resources gradually disappear .
Temperatures rise .
Water scarcer .
Desert lands spread .
The Pentagon scenario ?
Near the end , he watches a missile soar into space , an intergalactic time capsule , a final record of a once - great civilization .
Suddenly the probe turns off .
Picard awakes on floor of the Enterprise bridge .
Twenty minutes passed .
Engine power returns .
They continue boldly going where no one has gone before , left with memories of a simple life on a dying planet that vanished eons ago .
Ask yourself :
Are we boldly going anywhere ?
Will someone , someday be reading our probe ?
Nightmare scenario No. 7 : No - Growth Economics vs. Neo-Capitalism
While Goldman former Chairman Whitehead gave up , there is still a solution , one way to dodge the " Great Depression 2 , " the " 100 - Year Bear . "
I reviewed this scenario in a recent issue of Adbusters magazine , where legendary economist Herman Daly was recently named " Man of the Year . "
The Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy " says this new greener economic theory calls for " stabilized population and consumption .
Such stability means that the amount of resource throughput and waste disposal remains roughly constant . "
In this theory , all systems are in balance .
" The key features of a steady state economy are : sustainable scale , in which economic activities fit within the capacity provided by ecosystems ; fair distribution of wealth ; and efficient allocation of resources . "
This new economics may be what sustains the Star Trek culture in the 23rd century , but unfortunately , it is unlikely to get broad support in today 's free market Reaganomics capitalism , let alone support from America 's political parties or any sovereign nations in today 's highly competitive international arena ... at least not until we 've gone past the point of no return , like that mysterious planet recorded on the probe discovered in the 23rd century by Star Trek 's Captain Picard .
As in " Rashomon , " we " see " many competing scenarios , " seen " through many competing " eyes . '
Yet , for the victims , the end game is always tragically irreversible .
We may , however , find some comfort in the " wave theory , " for all waves emerge , ripple , oscillate , accelerate until they inevitably self - destruct and fade .
Earth appears destined to accelerate to 9 billion ... exhausting Earth 's resources ... in a self - destructive Pentagon global warfare scenario ... driven by another Great Depression ... and 100 - year bear market .
In the end Whitehead said it all : " This is a road to disaster ... I do n't see a solution . "
Probe dims , fade to black .
Or will we finally wake up ... and take command of our starship ?
ROME ( Reuters ) - Birdwatchers the world over , here ’s a challenge for you .
The slender - billed curlew is seen at its wintering site of Merja Zerga , Morocco , in a February 1995 photo .
REUTERS / Chris Gomersall / Royal Society for the Protection of Birds / Handout
Conservationists launched a global quest on Thursday for the slender - billed curlew , the rarest bird in Europe , North Africa and the Middle East , which was last spotted in Oman in 1999 .
They want birdwatchers to help find out whether the bird still exists -- and are handing out a toolkit complete with pictures , a map of the most recent sightings and a recording of the bird ’s call to make identification easier .
“ This is the Holy Grail of birdwatching .
We need to find it before it ’s too late to save it , ” said Nicola Crockford of Britain ’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , one of the main conservation groups behind the campaign .
“ Next winter we will have the first ever comprehensive international survey to find the bird -- it will stretch all the way from Morocco right the way through to Iran , the Mediterranean , the Red Sea and the Middle East , ” she told Reuters in an interview .
Besides deploying an army of professional bird counters to the wetlands where the bird may still survive , Crockford is asking volunteer birdwatchers to join the search -- and is even thinking of offering a reward .
“ It is just possible that small numbers of the bird may still be wintering in an isolated part of North Africa or the Middle East , or that some unknown nesting site may be discovered in the depths of central Asia , ” she said .
The crow - sized bird , also known as Numenius tenuirostris , used to be seen regularly and in large flocks -- it was regarded as very common in some areas of the Mediterranean .
Its only known breeding ground is in Siberia .
But its population declined dramatically during the 20th century because of hunting and loss of its wetland habitat .
It could be now numbering lower than 50 , if it is not extinct altogether .
The most recent verified sightings are of one to three birds , compared to flocks of over 100 birds in the 1960s and 1970s .
DON’T FORGET THE RINGTONE
The bird ’s bill has a fine , sharp tip and is characteristically slender and much narrower than that of the Eurasian curlew .
Adults have dark , brownish spots rather than streaks on pale breasts .
The slender - billed curlew is also known for its unusual migratory patterns , going east - west rather than north - south , and preferring to fly inland rather than on the coast .
It is considered a relatively tame bird , which may explain why it has been decimated by hunters and tends to feed higher up the wetland shore than other birds .
Conservationists hope that if surviving specimen are found , they can put satellite tags on them and follow them through their migration .
That is why the campaign is being launched in the winter , when birds tend to stay in the same place for long enough making it is easier to track them down .
Crockford says birdwatchers wanting to help should do what she did -- download the only recorded call from the bird on their mobile phone so they can become familiar with it .
That call , which can be found on www.slenderbilledcurlew.net, came from a bird recovering from a shooting wound in Morocco in January 1990 .
“ People should have it as their ring tone ... and then this call will become enshrined in their minds and when they are out in the field they will think ‘ Ah , the slender - billed curlew ’ or ‘ my mobile phone ’ . ”
From HaskellWiki
One of Haskell 's main features is non-strict semantics , which is implemented by lazy evaluation in all popular Haskell compilers .
However many Haskell libraries found on Hackage are implemented as if Haskell were a strict language .
This leads to unnecessary inefficiencies , memory leaks and , we suspect , unintended semantics .
In this article we want to go through some techniques on how to check lazy behaviour on functions , examples of typical constructs which break laziness without need , and finally we want to link to techniques that may yield the same effect without laziness .
Checking laziness
manual checks
If you want to check whether a function is lazy enough , you may feed it with undefined values .
An undefined value can be undefined , error " reason " , or an infinite loop .
The latter one has the advantage that it cannot be hidden by some hacks like " catching " the error in the IO monad .
Examples : Check whether filter is lazy :
filter even [ 0 .. ] filter even ( [ 0 .. 5 ] ++ undefined )
If the filter function is lazy then it keeps generating elements in the first case and it outputs a prefix of the output list , before breaking because of the undefined , in the second case .
An automated unit test can check whether infinite or corrupted input data produces correct prefixes .
Those tests usually do not fail by returning False but by leading to undefined results , either explicit undefined or an infinite loop .
testFilter0 = filter even [ 0 .. 100 ] ` is PrefixOf ` filter even [ 0 .. ] testFilter1 = filter even [ 0 .. 100 ] ` is PrefixOf ` filter even ( [ 0 .. 102 ] ++ undefined ) testFilter2 = let x = filter even [ 0 .. ] !!
100 in x == x test Filter3 = let x = filter even ( [ 0 .. 102 ] ++ undefined ) !!
50 in x == x
automated checks
If you are lazy when searching for laziness breakers , you may use the automated tool StrictCheck .
* StrictCheck > test1 10 ( unzip :: [( Int , Int ) ] -> ([ Int ] , [ Int ] ) )
Function seems not to be least strict .
Input ( s ) : _ | _ Current output : _ | _ Proposed output : ( _ | _ , _ | _ ) Continue ?
Laziness breakers
Maybe , Either , Exceptions
Some laziness breakers are visible in type signatures :
decodeUTF8 :: [ Word8 ] ->
Either Message String
The Either type signals that the function marks decoding - failure by using the Left constructor of Either .
This function cannot be lazy , because when you access the first character of the result , it must already be computed , whether the result is Left or Right .
For this decision , the complete input must be decoded .
A better type signature is
decodeUTF8 :: [ Word8 ] -> ( Maybe Message , String )
where the String contains as much characters as could be decoded and Maybe Message gives the reason for the stop of the decoding .
Nothing means the input was completely read , Just msg means the decoding was aborted for the reason described in msg .
If you touch the first element of the pair , the complete decodings is triggered , thus laziness is broken .
This means you should first process the String and look at Maybe Message afterwards .
Instead of the unspecific pair type you should use the special type for asynchronous exceptions as found in the explicit exception package .
Especially in parsers you may find a function , called Wadler 's force function .
It works as follows :
force y = let Just x = y in Just x
It looks like a complicated expression for y with an added danger of failing unrecoverably when y is not Just .
Its purpose is to use the lazy pattern matching of let and to show to the runtime system , that we expect that y is always a Just .
Then the runtime system does not need to wait until it can determine the right constructor but it can proceed immediately .
This way , a function can be made lazy , also if it returns Maybe .
It can however fail , if later it turns out , that y is actually Nothing .
Using force - like functions is sometimes necessary , but should be avoided for data types with more than one constructor .
It is better to use an interim data type with one constructor and lift to the multi-constructor datatype when needed .
Consider parsers of type StateT [ Word8 ] Maybe a .
many :: StateT [ Word8 ] Maybe a -> StateT [ Word8 ] Maybe [ a ]
Now consider the parser combinator
which parses as many elements of type a as possible .
It shall be lazy and thus must be infallible and must not use the Maybe .
It shall just return an empty list , if parsing of one element fails .
A quick hack would be to define many using a force function .
It would be better to show by the type , that many cannot fail :
many :: StateT [ Word8 ] Maybe a -> StateT [ Word8 ] Identity [ a ]
Early decision
List construction
Be aware that the following two expressions are not equivalent .
-- less lazy if b then f x else f y -- more lazy f ( if b then x else y )
It is if undefined then f x else f y is undefined , whereas f ( if b then x else y ) is f undefined , which is a difference in non-strict semantics .
Consider e.g. if b then ' a ':x else ' a ':y .
It is common source of too much strictness to make decisions too early and thus duplicate code in the decision branches .
Intuitively spoken , the bad thing about code duplication ( stylistic questions put aside ) is , that the run -time system cannot see that in the branches , some things are equal and do it in common before the critical decision .
Actually , the compiler and run-time system could be " improved " to do so , but in order to keep things predictable , they do not do so .
Even more , this behaviour is required by theory , since by pushing decisions to the inner of an expression you change the semantics of the expression .
So we return to the question , what the programmer actually wants .
Now , do you think this expression
if b then [ x ] else y : ys
is maximally lazy ?
It seems so , but actually it is not .
In both branches we create non-empty lists , but the run -time system cannot see this .
It is null ( if undefined then [ x ] else y:ys ) again undefined , but we like to have it evaluated to False .
Here we need lazy pattern matching as provided by let .
let z : zs = if b then [ x ] else y : ys in z : zs
This expression always returns the constructor ( :) and thus null knows that the list is not empty .
However , this is a little bit unsafe , because the let z:zs may fail if in the branches of if there is an empty list .
This error can only caught at run -time which is bad .
We can avoid it using the single constructor pair type .
let ( z , zs ) = if b then ( x , [ ] ) else ( y , ys ) in z : zs
which can be abbreviated to
uncurry ( : ) ( if b then ( x , [ ] ) else ( y , ys ) )
Another example is the inits function .
In the Haskell 98 report the implementation
inits :: [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] inits [ ] = [ [ ] ] inits ( x : xs ) = [ [ ] ] ++ map ( x : ) ( inits xs )
is suggested .
However you find that inits undefined is undefined , although inits always should return the empty list as first element .
The following implementation does exactly this :
inits :: [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] inits xt = [ ] : case xt of [ ] -> [ ] x : xs -> map ( x : ) ( inits xs )
See also the article on base cases and identities .
Reader - Writer - State monad
I do not know whether the following example can be simplified .
In this form it occurred in a real application , namely the HTTP package .
Consider the following action of the Control .
Monad .RWS which fetches a certain number of elements from a list .
The state of the monad is the input list we fetch the elements from .
The reader part provides an element which means that the input is consumed .
It is returned as singleton when the caller tries to read from a completely read input .
The writer allows to log some information , however the considered action does not output anything to the log .
getN :: Int -> RWS a [ Int ] [ a ] [ a ] getN n = do input <- get if null input then asks ( : [ ] ) else let ( fetched , rest ) = splitAt n input in put rest >> return fetched
As we learned as good imperative programmers , we only call splitAt when the input is non-empty , that is , only if there is something to fetch .
This works in even more many corner cases , but not in the following one .
Although getN does obviously not log something ( i.e. it does not call tell ) , it requires to read the input in order to find out , that nothing was logged :
* Test > ( \ ( _a , _s , w ) -> w ) $ runRWS ( getN 5 ) '
' undefined *** Exception : Prelude .
undefined
The problem is again , that if checks the emptiness of the input , which is undefined , since the input is undefined .
Thus we must ensure , that the invoked monadic actions are run independent from the input .
Only this way , the run -time system can see that the logging stream is never touched .
We start refactoring by calling put independently from input 's content .
It works as well for empty lists , since splitAt will just return empty lists in this case .
getN :: Int -> RWS a [ Int ] [ a ] [ a ] getN n = do input <- get let ( fetched , rest ) = splitAt n input put rest if null input then asks ( : [ ] ) else return fetched
This does n't resolve the problem .
There is still a choice between asks and return .
We have to pull out ask as well .
getN :: Int -> RWS a [ Int ] [ a ] [ a ] getN n = do input <- get let ( fetched , rest ) = splitAt n input put rest endOfInput <- ask return $ if null input then [ endOfInput ] else fetched
Now things work as expected :
* Test > ( \ ( _a , _s , w ) -> w ) $ runRWS ( getN 5 ) '
' undefined [ ]
We learn from this example , that sometimes in Haskell it is more efficient to call functions that are not needed under some circumstances .
Always remind , that the do notation looks only imperative , but it is not imperative .
E.g. , endOfInput is only evaluated if the end of the input is really reached .
Thus , the call ask does not mean that there is actually an action performed between put and return .
Strict pattern matching in a recursion
Consider the partition function which sorts elements , that match a predicate , into one list and the non-matching elements into another list .
This function should also work on infinite lists , but the implementation shipped with GHC up to 6.2 failed on infinite lists .
What happened ?
The reason was that pattern matching was too strict .
Let 's first consider the following correct implementation :
partition :: ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] -> ( [ a ] , [ a ] ) partition p = foldr ( \ x ~ ( y , z ) -> if p x then ( x : y , z ) else ( y , x : z ) ) ( [ ] , [ ] )
The usage of foldr seems to be reserved for advanced programmers .
Formally foldr runs from the end to the start of the list .
However , how can this work if there is a list without an end ?
That can be seen when applying the definition of foldr .
foldr :: ( a -> b -> b ) -> b -> [ a ] -> b foldr _ b [ ] = b foldr f b ( a : as ) = f a ( foldr f b as )
Now we expand this once for an infinite input list , we get
partition p ( a : as ) = ( \ ~ ( y , z ) -> if p a then ( a : y , z ) else ( y , a : z ) ) ( foldr ... ( [ ] , [ ] ) as )
We see that the whether a is prepended to the first or the second list , does only depend on p a , and neither on y nor on z .
The laziness annotation ~ is crucial , since it tells , intuitively spoken , that we can rely on the recursive call of foldr to return a pair and not undefined .
Omitting it , would require the evaluation of the whole input list before the first output element can be determined .
This fails for infinite lists and is inefficient for finite lists , and that was the bug in former implementations of partition .
Btw. by the expansion you also see , that it would not help to omit the tilde and apply the above ' force ' trick to the ' if - then - else ' expression .
However , there still remains a small laziness break :
There is an unnecessary decision between the pair constructor of the initial accumulator value ( [ ] , [ ] ) and the pair constructors within the if .
This can only be avoided by applying a force function to the result of foldr :
partition :: ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] -> ( [ a ] , [ a ] ) partition p = ( \ ~ ( ys , zs ) -> ( ys , zs ) ) . foldr ( \ x ~ ( y , z ) -> if p x then ( x : y , z ) else ( y , x : z ) ) ( [ ] , [ ] )
List reversal
Any use of the list function reverse should alert you , since when you access the first element of a reversed list , then all nodes of the input list must be evaluated and stored in memory .
Think twice whether it is really needed .
The articles on Infinity and efficiency and List traversal show how to avoid list reversal .
Input and Output
In general functions , output of lazily generated data is no problem , whereas lazily reading data requires a sort of a hack and thus caution .
Consider the nice program
readFile " source " >>= write
File " target "
which copies the file source to the file target with constant memory consumption , since readFile reads the data lazily and write
File writes it as it comes in .
However it fails badly , when a file shall be updated in - place :
readFile " text " >>= writeFile " text " . map toUpper
This would work only when readFile would be strict , that is it would read the file contents to memory before returning .
The function readFile needs certain hacks :
The function unsafeInterleaveIO is needed for deferring the calls to hGetChar until the characters are actually needed .
is needed for deferring the calls to until the characters are actually needed .
Exceptions , that occur while reading the file , are raised in the code that writes the result of processing the file content to somewhere .
I.e. the exceptions produced by readFile can occur in code that has nothing to do with file reading and there is no warning , that they might occur there .
Again , I want to advertise the explicit exception package , which helps making the reason for the stop of the file read explicit .
Exceptions must still be handled in code , that does not read the file , but the fact that they are explicit helps you to not forget it .

Again , I want to advertise the explicit exception package , which helps making the reason for the stop of the file read explicit .
Exceptions must still be handled in code , that does not read the file , but the fact that they are explicit helps you to not forget it .
The file must be closed after it is no longer needed .
The documentation says , that the file is put into a semi-closed state .
Maybe this means , it uses Weak Reference which lets the garbage collector close the file , once no reference to data of the file exists anymore .
However , the garbage collector never works immediately , but in phases .
It may be that the file remains open for a long time , maybe until the program exits .
The Data .
ByteString .
Lazy .
readFile function explicitly closes the file after the last byte is read .
The advantage is , that the file is closed immediately .
The disadvantage is , that the file is not closed at all , when not all bytes are read .
E.g. if a parser encounters a parse error , it has to read the rest of the file anyway , in order to get it closed .
A function that handles the closing of the file for you is System .
IO. withFile .
You can use it like
withFile " source " ReadMode $ \ h -> hGetLine h >>= putStrLn
After the actions inside the withFile call , the file is closed .
However this is dangerous :
If you leak lazily read contents from the file out of withFile , the file is closed before the data is actually read .
Thus , although withFile " source " ReadMode hGetContents looks like readFile , it is very different : I does not work .
How can you implement a function like hGetContents by yourselves ?
You need to call hGetChar in a lazy way .
This is achieved by unsafeInterleaveIO .
However , calling unsafeInterleaveIO hGetChar many times would not work , because the order must be preserved .
hGetContents h >>= putStrLn . drop 10
E.g. in , the first ten characters from the file are not needed ,
but hGetChar must be called for the first 10 characters anyway in order to increment the file position .
This is achieved by not calling unsafeInterleaveIO on hGetChar but on the list constructor .
The implementation of hGetContents looks roughly like
hGetContents h = let go = unsafeInterleaveIO $ lift M2 ( : ) ( hGetChar h ) go in go
.
In contrast to the standard hGetContents , this implementation does not close the file ( by the way , it does even not handle the end of the file ) , but the advantage of not relying on some automatism to close the file somewhen is , that you can close the file immediately after you stopped processing its content .
The disadvantage is that you must not forget to close the file and must do it only once .
So far we have only considered lazy read .
It might also be necessary to trigger write actions when fetching data .
Consider a server - client interaction , where data can only be read , when a request was sent before .
It would be nice if the request is triggered by reading the result from the server .
Such interactions can be programmed using the lazyio package .
Alternatives
From the above issues , you see that laziness is a fragile thing .
Make one mistake and a function , carefully developed with laziness in mind , is no longer lazy .
The type system will rarely help you hunting laziness breakers , and there is little support by debuggers .
Thus , detecting laziness breakers often requires understanding a large portion of code , which is against the idea of modularity .
Maybe for your case you will prefer a different idiom , that achieves the same goals in a safer way .
See e.g. the Enumerator and iteratee pattern .
Britney Spears and Kids at the Pumpkin Patch ( Photos )
recent ' driving without a license ' trial is over and she is very likely breathing a sigh of relief after the judge called a mistrial .
The jury was deadlocked at 10 - 2 in favor of a not guilty verdict and she is now able to put that chapter behind her .
Getting in the Halloween spirit , Britney took Jayden James and Sean Preston to the pumpkin patch in L.A. .
Her security detail can be seen with umbrellas trying to afford the family some privacy .
Good luck with that Brit .

Niksa Klecak , the 22 - year - old Croatian who created an anti-PM Facebook Group “ I bet I will find 5,000 people who do not like the Prime minister ” [ Ivo Sanader ] , has been arrested for allegedly promoting neo -Nazi materials .
The police claimed that they found some Nazi symbols and propaganda at his home .
Niksa Klecak has been then released by the police due to lack of evidence .
But later , according to the Telegraph.co.uk , a senior police official has rejected criticism of the detention , arguing that the “ Police acted legally [ … ] because Mr Klecak 's group displayed a photo montage of Mr Sanader in a Nazi uniform .
Nazi symbols are banned under Croatian law , ” he said .
So far , 14.186 members have joined the group , instead of the 5 thousand that Niksa Klecak wanted to gather .
Croatian political analysts described the detention as a “ politically motivated case ” and a “ notorious abuse of police for political purposes , ” since Niksa Klecak is the president of one of the Social Democrats ’ youth branches .
According to the Telegraph , opposition against Mr Sanader had been growing online :
The number of anti-government Facebook sites has grown rapidly over the weekend .
One , which calls for a protest against Mr Sanader later this month , has gathered 80,000 members and Mr Klecak 's group has grown to 6,200 members since Friday .
A photo of Mr Sanader posted on Facebook Group “ I bet I will find 5,000 people who do not like the Prime minister ”

SPRINGFIELD - Police Commissioner William J. Fitchet said Monday he would support a City Council ordinance to make smoking marijuana in public an arrestable offense with a $ 300 fine .
The ordinance would be a response - with the approval of the state attorney general - to a state law that took effect Jan. 2 that has decriminalized possession of an ounce or less of marijuana .
" I would be agreeable to that , if the City Council saw fit to pass such an ordinance ...
I think smoking marijuana publicly , especially in the vicinity of schools , is a bad message to send , " Fitchet said , at a council committee meeting at City Hall .
Under the new law , the drug is still illegal , but possessing a small amount brings only a fine of $ 100 without an arrest .
The $ 300 fine under the proposed ordinance would be in addition to that fine .
The new law took effect after voters overwhelmingly approved ballot Question 2 in November .
The proposed local restriction would be aimed at discouraging pot smokers from viewing the new state law as a green light to smoke outside schools or on sidewalks , parks , bridges and other public areas , officials said .
The city could use a model ordinance that the attorney general 's office has provided for cities and towns regarding the new marijuana law , Assistant City Solicitor Michael E. Mulcahy said .
Chairman James J. Ferrera III called the meeting of the Veterans , Administration and Human Services Committee because law enforcement officials and others have said the new law is confusing and ill - conceived .
" It 's not to circumvent the will of the voters .
They have spoken .
We 're just going to try to address qualify - of - life issues in the city , " Ferrera said .
He will propose the marijuana ordinance at the next council meeting on Feb. 2 he said .
A spokesman with a Washington , D.C. , group that pushed for Question 2 said he agrees the new law allows for tougher penalties for smoking marijuana in public , but he said too little time has passed to judge whether the new law is effective as is .
" They 're not circumventing Question 2 , but what I would say is they should let the law work and see what takes place with marijuana use , " said Daniel J. Bernath , spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project .
Under the new state law , people under age 18 caught with an ounce or less of marijuana also are required to attend drug - awareness classes .
Now that Gov. Sarah Palin ’s daughter has celebrated her 18th birthday , the GOP vice - presidential candidate says she ’s hoping Bristol and fiancé Levi Johnston – who are expecting a baby in December – will tie the knot well before the date next summer the young couple had been eyeing .
“ Hopefully before that , ” Sarah Palin tells PEOPLE in an Oct. 15 interview for the issue on newsstands this Friday .
“ Bristol turns 18 in a few days [ Oct. 18 ] .
That ’s what we wanted her to wait for : 18 , and a decision on her own about how she ’s going to go forward , her and Levi , at this point . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Taking a break between campaign speeches in New Hampshire , Palin and her husband , Todd , both 44 , spoke about Bristol , Tina Fey and sex ed .
They also responded to PEOPLE readers ’ questions about politics , life with five kids – ages 6 months to 19 years – and what ’s next for the Alaska governor , win or lose :
Do you two ever look at each other and just go , This is insane ?
Sarah Palin : I have n’t had time to yet .
( She clicks her tongue twice and pats Todd on the knee . )
With the kids traveling , how do they keep up with school ?
SP : They ’ve been going back and forth and bringing schoolwork with them .
Yeah .
It ’s workin’ .
With our help and Grandma ’s and Grandpa ’s help .
Your crowds are adoring but the criticism is sometimes tough .
Todd , Elizabeth in Nashville asks ,
Is it hard not to stick up for Sarah ?
TODD PALIN : When you get into this business , it ’s expected .
I do [ feel protective ] but it ’s just entertainment .
SP : They take their shots ; that ’s some people ’s entertainment .
We ’ve seen her as the Supermom and Power Chick , if you ’ll pardon the expression .
You ’ve seen her softer side .
TP : When she ’s working for me out there in my fishing boat , she ’s pretty vulnerable .
It ’s my element .
SP : He ’s the boss out there on the boat while we commercial fish .
Yeah .
That ’s a different story then .
You ’re not one of those I - broke - a- fingernail outdoorswomen ?
SP : No time for that , no .
You have to be tough out there .
You do n’t come back on the boat if you ’re going to whine and complain about being cold or tired .
You do what you have to do to get the job done .
Tina
Fey ’s got you locked up .
Who would play Todd ?
SP : Tim McGraw .
That ’s what they say back home , anyway .
Some of the kids tell our kids , “ Your dad , when he wears his hat , he looks like Tim McGraw . ”
It ’s good .
What types of things do you argue or bicker about back home ?
SP : We do n’t have a whole lot of time to argue and bicker .
It ’s a team effort how we get from point A to point B every day with everything that needs to get done .
TP : The normal challenges , it ’s the kids ’ schedules , where they go and who ’s coming over .
And that ’s mostly fallen to you now –
TP : Well we ’ve always shared that responsibility , especially with my [ oil - drilling ] slope job .
So , when I ’m gone with work , she ’s got both hats on .
When I come home , I try to carry both hats , as long as I do n’t disrupt their schedule .
In normal times , who does what around the house ?
SP : Todd grew up helping to raise a lot of sisters and it was expected that he would be a helpmate to his parents and siblings .
It ’s just par for the course now that he does as much as I do around the house .
In fact you probably do more [ laughs ] , with my busy schedule .
Todd has an unconventional work schedule : gone summers commercial fishing and then week - on , week - off in his [ oil ] job .
When he is home , he takes over .
TP : I have to .
If I do n’t then there ’s no Iron Dog [ snowmobile racing ] , there ’s not all the good stuff .
Mm-hmm .
The payoffs .
SP : No .
It ’s truly a partnership where we share the workload because
We ’ve never really looked at it as a workload .
It ’s a pleasure to be home , it ’s a pleasure to be working with the kids .
We enjoy cooking , we enjoy cleaning up together .
It ’s just what we do .
Who ’s the better cook ?
SP : It depends on what we ’re cooking .
I ’m a better –
TP : She ’s a good cook .
SP : I ’m a better cooker .
You ’re a better , like he can smoke salmon better than anybody else that I know .
And can salmon .
We eat a lot of wild Alaska seafood and we ’re trying different recipes all the time with that .
You do a couple of those dishes better than I do .
TP : Barbecue , yeah .
SP : Barbecued salmon .
Tina
Fey plays you sort of bubble - headed .
You obviously –
SP : That ’s funny , I play her bubble - headed , too , when I imitate her .
– but you do n’t get to be governor without being smart , so how would you describe your smarts ?
SP : How would I describe my smarts ?
Do you think you ’re intellectual ?
SP : Yessss .
And you have to be up on not only current events , but you have to understand the foundation of the issues that you ’re working on as a governor .
I had to do the same thing as a mayor .
So it is not just current events but it ’s much more in - depth than that to understand how , in the case of me being governor , how did our state get to the position that we are in order for a decision to have to be made .
You ca n’t just go on what is presented you .
You have to know the background , you have to know the players involved before you make a policy call .
So , um , it ’s uh , it ’s a good job , it ’s a tough job and it ’s a very , very serious job .
And no .
You do n’t get to be a governor by being –
TP : – going with the wind .
SP : Yeah definitely .
You do n’t just go with the flow and take a political pulse on policy .
You have to go with what the foundational knowledge is that you have on issues in front of you and you have to put the people you are serving , put them first .
You put them before partisanship you put them before special interests .
That ’s how you make decisions as governor .
How do you get that knowledge ?
SP : I ’m a voracious reader , always have been .
I appreciate a lot of information .
I think that comes from growing up in a family of schoolteachers also where reading and seizing educational opportunities was top on my parents ’ agenda .
That was instilled in me .
What do you like to read ?
SP : Autobiographies , historical pieces – really anything and everything .
Besides the kids and sports , reading is my favorite thing to do .
What are you reading now ?
SP : I ’m reading , heh - heh , a lot of briefing papers on a lot of issues that are in front of us in this campaign .
What about for fun ?
SP : Do we consider The Looming Tower something that was just for fun ?
That ’s what I ’ve been reading on the airplane .
It ’s about 9/11 .
If I ’m going to read something , for the most part , it ’s something beneficial .
Some national issues are different than what you ’ve focused on in Alaska .
Now that you ’ve been at this national campaign for a while , are there areas you ’ve discovered you ’d like to study up on more ?
SP : The overall mission here in a national campaign is the same mission that I was on in a state campaign and in my job serving the state and before that , in a local city campaign and in my job serving a community and that is making sure that the people who hire you are going to be put first in all the decisions that you make .
Overall , it ’s the same mission that I ’m on and in this case also it ’s supporting I think the perfect running mate , someone who is ready to lead our country through the economic crisis that we ’re in right now , lead us into victory in these wars that we ’re fighting .
So same mission , that being serving the people who will hire us .
What have you heard from your son overseas ?
[ Track , 19 , is deployed with the Army in Iraq . ]
SP : He ’s doing well .
Not a complaint .
I visited the troops over there , and I was so pleased and appreciative of our troops , my son included , where you do n’t hear them complain .
You do n’t hear them complain about the heat or the dozens of pounds of equipment that they ’re carrying , none of the conditions that we would consider adverse and burdensome .
I ’ve never heard any of our soldiers complain and my son has been the same way in discussions with him .
Jessica of Yucca Valley , Calif. , wants to know ,
When someone screamed , ‘ Kill him , ’ at your rally , why did n’t you say anything ?
SP : I have n’t heard anybody scream ‘ Kill him ’ at a rally .
Have you read that people in your crowds yelled hateful things about Barack Obama ?
SP : With 23,000 people at a rally it would be difficult to pick out one comment .
If I heard somebody say something like ‘ Kill him , ’ I would certainly not condone that and I would say something .
Your future son - in - law –
SP : What I have heard though are comments like Barack Obama has made outright asking his supporters to go out there and argue with us and ‘ get in their face . ’
I ’ve heard things like that directly from , of course , Barack Obama via the news waves .
But I have n’t heard such a mean - spirited and ugly comment as you mentioned at one of our rallies .
Your future son-in - law told the Associated Press that Obama seems like a nice guy .
Tammy of Nashville asks ,
Do you like Obama as a person ?
SP : I ’ve never met him .
Is there anything you like ?
SP : Oh , I admire that he has dedicated three years to serving Americans in the Senate .
And anyone who is willing to put so much on the line in terms of giving up privacy and , at least in our case , almost being in a position of having to allow your family to take unfair shots – because they ’re committed to a mission , as Barack Obama obviously is , I can respect that .
Yeah .
Alicia in New York City asks ,
Do you think about having more children ?
SP : No - o - o -o .
We got our starting five .
That ’s the final five .
Alicia also wondered if you had any more unique names up your sleeve .
SP : We did .
We never got to get our Zamboni in .
I always wanted a son named Zamboni .
TP : I do n’t think that would have flied .
Shelli of Charlotte , N.C. , was curious about your favorite family vacations ?
TP : To the cabin . Safari Lake .
New Year ’s Eve .
SP : Up to the cabin , yeah .
That ’s when all the family gets together and lots of our neighbors from Wasilla , we all pack up the trailers the snow machine trailers and head on up about 70 miles north so we can ring in the new year out in the snow , in the great outdoors , and under the Northern Lights .
It ’s been an absolute beautiful night each night we ’ve been out there .
Have you traveled with the kids anywhere in the lower 48 ?
SP : Yes .
Many , many , many times .
Yes .
Yes .
We go to Hawaii often .
That ’s a good trip for Alaskans because it ’s a direct flight down there .
We ’ve been to California quite a few times .
Washington State quite a few times to see relatives .
TP : We enjoy our road trips –
SP : We LOVE road trips .
TP : – driving from Alaska to the lower 48 .
SP : Our son a few years ago was playing hockey in Minnesota , and we missed him so much that we jumped in one of our four - door trucks and drove from Alaska to Minnesota so that we could see him for a few hours .
It also gave us a good excuse to travel that part of the country with the girls also .
How long a drive is that ?
A week ?
SP : Not the way Todd drives .
And Todd never sleeps !
Will everyone move to Washington if you win ?
SP : Well , Bristol will be starting her own family and Track will be [ with the Army ] still fighting the war , but the little kids and Todd and I will .
You ’re not the first parents to cope with a teenage pregnancy .
How did you get that news and what was your reaction ?
SP : Just a very quick acknowledgement that Bristol and her fiancé will have to grow up a lot quicker .
But she is quite mature , very kind - hearted and a very strong young woman .
She ’s also kind of an old soul who ’s beyond any desire to be out there partying .
It will all be good .
We look forward to another life coming into our family .
Do you worry about her finishing high school or going to college ?
SP : No .
She ’s a very smart girl .
She ’s got great grades .
She ’s always been a very good athlete , very plugged into school .
These are less than ideal circumstances , but she is making the most of this and she will be a very , very good and loving mother .
And Levi will be a very good father .
And it ’s going to be good .
And certainly , of course , as you point out , we ’re not the first .
Has this changed how you talk about sex with your other children ?
SP : I ’ve always been a proponent of making sure kids understand – even in schools – they ’d better take preventative measures so that they do n’t find themselves in these less than ideal circumstances .
Perhaps Bristol could be a good example to other young women that life happens and preventative measures are , first and foremost , the option that should be considered –
Do you mean abstinence or contraception ?
SP : Well , both .
Ideally abstinence .
But we have not been ones to say that students , should not know what preventive measures are all about .
I ’ve been taken aback by some criticism that mainstream media has thrown my way saying , Oh , what a hypocrite she is and she ’s now learned her lesson because she ’s been against sex education in the schools .
And I ’m like , when ?
Where ?
When have I ever said that there should be no sex education taught in our homes or even in our schools ?
STAFF : One more question .
Carlie from Winston Salem , N.C. , asks , If Sen. McCain does n’t win , will you run for President in 2012 ?
I will be old enough to vote then and you have my vote .
SP : Awww .
That is so nice to hear .
But our focus is between now and November 4 .
But have you been bitten by the bug ?
Can you go home again and just be an Alaskan ?
SP : I can always go home again and just be Mom and be perfectly happy and fulfilled with the blessings that God has given us .
And with a great marriage and great parents and siblings and children , I could today go home and just be Mom .
Wedding next summer , is that right ?
SP : Um . Hopefully before that .
But Bristol turns 18 in a few days .
That ’s what we wanted her to wait for : 18 and a decision on her own about how she ’s going to go forward , her and Levi , at this point .
Are you disappointed that he ’s dropped out of school ?
SP : He ’s working right now full - time , but there have been a lot of very successful , hard - working American families led by men and women who have received their GED and have figured out through home - schooling and alternative schooling how to get that high school diploma and Levi will be on that road to get his education , also .
But in addition to that , they ’re not going to be looking for anybody to hand them anything .
They ’re going to be working for provisions for their new family and I respect that Levi is out there working hard .
He ’s got a good job right now , working hard , ready to take care of his new child .
I respect that .
STAFF : We ’ve got to get going .
As a new Grandma , it ’s going to be hard if you ’re in Washington and the new baby is going to be so far away –
SP : We ’ve always had very flexible schedules –
TP : Very flexible schedules –
SP : – and probably quite unconventional , but it ’s always worked and our family and our faith and those things that we so believe in comes first and we ’ve always made this all work .
TP : And Uncle Trig [ Sarah ’s and Todd ’s 6 - month - old son ] needs a little buddy to play with .
SP : ( sing - songy )
That ’s right !
Trig does .
We ’ve gotten so many questions from people who saw Trig at the convention and the debate and worry about his bedtime .
SP : If you notice in those evening debates he ’s usually sound asleep in all of our arms and he manages to sleep and eat like any other baby needs to , on their own schedule .
TP : He ’s a good Alaskan kid .
SP : He is an Alaskan kid .
He ’s already tough and you can already tell he enjoys being outdoors also .
Man , that ’s when he wakes up ; he just enjoys it .
He ’s perfect .
And he ’s got more frequent - flier miles now than–
SP : And he ’s got more arms to hold him and feed him than any child could ever hope for .
He ’s got a lot of love .
STAFF : We ’ve got to go .
Do you miss him , though , as his Mom ?
SP : Well , he ’s just a couple of floors above me right now , so thankfully he ’s there with me .
When you guys are n’t looking at me , Trig is with me .
Thankfully , it all works .
Have you prepared Bristol for the sleeplessness ?
SP : She has helped with Trig for these months and she helped with [ 7 - year - old sister ]
Piper all those years .
She ’s also been a very good babysitter for nieces and nephews and cousins .
She knows what it ’s all about .
Yeah .
Do you have a favorite childhood book you ’ll be passing on to your new grandbaby ?
SP : Awww .
Gosh .
That ’s a good question .
Piper and I read lots and lots of nursery rhymes , of course , and we still do .
There ’s a couple of really good Alaskan child books , also , about the Iditarod , the sled - dog race so , in fact a couple of those – and I ’m reading one of them to Piper right now – we ’ll be passing those on .
Your child is less likely to graduate from high school than you were , and most states are doing little to hold schools accountable , according to a study by a children ’s advocacy group .
More than half the states have graduation targets that do n’t make schools get better , the Education Trust says in a report released Thursday in Washington .
One in 4 kids is dropping out of school , a rate that has n’t budged for at least five years .
Among minorities , more than 1 in 3 drop out .
“ The U.S. is stagnating while other industrialized countries are surpassing us , ” said Anna Habash , author of the report by Education Trust , which advocates on behalf of minority and poor children .
“ And that is going to have a dramatic impact on our ability to compete . ”

The U.S. is the only industrialized country where youths are less likely than their parents to earn a diploma , the report says , citing data compiled by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
High schools are required to meet graduation targets every year as part of the 2002 federal No Child Left Behind Act .
But those targets are set by states , and most states allow schools to graduate low percentages of students by saying that any progress , or even the status quo , is acceptable .
The U.S. was slow to realize the crisis .
For years , researchers reported dropouts as those who quit in 12th grade , failing to count those who left earlier .
Department of Agriculture raids have been occurring in Pennsylvania against horse and buggy Mennonite dairy farmers regularly and for some time .
It 's getting almost no attention though the farming communities there have been terrorized by the government for doing what they have done for centuries .
They came here to live in peace and freedom .
Meanwhile , farmers and ranchers have been desperate to stop the National Animal Identification System ( NAIS ) which the USDA said would be voluntary but the Bush administration in a last minute gift to our disappearing farmers , just made it mandatory by ordering vets to sign people on who bring animals for vaccinations even if they refuse to do so themselves .
Those who refuse are given a special number indicating they did n't " volunteer . "
And along with NAIS come " premises " ID which looks to be a way of tricking farmers and ranchers into signing away their land as collateral for the bailout .

It has been almost impossible to let the urban community understand the truly totalitarian threats occurring RIGHT NOW against our farmers .
Now this ... and perhaps THIS will finally hit home for those who care about their community supported agriculture ( CSA ) and want real organic food , not industrial food with an " organic " label applied by corporate agriculture which first got the USDA to eliminate its competition - real farmers producing real food .
" ... SWAT police , armed for riot control weapons , packing automatic rifles and armored for a terrorist response stormed a family food cooperative in Ohio .
Agents from the State of Ohio Department of Agriculture with the S.W.A.T. team did not give any explanation to the family other than a warrant , did not provide them a phone call , did not charge the family with anything as they burst into their private home .

Those warm hands will be spending a lot of time tapping keyboards .
Already , Webcams and wireless computer technology mean that a single critical - care doctor in a command center can make rounds on dozens of intensive - care patients in hospitals miles away .
On the horizon is a worldwide network of health care “ nodes , ” with instant information on anyone anywhere and keyboard - driven care crisscrossing the globe .
Dr. Hanson is a good writer  especially when he writes about patients rather than bionic limbs .
One short description of a young woman confronting the aftermath of Hodgkin ’s disease is particularly striking .
But elsewhere his editors appear to have had some trouble keeping up with him : the book refers to bone marrow transplants for breast cancer as if they are still performed , and asserts that fluctuations in blood sugar cause diabetes , while it is actually the other way around .
Whether descriptions of future technology contain similar errors is anyone ’s guess : there are no references to check .
But if your enthusiasm for the great beyond in health care can survive this caveat  and what is possibly a world ’s record for misspellings of “ principal ” in a single document  then this is the book for you .
If , on the other hand , the whole idea just makes you shudder , you should turn to “ The Big Necessity , ” a story of the past , present and future of the simplest , cheapest , most all - round magnificent health care innovation of our time .
That would be the toilet , which many experts credit with a greater impact on disease eradication in developed countries over the last two centuries than any other device or drug on record .
In a narrative that spans the primitive privies of China and India and space - age toilet factories of Japan , the British journalist Rose George tells a story every bit as complicated and mind - blowingly high - tech as Dr. Hanson’s .
In the West , the great 19th - century sewage systems are beginning to show their age , even as competing methods of water and sludge purification vie for primacy in cost and ecological friendliness .
Meanwhile , 2.6 billion people in developing countries get along without toilets , and it takes the most delicate psychology to persuade them that they need them .
They do , believe me , for without toilets any disease that they have risks becoming yours .
Never forget that the first great 21st - century pandemic , SARS , can be traced directly to faulty plumbing in a seventh - floor bathroom in Hong Kong .
In the name of research , Ms. George waded through sewers and checked out latrines all over the globe .
On paper , she glides with rueful and articulate poise through the biology , ecology , physiology , psychology and basic hydraulics of her subject , always articulate and persuasive .
Even if you are inclined to think health - care dollars should be put into titanium rather than porcelain , you will be hard pressed to put this extraordinary book down .
The other day the guys from BaconToday.com contacted me in search for some barbecue bacon recipes .
Of course I have plenty of great uses for bacon in a barbecue pit , but the longer I thought about it , the more I wanted to step it up a notch and clog a few arteries for those guys .
Behold , BACON EXPLOSION !!!
Here ’s what you ’ll need …
Bacon Explosion Ingredients
2 pounds thick cut bacon
2 pounds Italian sausage
1 bottle of Burnt Finger BBQ sauce
1 shaker of Burnt Finger BBQ rub
To kick off the construction of this pork medley you ’ll need to create a 5 ×5 bacon weave .
If the strips you ’re using are n’t as wide as the ones pictured , then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern .
Just make sure your bacon weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with .
The next step is to add some seasoning on top of your bacon weave .
I used our Burnt Finger BBQ Smokey Kansas City seasoning ( the label artwork has changed since this photo was taken ) , but many rubs will work .
Here are some of my favorites that are available on Amazon .
The key here is to use a seasoning that is more sweet than salty .
The bacon is already bringing a good amount of salt to party , so you want to avoid getting your Bacon Explosion over salted .
Now that you ’re pork is well seasoned , it ’s time to add more pork .
Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave .
Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across .
Most grocery stores carry loose sausage , so just pick out one you like .
I chose to go with a mild sausage , but spicy would work just the same .
If you really want to get crazy , take a stab at making your own homemade sausage .
Next up is bacon layer number two .
Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast ( or lunch , or dinner , or a midnight snack ) .
If you like soft bacon , make it soft .
If you like crunchy bacon , make it crunchy .
If you like your bacon burnt to hell so the smoke detectors go off , then burn it to hell so the smoke detectors go off .
These pieces are going to be a major part of the inner flavor of our sausage fatty , so cook them your favorite way .
Personally , I like my bacon right at the point when it starts to get crispy , but has n’t quite lost all of the softness yet .
Regardless of how well done you like yours , you ’ll need to crumble or chop the cooked strips into bite size pieces and place on top of the sausage layer .
( Note - It ’s okay , and encouraged , to snack on these pieces while your chopping / crumbling .
But keep in mind that once those bacon morsels touch the raw sausage , you ’ll need to resist all temptations to nibble .
This can and will be difficult , but hospital trips are no fun , so stay strong . )
Since this is a BBQ recipe , we need to add another layer of BBQ flavor .
Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces .
I use our Burnt Finger BBQ Smokey Kansas City sauce , but any BBQ sauce that you like will work .
Here are some of my favorites that are available on Amazon .
Once you ’ve sauced the bacon , sprinkle on some more of the Smokey Kansas City Barbecue Seasoning you used on the bacon weave .
Now comes the fun part .
Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards .
You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll .
Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed .
Once the sausage is fully rolled up , pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside .
At this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion , but we ’re missing one key item .
To complete the construction process , roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave .
Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up .
Sprinkle some more Smokey Kansas City Barbecue Seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave , and now this bad boy is ready for the smoker .
Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225 degrees in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees .
Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness , but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek .
Mine took about 2.5 hours , which was right on target with its 2.5 inch diameter .
Now that our Bacon Explosion is fully cooked , we need to add some finishing flavors .
Remember that Burnt Finger BBQ sauce we used for inner flavor ?
We ’ll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave .
Using a basting brush , coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce .
Slice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve .
If your roll was good and tight , you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage .
Obviously pork is best served by itself , but if you feel the need to make this meat monster into a sandwich , try placing a couple Bacon Explosion slices on a warm Pillsbury ’s Grands Biscuit .
You ’ll reach pork Nirvana in no time flat !
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A temporary plant shutdown gives an automaker the chance to stop making cars and sell off the ones that are still sitting around .
But in Chrysler 's case , the benefit comes from the money it saves on day - to - day costs .
First off , Chrysler 's inventory glut wo n't continue getting worse during the month its factories are idle , even if it does n't get much better .
At the beginning of December , Chrysler had 399,700 vehicles , or a nearly four - month supply of cars , trucks and SUVs , according to data from Automotive News .
About a two - month supply is considered normal in the industry .
" If they can get that down below a 90 - day supply , I think that would be an intermediate goal , " said Jesse Toprak , an analyst with the automotive Web site Edmunds.com .
He was speaking about both Chrysler and General Motors , which has also announced drastic production cutbacks in the face of bloated inventory .
Bush announces auto rescue
Chrysler 's sales last month dropped 47.1 % from the year before , the worst slowdown of any carmaker in November .
Industry analysts do n't forecast a much better performance this month .
Based on a comparison to last year 's sales rates , Chrysler may only sell about 70,000 vehicles between Dec. 19 and Jan. 19 when its factories wo n't be running .
( The period includes a regularly scheduled two - week shutdown for the holidays . )
Meanwhile , Chrysler will have produced about that many vehicles in the first part of December before the Friday evening shutdown , based on Automotive News production data .
So , by Jan. 19 , Chrysler 's inventory levels will be back where they started at the beginning of this month .
But the automaker will have saved substantial money by not powering all those factories , not paying 46,000 workers their full hourly wages and not buying parts to build vehicles that will sit in storage .
The cost savings
" I think the inventory is a secondary consideration in this , " said Tom Libby , an analyst with J.D. Power and Associates .
Although Chrysler 's move may be the most dramatic , he added , it is something all automakers are doing to some extent .
" They 're all really looking at turning down the production levels to some extent , " said Mike Wall , an analyst with CSM Automotive .
During the additional two weeks of shutdown , assembly line workers will be paid through a combination of state unemployment benefits and Chrysler contributions , but they will not receive the full amount of their working pay , a Chrysler spokesman said .
Chrysler would save more money by not paying suppliers for the parts and materials to build the cars .
In its " Plan for Short - Term and Long - Term Viability " filed with the federal government as part of a plea for financial assistance , Chrysler estimated it would pay $ 8 billion to auto parts suppliers in one quarter .
Based on that , the extra two weeks of closure , if Chrysler paid nothing at all to suppliers during that time , could save the carmaker about $ 1.3 billion .
But stopping production does n't mean the facilities are entirely shut down and cost - free , said Michelle Hill , a vice president with consultants Oliver Wyman .
" You still have the finance department and the indirect purchasing department , " she said .
Indirect purchasing deals with supplies the company needs other than auto parts .
But Chrysler will save money on outside service contractors that supply functions like janitorial services and security , she said .
" In the winter , especially , maintenance costs can be pretty high , " said Chrysler spokesman David Elshoff .
" plowing big , big parking lots and stuff like that . "
Beyond the closed gates
" When you have a plant shutdown , it will ripple across all the parts manufacturers , " Hill said .
But even for suppliers , a temporary closing is better than an outright collapse of the business , said Mike Wall , an analyst with CSM Automotive .
Carmakers ordinarily give warnings to their suppliers .
Still , " it does n't make it any easier , " he said .
" They have to right - size their own production levels . "
That means laying off their own employees as they 're no longer needed to make parts for the closed plants .
Connecting the closures to an already scheduled closing makes things somewhat easier on everyone , said Chrysler 's Elshoff .
" It 's easier on the entire chain , " he said .
" They do n't have to ramp up and shut down and ramp up and shut down . "
After the new year
Chrysler said Wednesday that all 30 of its plants will close after the last shift on Friday , and employees will not be asked to return to work before Jan. 19 .
But some plants will stay closed beyond that time , Elshoff said .
Two Jeep plants in Ohio , will stay closed until Jan. 26 , and a minivan plant in Canada wo n't reopen until Feb .
2 .
Some plants that are n't currently scheduled to be closed past Jan. 19 could still stay shut longer if their products are n't needed , said Elshoff .
" We always reserve the right to adjust our production , " he said .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich on Tuesday defied fellow Democrats and appointed a successor to fill Barack Obama ’s vacant U.S. Senate seat -- the seat the governor is charged with trying to sell to the highest bidder .
Ignoring warnings from within his own party not to make an appointment , Blagojevich named to the seat former Illinois attorney general and frequent candidate Roland Burris , 71 , a fellow Democrat and African - American who lobbied for the post .
The seat vacated by President - elect Obama , a Democrat who was the lone African - American in the chamber , has been in limbo since Blagojevich was arrested by FBI agents on December 9 on charges he attempted to solicit campaign contributions and other political favors .
Blagojevich said he was compelled to act because the Illinois legislature put off consideration of a special election to fill the seat .
The governor is fighting impeachment proceedings under way in the state legislature .
“ Please do n’t allow the allegations against me to taint this good and honest man , ” Blagojevich told a news conference .
The governor has denied doing anything wrong and dismissed calls , including from Obama , to resign and give up his sole power to make the Senate appointment , which lasts until 2010 .
U.S. Senate Democratic leaders vowed on Tuesday to block the appointment , saying Burris would “ serve under a shadow and be plagued by questions of impropriety . ”
“ It will ultimately not stand , ” they said in a statement .
Burris , a lawyer , was the first African - American elected to statewide office in Illinois in 1978 when he became state comptroller , and was state attorney general from 1991 to 1995 .
He has run unsuccessfully several times for higher office , including a U.S. Senate bid in 1984 and governor in 1994 .
Burris and his consulting firm have donated about $ 15,000 to Blagojevich ’s campaigns since 2002 .
“ Roland Burris is emblematic of the old - school , pay - to - play culture that has plagued Illinois for generations and this appointment is another embarrassment for the people of Illinois , ” state Republican Party Chairman Andy McKenna said .
“ It ’s a very shrewd political move on the governor ’s part , ” political analyst Don Rose said .
“ The Senate has said it wo n’t accept anybody that he proposes , but here they ’ve come up with an African - American with deep roots in the black community . ”
The Democrats will be in control of the U.S. Senate with at least 57 seats in the 100 - seat chamber when Congress reconvenes on January 6 .
Still in limbo are Minnesota ’s undecided Senate race , as well as Obama ’s Senate seat in Illinois .
The U.S. Constitution states that the Senate decides the qualifications of its members .
But if the Senate blocked the appointment , the case would likely end up in court .
The residue of millions of tons of coal burning at Kingston Fossil power plant in the Watts Bar Reservoir in Tennessee burst the bounds of the pond in which it was contained , burying as many as 400 acres of land in up to six feet of sludge .
The Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) , which owns the coal - fired power plant — first operated in 1955 — announced that 15 homes were buried and no injuries were reported .
A combination of rains and accumulating sludge likely contributed to the disaster — one of two major ash pond collapses in the past decade .
All told , about 2.6 million cubic yards of so - called coal ash slurry escaped , the TVA says .
The collapsed pond is one of three on the site .
" We deeply regret that a retention wall for ash containment at our Kingston Fossil Plant failed , resulting in an ash slide , " said Tom Kilgore , TVA president and CEO in an official statement today .
Such slurry worries environmentalists and public health activists because it is the residue of coal burning .
The burning concentrates the impurities in the coal , including arsenic , lead and mercury , among many other potentially toxic contaminants .
Coal ash is also radioactive .
But dealing with the 129 million tons of coal ash produced in the U.S. every year is not easy .
Some 25 million tons of it is dumped in old coal mines , and some companies incorporate it into cement .
The rest is typically dumped in landfills or stored in large coal - ash ponds like the one that collapsed .
But many environmentalists argue for only disposing of it in lined landfills , to prevent contaminants from leaching out .
" A risk assessment released by the U.S. EPA [ Environmental Protection Agency ] revealed that coal ash poses extremely serious threats to human health and the environment when disposed in waste ponds and landfills , " says Lisa Graves Marcucci , a founding member of the Jefferson Action Group , a Pennsylvania environmental group that is among 38 environmental organizations calling for the incoming Obama administration to review coal ash disposal rules .
" Significant pollution from mine disposal has been documented in New Mexico , West Virginia , Indiana , North Dakota , as well as Pennsylvania . "
Welcome to the third installment of the dissection of Sarah Palin ’s latest interview .
When we last left Sarah Palin in the middle of her interview at her Wasilla home on Sunday , she was talking about all those “ goofy ” stories that the media could have gotten right , if only they had known how to do their jobs .
If only they had dug a little deeper to get the real story .
If only those hacks at the New York Times , and the Washington Post understood real journalism .
Alas , this is the cross that Sarah Palin must bear .
She explains .
Regarding information regarding my record that is now out there , much of it that was based on misinformation was a very very frustrating thing to have to go through when the record was never corrected .
We would try to correct the record and too many in the media chose not to make those corrections or clarifications , and then I felt too often we were a bit defenseless in so many things that were reported wrongly that could have so easily been corrected just based on facts …
One of the examples she gave is this :
Banning books … that was a rediculous thing also that could so easily have been corrected by a reporter taking an extra step and not basing a report on gossip or speculation , but just lookin’ into the record…uh , the banning books issue , easily disproved when it was reported that I tried to ban Harry Potter , and it had n’t even been written when I was the mayor .
First things first .
Sarah Palin never actually banned books , and other than some exhuberant bloggers that jumped the gun , I do n’t know of any reports that she did .
Were the rumors rampant that she did ?
Absolutely .
I fielded lots of inquiries when this story first came out , and I set the record straight every time .
And the real story should n’t make us feel much better about things , because the answer to the question “ Why did n’t Sarah Palin ban books ? ” is not that the thought of book banning offended her moral sensibilities , it was that she could n’t get away with it .
A good summary can be found in a fascinating article by Noam Scheiber , in The New Republic .
He recounts the book story after talking to Laura Chase , a Wasilla councilwoman .
As a rule , the city ’s department heads attended every city council meeting .
One evening , as the session wound down , Palin mentioned to Mary Ellen Emmons , the library director , that something had been bothering her – a book she thought was overly indulgent of homosexuality .
“ She said there was no room in our library for that kind of stuff , ” recalled Chase .
Emmons curtly disagreed , but Palin was adamant .
She suggested the librarian could at least keep such books in the reference section , where visitors would have to request them .
“ We do n’t believe in censoring books , ” Emmons finally told her , at which point Palin trailed off muttering .
[ snip ]
Within a year , Palin had blown through her personal enemies list .
She had demanded the resignation of Emmons , the librarian opposed to censorship ( who successfully fought for her job ) … .
So , you see , she did n’t ban books … she just tried to fire a librarian who would n’t censor them .
If someone is offended at the prospect of book banning , the “ real ” story certainly wo n’t make them feel any better .
On to Harry Potter .
The reference to Palin wanting to ban Harry Potter came from an anonymous email .
I got this email 3 or 4 times .
There was no source cited , just a long list of “ controversial ” books that Palin supposedly wanted banned , including not only the first five Harry Potter books ( two of which were n’t even written at the time ) , but Lady Chatterly ’s Lover , James and the Giant Peach , and everything by Judy Blume .
Not one serious news organization printed this .
So when Sarah Palin whines about bad journalism , and the media not living up to their responsibility , and when she says “ it was reported , ” the reporters she ’s talking about are simply people who forward controversial emails without knowing if they ’re true .
So what books did she want removed from shelves ?
One that we know about is the book Pastor , I ’m Gay by the Rev. Howard Bess .
I had the pleasure of meeting Rev. Bess , and heard the story from his own mouth .
It was also reported by David Talbot of Salon .
After she became mayor of Wasilla , according to Bess , Sarah Palin tried to get rid of his book from the local library .
Palin now denies that she wanted to censor library books , but Bess insists that his book was on a “ hit list ” targeted by Palin .
“ I ’m as certain of that as I am that I ’m sitting here .
This is a small town , we all know each other .
People in city government have confirmed to me what Sarah was trying to do . ”
What about the other books on Palin ’s “ hit list ” ?
We may never know , but does it really matter ?
What if she supported banning some books and not others ?
The point is , we should n’t be banning any of them .
Free speech does n’t work if it ’s only the free speech the mayor of Wasilla agrees with .
Once you seek to ban one book , you ’ve already lost the Constitutional high ground .
( More to come on this interview … )
When faced with a difficult decision , we try to come up with the best choice by carefully considering all of the options , maybe even resorting to lists and lots of sleepless nights .
So it may be surprising that recent studies have suggested that the best way to deal with complex decisions is to not think about them at all — that unconscious thought will help us make the best choices .
Although this may seem like an appealing strategy , new research in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , cautions that there are limitations in the efficacy of unconscious thought making the best decisions .
Duke University researchers John W. Payne , Adriana Samper , James R. Bettman and Mary Frances
Luce had volunteers participate in a lottery choice task , where they had to pick from four various options , each with a different , but close , payoff .
The volunteers were divided into three groups for this task : one group was instructed to think about the task for a given amount of time , another group was told to think about the task for as long as they wanted and the last group was distracted before making their selection ( thus , unconsciously thinking about the task ) .
A second experiment was similarly set up , except that there were substantial differences in the payoffs of the different options .
The researchers found that there are situations where unconscious thought will not result in the best choice being selected .
The findings showed that in some instances ( when the payoffs were similar ) , thinking about the task for as only as long as it takes to make a decision was as effective as unconscious thought , resulting in the most profitable options being chosen .
However , when there were large differences in the amount of money to be won , mulling over the decision at their own pace led the volunteers to larger payoffs than unconscious thought .
The volunteers who were told to consciously think about the decision for a specific amount of time performed poorly in both experiments .
The authors explain that those volunteers had " too much time to think " about the task and suggest that their attention shifted " to information of lesser relevance , " resulting in less profitable decisions .
These results suggest that although unconscious thought may help us make the right decision in some instances , it is often better to rely on self - paced conscious thought and really focus on the problem at hand .

The signature moments in Dick 's fiction occur when a character 's seemingly stable reality turns inside out , revealing itself to be false .
A man discovers that he's not a human being but a sophisticated robot .
A television star finds himself in an alternate world where he 's literally nobody ; there 's no record of his existence .
An ordinary guy is told that the memory and identity he's had all his life were actually implanted not long ago and that he 's really another man altogether .
A man living in a sweet 1950 's small town realizes that it is entirely artificial .
If some of those scenarios sound familiar , it 's not surprising ; filmmakers have based such movies as '' Blade Runner , '' '' Total Recall ' ' and '' Minority Report ' ' on Dick 's fiction .
But acknowledged adaptations are n't the only cinematic manifestations of Dick 's obsessions .
'' The Truman Show ' ' bears a suspicious resemblance to the novel '' Time Out of Joint , '' and some of the most arresting independent films of recent years involve characters whose realities collapse , stutter or slip from their fingers .
Perhaps the writer - director Christopher Nolan never thought of Dick while creating '' Memento , '' but his hero 's struggle to function with almost no short - term memory is quintessentially Dickian .
The muddied boundaries between fantasy and fact in '' Mulholland Drive , '' the looped fate in the underrated '' Donnie Darko , '' the easy access sought to some other , better identity in '' Being John Malkovich ' ' all constitute territory that Dick knew well .
The hugely popular movie '' The Matrix ' ' is classic Dick without actually being based on one of his works , and , really , who is Freddy Krueger of the ' ' Nightmare on Elm Street ' ' films if not a cruder manifestation of the ubiquitous and demonic Palmer Eldritch ?
Dickian devices and themes -- implanted memories , commodified identities , simulacra -- haunt contemporary literary fiction as well .
The naming of years after corporate sponsors in David Foster Wallace 's '' Infinite Jest ' ' ; the downtrodden , stigmatized souls in George Saunders 's futuristic short stories , with their degrading theme park jobs ; the dream worlds Haruki Murakami 's characters tumble into and out of -- all partake of Dick 's peculiar mixture of wrenched ontology and underdog sympathies .
Of course these writers could as easily have been inspired by the world around them as by Dick 's stories and novels ; a great speculative writer always extrapolates from the material at hand .
What 's striking is how early Dick zeroed in on those ideas .
In 1968 ( 1968 ! ) he opened the novel '' Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? ' ' with a husband and wife bickering over the proper use of their '' Penfield mood organs , '' gizmos that allow them to fine - tune their personalities .
'' My schedule for today lists a six - hour self - accusatory depression , '' the wife announces , much to her husband 's annoyance .
He suggests she set the mood organ to 888 , '' the desire to watch TV , no matter what 's on it . ''
Aldous Huxley used the idea of chemical mood control even earlier , in '' Brave New World , '' but Dick took speculative fiction 's rarefied thought experiments and integrated them into the humble fabric of everyday life .
As weird as his work can be , it 's always grounded in the lives of Willy Lomanesque working stiffs -- late on the rent , nagged by their wives and just trying to get by .
In his own life , Dick alternated between the 1950 's ideal of a nuclear family and a freer but chaotic demimonde ; that tension between midcentury suburbia and our liberationist impulses preoccupies us still .
Like Dick 's characters , we take comfort in vicarious glamour .
The bored and miserable Mars colonists in ' ' Stigmata ' ' spend all their time playing with Barbie - like dolls .
Using a drug called Can - D , they can transport themselves into the dolls and briefly become gorgeous young people who drive Jaguars , revel in seaside trysts and otherwise savor a life in which it 's '' always Saturday . ''

Rick Warren tries to paint himself as a moderate evangelical , but after watching his performance on Hannity and Colmes I can safely say that 's he 's filling the void left by Jerry Falwell .
Steve Benen :
Last night , on Fox News , Sean Hannity insisted that United States needs to " take out " Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Warren said he agreed .
Hannity asked , " Am I advocating something dark , evil or something righteous ? "
Warren responded , " Well , actually , the Bible says that evil cannot be negotiated with .
It has to just be stopped ....
In fact , that is the legitimate role of government .
The Bible says that God puts government on earth to punish evildoers .
Not good - doers .
Evildoers . "
That 's pretty sick stuff for a " man of God . "
I have no problem with religion since I grew up as a Catholic and a lot of people derive comfort from it , but watching fools like Warren on TV promote attacking another country is just too much .
And I agree with Matt Duss also :
Does Warren really consider it part of his ministry to sanctify the inch - deep theologizing - cum - warmongering of thugs like Sean Hannity ?
If so , who else does Warren think Jesus would bomb ?
.
I 'm pretty sure that Warren uses the word " repent " when he 's headlining at his mega - church so I hope he takes the time to reflect on it and practice it .
And here 's what Falwell said about George Bush on January 8 , 2004 :
FALWELL : I think , in his next four years in office , he is going to -- well , look at what 's happening to the economy now .
Look what 's happening to America , what she thinks of herself today .
It 's so great that we have George Bush sitting there and not Al Gore .
Yes , it was so great to have George Bush and conservatism destroy this great nation , Jerry .
And how can we forget this incredible warmongering tirade from another " Man of God . "
When Justice McReynolds read the dissenting opinion in the Gold Clause Cases in the Supreme Court in 1935 , he was almost beside himself with rage , departing from his written text to utter such ejaculations as “ the Constitution is gone ” and “ this is Nero at his worst . ”
If only James Clark McReynolds were here today to witness the government ’s bailout of the banks .
McReynolds fumed that the government ’s seizure of the country ’s monetary gold and its abrogation of all contractual gold clauses , in both private and public contracts , spelled dishonor .
“ This amounts , ” he declared , “ to a declaration that the Government may give with one hand and take away with the other .
Default is thus made both easy and safe ! . . .
Loss of reputation for honorable dealing will bring us unending humiliation ; the impending legal and moral chaos is appaling . ”
None of these objections dented the Roosevelt administration ’s zeal to abolish the gold standard and all of its accouterment .
These dedicated public servants were too busy saving capitalism to be deterred by plausible claims that they were actually destroying it .
These historical incidents have streamed back into my consciousness often during recent weeks , as I have witnessed the government ’s floundering , flailing actions ostensibly to break free the “ locked up ” credit markets and to induce the banks to lend as freely as they were lending in recent years , when they were inflating the greatest global financial bubble of all time .
Do n’t talk to me about heroin or cocaine .
If you really want to see an addictive drug , take a look at cheap credit .
I have heard that the drug cartel meets in Washington , D.C. , in a big white building with a dome and that the drug ’s most active pusher is known on the streets as “ the Fed . ”
Although the Fed has been pushing the drug for a long time , everybody is scared of him , and nobody dares to arrest him and shut down his business .
Apparently , the first dog is not happy about the impending changes at the White House .
Today , Barney bit a reporter outside the briefing room .
The whole incident was caught on tape by another reporter , April D. Ryan .
Reuters political reporter Jon Decker had finished an interview with MSNBC around 10:30 a.m. when he saw Barney and his handler .
After getting permission to pet the dog , Decker said Barney snapped and chomped down on his right index finger and broke the skin .
Decker said his first reaction was , " that 's not good . "
Decker said he was treated with a bandage and some antibiotics and was asked to return for a tetanus shot Friday .
He has not gotten any calls from the White House .
A somber Israel buried Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg and his wife , Rivkah , on Jerusalem ’s Mount of Olives on Tuesday , his body wrapped in a prayer shawl , hers in a shroud .
They left behind 2 - year - old son Moshe , who had been with them in Mumbai , India , and many mysteries about the circumstances of their violent deaths .
The Holtzbergs were among six Jews killed last week during a terrorist attack on the obscure outreach center the pair were running in the back streets of the metropolis in western India , part of the calculated carnage that left more than 170 people dead across the nation ’s financial capital .
Details of the attack that killed the Holtzbergs and the four others , who also were buried Tuesday in Israel , have begun to emerge .
The still murky account was provided by the only two adult survivors of the assault on the Chabad - Lubavitch center and by Indians living nearby .

The sketchy information has only raised troubling questions .
Why , for example , did Indian police take hours to respond to the first explosions and gunfire at the center ?
Were any of the Jewish hostages killed by Indian commandos during the final assault to free them , or were they already dead ?
There are reports of a terrorist answering overseas phone calls from friends of the Holtzbergs , who were frantically trying to win their release ; heartbreaking accounts of a blood - soaked Moshe crying at the side of his slain parents .
And still , no clear explanation of the assailants ’ aim in attacking a faceless Jewish center on an unpaved back street of Mumbai .
On the day of the attack , the Holtzbergs were hosting a small group in the ultra-Orthodox center , one of hundreds of Chabad houses in 70 countries .

An unarmed Indian guard sat outside as five Jewish travelers dropped in for afternoon prayers , a kosher meal at the Holtzbergs ’ table and a bed for the night .
Yocheved Orpaz , a 60 - year - old Israeli , was en route to join her family on an Indian vacation .
Rabbi Aryeh Leibish Teitelbaum , a 37 - year - old American resident of Israel , and his friend Bentzion Chroman , 28 , a dual U.S. - Israeli citizen , were in India as part of their international work supervising the preparation of kosher food .
They were joined by David Bialka , a 52 - year - old diamond trader and a frequent guest at the center on his business travels , and Norma Shvarzblat Rabinovich , a 50 - year - old Mexican Jew visiting India on her way to start a new life in Israel .
Sometime before 9:30 p.m. on Nov. 26 , the center came under attack by at least two gunmen .
Rabbi Holtzberg telephoned the Israeli Consulate .
“ This is not a good situation , ” the 29 - year - old told security officer Ehud Raz before the line went dead .

Upstairs , Bialka had just fallen asleep and was rousted by an explosion .
He squeezed through a small fifth - floor bathroom window and shimmied down water pipes , hopping from one air - conditioning unit to another until he reached the ground .
Then his good fortune turned bad .
Aroused by the commotion , an angry crowd had already gathered outside the building and mistook Bialka for a militant .
They attacked him .
“ Twice I tried to get near the building , wanting to go back in and help , ” he recalled .
“ But they put me in a cab and took me to the police . ”
The thwarting of that early rescue effort typified the chaos at the scene .
Neighbors heard two blood - curdling screams , one from a man and the other from a woman , and gathered outside the center .
A terrorist tossed out a grenade , killing an Indian in the crowd .

By the time security officer Raz and another armed Israeli arrived , the crowd was so agitated that it chased them to the police station too .
They were detained for hours .
Israelis and Indians alike ask why it took police so long to respond .
Kamaljeet Singh , who witnessed the grenade explosion , said that he rushed to a police station and then to a nearby naval base , but that officers told him they had no permission from higher - ups to act .
The Indian response to the attacks across the city has been widely criticized as under-armed , slow and confused .
It took more than three hours for police to arrive at Nariman House , where the Chabad hostel is located , Singh said .
Israeli officials believe that by that time , at least one or two of the eight unarmed adults inside were dead .

The house was quiet the next morning , Thursday , until nanny Sandra Samuel heard Moshe ’s cries .
Leaving her hide - out in a laundry room , the 44 - year - old Nepalese ran up a flight of stairs and found the bodies of the rabbi , his 28 - year - old wife and two guests .
They had apparently been shot , and Moshe was crying at his parents ’ side , his pants drenched in blood .
The gunmen were apparently on the roof .
Samuel picked up the boy and fled the building .
Also on Thursday , the Mexican hostage , Rabinovich , was ordered to place two calls to Israeli diplomats and relay a demand that Indian forces refrain from attacking the building .
That afternoon the rabbi’s cellphone rang .
A gunman answered gruffly in Urdu .
Advertisement
Rabbi Levi Shemtov was calling from Washington , trying desperately to reach his Chabad - Lubavitch colleague .
The gunman spoke no English , Shemtov said , so the rabbi found an interpreter and dialed again .
Without identifying a cause or spelling out demands , the gunman promised to free his captives if he got what he wanted .
He identified himself as Imran Babar , age 25 , and said all the hostages were OK .
Shemtov promised to put Babar in touch with Indian authorities .
But efforts to patch an Indian police official into a subsequent call failed .
Israeli officials said there was never any negotiation with the two gunmen .
Advertisement
“ I asked if we could hear the voice of the rabbi , or someone who was alive there , ” Shemtov said .
“ We only heard the voice of one woman screaming in English , ‘ Please help immediately ! ’ ”
That was the last reported sign of life from any of the hostages .
When Shemtov insisted again on speaking to Rabbi Holtzberg , he said Babar replied : “ You ’ve already asked for too much . ”
The gunman hung up and called an Indian television station .
He ranted against Israel ’s security cooperation with India and an Israeli army general ’s September visit to the Indian - controlled portion of Kashmir , the territory fought over by India and Pakistan .
Advertisement
“ This is a matter between us and the Hindu [ Indian ] government , ” Babar said .
“ Why does Israel come in here ? ”
“ We are tired of facing tortures and injustices .
We are forced to do this . ”
Indian commandos flown in from New Delhi had arrived at the Jewish center Thursday morning .
But Raz , the Israeli security official , said he saw no serious effort to capture the building until early Friday , when blue - clad troops slid down ropes from a helicopter to the roof and battled their way inside .
Amid broken furniture on blood - soaked floors , soldiers and medics found the bodies of the six victims .
Two of the women , Orpaz and Rabinovich , were bound together .
In a library strewn with red-stained pages of holy books , Chroman ’s body was slumped over an open Talmud .
The rabbi , his wife and Teitelbaum were also dead .
Advertisement
The head of an Israeli medical rescue team that removed the bodies said some of the hostages may have been killed by Indian gunfire during the raid .
Israeli officials disavowed the report , saying the team was unqualified to make that judgment .
Israel ’s Foreign Ministry persuaded the Indian authorities to refrain from examining the corpses , which would have violated Jewish religious law .
“ No autopsies were performed , ” said Yigal Palmor , the ministry ’s spokesman .
“ So we ’ll never know for sure how and when the hostages died . ”

A recent story from the front page of the Wall Street Journal illustrates the bankruptcy of mainstream macroeconomic thinking .
The piece contains so much nonsense that the only appropriate critique is to go through the article step by step :
Shrugging off a flurry of grim economic news , stock investors pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 10 % as they anticipated new medicine from the Federal Reserve .
I realize the WSJ is in the business of selling newspapers , and that calling injections of Fed funny money " medicine " is a catchy opening .
But if our present crisis is the result of prior injections of artificial credit , then the medicine is in fact arsenic .
What is especially ironic is that this very article later on alludes to the possibility that the housing boom was fueled by Greenspan 's low rates .
In any event , the most recent Fed cut was largely symbolic , since the actual fed funds rate ( as opposed to the official " target " set by the Fed ) had already been below 1 percent for some time :
Let 's return to the article :
The case for more rate cuts strengthened Tuesday , with new reports showing the economy deteriorating sharply .
The Conference Board said its monthly measure of consumer confidence hit 38.0 in October , the lowest level since the New York - based business research group began keeping records in 1967 … .
The housing market also took a turn for the worse .
Earlier in the summer , some housing indicators suggested home - price declines might be slowing .
But the S&P / Case - Shiller home - price index for 20 large cities was down 16.6 % in August from a year earlier , a record decline .
Falling home prices can feed a downward housing spiral , creating pressure for more foreclosures and resulting in mortgage losses among banks .
It is true that spiraling home prices are the ultimate driver of the immediate problems , but to repeat , we are in the present mess because of an unsustainable boom in housing .
Everybody agrees that investors foolishly bought into a rising market , and that the incredible appreciation in house prices was not based on fundamentals .
How else will the economy move on , if these admittedly overvalued properties do not shed some of the gains during the artificial boom ?
Government efforts to prop up house prices will waste billions of taxpayer dollars and will only serve to continue denying reality .
The article touches on this point — unintentionally — when it says :
[ T ]he last time the Fed pushed rates [ to 1 % ] , it helped to plant seeds for the current credit bust , some economists argue , by contributing to a frenzy of borrowing by households and on Wall Street .
That does n't appear to be a concern for Fed officials now .
Credit markets are so shaky and the economic outlook so unpromising , another speculative frenzy now looks remote .
What this passage overlooks is that the economy still needs to cleanse itself from the previous bout of malinvestments .
Too many resources were channeled into housing ( and other " high - order " sectors ) , and workers need to be laid off and transferred to more appropriate areas .
( See this article for a simplified analogy to see exactly what this process entails . )
The government is doing everything in its power to prevent this adjustment in light of the true economic realities .
Alan Greenspan spurred an unsustainable boom , and now Ben Bernanke is preventing the recovery from it .
Ah , but we now come to my favorite part of the WSJ article .
Get a load of this :
The US economy is still far from deflationary territory , according to the yardsticks the Fed favors .
But some
Fed officials have recently highlighted a risk that inflation could become uncomfortably low .
" Some prominent forecasters at this stage are concerned that inflation in future years could decline to levels below what is consistent with price stability , " Janet Yellen , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , said in a speech earlier this month .
For the reader 's benefit , I have put Yellen 's statement in bold .
I have no further commentary , except to say : Please read that bold statement once again , and really let it sink in .
Orwell would be proud .
I wo n't bother quoting it , but the rest of the article compares the US situation to that of Japan in the 1990s .
Needless to say , the lesson the WSJ draws is not , " Hmm , Japan 's central bank tried ultra - low interest rates and massive growth in its balance sheet , and it still lost a decade to stagnation .
Maybe the Fed should stop pursuing the same remedies . "
The present crisis is scary , but only because no one knows what crazy new scheme the government will introduce every other day .
Resources were invested improperly during the housing boom , and the economy needs time to heal itself .
There is no way around this fact .
The sooner the government gets out of the way , the sooner recovery can begin .
But even " free market " media such as the Wall Street Journal cling to Keynesian pump - priming , which — by the media 's own admission — did n't help Japan and in fact caused the housing boom .
Thai opposition head to be new PM

Advertisement Thailand 's opposition leader , Abhisit Vejjajiva , has been confirmed as the country 's new prime minister after winning a special vote in parliament .
The speaker of the lower house , Chai Chidchob , said the Democrat Party leader had beaten former police chief Pracha Promnok by 235 votes to 198 .
Mr Abhisit will become Thailand 's fifth leader in a little over two years .
The previous prime minister , Somchai Wongsawat , was forced to resign after a court ruling earlier this month .
ABHISIT VEJJAJIVA Born in Britain , educated at Eton and Oxford Entered parliament in 1992 as one of its youngest members Party leader since 2005 Opposed military coup that overthrew Thaksin Shinawatra Profile : Abhisit Vejjajiva Mountain to climb for new PM
Send us your comments
The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says Mr Abhisit will start his term in office confronting some formidable challenges .
The 44 - year - old British - born politician needs to restore battered economic confidence , cool the emotional political climate , and impose his authority on a cabinet drawn up as a result of days of bargaining with his coalition partners , our correspondent says .
' Silent coup '
After the speaker of parliament had gone round and asked each of the 436 MPs to state the choice , he announced that Mr Abhisit had won and that the Democrats would be given their first chance to govern for eight years .
" Abhisit gained more than half of the vote , therefore I declare that Abhisit has been elected the new prime minister , " Mr Chai said .

Advertisement However , correspondents say the new coalition may only last a few weeks , as by - elections will be held on 11 January to fill 29 seats held by Thaksin supporters barred from politics by the court ruling .
There are also questions about the nature of the behind - the - scenes bargaining needed to persuade Thaksin loyalists to switch sides , with lucrative cabinet posts and , allegedly , large sums of cash being offered by both sides .
Outside the parliament , about 200 supporters of the ousted government reacted furiously to what they called a " silent coup " , hurling barricades at the gates and stopping MPs from leaving .
Several cars had their windows broken .
Some chanted " Abhisit , army nominee " , Reuters news agency reported .
The military is seen as being close to the Democrats .
Most demonstrators dispersed peacefully but promised to gather again later in the day .
Months of deadlock Earlier this month , the Constitutional Court found Mr Somchai 's governing People Power Party ( PPP ) guilty of fraud during the last election a year ago , and banned it and two other parties in the governing coalition .
Mr Somchai and several other PPP leaders were also barred from politics for five years .
However , lawmakers from the three parties who escaped the politics ban quickly formed a new party - Puea Thai ( For Thailand ) - or joined other parties .
On Sunday , Mr Somchai 's brother - in - law , exiled former PM Thaksin Shinawatra , accused the army of using the courts to undermine the government and warned them not to interfere in politics .
The country was stricken by months of political deadlock as anti-government protesters from the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) mounted a campaign to topple the PPP .
The PAD accused the PPP of being a proxy for Mr Thaksin , who was ousted in a coup in 2006 .
The protest culminated in a week - long occupation of Bangkok 's main international airport which left 300,000 foreign tourists stranded .
The PAD called off its action following the Constitutional Court ruling .

Cities deep underwater , frozen continents , the collapse of global agriculture : so far , much of the discussion about climate change has focused on these distant , catastrophic effects of a superheated world .
What 's less talked about is how global warming is making itself felt already .
Even the modest temperature rise we 've already experienced has set in motion fundamental shifts — and the further warming we can expect in the next few decades has the potential to set off dramatic changes .
View Slideshow : Top 10 Places Affected by Climate Change
It 's still difficult to confidently trace any given phenomenon directly to greenhouse gas emissions from our cars , factories and power plants .
The computer models used by climate scientists lack resolution and certainty .
Yet they do provide an idea of what we can anticipate , and there are places in the world where impacts of the type we can expect have already hit .
We do n't have to guess at what it will be like to live in a warming world .
As the following examples show , the future of our planet can be found now , on the frontiers of climate change .

400,000 Without Power After New Hampshire Ice Storm ( George Bush Does n’t Care About White People )
Last Thursday New Hampshire was hit with a major ice storm .
Much like Hurricane Katrina , the full extent of the damage was not fully known right away .
After Hurricane Katrina passed through New Orleans reporters on the scene reported that it looked as though New Orleans dodged a bullet , the hurricane did n’t do the damaged that was feared .
And then it happened , the levees broke and the political firestorm was on .
In New Hampshire last week the extent of the ice storm was not foreseen and the damage left in it ’s wake was devastating .
400,000 homes were left with no electricity , heat , or water .
Half of New Hampshire was dark .
You read that right , HALF of New Hampshire was dark .
After Hurricane Katrina the man who recently called himself the voice of this generation , Kanye West , went on a national awards program and made the outrageous statement , “ George Bush does n’t care about black people . ”
We were shown images of people who had no idea what to do or how to fend for themselves because they have been dependant on the government for so long .
People were asking where FEMA was and where the national guard was .
Hell , the theory was floated that the government blew up the levees to flood black neighborhoods .
It was all over the television because it was a politically viable story .
Fast forward to the New Hampshire ice storm .
NOTHING !
400,000 households with no heat in the middle of the winter and nobody gives a fuck .
I want to know where FEMA was , I want to know where the national guard is , I want to know where all the media coverage is , I want to know where President Bush is .
As of today there are still hundreds of people without power headed into day ten .
There are hundreds of people without heat and water .
There are hundreds of people freezing and yet this story does n’t gain the respect of the media , the celebrities , or the president .
First George Bush blew up the levees and now he has sent the Halliburton Hurricane Machine into New Hampshire to make a few more dollars .
It is obvious to me now that George Bush does n’t like white people .
Neither do the media or the celebrities .
NOTE : THIS IS SARCASM , DEAL WITH IT !

KABUL , Afghanistan 
It looked like an ordinary neighborhood playground : six children tumbling off their skateboards to the tune of laughter .
But only hours before , just 20 yards away , the body of a suicide car bomber was sprawled beside a glistening pool of blood .
Afghan youth have learned to recover almost instantly from such routine violence .
One person determined to inject some normalcy into their lives is Oliver Percovich .
A 34 - year - old from Melbourne , Australia , he plans to open this country ’s first skateboarding school , Skateistan , this spring .
He sees sport as a way to woo students into after - school activities like English and computer classes , which are otherwise reserved for the elite .
“ Teenagers are trying to dissociate from old mentalities , and I ’m their servant , ” Percovich said .
“ If they were n’t interested , I would ’ve left a long time ago . ”
Now , when he pulls his motorcycle into a residential courtyard here , a dozen youngsters pounce before it comes to a stop , yanking six chipped skateboards with fading paint off the back .
The children , most participating in a sport for the first time in their war - hardened lives , do not want to waste any time .
Two Arizona boys , ages six and seven , stoned a kitten before hanging it with a controller cord , reports AZfamily.com .
As the boys were playing Grand Theft Auto prior to harming the animal , infamous Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio blames the game for their actions .
" This game allows players to kill cops and rape women , " Arpaio said .
" It ’s little wonder why they perpetrated such violence against that little animal . "
Due to the boys ' ages they can not be charged with a crime under Arizona state law .
Similarly , Arizona Child Protective Services declined to get involved , claiming the crime was outside the criteria necessary to invoke the agency 's interference .
" This level of animal abuse at such a young age could be a predictor of worse violence in the future , " Arpaio said .
In an effort to prevent further criminal activities , Arpaio has requested that any qualified child counseler willing to volunteer their services to aid the duo contact his office as soon as possible .
" Though it is a little unusual for us to get involved in this way , we ’re doing whatever we can to find the guidance these two boys need to avoid that , " he added .

Bloomberg wrote a piece over the puzzlement that many in the Chicago School of Economics feel at the present time with all of the distress in the markets .�
After all , do n’t markets self - correct ? �
Sadly , no , not all the time , or , at least not with high speed during credit crunches . �
( All of the econometric studies I have done note a weak tendency to mean reversion in financial markets , even excluding periods where there are credit difficulties . )
For markets to self - correct , it requires that economic agents have enough access to capital in order to make the investments necessary to arbitrage the differences between the markets that are in disarray .�
It should be no surprise that during a time where credit is hard to come by , that there are potentially profitable arbitrages that are going begging .
Barry did a post today off of the Bloomberg piece , suggesting the death of the Chicago School . �
I think that prediction is too early .
I am not a Chicago School economist .�
I do n’t like the neoclassical synthesis . �
It posits human rationality in ways that make us robots , both individually and collectively . �
I have been a critic of their methods through both behavioral economics and nonlinear dynamics , a la the Santa Fe Institute . �
We need a new paradigm to replace the neoclassical synthesis . �
It does not adequately describe how mankind behaves ( and we have known that for 25 years — the models do n’t predict well , either in micro or macro ) .
But the answer is not Keynesian policy , in my opinion . �
Just because markets are unstable , that does n’t mean that government action can stabilize them over the long run . �
In the short - run , while credit is still easily available , yes , government action can work , whether through the Fed , subsidies , or tax incentives . �
But Keynesian remedies do n’t work when the government can’t easily tax or borrow in order to provide the stimulus . �
We will face borrowing problems soon enough .
The answers are not to be found by asking the Chicago School or the Keynesians . �
We need an economic theory that accepts the necessity of moderate booms and busts , where the government does little to try to correct the imbalances .�
Moderate imbalances are normal , and if we try to eliminate the moderate busts , we get a series of small busts , followed by one humongous one .�
We experienced easy money in the 20s , and in the 1990 - 2000s .�
Easy money cured the moderate busts , but at a price .
A quick excursus : I agree that tight regulation of financial institutions is necessary if there is fiat money . �
Controlling the money supply means controlling credit . �
I do n’t like fiat money , and would rather have a gold standard , but if we must have fiat money , then make life tough for the banks . �
Restrict what they can invest in .�
Regulate lending practices .
The present distress stems from both a lack of regulation and too much regulation .
Lack of regulation :
Lack of enforcement on bad lending
Leverage limits on commercial and investment banks were too loose .
Modest limits on the banks dealings with the non-regulated financials .
Regulatory arbitrage allowed depositary financial to choose weak regulators .
Failure to disallow investment in areas the regulators did not fully understand .
Too much regulation :
Lack of limits on Fed stimulus action ( our “ independent ” central bank was / is compromised )
Tax deductions for residential real estate , including the home sale capital gains exclusion .
Limiting the number of rating agencies .
My view is that we eventually have to give our currency some backing and get the government out of the money business .�
Until we get there the ride will be bumpy .�
We need to transist back to an economy where credit is not easy , but not non-existent , and where total leverage declines . �
Saving has to become a virtue again , which our present monetary policies will not encourage .
It is too early to declare the demise of the Chicago School , much as it should disappear . �
But now we will get the test of the Keynesian School and I predict failure there ; they will not solve our crisis . �
The crisis will end when enough bad debts have been liquidated , and the financial system can begin lending normally again . �
Call it unrealistic ; call it the Austrian School if you like ( I have not read and von Mises or Hayek ) , but it is what restores the financial sector , which cannot live with too much leverage once assets are deflating .
PS — The Bible says that the borrower is servant to the lender .�
True enough , but if the lender is himself a borrower , like most of our banks , the proverb does not hold . �
The only lenders that are truly soverign are those that control their own destinies , because they have no debt .

The New South Wales Government denies an increase in gun ownership across the state indicates a softening in the Government 's stance on gun laws .
Figures from the New South Wales Firearm Registry show gun ownership has risen by 10,000 per year since 2004 to more than 687,000 in October this year .
But Police Minister Tony Kelly says New South Wales has the toughest gun laws in Australia and there is evidence that firearm offences are on their way down .
" Recent firearm statistics by the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research show that over the last 10 years there 's been a significant reduction in gun crime in New South Wales , " he said .
" Last year , for example , firearm offences were down 20 per cent from the previous year . "
Mr Kelly says New South Wales has strict penalties for improper use .
" The Government has progressively strengthened them , " he said .
" Following the Premier 's request , we 're reviewing the Firearms Act .
" The vast bulk of gun owners are responsible , law abiding citizens .
" Illegal firearm use and trafficking in New South Wales continues to attract the highest penalties in the country . "

Powell rebukes Palin , Limbaugh , ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' David Edwards and John Byrne

In a wide - ranging CNN interview , former Bush Secretary of State Colin Powell lashed out at ex-vice presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin , Rush Limbaugh and said the Pentagon should reconsider the policy barring gays from serving openly in the military .
CNN released a preview of Fareed Zakaria 's interview with Colin Powell Thursday .
Of Palin , Powell said , " Gov. Palin , to some extent , pushed the party more to the right , and I think she had something of a polarizing effect when she talked about how small town values are good .
Well , most of us dont live in small towns .
And I was raised in the South Bronx , and theres nothing wrong with my value system from the South Bronx . "
" And when they came to Virginia and said the southern part of Virginia is good and the northern part of Virginia is bad .
The only problem with that is there are more votes in the northern part of Virginia than there are in the southern part of Virginia , so that doesnt work . "
Of Rush Limbaugh , " Can we continue to listen to Rush Limbaugh ? "
Powell asked .
" Is this really the kind of party that we want to be when these kinds of spokespersons seem to appeal to our lesser instincts rather than our better instincts ? "
The Palin quotes were noted by ThinkProgress , which first posted the clip .
Powell also indicated that there should be a review of the policy on gays in the military .
Pam's House Blend writes , " An architect of the original law , Powell 's opinion is widely regarded as a barometer of the law 's future . "

Air Marshal Shiri is the first senior figure to be targeted for many years
The commander of Zimbabwe 's air force has been wounded in what officials are calling an assassination attempt .
Perence Shiri , 53 , a close ally of President Mugabe , seen as one of the most feared military leaders , was shot in the arm and is said to be stable .
The opposition MDC says he was one of the masterminds of violence against its supporters during this year 's election .
Its spokesman said the attack was aimed at justifying a military crackdown and eventual declaration of an emergency .
The incident comes as pressure grows on Zimbabwe to allow international mediation in its political crisis .
The crisis is compounded by a cholera epidemic which has left hundreds dead .
On Monday , at the UN Security Council 's first discussions on Zimbabwe since July , Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said the world was witnessing a failure of the leadership in Zimbabwe to address the crisis .
After disputed presidential elections in March , President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) agreed to form a power - sharing government .
But implementation of that agreement , reached in September , has been dogged by disagreements over whose supporters would get key ministries .
' Terror attacks '
Correspondents say this is the first time such a senior government figure has been the target of a violent attack for many years .
PERENCE SHIRI Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition in 2008 Member of Joint Operations Command - top military body Accused of leading farm invasions in 2000 Led brutal campaign against " dissidents " in 1980s , which left 20,000 dead Called himself " Black Jesus " - as he had the power of life or death Cousin of Robert Mugabe
On sanctions list of US , EU Age : 53
Key role for security chiefs Q&A : Zimbabwe crisis " This is a very , very unusual incident , because Zimbabwe does not have a history of assassinations , " the assistant editor of the state - run Herald newspaper , Caesar Zaye , told the BBC World Service 's World Today programme .
Air Marshal Shiri was ambushed on Saturday evening while driving to his farm , state media said .
Police said he was accosted by unknown people who shot at his car .
When he heard the gunshots , he got out thinking it was a puncture and was shot .
He is now said to be recovering in hospital .
Officials said the incident was one of a series of attacks aimed at destabilising the country .
" The attack on Air Marshal Shiri appears to be a build - up of terror attacks targeting high - profile persons , government officials , government establishments and public transportation systems , " the Chronicle newspaper quoted Home Affairs Minister Kembo Mohadi as saying .
There were several bomb blasts around Harare last year which caused little damage .
The courts have acquitted several opposition activists accused of staging the attacks .
Mr Zaye said the alleged assassination attempt was " an attempt to bring a security angle into the crisis " .
However , other sources suggest the cause was either a feud within the ruling Zanu - PF party or an attempted robbery .
Crackdown fear On Monday , Zimbabwe 's government said it had " compelling evidence " that neighbouring Botswana was hosting military training camps for opposition groups intent on bringing about regime change .
Botswana denied the charges , and said Harare had failed to provide any tangible evidence to back up its allegations .
Air Marshal Shiri , who is also Mr Mugabe 's cousin and a loyal supporter since he came to power , sits on the Joint Operations Command which advises the president on military matters .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change said the JOC was behind the violent attacks on its supporters ahead of June 's presidential run-off - allegations the military strongly denied .
Air Marshal Shiri was commander of the Fifth Brigade , blamed for the killing of 20,000 people in Zimbabwe 's south - western Matabeleland region during the 1980s .

When thinking of a child with ADD , most people will picture an easily - distracted hyperactive child ... long on energy , and short on attention span .
And although that is sometimes the case , that description accurately describes only a portion of children diagnosed with ADD - and very rarely describes the behavior of girls with the condition .
In fact , many people think Attention Deficit Disorder ( ADD ) is a boy 's disease .
It is commonly believed that it occurs at least twice as often in boys as in girls .
Although it is true that boys are more often diagnosed , the rates are actually about the same in both genders .
Boys more often have the variety called Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) - and that 's what tends to get their problem noticed .
Parents , teachers , and even health professionals tend to picture the classic case of ADD as a boy with a lot of hyperactivity .
The average girl with ADD acts differently .
In girls , the disorganization and distraction results in lack of activity -- they are just too confused to get things started , and instead are often described as daydreamers .
This is in stark contrast to the boys .
Boys ' distractibility is expressed as impulsivity - - a flurry of activity .
While both genders have trouble learning the nuances of social interactions , the results for each are different .
Girls end up shy and withdrawn - they do n't like the negative reactions they get when they do n't clue in to the nuances .
Boys on the other hand are more likely to proceed with social behavior that is considered inappropriate .
While they are bewildered when they get negative reactions , they continue .
A girl 's environment is more likely to be disorganized -- their desk , their bedroom , their backpack .
Although both genders have problems in this area , as girls with ADD hit the teen years the increased organizational demands of junior high and high school become too much .
Grades suffer , and they may become tired and disheartened by poor school performance .
The girls with hyperactivity may throw themselves into social relationships to compensate .
They may be described as boy - crazy or party girls .
ADD and ADHD girls alike begin to show more risky sexual and other behaviors .
They may use drugs or alcohol both due to increasing impulsivity and to self - medicate .
Shoplifting , teen pregnancy , and eating disorders are also found more often in females with ADD .
Why the Symptoms Are Different
The differences in actual environmental disorganization are clearly due to social factors .
But , no one knows for certain why there is such a large difference in hyperactive behavior between the two genders .
It could be that girls have more pressure to conform .
Wild , loud social behavior in a boy may be tolerated .
But , a girl may be more pressured to be quiet and behave .
Likewise for girls , the impulsive actions may get a more negative reaction from adults and peers alike .
In fact , it has been found that girls with ADHD ( those who do express the hyperactive qualities ) have more negative social consequences than boys .
This is true even though the boys have more hyperactivity .
From a physiology perspective , researchers have found girls ' brains differ from those of boys in several ways - including weight , size , and the relative proportion of certain structures in the brain .
This difference may explain why males and females generally display different strengths and weaknesses .
It may also account for the different types of ADHD symptoms they display .
Research in this area is ongoing .
In general , girls are much more likely to have ADD without the hyperactive component .
This is in contrast to ADHD ( Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ) that boys tend to have .
Because a girl is n't disruptive in the classroom , her problem does not create the same need for an immediate solution .
As a result , her inability to focus and complete work is likely to be overlooked as a symptom of a more complex issue - and instead is blamed more on lack of discipline or motivation on her part .
A girl with ADD has fewer learning problems in early grades than her male counterparts .
Boys often get diagnosed through evaluation of learning problems .
Girls with ADD , especially those with high intelligence , may actually be good students and / or well - behaved - and as a result raise absolutely no alarms that anything may be amiss .
When girls with ADD do not conform to social roles , it is often described in gender - specific terms , rather than as a medical problem .
They are labeled tomboys or flighty as girls , and boy - crazy or party girls as teens .
Again , girls are more likely to meet social pressure to conform , rather than recognition and treatment of a disease .
Often girls with ADD are misdiagnosed with depression .
The symptoms of ADD and depression overlap : low energy levels , disorganization , social withdrawal , and trouble concentrating .
Even more confusing , the unrecognized ADD can lead to major coping problems , which in turn lead to actual depression on top of the ADD .
Typical signs of ADD in girls include :
Difficulty maintaining focus
Easily distracted
Disorganized and “ messy ”
Forgetful
Difficulty completing tasks
Daydreaming
Slow to process information and directions ( It may even appear that they are n’t hearing you )
Careless
Often late ( poor time management )
It 's easy for a girl to read this and see many of these characteristics in herself .
Being unprepared , shy , or daydreamy is a part of every girl 's life to some degree .
However , if several of these behavioral descriptions apply , it may be worthwhile to have a formal evaluation .
Even if it is determined that the behaviors are not due to ADD , reassurance will be gained just from knowing .
And if ADD is suspected , she can receive treatment or change her environment to maximize her potential .
Often times , simply understanding ADD ’s impact in one ’s life relieves girls of a huge burden and frees them from the damaging labels of “ spacey , ” “ careless , ” “ unmotivated , ” “ stupid ” or “ lazy . ”
They simply have ADD and their future feels much brighter .
Marion Nestle : Melamine taint - old problem has new urgency

Editor 's note : Nationally recognized nutrition expert Marion Nestle answers readers ' questions in Food Matters , written exclusively for The Chronicle .
E-mail your questions to food@sfchronicle .com , with " Marion Nestle " in the subject line .
Q: Every day we hear about more foods from China with melamine .
First it was infant formula , now it 's candy in New Zealand , croissants in Japan , M&M 's in South Korea , and coffee drinks in the United States .
Explain , please .
A : You may be puzzled , but I am appalled that melamine waste from Chinese plastic dinnerware is in so many foods , particularly infant formula .
China admits to 54,000 cases , 14,000 hospitalizations and four deaths from kidney stones among infants fed formula laced with melamine .
These numbers are undoubtedly underestimates .
Melamine is in milk powder for only one reason : greed .
You can dilute milk and cover up the dilution by adding melamine .
The test for protein in foods looks for nitrogen .
Melamine is 67 percent nitrogen ( the rest is carbon and hydrogen ) .
Nitrogen is used to make protein and shows up as protein on tests .
You can get away with substituting melamine for protein unless food safety officials are checking for it .
Clearly , they were not .
They should have been .
Milk adulteration has a long history and melamine has been fraudulently added to animal feed for at least 40 years .
Most people never heard of melamine until last year 's pet food recall of 60 million cans and pouches .
These contained an ingredient that caused kidney disease in cats and dogs .
That ingredient turned out to be wheat flour laced with melamine .
Some Chinese suppliers sold that adulterant in the guise of wheat and rice glutens .
In researching my latest book , " Pet Food Politics , " I traced the history of melamine adulteration back to the 1960s when veterinarians in South Africa tried to use the chemical as a source of nitrogen for sheep .
They thought that bacteria in the rumens of sheep could convert melamine nitrogen to body proteins .
They were wrong .
Melamine formed kidney crystals and killed the sheep .
That finding did not stop unscrupulous producers from adding melamine to animal feed .
This practice was so common in the 1970s that Italian scientists invented a test to look for " melammina " in fish feed .
They found melamine in nearly 60 percent of the tested samples .
As demonstrated by scientists at UC Davis , melamine itself is not particularly toxic to cats .
But when it is mixed with one of its by - products , cyanuric acid , it forms crystals in kidneys at very low doses .
It does so in infants , too .
Ideal adulterant
Melamine is a perfect adulterant .
It is cheap and hard to detect .
Remember Melmac dishes ?
These were so popular in the 1950s that you can still buy them on eBay .
Most melamine dinnerware is now made in China .
The process involves heat and formaldehyde and yields wastewater heavy with melamine and its by - products .
To recycle the water , these chemicals must be removed .
The resulting " scrap " is produced in prodigious amounts and is there for the taking .
My guess is that unscrupulous Chinese producers have been adulterating foods with melamine for years , but the booming dairy industry provides a new opportunity .
Milk is expensive .
You can buy melamine scrap for practically nothing , substitute it for the proteins in foods - wheat gluten in pet food and milk in infant formulas - and sell these foods at the price of the real thing .
That substitution is unlikely to be detected - unless you add so much melamine that pets or infants get sick .
Let 's not , however , get too xenophobic about China .
What 's happening there today is exactly like what happened in the United States during those heady late 19th century years of unregulated rapid industrialization and unbridled capitalism .
Checks on rampant food adulteration only became possible after Upton Sinclair 's book , " The Jungle , " induced Congress to pass food and drug laws in 1906 .
Taking action
The remedy is clear .
Countries need to clean up their food safety programs .
The challenge facing China is that 80 percent of its food is produced by small countryside operations .
It must enact and enforce food safety regulations that apply to that system .
We need to do everything we can to expedite such regulations .
On our side , this means no - nonsense inspections , import refusals and trade agreements with tight safety provisions .
It also means urging Congress to give the Food and Drug Administration resources adequate to do this job or , as some forward - thinking members have suggested , create a new food safety agency with the authority and resources to oversee the food supply from farm to table .
While waiting for all this to happen , we have some choices .
For the moment , it 's best to just say no to imported foods and ingredients supposedly made with milk or soy powder , unless they are certified free of melamine and other toxic contaminants .
But for this , it helps to know where foods and ingredients come from .
Ask before you buy
As of September , Congress requires country - of - origin labeling ( COOL ) for many foods .
Unfortunately , COOL has loopholes entire container ships could sail through .
If you can't find or do n't believe the origin of the foods you buy , ask .
Let the stores , product manufacturers and your congressional representatives know that you care about where your food comes from .
Tell them that you consider origin labels essential for protecting your family against unsafe food .
I gave " Pet Food Politics " the subtitle " The Chihuahua in the Coal Mine " for good reason .
Untold numbers of cats and dogs died last year from melamine poisoning .
Their deaths should have warned governments to check for melamine in other foods and to enact and enforce more effective food safety regulations .
We - and the Chinese - deserve better food safety oversight .
In this era of food globalization , all countries need safety regulations more than ever .
January 23 , 2009 — Cal NORML is sorry to note that the DEA yesterday conducted its first medical marijuana raid under the Obama administration .
Agents raided the Holistic Solutions facility in South Lake Tahoe , taking cash and product but not arresting anyone .
Supporters are urged to call the White House and ask that Obama act promptly on his pledge to end DEA medical marijuana raids .

DEA Medical Marijuana Raids Cost State Jobs , Taxes : The Ken Estes Story
The DEA ’s medical marijuana raids are depriving California ’s economy of jobs and taxes .
So says Ken Estes , manager of a North Lake Tahoe patients ’ collective which last week was hit by the first DEA medical marijuana raid under the Obama administration .
Estes , a quadriplegic and single parent who has been the target of repeated raids , says that the DEA not only closed his business , but also took his car and money and threatened to take his home and children .
“ I ’m a contributing member of society , creating jobs and paying taxes , ” says Estes , “ but the DEA keeps taking my stuff . ”
Last December , the DEA forced Estes to close what had been the only operating dispensary in Contra Costa county , Holistic Solutions .
“ I had nine employees and had paid over $ 51,000 in sales taxes to the state in the past three months , ” he says .
Last May , DEA agents raided Estes and forced him to close two other dispensaries in San Mateo and Clearlake , leaving a path of destruction in their wake .
Estes , 44 , credits medical marijuana with giving him gainful employment .
“ I was proud of myself to get off welfare , off disability , and to start paying taxes , ” he says .
Estes blames the
San Francisco DEA office for targeting him , saying that local police have given him no trouble .
DEA raids have cost California millions in sale tax revenues , according to records collected by California NORML .
In addition , they have deprived the state of hundreds of taxpaying jobs , contributed to criminality , and discouraged development of a legally regulated market .
Californians consume $ 1 – $ 2 billion worth of medical marijuana per year , enough to generate some $ 100 million in sales taxes .
Ten times as much could be generated by complete legalization .
California NORML urges supporters to call on President Obama to promptly implement his pledge to end the DEA ’s medical marijuana raids .

Cybersquatting is as much of a pain in the brand name as ever , but Verizon has been awarded what it calls the " largest - ever judgment " against OnlineNIC , a company squatting hundreds of domains related to Verizon products .
Verizon is set to collect $ 33.15 million from OnlineNIC — if anyone from the company can be found .
OnlineNIC is a domain registrar based in San Francisco that , according to Verizon 's 480 + page complaint filed in June , has made a business out of registering over 600 domain names like iphonefromverizon.com , itunesverizon.com , and treoverizon.com .
Since no one from the " accredited " OnlineNIC appeared to court summons , the court " concluded that OnlineNIC 's bad - faith registrations of Verizon - related domain names were designed to attract web users who were seeking to access Verizon 's legitimate websites , " Verizon said in a lawsuit .
The telecom won a default judgement against OnlineNIC for $ 50,000 per domain name that OnlineNIC registered , and both Microsoft and Yahoo filed their own similar lawsuits later this year .
Verizon Vice President Sarah Deutsch displayed an affinity for the theatrical in the company 's statement , declaring that " this case should send a clear message and serve to deter cybersquatters who continue to run businesses for the primary purpose of misleading consumers . "
According to Verizon 's lawsuit , however , it may have trouble striking fear into the knees of cybersquatters everywhere since OnlineNIC 's perpetrators employees have gone to great lengths to conceal their identities .
OnlineNIC 's employees have used " numerous shell - entities , fictitious business , and personal names , " in addition to covering basic tracks such as withholding accurate information from the company 's public WHOIS database .
Verizon believes that one or more of OnlineNIC 's employees conduct business with various aliases and contact information , including " dehau manglang ciqi CO. , LTD . , " " txt@yogidesigns.com , " and " DN4 Ever . "
Regardless of the whereabouts of OnlineNIC 's one - or - more employees , the World Intellectual Property Organization said in March that cybersquatters are on the rise .
In 2007 , it received 2,156 complaints over cybersquatting — almost a 50 percent increase from two years ago — and ICANN 's plan to introduce new generic Top Level Domains ( gTLDs like .com , .net , etc. ) will almost surely make matters worse .
Instead of having to protect against derivative .com domains like the ones that OnlineNIC registered , Verizon may soon need to register domains like http://phones.verizon and plans.vzw ; the sky could truly be the limit .
The US Federal Reserve Monday authorized giving credit card giant American Express full status as a bank holding company .
The US central bank said that both American Express Company and its affiliate American Express Travel Related Services would be allowed to form bank holding companies , as the AMEX group converts its Salt Lake City , Utah - based American Express Centurion Bank into a full commercial bank .
" In light of the unusual and exigent circumstances affecting the financial markets , and all other facts and circumstances , the ( Federal Reserve ) Board has determined that emergency conditions exist that justify expeditious action on this proposal , " the Fed said in a statement .
AMEX , with 127 billion US dollars in consolidated assets , will convert the Centurion Bank , which is classified as a limited industrial loan company with about 25.3 billion US dollars in assets , into a full bank .
The move comes four days before a US Treasury deadline for banks to participate in its 700 billion dollar bank rescue program to provide US banks with additional capital amid turmoil in US financial markets .

Low - code vs No-code :
What is right for you ?
Low - code platforms involve a more intuitive visual approach to application development , allowing developers to drag and drop components onto a canvas and then integrate the components using popup dialogs and plain language .
The simplified interface leads many to believe that building applications using LCP requires little or no knowledge of hand coding .
So low - code became synonymous with no code .
But at times , these drag and drop components need to be extended by coding to build customized applications .
For example , your developer might want to place a specific widget on the app page , which is not a part of the default widget library of the platform .
In this scenario , LCP ’s like WaveMaker , allows you to extend the platform capabilities by letting you build such a widget and make it available as a drag - n - drop component for future projects .
However , what if the company employed a team of developers who built a UI widget library based on the company ’s approved design template and is made available in the platform itself ?
Then app building becomes a no - code experience .
LCP ’s allow citizen developers to create apps without any hand coding and are also capable of letting professional developers create complex applications with a reduced amount of coding .
While no -code platforms let citizen developers create basic apps , they are of no use to professional developers .
WaveMaker , as a low - code AD&D platform , enables enterprise IT to create modern complex applications with a variety of integration options and advanced data management capabilities and a broad partner ecosystem .
These platforms can be used to customize and modernize apps , including user experience focused - customer facing applications and also have basic process automation capabilities .

Sorry , Brad , but 60 is not a filibuster - proof majority , because there are Blue Dogs among them and Liberman .
Perhaps , ( PERHAPS ! ) if they got to 60 with Liberman being counted , they could boot him and make an offer to a moderate Republican who is up in 2010 or 2012 and would feel vulnerable to the many votes they would be required to take against the interests of the nation simply to toe the party line .
Susan Collins comes immediately to mind , or perhaps Olympia Snow .
The offer would have to include some serious financing and major committee seats .
A moderate R who wanted to stay in the Senate might take that offer , rather than fight a multi-million dollar battle to save their seat down the road .
The interim election in 3 months for Stevens ' seat is another opportunity .
It 's a long - shot , but not impossible , but getting " to 60 " will absolutely NOT provide what they need to battle against politically - motivated , America - hating Rethuglicans in the Senate .

If the Republicans continue to adopt the filibuster tactic that they have used in recent years to thwart and obstruct the legitimate business of the public citizenry , then Democrats should absolutely INSIST that they physically do so instead of invoking the " Harry Reid cave - in " as was done in the past .
The public will then get to see who the obstructionists really are and a political price will then be extracted .

Agree with Steve B - I 've never agreed with the parliamentary strategy of failing to bring bills out of committee because you know they will be filibustered .
Make 'em do it out in the daylight !
Preferably over and over and over !
Even if it amounts to the same thing in the end , they will be exposed as the anti-progress dirty tricksters that they are , and we can dispense with the laughable accusations that the dems are ineffective .
As I teach my kids , do n't fail to stand up for the truth just because you think the other guy is going to lie - make him do it out loud !

Democrats might want 60 , but ordinary people have no desire for a last minute bald faced grab for power .

I agree with Steve B. above about filibustering , also .
However , everyone seems to be forgetting that the number of Democratic senators still include president - elect Obama and vice - president - elect Biden ( who won re-election to the senate in this very election ! )
These senate seats will be vacated when Obama and Biden take office and be subject to special elections which Republicans could conceivably win .
The eventual senate party make - up is not over yet by a long shot .

We need ( and hopefully will get ) new speakers in both the House and Senate .
Ones that will whip the Dems into shape and force those Republicans who do n't cooperate with bills that have majority support to pay a heavy political price for each obstruction .
We need to IMPLEMENT the solutions that Obama comes up with .
America will NOT put up with Rethuglican obstruction and fillerbuster .
They can get on board or get out of the way .
We spent 8 years trying Rethuglican ideas , and they did n't work out very well .
NOW , we are going to try something new .

It is my understanding that the governor 's of Illinois and Delaware will appoint replacements for Obama and Biden .
And even if this is not the case , if it is an actual re-election ( which does n't seem reasonable , to campaign for this office in such a short span of time between now and inauguration ) both of these states are solidly blue states .
I can't imagine either one would end up with an R as a replacement .

I 'm tired of research and investigating ... do n't we have enough data to know that machines do not belong in our election process , regardless if they are Diebold , Sequoia , ESS or whoever !!!
This has been going on for years !!
We need petitions , an organized push to get our congressmen to repeal / amend HAVA .
Get rid of the machines .
We do n't need machinery and private companies in our voting process .
Go with paper ballots , pencil and oversight of counters by both / all parties , like Canada .
We need language to support all registered eligible voters from voter suppression , caging , lies , intimidation .
Offenders need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law .
It 's time for action !!!!

GO check the Minnesota Secretary of state election site .
It is beautifully crosstabulated .
Unfortunately you can't compare with previous weeks ' polling , but you can compare with previous general elections .
You have presidential totals and senate totals and every other race by legislative district , state senate district , township , municipality , county , precinct , however you want it .
What I see is a fairly typical result in 5A ( Virginia , Mountain Iron , Eveleth ) and 5B ( Hibbing and Floodwood ) but a little Republican shift going on in 6A ( Ely - Kabetogama - Two Harbors - East Duluth ) , and in every case Dean Barkley 's total is almost entirely made up of Obama voters .
Even allowing Barkley 's presidence , the Republican shift in 6A alone more than accounts for Coleman 's statewide margin .
Overall , St. Louis County posts the exact same vote shares D - R for president for 2008 as it did four years ago --- in other words , about 65 D to 33 R --- but my sense is that Duluth is now the slightly more Democratic end of the county and the Range slightly less Democratic .
The wedges the Republicans have used up here is " sportsmen 's rights " , motorized recreation , abortion , and alleged Democratic insensitivity to " natural resource " issues ( i.e. claiming the system is rigged against loggers , claiming that mine permitting is too onerous ) .
Basically it 's a more microtargeted version of the national Republican spiel against environmentalism , social liberalism and regulations .
If you want to formally compare with previous elections , results for every year back to 1998 are available in huge Excel files for each year , and so you can accurately compare every county , legislative district or precinct as you choose .
Overall Minnesota is simply not trending Democratic for statewide office and the presidency like the rest of the Midwest .
The DFL for years was completely at sea ; they now have their act together in the legislature but they 're still a mess in statewide elections .
And do n't underestimate Pawlenty and Ventura 's effectiveness over the past decade in undermining the progressiveness of taxation in Minnesota and breeding the politics of resentment .

With almost 100 % of precincts reporting , the latest election results show Obama leading by 65 - 57 m votes ( 53 - 46 % ) .
But the tremendous GOTV and new registration effort has not resulted in an increase in the recorded vote from 2004 ( 122.3 m ) .
Compare this to the 17 m increase from 2000 to 2004 ( 105 m to 122 m ) .
The media should be asking the questions .
Why is the recorded count at 123 m , when a 140 m + turnout was forecast ?
How many voters were told they had to complete provisional ballots ?
Historically , about 75 % of uncounted votes ( spoiled , lost , provisional and absentee ) are Democratic .
Therefore , if 143 m votes were actually cast , the True Vote count would be approximately 80 - 62 m ( an increase of 15 m for Obama and 5 m for McCain ) .
Obama ’s current 8 m margin would increase to 18 m .
This would be a landslide of major proportions ( see the Election Calculator projection below ) .
But we will have to wait until the Census Bureau publishes its 2008 vote survey to know how many votes were cast .
Obama must have done better than the 53 - 46 % share as indicated by the Final National Exit Poll ( NEP ) .
The margin is probably closer to 55 - 43 % ( as projected by a few national pre-election polls ) .
In order to match the vote count , the Final NEP adjusts demographic category weights and vote shares .
The “ Voted in 2004 ” category indicates a TOTALLY IMPLAUSIBLE 46 Bush / 37 % Kerry returning voter split of the 2008 electorate !
Analysts would like to know what the split was in the earlier NEP update - before the Final was matched to the vote .
We have the preliminary numbers from 2004 and the 2006 midterms .
Changes to the “ How Voted ” mix of returning voters from the Preliminary to the Final NEP were to the advantage of the GOP .
The goal was to MATCH THE RECORDED VOTE COUNT .
This election is no different .
Landslide denied .

The Democrats do n't WANT a filibuster - proof majority .
Pelosi has already said they plan to rule from " the center " and they do n't want to have to explain why they wo n't fund Al Gore 's infrastructure plan , wo n't pull troops out of Southwest Asia , nor do anything on healthcare .

I do n't really care about the 60 vote supermajority .
I just want the votes to be counted correctly .
There is no way to convince me that Saxy Chambliss was ever really elected by the people of Georgia .
And Alaska sounds very fishy .
Minnesota sounds less fishy , but fishy enough .
My prediction is that the state without a Republican partisan overseeing the election will end up sending Al Franken to the Senate and that the other two Republicans will squeak through .
Georgia seems hopeless at this point .
Maybe there 's hope that Alaska 's shenanigans will be exposed by a newly emboldened Democratic caucus in the legislature .
We shall see .
Six years of Chambliss sickens me , but maybe by 2014 Georgia will have wisened up and dumped the machines .

Franken gained another 100 votes , so now there 's 236 votes between Coleman and Franken .
Calling it a typo , someone in one of the counties had typed in 24 instead of 124 votes for Franken .

Is n't that bad for democracy ?
I would n't want Democrats or Republicans as a united no opposition unit in congress .
That 's not good for our freedoms and not good for government .
Have the Democrats stopped the neocons from advancing their assault on us the people ... NO !
they were right there alongside with them every chance they got .
Some Republicans actually make sense like Ron Paul .

The 60 vote goal is a big deal since filibusters have increased in frequency in the last few years .
" In the fall of 2007 , the 110th Congress ' 1st session broke the record , for filibuster cloture votes , topping 70 as of Nov 15 , 2007 .
It is on track to triple the number of such votes in 2008 's 2nd session . "

Brad stated :
We 've also seen reports of inexplicable drops in turnout , comparable to Alaska's , as mentioned above , though we 've have n't yet confirmed that .
Brad ,
It 's possible that what appears to be lower turnout in 2008 in Georgia and Alaska can be alternately explained as having been an artifact of fraudulently inflated totals in earlier elections .
The Alaska situation in particular seems to demand much more investigation .
Thanks for your fabulous and dogged work trying to keep our elections honest !

FYI a replacement for Senator Joe Biden .
Gov. Ruth Ann Minner ( D ) will appoint Joe 's successor .
The successor will serve until the next general election in 2010 .
The winner of that election will serve out the balance of the term .
The front runner for the seat is the current Lt. Gov , John Carney ( D ) .
If appointed , he would probably win the seat in 2010 .
If Biden resigns before the end of the year , Carney could be appointed to the current Senate .
If done early enough , Carney would acquire several weeks of Senate seniority in the session to start on Jan 5 .

Pelosi Schmelosi !
Decora , you should teach your kids that this is about a fair election , and people 's livelihoods ; people 's very survival .
YOU ARE NOT A CENTER - LEFT NATION ANY MORE , however much you and La Pelosi might wish it were otherwise .
You should be utterly ashamed of yourself talking about this as a matter of a " power grab " and of " sportsmanship " .

In any case , you have never known a centre - left government in the US - just a spectrum of right - wing governments .
As regards the filibustering , even in the event of missing the necessary majority , if the bill is important enough , the Dems should not hesitate to sue the so - called " nuclear option " .
Remember , the Democrats ' adversaries are the very ones who have run your country into the ground .
It hardly behoves the Democrats to be bipartisan when a blocked bill arises as a result of the Republicans ' misgovernment or indeed if Obama perceives its passing to be crucial to the country 's recovery .
In those circumstances , I do n't believe Obama will cave , Pelosi notwithstanding .

We 'll see if that is part of the change they bring as the majority party in both legislative chambers

Facebook logo ( Photo credit : Wikipedia )
I have been reading your blog for a while now either through the site or my RSS feed , and I love it !
I think yours is actually my favorite blog .
So I have a question for you and / or your readers .
Its about my facebook profile , specifically the line called " religious views . "
Now you or a lot of your readers may not think that facebook is that important , but as a college student now it actually is - for fun and for practical purposes such as networking .
It is also the primary way to define yourself for people who know you , which is why I want my " religious views " line to be accurate .
For the last few years my profile has read " atheist , " but I have n't ever liked it because atheism is n't a religious view , it is the opposite .
" None " would be more accurate but at the same time it is kind of vague since spiritual people , agnostics , ignostics etc. could all describe their religious views as none .
Recently I have considered putting down Pastafarianism , but again that does n't really define me as an atheist .
So " atheist " is most accurate , but at the same time I feel like I am reinforcing the idea that atheism is a religion , and that is something I do n't want to do , especially since a large percentage of my friends ( most of whom are on facebook ) are Christians that are already ignorant about atheism .
Any thoughts ?
I believe I mentioned here recently that I had been playing around with Facebook .
Since I am using my real name and not planning to promote my blog there ( at least not just yet ) , I was not sure what to make of the " religious views " line on my profile .
Coincidentally , a reader e-mailed me and asked my opinion about this very issue just as I was confronting it myself .
She did not want to put " atheist " under religion because she recognized that atheism is not a religion and did not want to pretend it was .
This led her to think of simply putting " none " in the space .
However , she was n't sure she liked this idea much better .
Given my goals in using Facebook , I ended up just leaving the religion line blank for now .
For those of you using Facebook , what was your solution ?
The reader , whose identity I will protect here , described her dilemma as follows :
She 's certainly right about many Christians being ignorant about atheism .
Sadly , we could say the same for some humanists !
Anyway , do you have any advice ?
Peg Solitaire and Group Theory
Peg Solitaire ( also known as Hi-Q ) has very simple rules .
Pegs ( red circles ) are allowed to jump over adjacent ( vertically or horizontally ) pegs .
The peg that has been jumped over is removed .
So jumps are like captures in Checkers .
The goal of a regular game is to remove all pegs but one .
In central solitaire , the player starts with pegs filling all the holes , except for the central one .
According to the game brochure ( Milton Bradley Co. , 1986 ) , whoever succeeds in leaving the last peg in the center is a genius .
Anyone who leaves a single peg elsewhere is an outstanding player .
Figure 1
Not long ago , with the help of very elementary group theory , Arie Bialostocki from University of Idaho proved that there are only five locations ( b. above ) where one can leave that single peg .
Assuming that , e.g. , the peg was left in the rightmost hole , part c. in Figure 1 shows the position before the last move .
The irony is in that from the same position the player can leave the sole remaining peg in the central hole , thus gaining the status of genius , instead of an outstanding player .
Would one trade the distinction ?
It 's this amazing observation that led Arie Bialostocki to developing his nice theory which I am going to outline below .
Figure 2
Place letters x , y , z as shown in Figure 2a .
The arrangement of letters is very special and has been noticed yet in the classic WW , page 706 .
Whenever one of the letters points to a peg that jumps over a peg with another letter on it it always lands in a hole labeled by the third letter .
Moves Over
To x y z x z y y x z y z x z x y z y x
We may define an operation " + " on letters x , y , z to shorten move Description .
Let 's write x + y = z to indicate the fact expressed in the first row of the table , namely , that whenever peg x jumps over peg y it always lands in hole z .
Similar notion are used for the remaining rows of the table , so that , for example , y + x = z and z + x = y and so on .
The operation thus defined is commutative .
Indeed , for example , z + x = y , but also x + z = y , so that z + x = x + z .
Further , the operation " + " has been defined for all pairs of three letters , other than x + x , y + y , and z + z .
Guided by Group theory , we may set
x + x = y + y = z + z = 0 ,
where the new symbol 0 is required to fulfill
x + 0 = x , y + 0 = y and z + 0 = z .
All the properties of the operation " + " can now be summarized in its Cayley table :
0 x y z 0 0 x y z x x 0 z y y y z 0 x z z y x 0
The Cayley table of a group collects all the information about the group operation ( " + " in our case ) in compact form .
An additional property of " + " can be derived now from its Cayley table , namely , the sum of all three non-zero symbols x , y , z in any order is always 0 : x + y + z = 0 . ( Does not this remind you of 3 - purges ? )
We can also consider the sum of all pegs in a configuration ( See Figure 2 b - c . )
For example , it is clear that the sum of all pegs in the starting position of central solitaire is y - the value of the sole unoccupied hole .
When x jumps over y it lands in z .
So that two pegs x + y are replaced with a single peg z , which means that the moves in peg solitaire do not change the value of the game 's configuration .
In other words , the value of a position in peg solitaire is invariant under the legal moves .
In particular ,
Any position derived in central solitaire by legal moves has the value of y!
This is of course true of any position with a single peg left .
Figure 3
Therefore , the only possible locations for the sole remaining peg are those indicated in Figure 3a .
However , not all locations are attainable .
Since the starting configuration has both central and line symmetry , and since moves may also follow any of those symmetries , if , for example , a single peg might be left in the " corner " position in Figure 3b , it would be also possible to leave a single peg in other " corner " positions , like that in Figure 3 c .
But position in Figure 3 c is labeled by z .
Therefore , the position in Figure 3b is not possible .
The only positions that withstand the symmetry test are the five in Figure 1b .
A. Bialostocki mentions in a personal introduction to the paper that his Erdös number is 1 .
As I have recently learned , mine is 3 .
The reason is that I once wrote a paper with Ken Atkinson from University of Iowa whose Erdös number is 2 , which means that he wrote a paper with somebody whose Erdös number is 1 , which in turn means that the latter is one of a host of Erdös ' co-authors .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Gold maintained its strength on Monday , tracking a climb in crude oil prices amid renewed tensions in the Middle East , but it retreated from early highs as oil prices gave up some ground .
Broad weakness in the dollar also supported gold .
A slide in the pound sterling to a record low versus the euro helped take the precious metal to a new all - time high when priced in British pounds , according to Reuters data .
Spot gold reached a session high of $ 889.55 an ounce , its strongest level since October 10 , but was off the highs at $ 877.55/880.55 , up from $ 866.80 late in New York on Friday .
In sterling terms , gold hit an all - time high of 605.07 pounds an ounce , up from 592.40 pounds on Friday .
U.S. gold futures for February delivery climbed $ 4.10 to $ 875.30 .
“ The dollar and crude directed the market , with early strength in crude and the weak dollar pushing the market up hard early , along with the events in Gaza Strip , ” said Stephen Platt , an analyst at Archer Financials in Chicago .
Later in the session , some players used price gains as a profit - taking opportunity , once oil trimmed its gains .
“ We backed off those highs in recognition that that situation has not changed .
And crude backed off its highs and the dollar rallied up from its lows , which led to some profit taking from that early strength , ” said Platt .
Israeli aircraft destroyed a bastion of Hamas rule over Gaza on Monday , the third day of an offensive that has killed more than 300 Palestinians in the deadliest violence in the territory .
“ Gold is reflecting geopolitical tensions .
The other precious metals are tracking gold at the moment , and the oil market , ” said Deutsche Bank trader Michael Blumenroth .
Geopolitical tensions increase interest in bullion as a safe - haven investment and are also a prime factor driving up oil prices , which also influence gold .
Oil rose nearly 10 percent to a high of $ 42.20 a barrel as Middle East violence served as a reminder that political tensions could threaten crude supplies .
They later slipped back below $ 40 a barrel , limited by economic troubles .
“ Further geopolitical tension should inflate the risk premium in current precious metal prices , which should translate into increased upside potential in the near term -- barring any significant decline in financial market systemic risk , ” Standard Bank analyst Manqoba Madinane said .
The dollar , the other main external driver of gold , weakened against the euro , helping to lift bullion prices .
A softer dollar typically supports gold , which is often bought as an alternative investment to the U.S. currency .
The dollar fell broadly on Monday as a grim outlook for the U.S. economy weighed .
SILVER GAINS
Among other precious metals , silver tracked gold higher to a two - week high of $ 11.23 an ounce from $ 10.64 late on Friday .
By late in New York ’s session silver trimmed its early rise to $ 10.75/10.85 an ounce .
Investment demand for silver - backed exchange - traded funds remains strong .
The world 's largest silver - backed ETF , the iShares Silver Trust SLV.A , said its bullion holdings rose more than 30 tons , or 0.5 percent , on Friday to their highest level since late October .
The New York - based trust has recorded an inflow of more than 106 tons of silver since the beginning of December .
Platinum group metals also climbed .
Platinum touched a session high of $ 931 an ounce , its strongest in 10 weeks , and held most of those gains onto late New York business at $ 915.50/920.50 an ounce , against $ 888.50 on Friday .
“ The white metal should benefit from further bargain hunter interest in coming sessions , with chart resistance pegged at $ 938/44/74 , ” James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com , said .
“ However , the metal still remains overshadowed by slowing auto demand and shifting market fundamentals . ”
Fears over falling demand from the car industry , which accounts for around half of global platinum consumption , has knocked platinum down by as much as two - thirds from the all - time high of $ 2,290 an ounce it reached in March .
Spot palladium rallied nearly 7 percent to a session high of $ 186.50 , lifted by gains in other precious metals and in oil .
It was quoted at $ 185/190 an ounce in late Monday trade in New York , up from $ 174.50 on Friday .
After a year of explosive audience growth , the cable news channels head into 2009 buoyed by record ratings , a rare bright spot in what has otherwise been a gloomy media season .
Thanks largely to avid interest in the historic presidential campaign , all of the networks scored their largest prime - time viewership in history this year -- though they suffered a steep drop in viewers after the election .
Fox News racked up its seventh straight year as the most - watched cable news channel , delivering an average prime - time viewership of 2.1 million , 40 % more than 2007 , according to data released Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research .
CNN placed second with 1.3 million , up 69 % , while MNSBC drew 920,000 , a boost of 82 % .
With such huge gains in audience , the cable networks rivaled and often beat the broadcast networks with their coverage of the political conventions and presidential debates , a dramatic shift from past years .

“ You really saw the news game move to cable , ” said MSNBC President Phil Griffin .
“ I think cable news has come of age . ”
But even as the cable channels jostle over which can claim the biggest success in the last year , there are already signs of the challenges they ’ll face sustaining their audiences .
Since election day , all three have suffered a marked drop in viewership .
Fox News ’ prime - time audience shrank by 40 % in the seven weeks since Nov. 4 compared with the six - week period leading up to the election , a loss of 1.37 million viewers .
CNN shed 50 % of its audience , down 1.16 million viewers .
MSNBC dropped 41 % , down 713,000 viewers .
Cable news executives said they were n’t surprised by the post-election falloff .
Advertisement
“ This was an emotionally wrenching election , and an awful lot of viewers who are not normal news viewers tuned in to see who would win , ” said CNN / U.S. President Jon Klein .
He and other executives insisted that the coming year will present new opportunities to boost audience as people seek information about the incoming Obama administration and the state of the economy .
“ There ’s plenty of drama out there , ” Griffin said .
“ If we lose a lot of our audience , that ’s our fault . ”
The competition among the networks is bound to be fierce as they labor to attract viewers in a highly politicized environment .
Fox News has solidified its lineup of right - leaning commentators , renewing the contracts of Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly and bringing aboard Glenn Beck for a show that begins Jan. 19 .
MSNBC has gone the other direction , tapping liberal host Rachel Maddow to follow Bush critic Keith Olbermann , whose contract was renewed for four more years .
Advertisement
CNN , sensing an opportunity , has sought to claim the middle ground .
“ Our competition clearly entrenched themselves on the partisan flank , left and right , and that left the vast middle open to us , ” Klein said .
CNN scored significant victories throughout the 2008 campaign , including on election night , when it was the most - watched network in all of television between 5 and 9:30 p.m. Pacific time .
“ I think we established very clearly that CNN is the network to watch for reliable information , ” Klein said .
In lieu of a response , a Fox News spokesman pointed to the network ’s ratings dominance .
MSNBC rejected the notion that politics taints the news it delivers .
“ We do n’t skew the news , ” Griffin said .
“ I do n’t think we ’ve embraced an ideology , but I do think we ’ve embraced the point of view of our hosts . ”

After years of trailing far behind its rivals , MSNBC is basking in the success of Olbermann , who continues to beat CNN in his time period , as well as new star Maddow , who best - ed “ Larry King Live ” in the demographic most valuable to advertisers , 25 - to 54 - year - olds .
Both networks were outstripped in those time slots by Fox News ’ “ The O’Reilly Factor ” and “ Hannity & Colmes , ” which were the two most popular cable news shows of the year , followed by “ On the Record With Greta Van Susteren , ” “ The Fox Report With Shepard Smith ” and “ Special Report With Brit Hume . ”
( Hume , who anchored his last program Dec. 23 , will be succeeded by Bret Baier beginning Monday . )
Fox News also enjoyed its best daytime ratings ever , drawing 1.1 million viewers on average , 29 % more than last year .
CNN pulled in 695,000 , a boost of 44 % , while MSNBC had 468,000 , up 51 % .

Paper towels billowing out of bathroom dispensers is , for some environmentalists , a painful symbol of waste .
Rob Gogan , the recycling and waste manager at Harvard University , estimated that paper towels often account for 20 to 40 percent of waste ( by volume ) from an office building or a dorm .
The university is trying to cut down their use .
In some buildings , Harvard urges students to use fewer , with a sticker saying “ use wisely , paper equals trees . ”
The slogan is borrowed from the University of Oregon , Mr. Gogan said .
“ It ’s a delicate game because we do n’t want to be seen as anti-sanitary or restricting people ’s freedoms , ” he said .
Mr. Gogan himself carries two handkerchiefs — one for use as a tissue and the second , as a towel .
In other buildings Harvard has installed blow - dryers .
These use electricity , of course .
Nonetheless , Mr. Gogan said he had done the math , and the “ lifecycle ” energy use of a blow - dryer is lower than that of paper towels , which are produced at energy - intensive mills and then shipped to their destination .
A Slate writer reached the same conclusion earlier this year — though much depends on the energy - efficiency of the blower and how long it is running .
Recycling is not an easy option .
Not only are paper towels often mixed in with gunk , but also , “ There ’s hardly any fiber left in them to recycle , so it ’s not worth it , ” said Jim Gogek Grogek , a spokesman for the University of California at San Diego , in an e-mail message , citing the expertise of Alonso Noble , the university ’s recycling guru .
“ That ’s doubly true now that the price for recyclables has dropped . ”
Harvard is considering composting paper towels — something tried only rarely .
Since 2002 , several Canadian government buildings have had special bins for paper towels in bathrooms , which are composted and then spread over the refuse at landfills .
San Francisco State University is undertaking a pilot project for paper towel recycling in two locations ( including a student center ) , but there are hurdles .
“ It is expensive to set up a new waste stream , ” said Caitlin Steele , the university ’s recycling coordinator .
“ But we have so many paper towels that we are testing out the effect it will have on our trash compactor rates . ”
Mr. Gogan says that paper towels are very compostable and will take care of some of the extra moisture in , say , supermarket produce .
However , there is still the problem with tampons and dental floss mixed in .
“ You have to have the right kind of building , with the right population and get them trained properly , with probably a special receptacle , ” he added .
Could that right population be Harvard ’s facilities headquarters , where Mr. Gogan works ?
Not yet , he said : “ We have n’t had the nerve to do it even here . ”

U.S. financial losses from the credit crisis may reach $ 3.6 trillion , suggesting the banking system is “ effectively insolvent , ” said New York University Professor Nouriel Roubini , who predicted last year ’s economic crisis .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ I ’ve found that credit losses could peak at a level of $ 3.6 trillion for U.S. institutions , half of them by banks and broker dealers , ” Roubini said at a conference in Dubai today .
“ If that ’s true , it means the U.S. banking system is effectively insolvent because it starts with a capital of $ 1.4 trillion .
This is a systemic banking crisis . ”
Losses and writedowns at financial companies worldwide have risen to more than $ 1 trillion since the U.S. subprime mortgage market collapsed in 2007 , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
President Barack Obama will have to use as much as $ 1 trillion of public funds to shore up the capitalization of the banking sector , following the $ 350 billion injection by the Bush administration , Roubini told Bloomberg News .
Congress last year approved a $ 700 billion rescue fund , of which half remains to be disbursed .
Bank of America Corp. , the largest U.S. bank by assets , posted a quarterly loss of $ 1.79 billion last week , its first since 1991 , and received $ 138 billion in emergency government funds .
Citigroup Inc. posted an $ 8.29 billion fourth - quarter loss , completing its worst year , and plans to split in two under Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit ’s plan to rebuild a capital base eroded by the credit crisis .

The " Roboat " : Solar and Linux - Powered Sailboat
December 6th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Becoming an accomplished sailor is n’t easy , but a group of European sailing enthusiasts have just made the sport a little more accessible for beginners .
The ASV Roboat is a solar - powered , Linux - brained sailboat that can sail anywhere and navigate pre-set race courses with no human intervention .
The Roboat is actually an adapted 3.75 m Laerling beginner ’s sailing vessel that is tricked out with a Linux operating system and a control software suite that uses Java and C ++.
The boat also features sensors that track position and speed over ground , speed through water , ultrasonic wind speed , and more .
When a destination is set , the Roboat ’s chain - driven motors adjust the mainsail , jib , rudder , and boom .
In case its solar panels fail , the Roboat also comes with a methanol fuel cell for backup .
And while there are other robotic sailboats floating around the ocean , the Roboat may be the best — earlier this year , the boat won the first World Robotic Sailing Championship .

WASHINGTON --
New signs of deterioration in the U.S. job market added impetus to appeals by Detroit 's auto makers for a bailout , as Democratic leaders in Congress and the White House neared an agreement to providing a down payment to keep the industry afloat until early 2009 .
White House press secretary Dana Perino termed the discussions " constructive " on Saturday but stopped short of declaring a final deal had been reached .
" We have had constructive discussions with members of Congress from both houses , and both sides of the aisle , " she said in a statement .
" We hope to continue to make progress toward assistance for the automakers based on important principles , " including use of the existing auto loan program and " very strong taxpayer protections . "
Late Friday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the White House were " near a deal , but not 100 % " on a plan to provide short - term funding for the Big Three auto makers , a senior congressional aide said .
White house spokesman Tony Fratto said the talks were " still fluid " but stressed officials were " making progress . "
Mormon Church - owned businesses should be boycotted .
Businesses owned by Mormons , who tithe to the Church , should also be boycotted .
Large amounts of Church income comes from tithings .
Vote with your wallets !
Every dollar less that you give to a tithed Mormon is a dollar less that can be tithed and spent on anti-gay activity .
Some businesses are more easily boycotted than others :
retail
discretionary travel
businesses with competitors
I recommend we boycott Marriott Hotels , owned by the Mormon Marriott family , and so devout that every Marriott hotel has a Book of Mormon in the drawer , along with a bible .
In today 's depressed travel market , there are plenty of competitors to Marriott and plenty of people can avoid it if they want .
Also boycott Doug Manchester 's hotels .
http://www.boycottmanchesterhotels.com/
Who else ?
Start a list here !
Wiki power .
Boycott list :
All Marriotts
Manchester Grand Hyatt , San Diego , CA http://www.boycottmanchesterhotels.com/
Grand del Mar Resort , San Diego , CA
Whitetail Club and Resort , McCall , Idaho
Franklin Templeton Investments
Prince Group [ what product do these people produce ? ]
Blackwater ( military subcontractors - OK
I know it 's hard for an average consumer to boycott this one ! )
The Polynesian Cultural Center , Honolulu , Hawaii
Hoehn Motors , Carlsbad , California
A - 1 Self Storage Company , San Diego , CA
Update 1 : Please rec this up so it becomes a more productive place for Kossacks to deploy their energies , instead of the black v. gay arguments .
Update 2 : Many Marriott branded hotels are owned by non-Mormons and split their revenues with Marriott Inc .
These should also be boycotted .
Their owners would then be encouraged to leave Marriott and affiliate with another chain instead .
Update 3 : Added Franklin Templeton , Blackwater and Prince Group based on http://news.muckety.com/...
Update 4 : See http://www.sfgate.com/... for donors to Prop 8 .
There are three Marriotts who donated to Prop 8 : Elizabeth D. Marriott ( $ 1000 ) , Woodrow Marriott MD ( $ 200 ) , and Christina Marriott ( $ 100 ) .
Anyone know if these are members of the same family that owns Marriott Inc . ?
Update 5 : At the request of commenters , I have refined the title of this diary .
We all know that the Mormon Church was a prime mover behind Prop 8 .
We should do what we can to vote with our wallets to make sure we do n't directly or indirectly contribute to the Mormon Church .
Update 6 : Utah .
Hard call for me .
Ski businesses - who owns them ?
Someone please help find out .
I am not calling for a boycott of all of Utah at this time .
But definitely boycott the Marriotts there .
Update 7 : If a Mormon pays tithings to his or her church , should we still boycott his or her business ?
Probably yes , unless he or she also makes a reasonable countervailing donation to LGBT causes .
Update 8 : The corollary is this - " let the mormon business step forward and say " do n't boycott me .
I do n't support the church 's stance .
I support equality " .
Bingo , you got my business back . "
[ Credit : lighttheway ]
I want a definitive statement that Marriott Inc. supports gay rights and opposes the Mormon Church 's stance on same - sex marriage .
Update 9 : here is a list of Mormons for Prop 8 : http://mormonsfor8.com/
Update 10 : List of additional Mormon - owned businesses .
Peruse at your leisure .

Of note : Polynesian Cultural Center in Honolulu is owned by the Mormon Church directly .

Update 11 : Added A - 1 Self Storage and Hoehn Motors from http://www.dailykos.com/...
George Bush , in a moment of reflection ahead of his departure from the White House , last night admitted that the decision to go to war against Saddam Hussein on the basis of flawed intelligence was the biggest regret of his presidency .
The acknowledgment marks the first time that Bush has publicly expressed doubts about his rationale for going to war on Iraq .
In the run-up to the war , the White House adopted a position of absolute certainty that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction , basing its arguments on intelligence that was later exposed as flimsy and wrong .
" The biggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq , " Bush told ABC television in an interview scheduled for broadcast last night .
" I wish the intelligence had been different , I guess . "
But he followed that moment of candour with an attempt to try to deflect charges that the White House misled Congress and the public to build a case for war , arguing that there had been widespread belief that Saddam had a nuclear arsenal .
" It was n't just people in my administration ; a lot of members in Congress , prior to my arrival in Washington DC , during the debate on Iraq , a lot of leaders of nations around the world , were all looking at the same intelligence . "
He was not asked about allegations that political pressure was brought to bear on the CIA and other intelligence agencies in the run-up to the war .
The exit interview found Bush in an unusually reflective mood for a president who has famously refused in the past to admit any mistakes .
He did not go so far as to say he would not have gone to war if the intelligence had been correct .
" That 's an interesting question .
That is a do - over that I can't do , " Bush said , according to excerpts from the interview at Camp David .
Later he said : " I will leave the presidency with my head held high . "
Despite the flawed basis for the invasion of Iraq , Bush defended his decision to leave US forces in the country .
Though Iraq remains among his defining legacies , he said he had not anticipated going to war when he was running for the White House .
" I was unprepared for war .
In other words , I did n't campaign and say , ' Please vote for me , I 'll be able to handle an attack ' .
I did n't anticipate war . "
The big question about Facebook is does it have any valuable commercial application ?
Well it seems that the courts have found one .
Today in what appears to be a first in Australia and perhaps the world , Master Harper of the ACT Supreme Court ordered that a default judgement could be served on defendants by notification on Facebook .
A default judgement is given by the court where the defendant does not appear in court to defend the case .
Once the plaintiff has been awarded the default judgement by the court , the plaintiff must then locate the defendant and serve the judgement on them .
Games , crosswords might reduce anxiety BERKELEY Challenging games like Sudoku or chess seem to help nervous folks focus
Could Sudoku be a balm for anxious people ?
A new study suggests that intellectually demanding challenges like crossword puzzles or chess may be more successful at keeping worry - prone people from worrying than supposedly relaxing pastimes like watching TV or shopping .
Contrary to theories that " as things get harder , anxious people fall apart , this suggests it 's the opposite way around , " said UC Berkeley psychologist Sonia Bishop , lead researcher on the study published online this week by Nature Neuroscience .
The study showed that anxious people performed just as well as others when facing tasks that demanded concentration , but they took more time than others to complete tasks that were easier , Bishop said .
Their slower response time to challenges not requiring full attention was accompanied by reduced blood flow to the prefrontal cortex , which serves as the brain 's CEO in thinking , planning and active memory .
The study indicated that anxious individuals have a weakened ability to block out distractions and that they might benefit from mindfulness training , which often uses meditation and stress - reduction exercises to help increase one 's awareness and focus .
" With some very popular therapies like mindfulness training , people are n't sure why they work , " Bishop said .
" This perhaps gives us a rationale for why they do . "
The results also challenge another explanation for why anxious people face day - to - day problems in concentration and work - related cognitive function , Bishop said .
It has been argued that the " fight or flight " response center of the brain , the amygdala , overreacts to threat - related stimuli in anxious people , thus playing a central role in undermining concentration .
But the new study suggests that attention - focusing ability in such individuals is impaired even when the amygdala is not extra-active , and thus their difficulties with concentration may be determined by a different mechanism , she said .
The study consisted of simple letter - recognition tests given to 17 volunteers , ages 19 to 48 , while blood flow to a section in the front of the brain called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was measured by magnetic resonance imaging .
The volunteers , seven female and 10 male , were from Cambridge , England , where Bishop did research at the University of Cambridge before becoming an assistant professor at Berkeley in July .
The results were scored according to the difficulty of the tests , including the distraction level of extraneous elements , and correlated to the volunteers ' degree of anxiety .
Surveys indicate that nearly a fifth of U.S. adults suffer from one or more anxiety disorders in a given year , Bishop noted in the study , titled " Trait anxiety and impoverished prefrontal control of attention . "
Цены на жилье в 2009 году упадут как минимум на 20 - 25 процентов .
Такое признание сделал вчера президен т Ассоциации строителей России ( АСР ) Николай Кошман .
До последнего времени строители упорно не желали признавать , что стоимость квартир в столичных городах неоправданно завышена .
Другие эксперты прогнозируют еще большее удешевление жилья - по крайней мере в столичных городах .
Строители сетуют : квартиры не покупаются , поскольку потенциальные покупатели ждут дальнейшего снижения цен либо вообще отложили приобретение нового жилья .
А банковские кредиты из - за высоких процентных ставок недоступны для застройщиков еще с начала года .
В результате стройкомпании вынуждены заморозить часть своих проектов .
Например , только в Москве сейчас остановлено до 80 процентов строек .
В регионах ситуация еще хуже .
Николай Кошман сообщил , что по итогам года будет введен 61 миллион жилых метров , что соответствует прошлогоднему результату .
Прирост нулевой .
Минрегион прогнозирует на 2009 год еще большее снижение - до 51 - 52 миллионов " квадратов " , то есть на 15 процентов .
По словам вице - президента АСР Владимира Пономарева , если в 2009 году еще будет возможность достроить то , что заморожено сейчас , то перспектива 2010 года и вовсе в тумане , так как никаких заделов под будущее строительство сегодня не делается .
Между тем цикл подготовки всей разрешительной документации и стартовых работ непосредственно на территории будущей стройки - это минимум год .
Вслед за строителями " потянуло " и производителей стройматериалов .
Цены на многие из них упали , на цемент , например , очень значительно .
Но он все равно не востребован .
Многие предприятия приостанавливают работу , отправляя сотрудников в отпуска или вовсе увольняя .
Главное в сценарии по спасению отрасли - это сохранить спрос на жилье .
" Нужно вспомнить о жилищно - строительных кооперативах , а также создавать жилищно - накопительные счета " , - говорит Владимир Пономарев .
К слову , многие компании на свой страх и риск сейчас пытаются вернуться к практике трех- , пятилетней давности , когда львиная доля жилья приобреталась по прямой договоренности застройщика и покупателя в рассрочку .
Что касается обещанной государством поддержки стройотрасли за счет выкупа готового жилья под выполнение соцпрограмм , глава АСР заметил , что неплохо было бы предусмотреть и дополнительные меры .
Например , девелоперам , строящим социальное жилье , дать отсрочку по земельному налогу .
Тем не менее строители , наконец , признали , что жилищный рынок в
Москве перегрет , и холодный душ кризиса не мог не привести к снижению стоимости квадратного метра .
Хотя еще два месяца назад ( когда продажи жилья уже встали ) бизнес настаивал на том , что никаких предпосылок для этого нет .
А тогдашний прогноз руководителя аналитического центр а IRN.RU Олега Репченко , который одним из первых заговорил о " жилищном пузыре " , подвергался со стороны участников рынка нещадной критике .
Теперь же остается лишь строить предположения , с какой скоростью и глубиной будет проседать рынок в дальнейшем .
И если Кошман вчера предположил об удешевлении метра на четверть , то другие эксперты не исключают большего падения .
Снижение цен в 2009 году на жилье в
Москве может оказаться сопоставимым с послекризисной ситуацией 1998 года .
Такой прогноз обнародован в аналитической записке центра макроэкономических исследований Сбербанка России .
В ней рассмотрено два вероятных сценария .
В базовом , более спокойном варианте в качестве исходных данных взят показатель прироста ВВП в 2009 году на уровн е
2,5 - 3,5 процента и соответствующего прироста доходов населения .
Инфляция предположительно составит около 11 процентов , курс рубля к доллару постепенно снизится до 30 рублей за доллар .
В этом случае снижение цен в
Москве составит 34,3 процента в рублях и 46,6 процента в валюте .
Если ВВП покажет рост не выше 2,5 процента в год , то и инфляция будет больше , и доходы населения сократятся , и рубль по отношению к доллару " просядет " сильнее .
По этому стрессовому сценарию долларовые цены на жилье уменьшатся более чем вдвое , а в рублях - на 38 процентов .
Правда , оговариваются авторы , обвал цен можно ожидать лишь в Москве .
В регионах , где строители работали с минимальной наценкой , разница столь резко падать не будет .
Прогноз в целом по России : от 5 до 12 процентов удешевления в рублях , в долларах - 25 - 40 процентов .
В Сбербанке предупреждают , что резкое удешевление недвижимости самым негативным образом отразится на ипотечном рынке .
Хотя он в России только начал развиваться ( составляет менее 10 процентов от объема ВВП ) , уменьшение стоимости залогов может привести к массовому пересмотру банками условий погашения выданных кредитов и росту числа заемщиков - банкротов .
Новые кредиты в крайне нестабильной и трудно прогнозируемой экономической ситуации тоже и выдавать , и получать слишком рискованно .
А потому тот спрос на жилье , о котором так мечтают строители , через ипотеку в 2009 году поддержать будет крайне сложно .

Orbitz : The Drink With Balls Today , I feel compelled to write about Orbitz , the relatively new drink from Canada .
For those of you who have never seen it , Orbitz is a disgusting fruity drink with little gelatin balls floating in it .
Yes , you read that right .
A major corporation , Clearly Canadian in this case , has actually released a drink that features little gelatin balls floating in it .
In short , it looks very much like a lava lamp , plus you can drink it .
Orbitz comes in such actual flavors as Orange - Vanilla , Raspberry - Citrus , Blueberry - Melon - Strawberry , and Pineapple - Banana - Cherry - Coconut .
I do n't know about the others , but I did try Orange - Vanilla Orbitz .
I even paid money for it .
You 're no doubt thinking , " Joe , how could you have possibly paid money for something that sounds so horrible ? "
Well , there 's a simple and plausible explanation .
I bought it merely as public service to help you , my readers , navigate through the often confusing world of beverages .
Also , I was somewhat drunk .
The odd looking bottle of Orbitz sat in my refrigerator for days , terrifying my roommates .
When I finally had the balls ( er , sorry ) to try it , it tasted like the sort of thing thirteen year old boys dare each other to drink in a school cafeteria .
And those balls only made it worse .
I mean , here 's this disgusting drink .
One can almost handle that , but oh those balls .
I caught one with my teeth and bit into it .
It was like biting into radioactive mucous Tang .
I do n't want to think about it anymore .
And I 'm not the only one who hates it .
I went to the Beverage Network in an attempt to learn more about Orbitz and because , frankly , I have too much free time on my hands .
Here 's their review of Raspberry Citrus Orbitz : Atrocious .
That sums it up .
This flavor tastes absolutely horrible .
In the words of James Craven , author of SuperFox , " It tastes like water that came out of a vase used for flowers .
. . . the balls make it even worse . "
The only difference is that Orbitz has sugar .
This beverage makes us sick .
But despite all the negative reviews , Clearly Canadian is surging forward and opening a new Orbitz factory in California .
It makes me feel rather inadequate to realize that while I 'm still a temp the person who had the presence of mind to invent a drink featuring round floaty chunks of something or another is no doubt still employed .
Hell , he or she probably got a promotion , and that 's what 's really confusing .
Think about it .
At some point during a board meeting at Clearly Canadian , the following exchange occurred : Person who thought to put Round Floaty Chunks in a drink : " Sir , would you like to hear our idea about a new drink with round floaty chunks in it , eh ? " Chairman of the Board : " Round Floaty Chunks !
Round Floaty Chunks !
That 's brilliant !
What this company needs are more ingenious people like you .
We 'll be rich .
Rich , I say . "
Would n't you know it ?
Orbitz has a web site .
As you enter their site , you are greeted with the words , " Set gravity aside and prepare to embark on a tour into the bowels of the Orbiterium . "
Now , I 'm no marketing expert , but somehow it seems a bad idea to use the word " bowels " at a web site dedicated to a drink this hideous .
As I indeed delved further into their bowels , I discovered a page of e-mail from people who had tried Orbitz .
Not only did they have pages for their " good " and " arcane " mail , but they also had a page dedicated to " bad " mail .
You have to wonder about these people .
First , they create Orbitz , and then they use their web site to display the opinions of people who hate the drink .
I started with the good mail .
After all , I had to know who actually likes the drink .
It seemed a bad omen for them when on this page of " good " mail , I came across the comment , " your drink is good but it feels like you are swallowing barf . "
And later on there was another ringing endorsement : " The orbitz in the drink were cool at first !
But it gave me and my dad a slight stomach discomfort !
But the drink was really good ! "
High praise indeed .
To be fair , there are apparently some big Orbitz fans out there .
One person wrote : I think that your drink is the best , it gives me a tingling feeling all over the mouth and the throat .
Your drink is the only thing that ever gave me this feeling before and I love ORBITZ .
A 12 year old named Buzz wrote : I drink Orbitz all the time .
It makes me happy and sugar high .
. . .
Some of my friends do n't like Orbitz because of the way it looks .
I love the way it looks because it looks like a lava lamp .
I also have a lava lamp .
And perhaps the most cogent comment of all was : " Very trippy .
Whatever you guys are on , I want some . "
Next , I checked out the hate mail , which included comments such as :
The little squishy balls represent disgust in its purest form .
Sucking them through my teeth , waves of nausea racked my body for several hours following .
Your product sucks and thousands of people will probably do as we did and spit it in the sink !
Why does your drink make people sick if they drink it while riding a bike or doing something like that ?
I still do n't get it .
Perhaps I 'm just not hip enough .
I almost think they want people to know the drink is bad .
Maybe they are specifically targeting the " Here , this tastes horrible .
Try it . " market .
We all have an inherent curiosity to taste disgusting things , because we think " they could n't possibly be that bad . "
Orbitz , however is .
Unless you 're the type of person who has ever stared into a lava lamp and thought , " Well , gosh , I 'd sure like to take a swig of that , " my advice is to avoid Orbitz completely .
You 'll thank me later .

And sorry , I have no idea where you can buy some .

As House leaders unveiled legislation for an unprecedented $ 825 billion economic stimulus , UC Berkeley economist Christina Romer said she never dreamed that her scholarship on the Great Depression would be useful in formulating current economic policy .
But giving her strong endorsement to the history - making package , Romer , President - elect Barack Obama 's nominee to be head of his Council of Economic Advisers , said at her Senate confirmation hearing Thursday that her chief task will be to " ensure that the tragedy of the 1930s is not repeated . "
The stimulus package , consisting of $ 550 billion in new federal spending and $ 275 billion in tax cuts over two years , was developed by congressional Democrats in coordination with Obama transition officials .
Republicans complained they were shut out of the process despite personal promises from Obama that their ideas were welcome .
The stimulus plan is a veritable dream list of projects that Democrats , and some Republicans , feel have been delayed too long .
Democratic leaders cast the package as immediate relief to struggling families and the start of a longer - term investment in building a " 21st century economy . "
Obama said the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan will save or create more than 3 million jobs " and make America strong and competitive in the 21st century . "
He described the plan as a " significant down payment on our most urgent challenges " and promised " it will contain the kind of strict , independent oversight that will allow the American people to hold Washington accountable for how and where their tax dollars are spent . "
Romer , a renowned macroeconomist whose confirmation is expected to fly through the Senate as early as next week , was joined by her husband , David , also a Berkeley economist , her father and her youngest son , Matthew , 12 .
She endorsed the tax cuts , which are expected to lure GOP support , as well as the huge increase in government spending .
Such an enormous fiscal stimulus " was not really tried " during the Great Depression , despite conventional wisdom surrounding President Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal , mainly because states simultaneously cut their spending , Romer said .
In addition , President Herbert Hoover had raised taxes in a mistaken effort to keep the budget in balance .
Romer said the new spending , which polls find enjoys overwhelming public support , will be aimed not just at short - term job creation but also at public investments in infrastructure , education and other areas to improve U.S. competitiveness .
" If we have to spend all this money , let 's make sure we get the long - term dividends , " she said .
She also warned the Banking Committee that the $ 350 billion second installment of the deeply unpopular $ 700 billion bank rescue was vital to keeping the financial system functioning .
In recent days , Bank of America and other large institutions indicated they will need more capital injections .
" The connection of the financial system and the economy is crucial , " Romer said .
" If we let the financial system go under , it wo n't just be a catastrophe for Wall Street , it will be a catastrophe for every one of us . "
Democrats have the stimulus plan on a fast track for Obama 's signature by mid-February .
Billions would go to beleaguered states such as California to prevent cuts in state spending .
Each worker would get a $ 500 tax credit ; $ 39 billion would go to subsidize health care insurance for unemployed workers .
More billions would go to education , science and research and expanded broadband Internet access .
More than $ 30 billion would be spent to upgrade the nation 's electric grid to ease transmission of wind , solar and other alternative power .
A welter of tax credits is aimed at spurring alternative energy production and conservation .
Another $ 20 billion would be spent computerizing medical records .
Democrats insisted there would be no earmarks for members ' pet projects of the type that proliferated by the tens of thousands when Republicans controlled Congress and the White House .
Obama has repeatedly promised that every line of spending will be completely transparent .
" Oh , my God , " said House Republican leader John Boehner , R - Ohio .
" It appears my Democratic colleagues think they can borrow and spend their way back to prosperity . "
Conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation and conservative budget watchdog groups immediately attacked the plan as a boondoggle and will attack it piece by piece in the coming weeks .
But other groups , which are seeing federal dollars flow to areas they said have languished during the Bush administration , were jubilant .
" These proposed investments in research , in students and in infrastructure will not only create jobs right away but also jump - start the nation 's effort to produce more of the people , ideas and technologies that will help build a foundation for energy security , a cleaner environment and ultimately a sustainable prosperity , " said Robert Berdahl , president of the Association of American Universities .
Technology industry groups similarly lavished praise on the effort .
Silicon Valley has bet heavily on green energy as the next advance in technology but , with the collapse in oil prices , needs government aid to keep such projects alive .
For House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco , the giant stimulus package is the first step into Democratic rule in Washington and a showcase for ideas she and others have seen thwarted during the last decade and a half of GOP control of the White House or Congress .
" It is pretty exciting , " Pelosi said .
The stimulus carries political and economic risks .
It may not work , and comes as U.S. debt levels are rising rapidly .
With trade and the entire global economy in a sharp downturn , and many governments spending heavily on their own stimulus efforts , borrowing may become more difficult .

Vice President Dick Cheney has a parting message for Americans :
They should quit whining about all the things he and President Bush did to undermine the rule of law , erode the balance of powers between the White House and Congress , abuse prisoners and spy illegally on Americans .
After all , he said , Franklin Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln did worse than that .
So Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush managed to stop short of repeating two of the most outrageous abuses of power in American history 
Roosevelt ’s decision to force Japanese - Americans into camps and Lincoln ’s declaration of martial law to silence his critics ?
That ’s not exactly a lofty standard of behavior .
Then again , it must be exhausting to rewrite history as much as Mr. Cheney has done in a series of exit interviews where he has made those comments .
It seems as if everything went just great in the Bush years .
The invasion of Iraq was exactly the right thing to do , not an unnecessary war that required misleading Americans .
The postinvasion period was not bungled to the point where Americans got shot up by an insurgency that the Bush team failed to see building .
World 's first flying car on the roads from next year - yours for just £ 130,000
It 's been a pipe dream for 30 years but now the world 's first fully available flying car is set to hit the roads next year .
Ever since the Back to the Future movies lit up our screens in the 80s , designers have dreamt of an automobile that could take to the skies at the push of a button .
And now qualified pilots can order their very own Terrafugia Transition ' roadable ' plane for just £ 127,000 , with delivery planned for late next year .
The Terrafugia Transition ' roadable ' plane can be kept at home , with wings folded up , in your garage
The ' light - sport airplane ' promises to bring more ' flexibility and convenience to your flying ' .
The plane , which has fold - out wings that span 27.5 ft when extended , has an airborne range of 460 miles and can cruise at 115 mph .
Back on terra firma , it is capable of travelling at ' highway speeds ' in car mode .
Fuelling the 19ft long plane could n't be simpler - you just drive it into a petrol station and fill it up with unleaded .
It is powered by a 100 hp , Rotax 912S , four - stroke engine .
Action !
The 19 - foot - long plane has an airborne range of 460 miles and can cruise at 115mph
A spokeswoman for designers Terrafugia , based in Woburn , Massachusetts , USA , said : ‘ You can keep your Transition in your garage .
‘ Then you simply drive to your local airport , fly up to 460 miles , land , convert and drive directly to your destination .
‘ You 'll always be ready to drive or fly . ’
A series of simple commands made from the cockpit convert the white craft from plane to car and vice versa .
But the wings only fold out if the correct key code is entered by someone with a pilot 's licence .
Simple : The ' roadable ' plane can be filled up at the local petrol station with unleaded
Unlike many ' flying car ' concepts which use thrusters to take off vertically , the Transition needs a short runway to take to the air .
The spokeswoman added : ‘ Never let questionable weather cancel or endanger your trip again .
‘ You can simply divert and continue on the ground until the weather clears . ’
You can secure your very own Transition aeroplane by simply paying a deposit of £ 6,500 .
Ease : Pilots will be able to drive to the local airport , take off and then fly for up to 460 miles ( 740 km )
The firm 's website , ' Terrafugia.com ' , says of prospective owners : ‘ Your deposit does n't just reserve your very own roadable airplane , it gives us proof that today 's pilot community is ready for this dream to finally become reality .
‘ There 's no risk to you - only the chance to be the first at your home field to unfold your wings and fly into the future .
‘ Production schedules are filling up quickly . ’
Concerned that many would - be contributors to Wikipedia are being scared away , the foundation that runs the internet encyclopedia is getting a US $ 890,000 grant to try to make the editing process more user - friendly .
Anyone can contribute to Wikipedia , but clicking on the " edit " button brings up a jumble of coding mixed with plain English paragraphs .
There are buttons on the top of the page that eliminate any need for users to write their own code , but the Wikimedia Foundation has acknowledged for several years that the unfamiliar feel of the editing process probably turns off people who could otherwise make valuable contributions .

" Wikipedia attracts writers who have a moderate - to - high level of technical understanding , but it excludes lots of smart , knowledgeable people who are less tech - centric , " Sue Gardner , the Wikimedia Foundation 's executive director , said in a statement .
The foundation has snared an $ 890,000 grant from the Stanton Foundation for the project and plans to assemble a five - person team to identify what exactly is turning some users off .
In particular , the foundation said it will look at hiding more technical elements of the site that contributors do n't necessarily need to see .

You want to roast your own beans .
There now , does n’t that feel better ?
It ’s not a crazy idea .
Green beans are far less expensive than those roasted ahead of time and can be safely stored for up to two years without loss of flavor .
By roasting your own you also know you ’re getting the freshest possible cup of coffee .
As far as the flavor of your coffee , well that depends a lot on you .
If you favor the light roasts you will find it very difficult to approximate their flavors using the pan method .
If you favor the darker styles , you stand a good chance of success simply by using a common skillet .
Pan roasting coffee .
Want to get started ?
Okay , start by selecting from the hundreds of green beans that are available on the Internet .
Then take a common skillet and place it on a burner set to high .
You need a temperature of approximately 500 F to roast coffee .
When the skillet has heated sufficiently , pour the beans in and begin shaking .
This is the first key – never let the beans come to rest on the pan surface .
If you do they will burn .
As you shake you will begin to notice the beans changing color , from an olive green to a yellow - green hue .
The second key is wrist strength : you will have to keep the beans moving in the skillet for at least six , up to approximately nine minutes , and perhaps much longer ( depending on the roast style you prefer ) .
If you can keep the pan shaking at the 6 - 9 minute mark you will hear the beans begin to pop .
This is what the roasters call “ First Crack ” .
Once this crackling stops the beans should have turned a light , golden brown and you may stop .
If you do you have what many call a New England Roast .
If you ’re experimenting go ahead and stop and , when they ’ve cooled , grind these fresh roasted beans and sample the results .
Be exact .
Precisely measure the amount of ground coffee and water you use , and then take notes on the flavors you perceive in the cup .
If you know you want a darker roast when that first crackling stops keep shaking .
The longer you go the easier it is to burn the beans so shake it baby , shake it .
The beans will be getting darker and darker and at some point you will hear the “ Second Crack ” .
Get ready now , when the crackling stops this time you will be at what is called “ Full City Roast ” .
There was a time when the ‘ chore ’ of roasting coffee was replaced by the ubiquitous can .
In a world where clothes were still scrubbed by hand , anything that lessened the labors of life was seen as an improvement .
But today we have the luxury to choose to make our own pasta , or bake our own bread , or roast our own coffee .
Today we realize that though it is often a lot of work , it is well worth the effort to revisit the days of the home - grown , the hand - made , the home - roasted .
Authorities at Super Bowl XLIII will be looking for more than just drunken fans .
They 'll be watching spectators ' body language , facial expressions and demeanor to find suspicious people .
For the first time Sunday , federal behavior - detection officers will team with local police to use a controversial technique on people heading to a major event , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) says .
The officers usually work in airports .
Behavior observation aims to find people in crowds acting unusually .
A flagged person gets a casual interview from an officer who determines if he or she should be formally questioned or arrested .
At the Tampa Police request , the TSA is sending dozens of its behavior officers to Tampa to watch spectators entering 75,000 - seat Raymond James Stadium on Sunday , said Tampa Police spokeswoman Laura McElroy .
The TSA on Jan. 13 gave a four - hour training overview on behavior detection to 100 Tampa - area police , TSA operations chief Lee Kair said .
" They 'll be a dedicated set of eyes looking for suspicious behavior , " McElroy said of TSA officers .
The American Civil Liberties Union says that the technique is unproven and that its use at a stadium sets an alarming precedent for police inquiries .
" Police should n't be stopping and questioning people unless they have some credible reason to suspect them .
Behavior detection is just too vague , " ACLU analyst Barry Steinhardt said .
He noted sarcastically , " If we 're going to use this at high - profile sporting events , why not start using it on streets ? "
Behavior observation is used daily by 2,600 specially trained TSA officers at more than 160 airports .
Officers look for obvious signs of nervousness or other behavioral flags , such as sweating , avoiding eye contact or talking evasively .
Police want to guard against an attacker such as the man who drove to last year 's Super Bowl site near Phoenix with an automatic rifle intending to open fire , McElroy said .
The man , Kurt William Havelock , apparently changed his mind in the stadium parking lot and turned himself in .
He was sentenced in October to a year in prison for making threats .
The TSA officers , who get seven days of training , will take the lead in spotting suspicious spectators , while their police partners will do the questioning , McElroy said .
Police around the USA are asking for the TSA training , Kair said .
Breast cancer cells like this one could be wiped out by the immune system , thanks to a new way to direct immune cells to attack a particular target ( Image : NCI / Phanie / Rex Features )
Implants that sit in the body and reprogram a person ’s immune cells could be used to treat a range of infectious diseases and even cancer .
In a trial on mice with an aggressive melanoma that usually kills within 25 days , the new treatment saved 90 % of the group .
Because cancer cells originate within the body , the immune system usually leaves them alone .
Therapies exist that involve removing immune cells from the body before priming them to attack malignant tissue and injecting them back into a patient .
Results are not encouraging , though – more than 90 % of re-injected cells die before they can have any effect , says David Mooney of Harvard University .
Advertisement
Mooney and colleagues have now developed a technique that directs the immune system from within the body – a method that is more efficient and potentially cheaper too .
Search and destroy
Their breakthrough involves implanting cylinders of an FDA - approved biodegradable polymer into the body .
The implants release a particular variety of the cell - signalling molecules called cytokines – a sort of molecular perfume that is irresistible to a certain kind of immune - system messenger cell .
These dendritic cells are attracted into the pores of Mooney ’s implant , where they are exposed to antigens – the molecular signatures of the cancer , bacterium or virus being treated – and a danger - signal chemical derived from bacterial DNA .
This alert signal makes the dendritic cells flee to the nearest lymph node , where they meet up with the immune system ’s “ killer ” T - cells and program them to hunt down the invading cells .
Strength in numbers
In tests , the researchers implanted cylinders with a diameter of 8.5 millimetres into mice and two weeks later injected the animals with highly aggressive melanoma cells .
Mice implanted with ‘ blanks ’ – cylinders lacking any chemical additives – developed large tumours within 18 days and had to be euthanised .
However , 90 % of the mice given the full treatment were cured .
“ There have not been any reports of the traditional [ external ] dendritic cell activation having survival rates at the levels we find with our materials for the cancer model we used , ” says Mooney .
He suspects this is because the implants can recruit and activate very large numbers of dendritic cells .
“ It is a continuous process – dendritic cells are attracted to the device , take up the [ cancer ] antigen and [ the warning signal ] … and then they can leave , ” says Mooney .
“ New cells are continuously arriving while activated cells are leaving . ”
The team thinks modified versions of the material could be effective against a range of cancers and infectious diseases .
These might also help reprogram the immune system to combat autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes , caused by immune cells destroying insulin - producing cells in the pancreas .

‘ Batman : Battle For The Cowl ’ : Who Will Take Up The Mantle ?
By Totally Bitchin’ ( aka Eric Drumm )
Who is going inherit the Bat mantle ?
With Batman RIP heading towards its dramatic ( and long awaited for some ! ) conclusion , Bruce Wayne may be going bye bye .
Is he gonna die ?
Is he gonna retire ?
Will he descend into madness , never to be heard from again ?
Grant Morrison knows , but he ainâ€™t telling .
With all controversy going around , arenâ€™t we forgetting one major dilemma ?
With the Bat mantle vacated , who is going to step up and take control of Gotham ?
Following Batman RIP is the much hushed “ Battle For the Cowlâ€ arc .
The title suggests that there is a slugfest on the horizon between the Bat boys to see who gets the cape .
Who can even pretend they are qualified to replace the Dark Knight ?
A few are real contenders , but there are a few underdogs that could potentially take the title .
Here are a few of the folks we think just might take it .
But donâ€™t listen to us !
Sound off with your own theories in the comments !
Dick Grayson / Nightwing
The crimefighter and notorious ladies man is the most obvious choice to take up the mantle .
Dick Grayson has been knocking out wise guys since he was a pre-teen , taking direction from the Dark Knight himself .
Since he traded in the pixie boots for the Nightwing disco collar , Dick has been fighting to make a name for himself outside his Bat - past almost as hard as he fights bad guys .
Nearly to the point of having a chip on his shoulder about it , Dick will have words with anyone who doesnâ€™t think that he is his own man .
He hates being associated with his â€œdad , â€ and this potentially poses a problem .
After all this time , why would he go back on everything he has tried to build for himself ?
It took quite a bit of coaxing to get Dick into the cowl during â€ œProdigal .â€ 
With all the self doubt and whining about the hero life going on in his own title , is Nightwing even stable enough to be Batman ?
Not to mention that he is currently drooling on himself in a stupor in Arkham , so that doesnâ€™t help much either .
However , knowing Dick , his undying sense of responsibility may lure him into the Cave .
Tim Drake / Robin
By far the most capable of all the Robins , Tim â€ œTim Wayneâ€ 
Drake has the same problem that his â€œbig brotherâ€ 
Nightwing suffers from — crippling self doubt .
Tim figured out who Batman was , went on an international adventure , almost banged Lady Shiva , and fought the Joker all within a few weeks of becoming the third Robin .
Not bad for a skinny 14 - year - old .
Robin isnâ€™t taking this whole Batman RIP thing too well .
Forced to protect Gotham on his own , he is in way over his head .
As a result , his thinking doesnâ€™t exactly speak â€ œIâ€™m awesome !â€ 
In fact , he is lower than he has been in a while .
Keep in mind this is the kid who lost his girlfriend , his only parent , and his best friend all at the same time , and still soldiered on .
Tim may not think he is ready for it , but even Batman has been quoted that Tim can do just about anything , so he may be able to pull it off .
The costume wonâ€™t fit , but Alfred can help with that .
â€ œTitans Tomorrowâ€ showed us a pistol packing Bat - Tim 10 years in the future , so itâ€™s not impossible .
Jason Todd
Think what you like about olâ€™ JT , but heâ€™s back .
So the rest of us will just have to get used to it .
Leaving a mountain of dead criminals in his wake , Jason killed the hell out of lot of dudes as the Red Hood , much to Batmanâ €™s dismay .
Back from his adventure in the Multiverse ( yeah , we know ) , Jasonâ€™s schedule is pretty open these days .
He is currently organizing a gang war in the pages of ROBIN , but perhaps his plan is to sit on the underworld throne with a cape on .
Despite his fleeting moments of redemption , Jason Todd is a smarmy violent jerk ( and this is coming from someone that likes him ! ) .
Impulsive , murderous and recklessly irresponsible , Jason seems the least likely to take the title .
However , Jasonâ€™s lack of morals may be his biggest strength in the battle for the cowl .
Dick and Tim have rules they have to follow as do - gooders , Jason doesnâ€™t .
He can literally do whatever it takes to be Batman , included dusting anyone that gets in his way .
Thatâ€™s a very scary thought , but its one that could come true .
The internet may explode with fan outcry if it comes to pass , but this is also the guy who was voted to die and then miraculously and ridiculously came back .
So there ya go .
Tommy Elliot / Hush
This fella HATES Batman .
Forget the Joker or Raâ€™s Al Ghul , Hush hates him with every cell in his body .
He has nearly destroyed him a few times , but what if Batman really disappeared ?
What of Hush then ?
Would Hush even know what to do with himself if his nemesis suddenly kicked ?
Becoming what you hate the most and perverting it into something evil sounds like the perfect revenge , donâ€™t it ?
Hush is more than a little cold blooded , so metaphorically peeing on the Dark Knightâ€™s grave makes a lot of sense .
The rest of the Bat family will probably take issue with this , the Bat - boys VS Hush could be the main event of â€ œBattle For the Cowl.â€ 
Damien Wayne
The â€œsonâ€ of the Bat has been a first class a - hole since he showed up .
Arrogant , snobbish and most of all murderous , lilâ€ ™ Bats has already spilled enough blood and insults to wear out his welcome .
With his actual parentage still in question , Damien could be just another ruse in a larger scheme to bring down Batman .
However , the little bugger has had a few moments where he genuinely seemed like he wanted to follow his fatherâ€™s path .
If the kid can learn to play well with others and quit killing people , he just might make it .
One small hurtle , though â€ “ he is only 10 !
BATMAN #666 told us that Damien does in fact take over for Bruce Wayne in the future , but was there an interim Bat ?
As â€ œBatman RIPâ€ wraps up , itâ€™s certain that there will be lots of questions .
But what happens to the cape and cowl is up in the air .
Will the man ( or woman , or boy ) behind the mask be the best choice are will it be an Azbats level crisis ?
Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy – Benjamin Franklin
Beer gets a bad rap .
It ’s blamed for so much of society ’s ills , when it should be celebrated as one of the finest beverages created .
There are a number of persistent myths and urban legends about beer that are passed around that unfairly distort the facts and confuse beer drinkers .
At LegendsOfBeer.com , we ’d like to set the record straight and explode 12 of the most common beer myths , for once and for all .
So take a read of these myths and the truth behind them and start spreading the good beer news !

Myth # 1 : The Guinness served in Ireland is different to the rest of the world
Actually , the Guinness served in Ireland is most likely the same as that served in Boston or Berlin .
However , many people will attest that Guinness simply tastes better in Ireland , which is why the myth spread .
There ’s a certain amount of sentimentality in this myth , but when you dig into it , most of the reasoning is pretty circumstantial .
There are a few reasons why it may taste better in Ireland – most likely freshness and rapid keg turnover ( a pub in Dublin will serve the freshest Guinness in the world ) – but the actual product is not any different to the black stuff served around the world .
Also , a Guinness drinker in Ireland is guaranteed to have their drink poured correctly in Ireland than in some parts of the world , which will have an impact on the quality of the experience .
Myth # 2 : Lite beers will help you lose weight
On average , a lite beer will have 90 - 100 calories , while a regular beer might have under 200 .
In the grand scheme of things , lite beers will contribute very little to your dietary goals , and considering their typical lack of taste , you ’d be better off drinking one or two regular beers .
Myth # 3 : Dark beers are stronger in alcohol
The color of beer has no relation to its alcohol content .
For example , Guinness , one of the most popular dark beers has an alcohol volume of 4.2 % , while several light - colored Belgian beers have alcohol content of 8 % +.
Myth # 4 : Corona beer contains urine
This was a nasty rumor claiming that Mexican brewery workers were relieving themselves into the beer .
Allegedly , the rumor was spread by a Heineken distributor and was only refuted following a lawsuit by Corona .
Myth # 5 : Imported beers are stronger than American beers
Traditionally , American beers measure their alcohol content by weight , while many other countries ( across Europe and in Canada ) measure by volume .
The alcohol by weight figure will always appear lower than the alcohol by volume – for example , 4 % ABW = 5 % ABV , hence the myth creation .
Myth # 6 : Beer should be served ice - cold for best flavor
This is an unfortunate myth perpetuated by the major commercial breweries – especially for their lite beers .
The fact is , flavor typically diminishes when beer is served ice - cold .
It may make for a thirst - quenching , refreshing beverage , but often bears little resemblance to traditional beer .
Several beers are , in fact , best served much closer to room temperature or slightly cool and are considered undrinkable when icy cold – such as Guinness and many of the traditional English ales .
Myth # 7 : The best beers have green bottles
Another myth that circulated imported beers .
Brown glass is the best color to protect beer from light , which is why most beers are bottled with it .
A shortage of brown glass in Europe during the last century led to many breweries using green glass to bottle their beer – therefore , green bottles represented imported beer for many years and people incorrectly assumed the color indicated a better beer .
Myth # 8 : “ Beer before liquor , never sicker – liquor before beer , in the clear ”
This is common drinking advice shared but not scientifically true .
In reality , alcohol is alcohol , and the overall quantity you imbibe will determine your resulting ( in ) sobriety or hangover .
Drinking beer before drinking hard liquor may prolong the onset of inebriation .
However , it wo n’t ultimately matter whether you drink beer first or last ; it ’s the quantity of alcohol that does the damage .
Myth # 9 : You ca n’t get a hangover from drinking organic beer
If only being eco-friendly was this rewarding !
This myth is based on the idea that organic beer is cleaner or purer than other beer , but there ’s no existing proof that it manages to avoid giving hangovers when consumed in sufficient quantities .
Myth # 10 : Beer will raise your cholesterol levels
Beer actually contains no fat and no cholesterol !
Perhaps this is one reason that Guinness was originally advertised as good for your health .
Myth # 11 : A good beer must be high in alcohol
Many people unfairly associate low alcohol with low flavor .
There are plenty of poor quality beers that are high in alcohol content , and the opposite is also true .
Some of the famous Belgian and German beers have traditionally high average alcohol content – perhaps 8 % or 10 % .
However , the alcohol content is only one feature and does n’t necessarily account for the good taste .
In England , many of the best mild ales have alcohol content of 4 % or less – resulting from a higher tax on stronger beer .
Of course , the advantage is finding good - tasting , lower alcohol beers is that you can drink more of it !
Myth # 12 : Beer kills brain cells
Possibly the most damning of all beer myths , and we ’re happy to explode this for you .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The job toll continued Tuesday , as Sony Corp. and five other companies announced cuts totaling nearly 15,000 positions .
Sony , Danaher Corp. , Wyndham Worldwide , the National Football League and Principal Financial Group announced job cuts totaling about 14,400 positions .
In addition , Novellus Systems said it was cutting 10 % of its global work force without specifying a number of employees , but the company had a headcount of 3,678 staffers on Dec. 12 , 2007 .
Sony ( SNE ) , based in Tokyo , on Tuesday announced the most sweeping job - cutting plan of the three companies .
Sony said it planned to " reduce headcount " in its electronics business by 8,000 jobs by March 30 , 2010 .
The cuts will be implemented worldwide , the company said , from a total workforce of 160,000 , according to a Sept. 30 headcount .
Sony , which produces a wide variety of consumer electronics , blamed " the acute downturn in the economic climate " for the job cuts .
The company also said it was reducing its seasonal and temporary staff .
The Wyndham Hotel Group ( WYN ) , based in Parsippany , N.J.. , said late Monday it would " eliminate " about 4,000 positions through the first quarter of 2009 .
Wyndham 's hotels include Ramada , Days Inn and Super 8 chains .
Danaher Corp ( DHR , Fortune 500 ) . , a manufacturer based in Washington , said late Monday that it was " eliminating " about 1,700 jobs and 13 facilities in the fourth quarter , to save about $ 100 million in 2009 .
The company blamed the " current economic backdrop . "
Danaher makes tools , sensors and medical equipment .
Novellus ( NVLS ) , a provider of equipment for the semiconductor industry , said on Tuesday that it was cutting one - tenth of its work force " through a combination of attrition and layoffs . "
The company , based in San Jose , Calif. , said the reductions would occur through Jan. 31 , 2009 .
The NFL said on Tuesday that it planned to reduce its staff by about 150 employees over the next 60 days .
The company employs 1,100 workers in its league headquarters in New York City , NFL Films facilities in Mt. Laurel , N.J. , and its Los Angeles facilities houses NFL Network and NFL.com .

He said the NFL would " emerge strong , more efficient " as a result of cuts .
Principal Financial Group ( PFG , Fortune 500 ) said it is eliminating about 550 positions .
This includes 300 jobs at its Des Moines , Iowa , headquarters and 250 jobs in 45 other locations , the company , equating 3.5 % of its total workforce .
" Since September , when market conditions worsened , we have been continuously reviewing expenses and expected revenues , " said Mary O'Keefe , senior vice president of Principal Financial , in a prepared statement .
" In order to bring expenses more in line with projected revenues , we have already cut many expenses .
Unfortunately , this must include eliminating some jobs . "
Job cuts have been mounting all year .
According to the Labor Department , the U.S. economy hemorrhaged 533,000 jobs in November , the largest monthly loss in 34 years .
Through November , the economy lost of total of 1.9 million jobs , the government said , raising the unemployment rate to 6.7 % .
The December of our discontent
This does not include December 's brutal onslaught of job eliminations , totaling around 50,000 so far .
Just in one day - Dec. 4 - 11 companies announced a total of about 25,000 job cuts .
Nearly half of that tally comes from one company : Dallas - based telecom AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) .
Also on that day , Credit Suisse Group ( CS ) announced 5,300 cuts and DuPont ( DD , Fortune 500 ) reported 2,500 .
Also in December , Washington Mutual said it was cutting 7,600 jobs , U.S. Steel said it was cutting 3,500 and State Street Corp . ( STT , Fortune 500 ) announced plans to eliminate 1,800 .

Going forward , the Labor Department is scheduled to release its weekly report on initial jobless claims on Thursday .
The government is expected to announce 525,000 total jobless claims for the week ended Dec. 6 , according to a consensus of economists compiled by Briefing.com .
A small start - up Web zine , The Art of Manliness wanted readers to know that they were not looking for girly men .
Sponsored by Old Spice , the venerable line of men ’s shaving and hygiene products , the zine solicited nominations from readers for its first annual Man of the Year , to honor men who “ epitomize the manliness that used to exist before the arrival of metrosexual pretty boys . ”
They were looking for “ men like Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill .
Men like your grandpa , ” who “ understood things like hard work , responsibility , and looking out for others .
They lived by a code of honor and respect for others . ”
Winner Matthew Chancey , a marketing and communications consultant from Ashville , Alabama — an up - and - coming Republican politician — topped a field of ten finalists with thirty percent of the vote ( 3038 votes ) .
He is now honored as one who knows “ what it means to be a man , ” which includes a $ 2,000 prize “ and a manly stash of Old Spice products . ”
“ It was not possible , ” according to the contest rules , “ or even desirable to quiz each candidate about their political , religious , and social views . ”
But as it happens , it was precisely those views that led to his win .
The Manly Theocrat
Matthew Chancey is an aspiring religious right politician who hails from some of the most unusual and archaic precincts of modern American religious , political , and social life .
These precincts apparently turned out for him during a “ get out the vote ” campaign in the 48 hours before the contest deadline .
Key to Chancey ’s victory were the efforts of both his wife , who nominated him , and an entrepreneur named Doug Phillips , an important figure in the homeschooling movement , and his large family and network of supporters .
Phillips is an old pal of Chancey ’s and a religious and political co-belligerent from their days on the staff of the Home School Legal Defense Association ; he heads a Texas - based organization called Vision Forum , which produces and markets books and other materials for conservative Christian homeschoolers .
But to describe Vision Forum as ‘ conservative ’ does not tell the half of it .
Phillips is a follower of Christian Reconstructionism , a movement whose seminal figure is Calvinist theologian R.J. Rushdoony , who died in 2001 .
Rushdoony ’s voluminous , and explicitly theocratic work , ( such as the Institutes of Biblical Law ) was a pivotal influence in the development of the religious right , and more particularly , the countercultural homeschooling and Christian school movements .
Vision Forum ’s product line includes the Beautiful Girlhood Collection , which , “ aspires , by the grace of God , to encourage the rebuilding of a culture of virtuous womanhood .
In a world that frowns on femininity , that minimizes motherhood , and that belittles the beauty of being a true woman of God , we dare to believe that the biblical vision for girlhood is a glorious vision . ”
Phillips is also the publisher of Matthew Chancey ’s wife Jennie ’s latest title , Passionate Housewives Desperate for God , a book that asks the question : “ Do you wrestle with cultural messages that demean the homemaker ’s calling and exalt instead the emotionally androgynous power - woman ? ” Mrs. Chancey is a popular speaker on matters of wifely submission and “ faithful ” daughterhood ( namely , eschewing college to stay under a father ’s protection until marriage ) .
And then there is Vision Forum ’s “ All - American Boy ’s Adventure Catalog . ”
“ I knew my husband was a real man from the start , ” Jennifer Chancey wrote in the her nominating essay , noting that he wore “ impeccable three - piece suits and natty ties at age 19 . ”
Her essay , which mentions his humanitarian work in Sudan ( Christian missionary and relief work , carried out in consort with Phillips ’ brother , Brad ) , is illustrated with a photo of Matthew dressed like a Texas gentleman rancher , holding a long unlit cigar , and inexplicably accompanied by two armed Sudanese “ freedom fighters ” in military garb .
“ The photo was taken , ” Jennifer writes , “ in the upper Nile .
My husband , cool as a cucumber in the 120 - degree heat , demonstrates that it is possible to be well - dressed even in the far reaches of Africa . ”
RD contributor Kathryn Joyce , author of the forthcoming Quiverfull : Inside the Christian Patriarchy Movement ( Beacon Press , March 2009 ) , calls it “ pretty savvy marketing ” in our e-mail interview :
One of Vision Forum ’s strongest suits is in finding and developing charismatic and photogenic representatives of the lifestyle they promote .
To this end , VF creates a beautiful glossy catalogue populated with high quality photographs of [ the ]
Phillips children and friends in romantic historic costumes and settings : Jamestown , the Massachusetts Bay Colonies , and the Wild West .
In these images , and generally in the literature and stories of Vision Forum , gender roles are greatly exaggerated and glamorized .
The featured women are often attractive in a somewhat fragile , old - fashioned way , and the men are depicted ( and dressed up ) as adventuring heroes .
Chancey ’s dashing image as a gentleman looking comfortably at home in a dangerous and faraway land fits the image — as does Jennifer ( with help from friends and family ) boosting her husband ’s Art of Manliness - Man of the Year campaign on her Web site Ladies against Feminism and on various homeschooling blogs .
Doing Demographic Battle with Nonbelievers
When Doug Phillips blogged Chancey ’s award campaign in the final 48 hours — he noted the large families of various other campaigners .
Matt and Jennifer Chancey themselves have eight children .
So far .
According to Joyce , this fact is at the heart of the story :
[ The ] Phillips , the Chanceys , and nearly the entire Vision Forum roster of authors and authorities are among the staunchest promoters of the Quiverfull conviction and the patriarchy lifestyle , both of which hold that Christian couples should have as many children as God gives them , forgoing any form of family planning , as both a demonstration of their obedience and trust in God and as a militant method of demographic battle with nonbelievers .
This archaic term , which suggests a quiver full of arrows , is in surprisingly common use in a wide subset of conservative Christianity — often the same people who populate the Christian homeschooling movement :
“ Quiverfull , ” Joyce explains , “ envisions children as weapons of the righteous that can help take dominion of the world for Christ , and , practically speaking , they hope will give them a majority vote that will enable them to shape American society to conservative Christian mores . ”
One does not have to look far for evidence of such views .
Doug Phillips on the Vision Forum Web site , explicitly opposes the American cultural and Constitutional doctrines related to religious pluralism , claiming that Jesus is the only lawmaker .
He believes that Americans have fallen away from the true biblical order and models for manliness , stating : “ the absence of biblical patriarchy leads to male effeminacy which leads to homosexuality .
Biblical patriarchy must be re-established within the home .
To the extent that families have embraced evolutionary or feminist principles of family life … they must repent and return to the old paths . ”
He adds , “ the Church needs to repent ” and “ begin to promote biblical manhood . ”
Of course , even the hardcore have to live in the marketplace of ideas .
Jennifer Chancey has generated controversy with her views on women and voting .
She told a newspaper during Matthew ’s unsuccessful 2008 campaign for the Alabama Public Service Commission that she thought that while husbands and wives should talk about it , women should submit their vote to their husband , because to vote opposed would cancel each other ’s vote out .
Joyce informed me that Chancey also “ spoke about her opposition to women ’s voting in a film by the Gunn Brothers , winners of Vision Forum ’s annual Christian film contest , The Monstrous Regiment of Women . ” Vision Forum like other Christian Reconstructionist - oriented agencies teaches that women should not vote or hold public office .
The Alabama PSC race was not Matthew Chancey ’s first foray into electoral politics .
Chancey was the campaign manager for current Alabama Supreme Court Justice Tom Parker , the former spokesman for disgraced Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore , who was ousted after refusing to carry out a federal court order to remove the monument to the Ten Commandments he ’d had installed in the rotunda of the state courthouse .
In light of the Chanceys ’ religious orientation and profoundly anti-secular , evangelical world view , it is a little odd that he entered a contest that required him to elide all references to the ways his religious beliefs shape his life and manly character .
Whether Chancey ’s victory in the Old Spice , Art of Manliness - Man of the Year contest is a harbinger of another run for office remains to be seen .
The economy is wallowing in the corner of the room in a puddle of its own tears while the gas pump collectively rapes us in the bumhole , and wealthy CEO ’s and executives hold the cam - corder and swig beers .
America has become the Nicholas Cage character in Leaving Las Vegas .
Or Elizabeth
Shue , rather , since her career hit the toilet after that movie .
Welcome to the end .
We deserve it .
I ’m kind of glad all this shit is going down , because people have n’t been punished enough for electing George Bush twice .
Over 50 million Americans have come out repeatedly and voted for the neo-cons , and I ’m pretty sure a very small percentage of those are wealthy CEO’s .
The rest are “ regular folk ” who are now getting a nice , bitter taste of consequence .
Your hatred of lesbians and abortion doctors outweighed everything else , and now you ’re paying for it with the loss of your job , your health insurance , and possibly your son or daughter in a disastrous war .
Oh wait !
I ’m sorry !
You voted for Gore !
The election was stolen !
Popular vote !
Yes , all this is true .
But what did you do when Katherine Harris gave Florida to the Republicunts ?
Riot in the streets ?
March to the White House ?
Exercise your second amendment right against an unjust system ?
Nope .
You got better shit to do !
College football is on !
And that causes bigger riots than a stolen election ever would .
And then 9/11 happened , you dusted off your American flag , wrapped it around George Bush ’s cock , gave him a few good tugs off and let him splooge all over your patriotic face .
In November of 2001 , George Bush had an 88 % approval rating !
That ’s 9 out of 10 of you , giving him the thumbs up to do whatever the fuck he wanted .
And , Gosh Darnit , he did .
Love me , love me , love me , I ’m a liberal !
Would things be any better now under Gore or Kerry ?
It ’s tough to say .
But it ’s not like more than a few percent of us have gone the Third Party route .
We invited thieves into our homes , and now we ’re acting surprised that our laptops are missing .
Fuck us .
We had it coming .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. President - elect Barack Obama said on Tuesday it is not good policy for a president or president - elect to second guess the Federal Reserve , although he said the central bank ’s traditional tools for fighting recession were “ running out ” .
“ I do n’t think its good policy for the president or president - elect to second guess the Fed , ” Obama told a news conference in Chicago where he announced his nominee for education secretary .
“ We are running out of the traditional ammunition that is used in a recession , which is to lower interest rates .
They are getting to be about as low as they can get ... it is critical that the other branches of government step up and that ’s why the economic recovery plan is so absolutely crucial . ”
In a decision expected at 2:15 p.m. EDT ( 1915 GMT ) , the Fed is likely to cut U.S. interest rates by at least 50 basis points to 0.5 percent .
The Earth at night : Stunning images of the cities that light up the globe
It may look like an intriguing star constellation far away in space , but these lights are actually far closer to home .
This image shows London at night as viewed by the International Space Station .
Taken by astronaut Donald Pettit on his last mission on the ISS , it shows England 's capital shortly after 7.22 pm on a cloudy February 4 , 2003 .
He is due to return to space for the second time on the shuttle Endeavour later this week and no doubt looks forward to capturing yet more stunning images .
The orbital motion photo shows London at night ( top ) .
Cloud obscures some of the smaller cities
London 's orbital motorway , the M25 , is most clearly running south of the city .
The darkened Thames river estuary fans out to the east , while dark pockets slightly west of the densely packed lights in the centre reveal Hyde Park and Regent 's Park .
Mr Pettit captured his images after he constructed a device called a camera mount called a barn - door tracker on board the station .
Donald Pettit looks out at the Canary Islands from the space station
It is commonly used by astronomers on the ground to capture images of the stars , which compensates for the rotation of the Earth relative to the stars .
However , Mr Pettit used it to compensate for the movement of the space station relative to the Earth below .
The careful coordination kept the target city in the same position during a long exposure , producing detailed photos .
The astronauts have now captured hundreds of images of cities from around the world with this technique with a level of detail of about 60 metres .
Border cities like Ciudad Juaréz , Mexico and El Paso , Texas , show cultural differences influencing city planning .
On the U.S. side of the Rio Grande , El Paso is marked by the brightly - lit Interstate Highway that cuts through the city .
The American - style grids of the city differs markedly from Ciudad Juaréz , which has a European inspired pattern of curved streets .
This image shows El Paso in America to the North and the far more densely populated Ciudad Juar in Mexico below
Tokyo Bay : Lights in Japan glow a cooler blue - green colour
Cities from different regions of the Earth can also be identified by the different colours that the lights throw off .
Japanese cities such as Tokyo glow a cooler blue - green than other regions of the world and patches of orange along the shore of Tokyo Bay reveal more advanced orange sodium vapour lamps , compared to the light green mercury vapour lamps inland .
As populations expand and urban areas grow , individual cities will merge into ever larger bright blobs .
More roads will connect those cities to form an illuminated , lace - like web across the continents .
And the snappers on the ISS no doubt hope there will be someone up in space to chart the changes .

Dec. 1 , 2008  --
The following is an excerpted transcript of Charlie Gibson 's interview with President George Bush and First Lady Laura Bush at Camp David , on their reflections over the past eight years , the current state of the country and their greatest disappointments and accomplishments , for " World News . "
CHARLIE GIBSON : Mr. President , let 's start with the economy because it's what 's on everybody 's mind .
Your successor will inherit not just a troubled economy , but an economy in crisis .
Did you miss any signals that this would --
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH : You know , we anticipated some issues revolving around Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and early in my administration called for a regulator , on the knowledge that an implied government guarantee could cause , and eventually did cause , the agency to become excessive in its lending practices , which eventually was a part of the financial meltdown .
And I can remember sitting in the Roosevelt Room with Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke and others , and they said to me that if we do n't act boldly , Mr. President , we could be in a depression greater than the Great Depression .
GIBSON : When was that ?
BUSH : That was , I would say , five weeks , four weeks after we began to deal with some -- like AIG .
And that was right before we went to Congress for the $ 700 billion .
And my attitude is , is that if that 's the case , this administration will do everything we can to safeguard the financial system .
And that 's what we 've been doing .
And I 'm sorry it 's happening , of course .
Obviously I do n't like the idea of people losing jobs , or being worried about their 401Ks .
On the other hand , the American people got to know that we will safeguard the system .
I mean , we 're in .
And if we need to be in more , we will .
And eventually , however , this economy will recover .
And when it recovers , many of the assets backed by the government now will be redeemed , and we will -- could conceivably make money off of some of the holdings .
GIBSON : But was there an " uh - oh " moment -- and I could probably use stronger language than that -- ( laughter ) -- when you thought this really could be bad --
BUSH : Well , that was , of course , the crystallization .
When you have the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Fed say , if we do n't act boldly , we could be in a depression greater than the Great Depression , that 's an " uh - oh " moment .
But you got to understand , leading up to that we had been bailing water in this way : AIG was failing ; other big houses on Wall Street needed to be merged , one failed --
GIBSON : Was not saving Lehman a mistake ?
BUSH : We 'll let the historians look back on that .
At the time , the recommendation was not to , obviously .
And some are second - guessing that .
And in a situation like this , Charlie , where the administration is making big decisions and big calls , that there 's going to be a lot of second - guessing .
The one thing that I do n't want to have happen is people say this thing was in a financial meltdown and we did n't do anything .
And so we 're moving -- hard .
GIBSON : When you add it all up , you 've got about $ 7.5 trillion in funded and unfunded backing of securities now .
BUSH : Yes .
GIBSON : And that 's about half of what our economy is in its whole .
Does that scare the willikers out of you ?
BUSH : What scared me is not doing anything , which would have caused there to be a huge financial meltdown and the conceivable scenario that we'd have been in a depression greater than the Great Depression .
On the other hand , a lot of the -- you know , these -- some of these are investments .
I 've got faith that the economy will recover .
As a matter of fact , I 'm confident it will recover .
I can't tell you exactly the moment , but when it does recover , a lot of the assets now owned by the government will be sold .
And I can't guarantee that we 'll get all our money back , but it 's conceivable we could .
And the question is , is it worth it to save the system , to safeguard the system ?
And I came to the conclusion , along with other smart people , that it is .
GIBSON : Do you feel in any way responsible for what 's happening ?
BUSH : You know , I 'm the President during this period of time , but I think when the history of this period is written , people will realize a lot of the decisions that were made on Wall Street took place over a decade or so , before I arrived in President , during I arrived in President .
I 'm a little upset that we did n't get the reforms to Fannie and Freddie -- on Fannie and Freddie , because I think it would have helped a lot .
And when people review the history of this administration , people will say that this administration tried hard to get a regulator .
And there will be a lot of analysis of why that did n't happen .
I suspect people will find a lot of it did n't happen for pure political reasons .
GIBSON : How high do you think unemployment will go ?
BUSH : Too high .
I mean , anybody unemployed is too much .
And I -- I 'm not a very good economic forecaster .
I do know that we are taking steps to make sure -- see , the most difficult thing about this is that a lot of people out there in Main Street wonder why the government is having to act because Wall Street went on a binge .
And I 'm one , frankly -- at first .
I was the guy that inartfully said , " Wall Street got drunk , and we got a hangover . "
And on the other hand , though , when you 're the President and somebody says , we better move big , Mr. President , otherwise we could have a depression greater than the Great -- we 're moving big .
And it is hard for the average citizen to understand how frozen the system became and how over - leveraged the system became .
And so what we 're watching is the de-leveraging of our financial markets , which is obviously affecting the growth of the economy .
GIBSON : You 've pushed a lot of money on the table to try to get the banks lending again and to try to get the economy vibrant again .
And yet a lot of banks in trouble , we get an indication , are hoarding some of that money , or holding it , concerned about debts that they may have .
Are you disappointed the way the banks have dealt with the money that was given them out of TARP ?
BUSH : Well , obviously , in a situation like this you 'd like to see instant liquidity .
But there 's a lot of fear throughout our society and the system itself .
And slowly but surely the system is becoming unthawed , and it 's going to take time for the system to become unthawed .
What the American people have got to know is we 've taken the steps to unthaw it , which is the first step to recovery .
GIBSON : Your successor said right from the beginning , there 's only one President .
But he 's been holding news conferences ; he named his economic team .
Is he intruding in any way ?
BUSH : No , not at all .
Look , one of the things that we vowed is to work with the President - elect and his team to have a smooth transition .
This is a very unique period in American history where a new President is coming in where we are fighting a two - front war against terrorists and , at the same time , dealing with a very difficult economic situation .
And the more we can work together , the better off our country will be .
I called President - Elect Obama with the Citigroup decision .
I wanted him to know what we were doing .
And he was very appreciative of the phone call .
And I --
GIBSON : Did you call him on Tuesday about the Fed putting up $ 600 billion , and Treasury $ 200 billion --
BUSH : Yes , yes .
GIBSON : You called him about that , too ?
BUSH : I sure did -- oh , no , no , no , I have not on that .
But I know his team was briefed .
I did n't speak to him personally about that , but I know his team was briefed .
We 're in touch with the Obama transition team a lot .
And I do n't feel any -- I do n't feel any intrusion whatsoever , because he knows what I know -- I 'm -- our administration still will be making the decisions necessary until he becomes the President .
GIBSON : Given the exigencies of the time and how critical this situation is , do you need to take any kind of extraordinary actions , bringing his people in to work side by side with your people before January 20th ?
BUSH : I do n't think so .
And I do n't think he would want that .
I think he 's going to want to be able to come in fresh .
On the other hand , he does want , and I think his team will want , to be fully briefed on any further difficulties until he 's sworn in .
GIBSON : Let 's talk a little bit about eight years as being President .
What do n't the American people know about being President ?
What would surprise them the most ?
BUSH : That 's an interesting question .
I think , at least from my administration , I think they'd be surprised at how our team has worked so closely together .
Some days we 're not so happy , some days happy ; every day has been pretty joyous , though -- that when you have a purpose in life , that no matter what it may look like from afar , that we 're a highly motivated group of people that are honored to serve .
In other words , I think people look at the White House and say , oh , man , what a miserable experience it is to be President .
You know , there 's a lot of noise , a lot of criticism , a lot of name - calling , a lot of this , a lot of that .
But I think people would be surprised when they walked in the Oval Office and the White House to see a highly motivated group of people that really enjoy what we 're doing .
GIBSON : What were you most unprepared for ?
BUSH : Well , I think I was unprepared for war .
In other words , I did n't campaign and say , " Please vote for me , I 'll be able to handle an attack . "
In other words , I did n't anticipate war .
Presidents -- one of the things about the modern presidency is that the unexpected will happen .
GIBSON : You said you were not going to be in the business of nation - building .
And so much of what you had to do was nation - building .
BUSH : Well , what I said was , in the course of a debate , I said the military should n't be used to build nations .
In this case , it turns out the military , in my judgment , was needed to remove threats to our security , and after that removal , the military , as well as our diplomatic corps , needed to help rebuild after tyrannical situations .
GIBSON : That 's the second time I 've heard you use the word " joyful " about the presidency , and that might take people by surprise .
Even in really tough times ?
BUSH : Oh , yes .
As I said , some times are happy , some not happy .
I do n't want people to misconstrue .
It 's not -- I do n't feel joyful when somebody loses their life , nor do I feel joyful from somebody loses a job .
That concerns me .
And the President ends up carrying a lot of people 's grief in his soul during a presidency .
One of the things about the presidency is you deal with a lot of tragedy -- whether it be hurricanes , or tornadoes , or fires , or death -- and you spend time being the Comforter - in - Chief .
But the idea of being able to serve a nation you love is -- has been joyful .
In other words , my spirits have never been down .
I have been sad , but the spirits are up .
GIBSON : I have found you to be an excellent political analyst and commentator ?
BUSH : Why ?
I try not to .
( Laughter . )
GIBSON : What did you think of the campaign ?
BUSH : I thought my candidate for President , John McCain , had a tough headwind -- for two reasons .
One , rarely does the American people -- do the American people give a political party three terms .
That in itself was difficult for him .
They did one time since World War II ; that happened to be for President 41 , my dear dad .
Obviously the economic situation made it awfully difficult for John McCain to get a message out .
And I felt that Barack Obama ran a very disciplined campaign .
I mean , he inspired a lot of people and was in a position to take advantage of the inspiration .
It was well organized , he raised a lot of money , and ran a textbook campaign .
GIBSON : Given the conditions , and the economy , is there any way John McCain could have won ?
BUSH : It 's hard to see it , in retrospect .
You know , John ran a hard campaign .
And he was -- I think the interesting thing about the way people analyze campaigns , though , is they always look at the negative side .
The positive side is , from Barack Obama 's perspective , he had a really good campaign .
I mean , this guy I 'm told raised $ 150 million in one month .
That meant a lot of people were for him for President .
And he had a organization that he was able to get them out to the polls , particularly in the voting box , where it really mattered on the electoral map .
GIBSON : Palin choice -- help or hurt ?
BUSH : I think it helped John .
It energized the party .
It -- I can remember when she first was named , young women in our office were saying , is n't it great that a woman is in a position to serve on the ticket now , to maybe be Vice President of the United States .
Her crowds were big and enthusiastic .
And so I think it helped .
GIBSON : Was the election in any way a repudiation of the Bush administration ?
BUSH : I think it was a repudiation of Republicans .
And I 'm sure some people voted for Barack Obama because of me .
I think most people voted for Barack Obama because they decided they wanted him to be in their living room for the next four years explaining policy .
In other words , they made a conscious choice to put him in as President .
GIBSON : But both candidates wound up criticizing you a lot .
BUSH : Yes , well , that 's what happens when you 're the incumbent during a tough economic time , but --
GIBSON : Hurt ?
BUSH : No , not really .
You know , I 've been around politics a long time .
Remember , I was the guy in 2000 who campaigned for change .
I campaigned for change when I ran for governor of Texas .
The only time I really did n't campaign for change is when I was running for reelection .
GIBSON : Given the fact that you did start campaigning for change , said you were going to change the ways of Washington , do you feel you did in any way ?
Or did 9/11 really stand in the way of doing it ?
BUSH : No , you know -- actually , 9/11 unified the country , and that was a moment where Washington decided to work together .
I think one of the big disappointments of the presidency has been the fact that the tone in Washington got worse , not better .
Having said that , there were some moments of strong bipartisanship .
I mean , No Child Left Behind Act , for example , or eventually funding our troops .
I know the war was -- created bitter divisions .
But nevertheless , when it came to supporting the troops or our veterans , we worked together .
And so there were -- PEPFAR , for example , the AIDS initiative in Africa , got bipartisan support .
Millennium Challenge Account .
I mean , there were moments of bipartisanship .
But the tone was rough .
And I was obviously partially responsible because I was the President , although I tried hard not to call people names and bring the office down during my presidency .
GIBSON : Do you feel the divisions are deeper , the enmities perhaps a little stronger , the language a little tougher now than it was January 20 , 2001 ?
BUSH : Yes , I do .
I do .
I think -- I do n't know , the close election created some pretty harsh language .
But once I was President I think people decided that , well , let 's try to work with him , and I said , I 'd like to work with you , and we did some pretty good things .
But having said that , Washington has always been politics .
I mean , if you , like , for example , study the early Presidents , there 's some pretty tough language when it came to Abraham Lincoln , or the relationship between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson .
So I did n't go into this naively , I knew it would be tough .
But I also knew that the President has the responsibility to try to elevate the tone .
And , frankly , it just did n't work , as well as I 'd like to have it work .
GIBSON : I guess the bottom - line question I 'm asking you is , do you feel you were in any way able to change Washington ?
Or do you feel --
BUSH : I think we did .
I think we brought a results - oriented government , and we insisted that people focus on results , not process , and on a variety of reforms .
Whether it be No Child Left Behind , or like the PEPFAR Initiative , or the Malaria Initiative , the question we always asked was , are we achieving the results ?
Washington can be a very process - oriented town .
The budget process -- let 's just pass money because the program sounds good .
We worked hard to say , is the program achieving the results ?
If not , let 's eliminate it .
GIBSON : Barack Obama was talking just last week about the fact that he wants to go at the budget line by line , change things .
I remember your State of the Union address you said , here 's 151 programs we can cut out --
BUSH : Yes .
GIBSON : -- and we can save $ 20 billion .
Not one of them got cut out , sir .
BUSH : No , that 's right .
The problem is the President does n't get to decide how to appropriate .
And because the President does n't have the line - item veto it 's very difficult to be able to excise some of the programs from the budget .
GIBSON : I 'd like to talk a little bit about the highs and lows of the eight years .
But you can't do that alone .
We should bring Mrs. Bush in to talk about that .
******
MRS .
BUSH : Okay , heard you calling .
( Laughter . )
Hey , Charlie .
GIBSON : Mrs. Bush .
MRS .
BUSH : Good to see you .
GIBSON : Nice to see you .
GIBSON : As you leave , what do you think the country 's feeling is about George W. Bush ?
BUSH : I do n't know .
I hope they feel that this is a guy that came , did n't sell his soul for politics , had to make some tough decisions , and did so in a principled way .
MRS .
BUSH : I think they think he 's somebody that kept them safe for eight years .
And I think -- and I hear that all the time , people thanking me , telling me to thank him .
BUSH : I 'll be frank with you .
I do n't spend a lot of time really worrying about short - term history .
I guess I do n't worry about long - term history , either , since I 'm not going to be around to read it -- ( laughter ) -- but , look , in this job you just do what you can .
The thing that 's important for me is to get home and look in that mirror and say , I did not compromise my principles .
And I did n't .
I made tough calls .
And some presidencies have got a lot of tough decisions to make --
GIBSON : Was there a time when you thought , if I do this I will be compromising my principles --
BUSH : Yes .
GIBSON : -- some decision where you really thought that that was at issue ?
BUSH : Yes .
GIBSON : What ?
BUSH : The pullout of Iraq .
It would have compromised the principle that when you put kids into harm 's way , you go in to win .
And it was a tough call , particularly , since a lot of people were advising for me to get out of Iraq , or pull back in Iraq , or -- and rather than listen to -- I mean , I listened to a lot of voices , but ultimately , I listened to this voice : I 'm not going to let your son die in vain ; I believe we can win ; I 'm going to do what it takes to win in Iraq .
GIBSON : You 've always said there 's no do -overs as President .
If you had one ?
BUSH : I do n't know -- the biggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq .
A lot of people put their reputations on the line and said the weapons of mass destruction is a reason to remove Saddam Hussein .
It was n't just people in my administration ; a lot of members in Congress , prior to my arrival in Washington D.C. , during the debate on Iraq , a lot of leaders of nations around the world were all looking at the same intelligence .
And , you know , that 's not a do - over , but I wish the intelligence had been different , I guess .
GIBSON : If the intelligence had been right , would there have been an Iraq war ?
BUSH : Yes , because Saddam Hussein was unwilling to let the inspectors go in to determine whether or not the U.N. resolutions were being upheld .
In other words , if he had had weapons of mass destruction , would there have been a war ?
Absolutely .
GIBSON : No , if you had known he did n't .
BUSH : Oh , I see what you 're saying .
You know , that 's an interesting question .
That is a do - over that I can't do .
It 's hard for me to speculate .
GIBSON : Greatest accomplishment ?
The one thing you 're proudest of ?
BUSH : I keep recognizing we 're in a war against ideological thugs and keeping America safe .
GIBSON : How about you ?
Greatest feeling of accomplishment as First Lady ?
MRS .
BUSH : Well , for him , one great feeling of accomplishment of his that I appreciate is the liberation of Afghanistan , and the fact that girls are in school in Afghanistan , and women can walk on the streets without a male escort .
And it 's still tough there , and we read about it every day .
But I 've met a lot of women from Afghanistan , both on my visits there , and women who come through the United States studying to be teachers , or working with judges , the women judges , or the parliamentarians that come through , and that 's a -- I think that 's a huge accomplishment .
It 's life - changing for the women who live there .
GIBSON : Was there one moment --
BUSH : May I talk about her accomplishment , please ?
GIBSON : Sure , sure .
BUSH : I think her greatest accomplishment is that she was able to lift the spirits of a lot of people , whether it be activists in Burma , women in Afghanistan , teachers in America -- that she came and seized the moment , and has been a fabulous First Lady .
MRS .
BUSH : Thank you .
GIBSON : High point of the eight years ?
The one moment when this all felt the best ?
BUSH : You know , it 's -- I would say maybe the 2004 inauguration , because I had a difficult first - term presidency -- not such an easy one second term , either , by the way -- but I had taken my message to the American people , campaigned hard , in a race that , frankly , I was n't expected to win ; won ; and then was able to go in front of the American people again , thank them for their confidence , and start a second term .
GIBSON : How about for you ?
One moment ?
MRS .
BUSH : Well , there have been lots of moments , so many moments .
It 's hard to say just one .
Being able to represent the United States in Africa on the five different trips I was able to make there , and see people who literally had come back from the dead because the American people funded antiretrovirals for them , had what 's called the " Lazarus effect , " and had been dying from AIDS and now are productive .
Those were always wonderful moments to be able to see that .
GIBSON : Greatest disappointment ?
BUSH : Well , I mentioned one , and that is no weapons of mass destruction .
I think another -- in Iraq .
I think another great disappointment was not getting immigration reform done .
I firmly believe that the immigration debate really did n't show the true nature of America as a welcoming society .
I fully understand we need to enforce law and enforce borders .
But the debate took on a tone that undermined the true greatness of America , which is that we welcome people who want to work hard and support their families .
GIBSON : Did the country disappoint you in its reaction to that issue ?
BUSH : No , not really .
What was interesting was , is that the issue was very hot for a period of time ; then the primaries ended and it was n't much of an issue in the general election .
It -- listen , immigration is a highly emotional issue .
It 's always been a highly emotional issue throughout our history .
I was disappointed we did n't get a bill out of Congress .
That 's where I was disappointed .
GIBSON : How about you ?
One thing you 'd have liked to have done as First Lady that perhaps did n't get done ?
MRS .
BUSH : You know , I 'm sure there are a lot .
Really , just not -- I mean , just wish I could have done more , I guess , would be what the disappointment would be , on a lot of different issues .
I wish we would see the release of political prisoners in Burma .
I wish Afghanistan were really not having the problems they 're having right now .
And I think they are on the road to a real democracy , but it 's a lot harder than I wish it would be .
GIBSON : I asked the President a moment ago before you came in the room what people do n't know about being President .
What do n't they know about your role ?
MRS .
BUSH : About my role ?
GIBSON : Yes .
MRS .
BUSH : I do n't know .
You know , there 's really not a map for my role .
There 's not really a job description .
And what I do think happens is we end up benefiting from whatever the interests of our First Ladies have been .
I do think a lot of times First Ladies are trivialized with a pet project .
And I think in every case , certainly that I know of , the First Ladies are much more complicated , much more dynamic people than you can tell from listening to press or reading press reports , because it 's sort of an either / or .
When George was elected I was asked , was I going to be Hillary Clinton or Barbara Bush , like I was either going to be --
GIBSON : Like they 're polar opposites .
MRS .
BUSH : -- in this box or in this box .
But --
GIBSON : They 're not polar opposites .
BUSH : No , not at all .
MRS .
BUSH : No , not at all .
GIBSON : Did you give Michelle Obama any advice on that ?
MRS .
BUSH : No , not really .
GIBSON : Or , did you just say , figure it out yourself .
MRS .
BUSH : No , we did n't -- she did n't ask for any advice like that , and I did n't give her any .
What we talked about , really , was living in the house and making it a home -- because that is what the First Ladies have done first , and that is make sure it 's a home for their children , it 's a home for the President .
And we talked about closets -- ( laughter ) -- we talked about , you know , all the things that will make it easier for her to move there and live there at the very first .
And then I know she 'll take on a lot of great issues .
GIBSON : How do you mentally adjust for life after January 20th ?
BUSH : Check in about February 15th .
I do n't know .
That 's going to be an -- that 's an interesting question .
We 've been in the spotlight now for 14 years .
We 've lived in the Governor 's Mansion and the White House .
It 's going to be an interesting adjustment .
GIBSON : Do you talk to yourself in the shower about that ?
BUSH : I generally sing in the -- no .
( Laughter . )
No , I 'll begin to think about it -- obviously this financial situation makes it really hard to think about what life 's going to be when we get out of here , because I 've spent a lot of time thinking about people who are losing work , or watching their 401Ks go down .
And I 'm confident I 'll adjust , obviously .
And I 'm beginning to think through what I 'm going to do .
I intend to write a book .
I 'm going to build an institute at Southern Methodist University , along with the library and archives .
That 's where Laura went , right there in the heart of Dallas .
And other than that , I 'm just going to take it when it comes .
I 'd like to -- I tell you what I do n't want to do , I do n't want to draw attention to myself .
Pretty much had it when it comes to --
GIBSON : You want to withdraw from the limelight ?
BUSH : I think so , yes .
I 'd like to live life without the limelight for a while .
I do n't --
I think it 's going to be real important for me to get off the stage .
We got a new man coming on the stage ; I wish him all the very best .
And I do n't want to be a -- I do n't want to be out there critiquing him , his every move .
GIBSON : How about you ?
What thought have you given to it ?
MRS .
BUSH : Well , I 'm actually thinking of things like being a cook again and doing those sort of things .
And I 'm feeling very incompetent -- ( laughter . )
BUSH : I guess I 'm going on a diet .
( Laughter . )
MRS .
BUSH : But I 'm looking forward to that .
I 'm looking forward to the more normal daily life .
But I want to keep working on all the things I 've worked on .
And I think the institute , the freedom institute that George is going to build will be a perfect vehicle for me to keep working on things .
GIBSON : Do you want to withdraw from the limelight , as he does ?
MRS .
BUSH : Sure .
GIBSON : Do you ?
MRS .
BUSH : Sure .
GIBSON : Because you go from 120 miles an hour --
MRS .
BUSH : That 's going to be the hard part .
GIBSON : -- to dead stop .
MRS .
BUSH : That 's it .
GIBSON : And one former President said to me , it 's a shock when the phone rings , that you know it 's probably the kids .
BUSH : Yes , that 's right .
GIBSON : And it 's not --
BUSH : It 's going to be an interesting adjustment .
We 'll adjust .
We got each other , we 've got our kids , we 've got fabulous friends in Texas .
One of the great things about our lives is that we have a bunch of friends in our state that were our friends before politics , they were our friends during politics , and they 'll be our friends after politics .
We 're going to a society where we got a lot of folks that will help us adjust from the big - time to just normalcy .
GIBSON : So what do you anticipate the feeling will be ?
I 'm always wondering what 's going through the mind of that -- it 's always been a man -- walking down the Capitol steps , getting on the helicopter , flying out for the last flight on Air Force One , and suddenly realizing his life has just changed totally .
BUSH : Yes , it 's an interesting question .
It will certainly be a contrast to that moment when you get sworn in as President and realize your life has just changed totally .
One of the things I 'm beginning to realize is that you get prepared for that moment during these final months .
Today was my last pardoning of the Thanksgiving turkey .
( Laughter . )
MRS .
BUSH : We 're on the lasts .
BUSH : And so in other words --
GIBSON : I do n't think that 's going to keep you up nights -- missing that .
BUSH : No -- but , no , but seriously , there 's a lot of last moments .
GIBSON : Yes .
BUSH : And I suspect that by the time the moment comes , that you will have said goodbye to so many people and goodbye to places like Camp David , that it may not be quite as difficult as you would think .
I do n't know .
Listen , I 've never done it .
This will be an interview that you need to come down and find me in about six months from now --
GIBSON : I 'll be there .
BUSH : Thank you .
GIBSON : I 'll be there .
But is it -- do you anticipate it will be a relief ?
A longing ?
And if it 's a relief , I wonder if you 'll be more relieved than your folks .
BUSH : Well , first of all , no one will be more relieved than my mother and dad , because one of the things I learned during his presidency is being the son of the President is a lot tougher than being the President .
I mean , it is really agonizing to have somebody you truly love get banged around in the political process .
It was hard .
And so , no doubt they 're going to be relieved to have their boy out of the limelight .
And I bet a lot of our friends will be relieved , too .
GIBSON : You 're only 62 , though .
BUSH : Right .
GIBSON : Is there one more deal in you ?
Is there one more thing you really want to achieve ?
BUSH : That 's an interesting question .
I 'm confident -- look , first of all , you do n't get to be President unless you 're a " Type A " personality who 's driven to do things .
And I am confident I 'll be driven to do something ; I just can't tell you what it is yet .
Steve Hadley and I were sitting around -- he 's the National Security Advisor -- sitting around ; I said , would n't it be interesting for baby boomers not to retire in nice places , but to retire -- during their retirement , go help people deal with malaria or AIDS .
In other words -- and I 'm not suggesting that 's what I 'm going to do , but it is the kind of thing that intrigues me .
But I , frankly , Charlie , have n't had time to figure it out yet .
But I will .
I mean , look , I 'm going to have a lot of time to think .
My day is going to go from getting up early - early , and being at the Oval Office at 6:45 a.m. , and having a lot to do when you get there , to waking up at 6:45 a.m. , getting Momma the coffee -- ( laughter ) -- and kind of wandering around trying -- what 's next , boss ?
GIBSON : How about you ?
One thing you want to do after you leave ?
MRS .
BUSH : Well , I want to keep working on a lot of the things I 've worked on , but obviously , from another -- not from the government side , not from the inside side .
But there are plenty of things for everybody to do , and there are lots of ways to serve .
And we 'll figure out those other ways to serve .
BUSH : This institute is going to be an interesting place , a public policy forum .
It will be -- it 's non-partisan .
It 's not going to be George Bush 's wonderful place .
It 's going to be a place where smart people come and debate issues and talk about issues .
But it will also be a launching pad for a variety of projects .
I mean , I could conceivably help organize people going to volunteer on the President 's Malaria Initiative , for example .
I keep talking about malaria , because it happens to be the type of initiative where it is easy to plug in volunteers .
GIBSON : You 've called on former Presidents to fill various roles -- your Dad obviously , President Clinton .
Is there one area that you think you can really be helpful to President Obama , President - Elect Obama , soon to be President Obama ?
BUSH : Yes , that 's right .
I do n't know , Charlie .
Obviously , one of my parting words to him will be :
If I can help you , let me know .
The interesting thing about being President , though , is that these issues come so hard and so fast , that you really do rely upon the people that are close to you , because they 've got the latest information , they 've got the latest intelligence , they 're people whose judgment you trust .
Obviously , you reach out beyond the White House , but the decision - making is -- ends up being with a trusted group of people .
GIBSON : Is the President too much in a bubble ?
BUSH : Oh , I do n't know .
I mean , you 're going to have to be in a bubble during this here because the enemy would like to do nothing more than do you in .
So , I mean , that 's a necessary part of the job .
You know , yes -- I mean , believe me you understand what 's going on in the world .
This idea about how the President does n't understand this , that , or the other , just simply is not the case .
I mean , there 's a lot of information that comes through the White House .
GIBSON : One thing you 'll miss most ?
BUSH : Well , I 'll miss being Commander - in - Chief .
I have gotten to be -- grown to be so appreciative of our military .
It 's hard to believe that so many kids , and some not - so - kids , have volunteered to fight in a war .
And I 'll miss -- and it's going to sound strange to you -- I 'll miss meeting with the families whose son or daughter have fallen in combat , because the meetings I 've had with the families are so inspirational .
They -- I mean , obviously , there 's a lot of sadness , and we cry , and we hug , and we occasionally laugh .
And we share -- I listen to stories .
But the Comforter - in - Chief is always the comforted person .
Believe it or not , I 'll miss going to the hospitals as the Commander - in - Chief , and looking a kid in the eye , and have him say , heal me up , Mr. President , I want to go back in .
And so , there will be a lot of these special moments that we 'll miss .
GIBSON : How about you ?
The thing you 'll miss the most ?
MRS .
BUSH : > I 'll miss living at the White House , of course , and all the people that are there that we 're with every single day that -- my staff that I laugh with and talk to every single day , and the President 's staff , and then , of course , the people that work at the White House who we 've known for years because we knew them when we visited President Bush and Barbara .
So , it 's the people that I 'll miss the most .
GIBSON : And final question , just to finish the sentence : I will leave the presidency with a feeling of ?
BUSH : I will leave the presidency with my head held high .
GIBSON : And I will leave the White House with ?
MRS .
BUSH : With gratitude for everybody that we met the entire time .
GIBSON : Good to talk to you .
BUSH : Thank you , sir .
MRS .
BUSH : Thank you .
President George W. Bush has been using his last weeks in office making the case that he was not a disaster as president .
There ’s not much else for him to do  after all , no one cares what he thinks about the issues .
Everyone , even those who voted for John McCain , are waiting for Barack Obama to take the oath of office on Tuesday .
A lame duck even before the election of his replacement , most any president becomes the lamest of lame ducks in his final weeks in office .
Especially one as unpopular as President Bush .
Good for a sardonic laugh is the Bush administration wrap - up , " Policies of the Bush Administration : 2001 - 2009 . "
Needless to say , it portrays a heroic statesman who made America safer , freer , and wealthier .
It suggests we are living in a parallel universe like that in a Star Trek episode .
The president ’s principal claim , leading p.1 , is that he " kept America safe . "
One aspect of that was waging " the Global War on Terror . "
Too bad al - Qaeda survives and the Taliban is resurgent in Afghanistan with a military solution looking ever more distant .
Nuclear - armed Pakistan is being sucked into the vortex , creating the potential for genuine catastrophe .
As for Iraq , the administration glories in the fact that it " freed 25 million Iraqis from the rule of Saddam Hussein . "
Yes , and in the process left millions of Iraqis dead , wounded , and displaced .
Those who survived are living under a government likely to become increasingly authoritarian and sectarian .
That ’s sure a great way to create democracy .
Heck of a job , Georgie !
More seriously , the president claims to have " prevented another attack on US soil . "
Let us grant that almost in spite of themselves administration officials have taken out much of the al - Qaeda organization and made it more difficult for terrorists to organize an attack in America .
But the Bush administration ’s manifold mistakes and errors also frequently hindered efforts to combat terrorism : the inefficiency of the Department for Homeland Security ; many dubious arrests and lengthy incarcerations , as well as the well - publicized mistreatment of prisoners at home and abroad ; and creation of new radical grievances spawning more terrorists in Iraq and elsewhere around the world .
The administration even lauds the creation of the Transportation Security Administration , as if travelers are more secure because of the increased bureaucratic nonsense through which they must pass .
Indeed , if we are to equate correlation with causation in terms of the lack of assaults after 9/11 , should we not apply the same standard to 9/11 itself ?
That is , by all accounts pre-9/11 the administration failed to heed warnings and address shortcomings that could have prevented the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon .
So there ’s no home run for George W. Bush even here .
The Bush administration claims to have " invigorated international alliances and partnership , " yet most of America ’s friends reacted in horror to Washington ’s militaristic and hubristic approach to foreign affairs .
The administration squandered the enormous goodwill generated by 9/11 , making it more difficult to convince sympathetic states to cooperate in destroying transnational terrorist networks .
As for expanding NATO , the administration has made America less secure by multiplying security commitments in a region of no significant geopolitical interest to America .
The Bush administration sacrificed relations with Russia , a rebounding power whose aid Washington desires in a number of areas .
Last August the US even found itself confronting nuclear - armed Russia in the Caucasus over a war started by a third country .
Ironically , the administration set the precedent for Russian intervention against Georgia with Washington ’s misguided efforts to dismember Serbia and create an independent Kosovo .
A foolish " success " is no success .
The Bush performance report also contends that " the President ’s freedom agenda helped emerging democracies build the institutions that sustain liberty . "
The first two countries listed are Iraq and Afghanistan .
The likelihood of either country becoming a liberal democratic society in our lifetimes is about on par with the odds that Congress will approve spending programs without pork .
But the administration goes further , even claiming credit for urging " valued partners like Saudi Arabia to move toward freedom . "
Well , maybe by inches .
Riyadh remains a totalitarian state ; high - profile US support for the monarchy remains a blot on any president ’s claim to be advancing human liberty .
Some of the administration ’s claims are harmless blather .
The president " announced steps to help the Burmese people bring peaceful change and democratic transition to their country . "
Well , he may have announced steps , but they ’ve had no impact .
Of course , there is n’t much any president could have done about that tragic country ; at least President Bush did n’t launch yet another bloody military invasion and nation - building mission in response .
Finally , the administration proclaims : " the president has transformed our military to become better trained , better equipped , and better prepared for the threats of today , tomorrow , and beyond . "
It ’s an astonishing assertion .
After all , the military would have been far better provisioned and transformed had the administration not squandered $ 620 billion on an unnecessary war in Mesopotamia .
And the total bill could eventually run $ 2 or $ 3 trillion for Bush ’s Iraq folly .
This also is the administration that could n’t be bothered to provide armored Humvees and body armor for its own troops .
Throwing money rarely solves social problems , but quickly equipping combat personnel is a different matter .
Apparently the administration did n’t want to acknowledge that anything was amiss with the Iraq adventure requiring better protection for US forces .
Americans died as a result .
Finally , the president ’s misguided invasion placed enormous strain on the volunteer military , with both the active and reserve forces suffering significant recruiting problems .
To make its recruiting objectives the Army lowered standards for new recruits .
The administration also imposed " stop - loss , " halting retirements and extending enlistment terms , and began treating reservists as substitutes rather than supplements to the active forces , sending citizen soldiers on a succession of lengthy tours .
The Pentagon even called up members of the Individual Ready Reserve , an almost unprecedented step .
Not everything has been a disaster .
The president can claim credit for not wrecking relations with China and for significantly improving ties with India  perhaps the administration ’s single most important foreign policy achievement .
The administration also recognized the importance of diplomacy when it negotiated denuclearization with Libya , completing a process of engagement begun under Bill Clinton .
However , the report sidesteps or ignores other monumental failures .
For instance , policy towards North Korea and Iran has been a shambles .
The US actually invaded the least dangerous member of the " Axis of Evil . "
In contrast , Washington spent several years refusing to talk to North Korea , which goes unmentioned in the administration document .
The North busily reprocessed nuclear fuel and is thought to have acquired the capability of building another ten or so nuclear weapons .
Only after the debacle was manifest to all did the administration appear to notice , causing it to change course .
Now Washington is locked in endless and endlessly frustrating negotiations with Pyongyang .
The US government adopted a similar stance toward Iran  celebrated by the administration as working " with the international community to isolate the regime in Tehran "  refusing to even respond to Tehran ’s offer to negotiate an overall settlement with Washington in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq .
Since then America ’s bargaining power has dwindled as Iran gained mightily from Saddam Hussein ’s ouster .
So the administration belatedly began low level diplomatic discussions with Iran in Iraq and considered opening a diplomatic mission in Tehran .
All the while Iran continued its nuclear developments  apparently pursuing a peaceful program today , but prepared to move to a weapons program tomorrow if desired .
With war raging in Gaza the administration ’s claim to have " laid the groundwork for a future Israel - Palestinian peace agreement and a democratic Palestinian state " can only evoke horselaughs .
There was never any pretense that the US was an honest broker between the two sides .
The administration ’s subservience to the interests of Israeli hard - liners was highlighted by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s claim to have pulled President Bush off of the podium during a speech to insist that the latter torpedo a UN Security Resolution calling for a cease fire which had been drafted with the assistance of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Tightening sanctions on Cuba proved to be a miserable failure .
Washington ’s apparent approval of a briefly successful coup against Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez was maladroit and counterproductive , especially for an administration purporting to promote democracy around the globe .
In short , the administration has amassed an extraordinary record of foolishness , incompetence , and arrogance .
It is one thing to tolerate a braggart who gets the job done .
But no one will endure a self - inflated nitwit who ruins everything he touches .
Yet that was Uncle Sam as projected by the Bush administration over the last eight years .
The Bush presidency has been an American tragedy , with horrid consequences for the rest of the world .
George W. Bush personally is a decent man , but proved to be wholly inadequate for job to which he was elected .
With a new president about to take the oath of office , we should all hope that the lessons of the last eight years have been learned , and learned well .
We cannot afford a repeat experience , now or in the future .
Just today someone told us he heard you ca n’t do real development in Ruby .
Funny – the AGI Goldratt Institute paid us a whole bunch of money for nothing then .
It must be that their brand new , multi-platform , JRuby - based desktop simulation app does n’t exist .
Pity .
Backstory
< corporate speak > AGI provides Theory of Constraints consulting and training to organizations pursuing rapid and sustained bottom line improvement </ corporate speak > .
They ’ve been fantastic to work with , and they help their clients achieve impressive results .
AGI uses several pieces of software in their training sessions to simulate manufacturing and supply chain scenarios .
They ’re reminiscent of old skool games .
These original applications were developed for DOS in the early 90s .
As time went on the simulators presented a number of pain points motivating AGI to contract out new software development – that ’s where we came in .
How We Did It
We love Ruby and how much can be accomplished in a short time with it .
With JRuby and 12 - ish months we created for AGI a complex desktop application , Production Simulator , able to run on Windows , Mac , and Linux .
The awesomeness here is that JRuby let us use a preferred language , Ruby , together with a bunch of really mature Java libraries , technologies , and tools that might not otherwise be available to Ruby .
And , in the end , thanks to Java we got multi-platform support almost for free .
The application is multi-threaded to decouple simulation execution , graphical updates , and user interaction .
Heavy lifting in the simulation does n’t decrease the application ’s responsiveness to the user ; updating the interface does n’t slow down the core simulation .
Under the hood , simulation execution has certain similarities to a gaming engine .
Our normal practices ran the show – stories , iterations , whole team , burn - down charts , TDD , continuous integration , etc .
, continuous integration , etc. RSpec runs 2120 Unit tests + 286 Integration tests
Atomic Object libraries Hardmock , Constructor , & DIY enabled our testing and construction patterns

CIA buys Afghan chief 's loyalty with Viagra
It lies to the south , says operative who bought patriarch 's cooperation with Viagra

The Afghan chieftain looked older than his 60 - odd years , and his bearded face bore the creases of a man burdened with duties as tribal patriarch and husband to four younger women .
His visitor , a CIA officer , saw an opportunity , and reached in his bag for a small gift .
Four blue pills .
Viagra .
" Take one of these .
You 'll love it , " the officer said .
Compliments of Uncle Sam .
The enticement worked .
The officer , who described the encounter , returned four days later to an enthusiastic reception .
The grinning chief offered up a bonanza of information about Taliban movements and supply routes - followed by a request for more pills .
For U.S. intelligence officials , this is how some crucial battles in Afghanistan are fought and won .
While the CIA has a long history of buying information with cash , the growing Taliban insurgency has prompted the use of novel incentives and creative bargaining to gain support in some of the country 's roughest neighborhoods , according to officials directly involved in such operations .
In their efforts to win over notoriously fickle warlords and chieftains , the officials say , the agency 's operatives have used a variety of personal services .
These include pocket knives and tools , medicine or surgeries for ailing family members , toys and school equipment , tooth extractions , travel visas and , occasionally , pharmaceutical enhancements for aging patriarchs with slumping libidos , the officials said .
" Whatever it takes to make friends and influence people - whether it 's building a school or handing out Viagra , " said one longtime agency operative and veteran of several Afghanistan tours .
Like other field officers interviewed for the story , he spoke on the condition of anonymity when describing tactics and operations that are largely classified .
Officials say these inducements are necessary in Afghanistan , a country where warlords and tribal leaders expect to be paid for their cooperation , and where , for some , switching sides can be as easy as changing tunics .
If the Americans do n't offer incentives , there are others who will , including Taliban commanders , drug dealers and even Iranian agents in the region .
The usual bribes of choice - cash and weapons - are n't always the best options , Afghanistan veterans say .
Guns too often fall into the wrong hands , they say , and showy gifts such as money , jewelry and cars tend to draw unwanted attention .
" If you give an asset $ 1,000 , he 'll go out and buy the shiniest junk he can find , and it will be apparent that he has suddenly come into a lot of money from someone , " said Jamie Smith , a veteran of CIA covert operations in Afghanistan and now chief executive officer of SCG International , a private security and intelligence company .
" Even if he does n't get killed , he becomes ineffective as an informant because everyone knows where he got it . "
The key , Smith said , is to meet the informant 's personal needs in a way that keeps him firmly on your side but leaves little or no visible trace .
" You 're trying to bridge a gap between people living in the 18th century and people coming in from the 21st century , " Smith said , " so you look for those common things in the form of material aid that motivate people everywhere . "
Among the world 's intelligence agencies , there 's a long tradition of using sex as a motivator .
Robert Baer , a retired CIA officer and author of several books on intelligence , noted that the Soviet spy service was notorious for using attractive women as bait when seeking to turn foreign diplomats into informants .
" The KGB has always used ' honey traps , ' and it works , " Baer said .
For American officers , a more common practice was to offer medical care for potential informants and their loved ones , he said .
" I remember one guy we offered an option on a heart bypass , " Baer said .
For some U.S. operatives in Afghanistan , Western drugs such as Viagra were just one of a long list of enticements available for use in special cases .
Two veteran officers familiar with such practices said Viagra was offered rarely , and only to older tribal officials for whom the drug would hold special appeal .
While such sexual performance drugs are generally unavailable in the remote areas where the agency 's teams operated , they have been sold in some Kabul street markets since at least 2003 , and were known by reputation elsewhere .
" You did n't hand it out to younger guys , but it could be a silver bullet to make connections to the older ones , " said one retired operative familiar with the drug 's use in Afghanistan .
Afghan tribal leaders often had four wives - the maximum number allowed by the Quran - and aging village patriarchs were easily sold on the utility of a pill that could " put them back in an authoritative position , " the official said .
Not everyone in Afghanistan 's hinterlands had heard of the drug , leading to some awkward encounters when Americans delicately attempted to explain its effects , taking care not to offend their hosts ' religious sensitivities .
Such was the case with the 60 - year - old chieftain who received the four pills from a U.S. operative .
According to the retired operative who was there , the man was a clan leader in southern Afghanistan who had been wary of Americans - neither supportive nor actively opposed .
The man had extensive knowledge of the region , and his village controlled key passages through the area .
U.S. forces needed his cooperation and worked hard to win it , the retired operative said .
After a long conversation through an interpreter , the retired operator began to probe for ways to win the man 's loyalty .
A discussion of the man 's family and many wives provided inspiration .
Once it was established that the man was in good health , the pills were offered and accepted .
Four days later , when the Americans returned , the gift had worked its magic , the operative recalled .
" He came up to us beaming , " the official said .
" He said , ' You are a great man . ' "
JEFF LARSON’S OTHER CAREER ….
We talked just the other day about McCain having hired FLS - Connect , a robocal firm led by Republican activist and Karl Rove protege Jeff Larson — the same Larson that Bush hired eight years ago to destroy McCain with scurrilous robocalls .
Today , Larson ’s name came up in a very different context .
Everyone now knows that the Republican National Committee spent more than $ 150,000 on clothes and accessories for the Palin family since late August .
But guess who was doing the shopping ?
[ B]uried in the same FEC disclosure form that revealed Palin ’s taste for the fine life is the name of the man who appears to have been her personal shopper : Jeff Larson .
Under FEC regulations , the RNC must file what is called a “ Schedule F form , ” which lists “ expenditures made by political committees or designated agents ( s ) on behalf of candidates for federal office . ” [… ]
Along with the matching dates and dollar totals , note the “ Transaction ID Number , ” which clearly connects the questionable expenditures with reimbursement payments made to Larson . [… ]
What ’s so incompetent about this from a political tradecraft perspective is that both parties ordinarily take the easy precaution of making sure such embarrassing material is n’t obvious to reporters , which they do by routing the payment through a law firm or consultant .
Here they neglected to do so .
A different Jeff Larson , perhaps ?
No such luck .
The New York Times confirms that the Republican consultant and robocall - firm executive bought Palin ’s clothes and was reimbursed by the RNC .
But wait , there ’s more .
Noting the “ six degrees of GOP sleaze , ” Josh Marshall reminds us , “ Jeff Larson is not only John McCain ’s chief robocaller and Sen.
Palin ’s $ 150 k clothes shopper , he ’s also the guy who ’s giving that sweetheart rental deal on his apartment in DC ” to Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - Minn . ) .
Amazing .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Departing U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey said on Wednesday that he saw no reason for prosecutions or for pardons for those who gave legal advice on the Bush administration ’s terrorism policies .
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey speaks about the Administration 's legal approach in the conflict with al Qaeda and the implications of the Supreme Court 's ruling on Guantanamo Bay detainees at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington July 21 , 2008 .

Some human rights groups have urged President - elect Barack Obama to launch criminal investigations into the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques on al Qaeda terrorism suspects .
They also have questioned whether the Bush administration broke the law with its warrantless domestic spying program adopted after the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
Obama ’s advisers have yet to say what he will do , but one idea being considered is creating an independent commission , like the one that investigated the September 11 attacks , to examine the interrogation policies .
There has been speculation that President George W. Bush , before he leaves office next month and hands over to Obama , might give pardons to past or present officials implicated in the harsh interrogation methods or other abuses .
Mukasey told reporters at the Justice Department that he did not see the need for prosecutions or for pardons .
“ There is absolutely no evidence that anybody who rendered a legal opinion either with respect to surveillance or with respect to interrogation policy did so for any reason other than to protect the security of the country and in the belief that he or she was doing something lawful , ” he said .
“ In those circumstances , there is no occasion to consider prosecutions , there is no occasion to consider pardons , ” Mukasey said .
Mukasey said he had not yet met with Eric Holder , a Washington lawyer who has been selected by Obama as the new attorney general , and he declined to say what advice he would give him .
But Mukasey noted changes at the Justice Department since Holder served as deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton , with the creation of the national security division .
Asked about the potential for an attack in the United States during the transition period to Obama , Mukasey replied , “ Terrorist groups strike when they are ready to strike , ” not according to the political calendar or schedule of events .
Obama has vowed he will close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , which now holds about 255 terrorism suspects .
Mukasey said he strongly believed that none of the detainees should be released into the United States .
And if one of the dangerous detainees receives a short sentence from a military tribunal , Mukasey said it would be “ suicidal ” to release that person after the sentence has been served .
Asked if that was justice , he answered , “ Yes . ”
Mukasey , a former federal judge , said he planned to go back to New York , but said he had not yet decided what he will do .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
India 's air force geared up for possible missions against suspected terrorist camps in Pakistan in the immediate aftermath of November 's Mumbai attacks , U.S. military officials told CNN Monday .
One U.S. official said India 's air force " went on alert " after the attacks in Mumbai .
Pakistan said it would defend itself if attacked .
" We do n't want to go to war , " Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Gilani announced during a speech at the National Assembly on Monday .
" But if the war is thrust on us , we will stand united like a respectful nation . "
While the officials characterized the Indian actions as preliminary preparations to position the air force if strikes were ordered , the comments indicate that the two nuclear powers were perhaps closer to conflict than previously acknowledged .
Three Pentagon officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , have individually confirmed to CNN that the United States has information indicating that India began to prepare air force personnel for a possible mission .
The officials offered few details , but one said India 's air force " went on alert . "
A second official said the United States concluded these preliminary preparations would put India in a position to move swiftly against suspected terrorist camps and targets inside Pakistan , before adding that a number of senior U.S. officials urged India to exercise restraint during this time .
An Indian air force official had no comment .
CNN sister network CNN - IBN reported last week that the air force had been put on its highest level of readiness and that the aircraft had been armed .
" We are certainly against terrorism , but that does n't mean that we go at war with any country , " Indian Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major told CNN - IBN Thursday , adding that any decision on military action would be " up to the government because the air force and the army are there only to carry out the will of the government . "
Air Commodore Homayoon Ziqar , a spokesman for the Pakistani air force , told CNN that Pakistan is not on heightened alert at the moment .
" Everything is normal , " he said .
Another source in Pakistan 's military also said the air force is not on heightened alert , but added , " We are always ready , on weekends , on holidays , no matter what the circumstances . "
Since the Mumbai attacks , Pakistani security forces raided a camp near Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistani - controlled Kashmir , according to military sources .
It was the first sign of government action against Lashkar - e - Tayyiba since the Mumbai attacks .
India says the Pakistan - based Islamic militant group was behind the killings of more than 160 people in Mumbai .
Watch Miss Pakistan talk about the Mumbai attacks »
Also , Pakistani authorities have banned a charity linked to last month 's attacks and placed its leader under house arrest .
The move came after the U.N. Security Council designated the charity , Jamaat - ud - Dawa , a terror organization because of its links to Lashkar - e - Tayyiba .
Gilani's promise that Pakistan would defend itself came amid mounting international pressure for him to crack down on Lashkar - e - Tayyiba .
U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm . Mike Mullen said he was " encouraged " that Pakistan arrested two of the group 's top leaders last week , saying it amounted to the first steps toward determining who plotted the Mumbai siege .
Indian police say the only surviving suspect from the Mumbai attacks , identified by Indian authorities as 21 - year - old Mohammad Ajmal Kasab , is from Pakistan 's Punjab province and the other nine attackers also were from Pakistan .
Pakistani officials have denied that assertion , blaming instead " stateless actors . "
Until now , the Bush Administration has publicly said it saw no signs of military movement by India and no indication that the Indian government was preparing any type of retaliation .
The Pentagon officials broadly described the activity as checking the status of crews , fighter jets and weapons that were available .
The extent of the reported preparation was not immediately known .
Also , one of the Pentagon officials confirmed that the United States has intelligence indicating a single Indian aircraft violated Pakistani airspace twice on Saturday .
The United States believes the incursion was inadvertent , the official said , adding that there is no information to indicate it was planned .
Meanwhile , suspected U.S. missile strikes continued to hammer Pakistan 's tribal region , killing three people in a North Waziristan village Monday evening , according to a Pakistani military official .
Monday 's strike is the 29th suspected U.S. missile strike in Pakistan this year .
CNN 's Reza Sayah and Zein Basravi contributed to this report .

" I did not say that we reject all cinema , but I said that we were not consulted during the organisation of these movie showings , " he explained .
" I could see how some people might think the test would pigeonhole your child into doing fewer sports or being exposed to fewer things , but I still think it ’s good to match them with the right activity , ” Ms. Campiglia , 36 , said as she watched a toddler class at Boulder Indoor Soccer in which Noah struggled to take direction from the coach between juice and potty breaks . "
“ I think it would prevent a lot of parental frustration , ” she said .
Doing any type of performance based sport talent identification testing is very difficult below age 6 due to developmental levels of motor skills , strength and eye - hand coordination .
Atlas First looks at only genetic markers , specifically the presence of ACTN3 .
The presence or absence of genetic markers associated with ACTN3 have been shown to have a strong correlation to the ability of the human body do well in sports that have more characteristics with Speed / Power events ( ie. Football , soccer , volleyball , basketball ) vs. those that are more pre-disposed to characteristics associated with endurance sports ( ie. Cycling , cross country skiing , distance running ) .
Knowing this information may be helpful , not in eliminating choices for sport activities but adding exposure to a host of team or individual sport events that may come easier to a young athlete .
" We did not find significant differences in genotype distributions among the groups except for the ACE gene - that is , lower ( P< 0.05 ) proportion of II in rowers ( 10.3 % ) than in the total subject population ( 22.3 % ) .
In summary , sports performance is likely polygenic with the combined effect of hundreds of genetic variants , one possibly being the ACE ID polymorphism ( at least in the sports studied here ) but many others remain to be identified . "
Our data suggest that alpha - actinin - 3 deficiency is not a major influence on performance in African athletes .
In conclusion , the R577X polymorphism within the ACTN3 gene was not associated with ultra-endurance performance in the 2000 and 2001 South African Ironman Triathlons .
In summary , although the alpha - actinin - 3 deficient XX genotype may be detrimental for sprint performance in humans , the R577X polymorphism of the ACTN3 gene does not appear to confer an advantage on the ability of male athletes to sustain extreme endurance performance .
Would n't it be great to know if your three - year - old has the potential to be a soccer star or a top marathon runner ?
One genetic testing company is offering to tell you just that , so that all of you obsessive , controlling parents can get your toddlers in the proper training program right from the start .
I'm sure most of you are probably cringing at the thought of using genetics to decide what sort of future you 're going to push your kid into before she can even brush her own teeth .
But even if you are a parent who sees nothing wrong using a little prior information to get a head start on your kid's bright athletic career , DON'T DO IT !
Leaving ethical arguments aside , there are good reasons to stay away from these tests : they are not good predictors of athletic performance .
The test at issue is one for a particular version of the ACTN3 gene , which in most people produces a muscle protein .
However there is a variant of the gene which fails to produce a viable protein , which we 'll call the X variant .
The ' normal ' variant is the R variant , and since you have two copies of ACTN3 in your genome ( one from each parent ) , you can have two X copies ( XX ) , two R copies ( RR ) , or you could be heterozygous and have one of each ( XR ) .
2003 paper published by a University of Sydney group found that elite sprint athletes tended to have at least one copy of the R variant .
They also found that more elite female sprint athletes frequently had the RX genotype , while female endurance athletes did not have the RX combination as frequently .
This is a clear example of muscle gene variant having an effect on elite athletic performance .
But it 's logically flawed to go from that research to a genetic test to predict whether your child will be better at football or cross-country .
And yet that is exactly what one company has done , as The New York Times reports .
Atlas Sports Genetics offers to test your toddler for the ACTN3 X variant .
In the story , some parents are ready to jump at the chance : Atlas Sports Genetics offers the same argument : Unfortunately the test is n't going to prevent any parental frustration .
Even if we make the dubious assumption that you can match your toddler with the " right activity " to maximally develop her future athletic potential , the test is useless for achieving that .
In the NY Times story , the scientists interviewed were skeptical to the point of calling such genetic tests " new versions of snake oil . "
I agree .
The reason this test is not a good predictor of your child 's athletic potential is this : the effects of almost any genetic variant you have depends on the context - dozens or possibly hundreds of other genetic variants in your genome .
You may have the RX combination of ACTN3 variants , but whether you are a great sprinter almost surely depends on variants in many other genes ( and of course environmental factors ) .
With a ' bad ' combination of other genes , your ACTN3 RX genotype may be meaningless , and in fact you may be a better distance runner than sprinter .
The research done by the University of Sydney group showed that the RX ACTN3 genotype probably had an impact in some elite athletes , but certainly not all , and the study said nothing about those who are non-elite athletes - maybe having the ACTN3 RX combination only makes a big difference in performance at the elite level .
Let 's look at the numbers from the study : 52 % of the ' control ' , non-elite - athletic subjects were RX , 45 % of elite sprinters were RX , and 45 % of the endurance runners were RX .
If you look at just females , the differences are more pronounced : 50 % of controls were RX , compared with 57 % of sprinters and 35 % percent of distance runners .
In males , the distribution was reversed : only 39 % of sprinters were RX and 52 % of distance runners were RX .
In other words , if you pick any one individual out of the study and look at that person 's ACTN3 genotype , it does n't tell you very much .
It gets worse .
This effect only shows up in certain populations .
Since 2003 , other studies have come out on ACTN3 and athletics :
If you find out that your child is RX , what are you going to do ?
Your female child may very well have the potential to be a fantastic long - distance runner , but if you believe the results of the test , you 're going to steer her in the direction of speed / power sports .
Your rambunctious RX toddler may have some genetic potential to be a great wide receiver , but later he may hate football and love distance running , meaning that he 'll be much more dedicated to working hard at the sport he loves , and thus more likely to excel at it .
So before you go and blow your money on a genetic test , remember that while , on average , a certain genetic variant may have a certain effect in a certain population , the chances are good it does not have that effect in you or your child .
Most of the athletic traits we 're interested in are probably modulated by variants of maybe dozens of genes , and the impact of any one genetic variant depends on what other variants are around .
Perhaps some day we 'll be able to test for combinations of dozens of genetic variants and make better predictions about your toddler 's athletic potential , if you care badly enough to know .
In the mean time , you 're better off taking that $ 149 and spending it on gymnastics or swimming lessons , or whatever activity your kid enjoys .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - North Korea threatened to stop taking apart its nuclear plant that makes bomb - grade plutonium unless Japan provides it with energy aid as part of an international disarmament deal , Kyodo news agency said on Monday .
The threat is the latest snag in the sputtering deal the North struck with five regional powers and comes about two weeks after the United States called for a halt in all energy aid to punish Pyongyang for failing to agree this month to a system to check claims it made about its atomic programs .
Kyodo quoted a Beijing - based diplomat who participates in the six - way nuclear talks as saying : “ Unless Japan implements the heavy fuel assistance , the ( disablement ) activities will be suspended . ”
Kyodo later said Yoshihiro Kawakami , a Japanese lawmaker from the opposition Democratic Party , had quoted the diplomat as making the remarks in a meeting in the Chinese capital .
Japan has said it would not provide fuel aid unless the North settles problems caused by its agents abducting Japanese citizens decades ago and holding them in the reclusive communist state .
North Korea has received about half of the 1 million metric tons of heavy fuel oil , or aid of equal value , as a part of the deal it struck with China , Japan , Russia , South Korea and the United States for previous progress it has made on ending its nuclear arms program .
Energy - starved and destitute North Korea relies heavily on fuel aid to keep its few factories running .
The Beijing - based diplomat also said that 90 percent of the disablement work at the Yongbyon nuclear complex , which is capable of making weapons - grade plutonium , has been completed under the terms of last year ’s denuclearization - for - aid deal , Kyodo reported .
Kawakami , an executive of a Japanese non-partisan group of lawmakers seeking to promote normalization of Tokyo ’s ties with Pyongyang , had quoted the diplomat as saying the remaining 10 percent depended on Japan ’s willingness to fulfill its obligations under the multilateral deal , Kyodo said .
South Korea has also called on Japan to contribute fuel aid , saying each country in the talks has bilateral problems with North Korea but ending Pyongyang ’s atomic ambitions is a much greater concern than the grievances of any one country .
Most of the steps to disable the North ’s Soviet - era Yongbyon nuclear plant have been completed .
The steps are designed in total to take a year to reverse .
A think - tank affiliated with South Korea ’s Foreign Ministry said separately the North may want to test U.S. President - elect Barack Obama ’s team after it takes office in January .
“ We cannot rule out a possibility that North Korea may threaten to suspend its denuclearization process , boycott the six - party talks and fire missiles or a test nuclear weapon ... so as to tame the new Obama administration , ” Yonhap news agency quoted the report from the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security as saying .
As you may already know , the One Laptop Per Child project produced its first working prototype last week at the Red Hat Summit in Nashville , Tennessee .
