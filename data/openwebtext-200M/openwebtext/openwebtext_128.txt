WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates expressed concern on Thursday about the increasing sophistication of China ’s military and called on Beijing to be more open about its intentions .
Gates said a new annual Pentagon assessment of China ’s military , due to be released on Friday , depicts “ a country that has steadily devoted increasing resources to their military , that is developing some very sophisticated capabilities . ”
“ Some of the capabilities that are being developed are of concern , ” he told reporters at the Pentagon .
The China Military Power Report issued by the Pentagon last year said China ’s buildup retained a long - standing focus on rival Taiwan but that years of double - digit growth in arms spending gave it the ability to project power further afield .
Gates , who has seen the 2007 report , said the new document would not contain “ any exaggeration of the threat ” and reiterated a long - held U.S. call for greater Chinese transparency about its intentions and strategies .
“ These are assessments that are in this publication , ” he said .
“ It would be nice to hear first - hand from the Chinese how they view some of these things . ”
Chinese President Hu Jintao said on Wednesday his country must build up more modern armed forces to safeguard national security , according to the official Xinhua news agency .
The expansion of China ’s navy includes a growing submarine fleet and new ships suitable for the open seas , fueling fears in the United States that its military could alter the balance of power in Asia .
China has said it would attack Taiwan if the self - ruled island , which Beijing views as a renegade province , formally declares independence .
NY Times editor : Founding fathers feared such an ' imperial presidency '

In a strongly worded column published in Monday 's New York Times , Assistant Editor Adam Cohen argues that America 's founding fathers feared an " imperial presidency " such as George W. Bush 's when drafting the Constitution .
Cohen , a lawyer and member of the Times editorial board since 2002 , writes , " The nation is heading toward a constitutional showdown over the Iraq war .
Congress is moving closer to passing a bill to limit or end the war , but President Bush insists Congress doesnt have the power to do it .
' I dont think Congress ought to be running the war , ' he said at a recent press conference .
' I think they ought to be funding the troops . '
He added magnanimously : ' I m certainly interested in their opinion . ' "
" The war is hardly the only area where the Bush administration is trying to expand its powers beyond all legal justification , " Cohen continues .
" But the danger of an imperial presidency is particularly great when a president takes the nation to war , something the founders understood well .
In the looming showdown , the founders and the Constitution are firmly on Congresss side . "
Excerpts from column : #
The founders would have been astonished by President Bushs assertion that Congress should simply write him blank checks for war .
They gave Congress the power of the purse so it would have leverage to force the president to execute their laws properly .
Madison described Congresss control over spending as  the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people , for obtaining a redress of every grievance , and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure .
.... Members of Congress should not be intimidated into thinking that they are overstepping their constitutional bounds .
If the founders were looking on now , it is not Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi who would strike them as out of line , but George W. Bush , who would seem less like a president than a king .

RCTV 's imminent closure drew thousands onto the streets
The head of the RCTV station addressed the marchers , urging them to defend freedom and " free independent media " .
President Chavez has said he will not renew a licence for the RCTV network which is due to expire on 27 May .
He accuses the opposition - allied TV station of supporting a failed coup against him in 2002 .
He has referred to opposition television stations in general as " horsemen of the apocalypse " and has blamed RCTV in particular for spreading immorality with its steamy soap operas .
Mr Chavez plans to replace RCTV with a government - funded TV station .
Bolivar citation
Marcel Garnier , RCTV 's managing director , told a crowd of cheering protesters in Caracas that Mr Chavez was trying to " topple the country over the precipice of totalitarianism where not even his own supporters can express their opinions " .
He said the president should pay more attention to the words of Simon Bolivar , a hero of Mr Chavez famed for leading South Americans in the fight against colonialism .
" He who rules must listen , the people are speaking , " Mr Garnier said , quoting Bolivar .
President Chavez was re-elected by a landslide last year .
His welfare spending programme has won him massive support among the poor but his opponents accuse him of turning the country into an increasingly authoritarian socialist state , modelled on Fidel Castro 's Cuba .

DIGG THIS
Every year , I nervously wait for the grim news of mass starvation in the U.S. Millions in America are creeping to death ’s door on the brink of complete hunger .
These masses , due to the inequality of our society , are utterly desperate for food .
Or so " hunger relief " groups in this country would like to have us think .
These organizations constantly publish statistics with completely absurd numbers such as :
" 35.1 million people — including 12.4 million children — live in households that experience hunger or the risk of hunger .
This represents more than one in ten households in the United States ( 11.0 percent ) .
3.9 percent of U.S. households experience hunger .
Some people in these households frequently skip meals or eat too little , sometimes going without food for a whole day .
10.8 million people , including 606 thousand children , live in these homes .
7.1 percent of U.S. households are at risk of hunger .
Members of these households have lower quality diets or must resort to seeking emergency food because they cannot always afford the food they need .
24.4 million people , including 11.8 million children , live in these homes . "
~ Bread for the World
These numbers never seem to hit reality .
If anything America is one of the most obese nations in the world .
A quick drive through poor sections of New Orleans easily reminds me of this .
This supposed 11 % of hungry people are nowhere to be found .
Instead of looking skinny and gaunt , most of the people in these neighborhoods look plump and overstuffed .
Other groups point out concerns in different areas .
The American Obesity Association now claims that over 64.5 % of Americans over the age of 20 are overweight .
Now , one of the two here has to be wrong .
The U.S. ca n’t be both starving and getting overweight at the same time .
It just does n’t make sense .
From my personal experience seeing overweight poor everywhere , I ’m going to take a guess that this is the false one .
The only people starving in this country are over privileged rich white girls trying to look like Paris Hilton .
Let ’s be frank here , there ’s lots of things that can go wrong in America .
You can lose a job , get kicked out your house , and end up on the street .
But going hungry is something that ’s very difficult to accomplish .
It can usually only be done by sticking a finger down your throat and vomiting while trying to keep your new Prada purse puke - free .
If a person is really broke , food is the last thing that ’s out of affordability range .
Dollar Menus at fast food places alone could keep a person from starving .
At most a homeless person would have to beg for $ 3 and get 3 double cheeseburgers at McDonald’s .
That ’s enough calories to keep a person going .
This is hardly starvation .
If not that , are n’t there plenty of even cheaper avenues for food ?
One of my favorite dishes to make is jambalaya .
Whenever I have a large amount of guests , I prepare this New Orleanian treat .
You gotta buy a sausage and mix for about $ 5 , add about two cups of rice , and you ’ve got yourself enough food to feed 5 — 8 people .
If you cook , food is not that expensive .
The jambalaya costs about 80 cents per person .
These just seem like simple ways to save money to me .
But who am I to comment on this with reason and rationality .
The all - wise government USDA explains how these 35.1 million people are at the risk of not having food security and being hungry .
These statistics are not based on how much food a person consumes but instead on how much money a person spends on food .
If you are a certain amount below the median for U.S. households , you are considered hungry .
Of course this median is calculated by adding the price of all food including restaurants !
Perhaps , the statistics would make a little sense if the comparison was in grocery bills .
But no , your bill at a fine dining establishment is calculated inside these fabulously accurate statistics to determine whether you are hungry or not .
The USDA says that a person has food insecurity at $ 30 — $ 32.50 a week .
According to them , the average person spends $ 40 a week on food .
I suddenly realized the horrible truth of these statistics .
They told me something about myself that I did n’t know before .
If I do n’t go to a restaurant this week , I ’ll be STARVING !!!!!
The USDA must be alerted quickly .
I was left out of statistics the true number is 35.1 million people plus one !
My grocery bill is split with my brother / roommate .
Being a college student , I shop pretty conservatively , buying only what I need with occasional frills such as new spice or expensive olive oil .
I enjoy making cheaper foods and saving money with things like jambalaya , Cuban dishes , and the classic red beans / rice .
My grocery bill amounts to $ 150 for two weeks .
If I took out the frills , I could probably get the bill easily to $ 120 .
Split in two ; this would be $ 60 on my part .
And $ 60 divided by 2 weeks is $ 30 dollars .
At six feet tall and 230 pounds , I ’m one of the 35.1 million hungry people in the United States .
These statistics are another perversion of economic research that does not consider human action .
Setting standards of middle class food spending to the poor and calling the lack of spending hunger is simply ridiculous .
When you ’re broke , you hold off on the restaurants , and you buy cheaper food .
People react to prices and budget constraints .
This alarmism of hunger in the U.S. is desperate anti-capitalist propaganda attempting to disguise the obvious outright gluttony in this country .
Some people try to twist the facts .
This is almost outright fabrication with the use of statistical science .
Only through understanding human action , using reason , and common sense can we identify true problems worthy of immediate attention .
Until then check your local news and you wo n’t find anyone other than anorexics starving in mass numbers .
Food is perhaps the only thing everyone has in great plentitude .
It ’s time to come back to reason and common sense when faced with these absurd statistics that cover almost all " hunger relief " websites .
The web of lies attempting to undermine our country with anti-capitalist propaganda easily unravels to those willing to seek the truth .
These people try to use their emotional persuasion to keep dissenters quiet .
Who would say theses kids are n’t starving ?
I personally have had enough of emotional appeals disguising blatant lies in an attempt to cover up the truth about hunger in America as well as many other issues .
No longer should this level of obfuscation be tolerated especially when the information comes from charitable organizations .
This does n’t mean that everyone is eating right ; the obesity and overweight statistics point this out on the other side of the coin .
Not every day of the year is everyone stuffed popping the buttons of their shirts .
But to suggest that America has 35.1 million hungry people is outrageous .
The Best of Vedran Vuk
I may be a die - hard Cleveland Indians fan , but that does n't mean I 'll go to the ballpark just for the games .
I often choose what tickets I buy based on the promotions .
So far this season I 've bought tickets to fireworks night , half - price college ID night and dollar dog night .
While I always enjoy my free flashlight or bobblehead , there have been some fan promotions that did n't go so well .
Here 's a look at five that failed :
Cleveland Municipal Stadium , 1974
The Promotion : 10 - Cent Beer Night .
To bring fans to see the miserable Cleveland Indians , management decided to sell 10 - ounce cups of beer for only 10 cents at a game against the Texas Rangers .
What went wrong : Management forgot one small detail : drunk people get restless .
More than 25,000 fans showed up for the event , most of them already tipsy at the gate .
Among the more tame incidents was a woman who flashed the crowd from the on - deck circle , a father - son team mooning the players ( good bonding experience , I guess ) and fans jumping on the field to meet shake hands with the outfielders .
Then , in the bottom of the ninth , the Indians tied the game , but never got a chance to win .
Fans started throwing batteries , golf balls , cups and rocks onto the field and one even took the glove of the Rangers right fielder .
As the player rushed into the stands to get his glove back , fans starting swarming the field to stop him and threw chairs to block his way .
The Outcome : The Indians were forced to forfeit the game and nine fans were arrested .
The AL president forced the franchise to abandon the promotion idea after understating " There was no question that beer played a great part in the affair . " 
Cash drop night , All - you - can - eat seat night , and more bad ideas after the break .
Comiskey Park , 1979
The Promotion : Disco Demolition Night .
White Sox fans were encouraged to bring old disco records to the park in exchange for a reduced admission price of 98 cents .
The records were to be destroyed in between the two games of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers .
What went wrong : Believe it or not , a lot of people wanted to see disco records destroyed .
50,000 people showed up at the gates and many who were turned away at the gate tried to climb the walls of the stadium to get in .
The crowd , who were reportedly heavily under the influence , soon realized that records could double as Frisbees , which naturally led to fans throwing firecrackers and drinks .
When the demolition moment came , the explosion was bigger than expected and ended up ripping a hole in the outfield grass .
Thousands of fans ran onto the field to join the mayhem , burning banners and throwing objects .
The batting cages were even destroyed in the riot .
The outcome : The Tigers refused to take the field , forcing the White Sox to forfeit the game .
The quick patch job on the outfield left the grass uneven and players complained about it for the rest of the season .
Dodger Stadium , 1995
The Promotion : Ball Night .
Fans entering the game were given a souvenir baseball .
What went wrong :
Turns out baseballs are pretty convenient things to throw .
In the seventh inning , fans threw balls at an opposing outfielder when he bobbled a play .
The real drama happened in the bottom of the ninth , though .
Dodger Raul Mondesi and manager Tommy Lasorda were ejected for arguing a strikeout call , inspiring about 200 fans to throw their promotional balls onto the field .
The umps urged the Cardinals to stay on the field , but finally decided to end the game after more fans decided to contribute their gifts to the game .
The Outcome : The Dodgers were forced to forfeit the game , the first forfeit in the National League in 41 years .
Fifth Third Ballpark , 2006
The Promotion : Cash Drop .
The West Michigan Whitecaps , Detroit 's class - A affiliate , had a helicopter drop $ 1,000 in various bills from a helicopter after a game .
What went wrong : People love money more than they love other people .
Two children were injured scrambling for the cash .
A girl received a bloody lip being pushed to the ground , while a seven - year - old boy was bruised when he got trampled in the fray .
The Outcome : The boy was taken to the hospital , but released after treatment .
The team management summed up the incident by reminding everyone that they had signed waivers .
Dodger Stadium , 2007
The Promotions : All - you - can - eat seats .
Undoing the work of Shaq and Cookie Monster , the Dodgers decided to promote obesity by opening up a section of all - you - can - eat seats .
Although beer , ice cream and candy are still for sale , most food is just given away .
Ticket prices range from $ 20 - $ 40 .
What went wrong :
Not everybody can handle an open buffet of hot dogs and nachos .
One Slate reporter wrote about his experience in the seats , which predictably ended in vomit .
I can only imagine that countless other fans have had their evenings end in a similar way .
The Outcome : Despite the upchucking , the seats remain open and usually draw between 2,000 and 4,000 fans a night .
In fact , the Dodgers have declared the promotion a success and have reached the second - highest attendance in baseball .
Other stadiums have contacted the Dodgers about copying the idea .
I hate folding laundry .
So , when I recently had to fold some laundry , I was feeling impatient and irritated .
The laundry was n’t going to fold itself , and I was running out of clothes .
Despite my internal protests , it would have to get done .
I figured it would only take a few minutes and then I could get back to the more enjoyable parts of my day .
Then it hit me .
I was resisting folding the laundry .
The whole time I was rolling socks and sorting shirts my mind was elsewhere .
Instead of simply accepting that the laundry needed to be done and experiencing that , I was resisting it .
Then I began to wonder .
How many other things in life am I resisting instead of accepting and experiencing them ?
Resistance is Futile
What do I mean by resistance ?
I do n’t like a lot of spiritual authors because they are unable to break down words into a core concept .
Instead they resort to fancy wordplay to dance around an idea that they ca n’t communicate .
I ’d like to try to avoid that error here .
Resistance means denying where you are right now .
Struggle and challenge to meet a higher goal is an important and honorable part of life .
But I ’m not talking about resistance against challenges but deceiving yourself at what is happening right now .
Let ’s say you want to travel to Paris .
You go to book a ticket online .
You enter in Paris as the destination , but when it asks for the location of departure , you freeze .
You ca n’t admit to yourself you are where you are .
Instead of simply accepting your current location and entering it , you resist .
It sounds silly to think of resisting a physical location .
But what about your life situation ?
I think a lot of people are caught between resisting their current location and seeking out a new one .
A Battle of Paradigms : Be Happy VS Be Successful
Why does this happen ?
Why should we resist what is , especially when it impairs our ability to go forward ?
I think the answer lies in a clash between the obligations to be happy and be successful .
Be Happy .
To most , depression is a sign of weakness .
Same goes for other negative emotions .
Being frustrated , sad or angry are signs you can’t properly deal with the world .
Although this is n’t the truth , it is a pervasive belief .
Therefore people do their best to hide and avoid negative feelings .
Both out of a desire to be happy and because they feel it would be shameful not to .
Be Successful .
The conflicting paradigm is that you should be successful .
This means you should n’t just have emotional success in maintaining happiness but you should have wealth , health and status .
These two ideas create resistance .
Be happy causes resistance of emotions and be successful causes resistance of circumstance .
This would n’t be such a large problem if the two did n’t overlap .
The clash occurs when evaluating the success in your life it is n’t enough .
This causes feelings of unhappiness , creating resistance with the expectation to be happy .
The other clash occurs when you have success but you feel unhappy thoughts .
This can cause you to see your success as diminished , creating more resistance .
No matter where you go there is resistance .
Denying the truth of your feelings and circumstances .
How to Accept
The opposite of resistance is acceptance .
This is complete honesty with yourself about how you feel , what you are doing and where you are in life .
It does n’t mean you need to like it , just that you fully accept that it is true .
Resisting Activity – Here is the Zen of folding laundry .
Chores can be a source of resistence if you are actively trying to deny that you are doing them .
Acceptance here means admitting to yourself that , right now , you are folding laundry and not doing anything else .
– Here is the Zen of folding laundry .
Chores can be a source of resistence if you are actively trying to deny that you are doing them .
Acceptance here means admitting to yourself that , right now , you are folding laundry and not doing anything else .
Resisting Circumstances – Like everyone , I ’ve had periods of loneliness where I ’m in relative isolation .
When this happens , I ’ve learned to completely accept my temporary solitude , even though I dislike it .
– Like everyone , I ’ve had periods of loneliness where I ’m in relative isolation .
When this happens , I ’ve learned to completely accept my temporary solitude , even though I dislike it .
Resisting Emotion –
If you feel depressed , admit that to yourself .
Accept that you are depressed right now .
Accept your emotions as if they were the color of your shirt rather than a symbol of your character .
Not something to resist or feel ashamed of but just a fact .
Acceptance Is n’t Giving Up
In fact it is often the complete opposite .
Acceptance is like our trip to Paris , knowing our location of departure .
Without knowing where you are now , you ca n’t possibly reach your destination .
Giving up means taking acceptance ( “ this is what is , right now . ” ) and moving it a step further ( “ this is what will be forever . ” )
You can accept current depression with both the optimism to see a happier future and the willingness to work towards it .
You can accept a life you dislike and set goals to improve it .
Resistance ’s Mild Deception
Most failures to accept the current situation are n’t complete lies .
They are n’t entire frauds , completely disregarding the truth .
Instead they are distractions and oversights .
Mild deceptions that do n’t remove the truth but resist it nonetheless , pushing it into an area of slight disbelief .
Lost Socks and Folded Laundry
As I finished folding my laundry , I got a chance to reflect on my current position .
To move out of my head for a few seconds .
To accept everything around me , without bias or judgment .
Then I just noticed how I felt without censoring or distortion .
Some of it made me happy , some did n’t .
I accepted that too .
With the clothes in the drawers I can hear the birds outside .
They make me smile and give me the strange feeling that I had n’t heard them before .
Peak Oil Peak Oil : An Update By Ryan McGreal
Published February 26 , 2007
RTH has n't published much about the peak oil hypothesis recently ; not because we 've given up on the theory , but because not much has happened recently to cause us to revise our assessment of the situation .
The Oil Drum just analyzed the latest data from the US Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) , and their graph of total world production is instructive :
EIA World Oil Production , 1980 - 2007 ( Source : The Oil Drum )
After two decades of almost continuous growth , global oil production has been stagnant around 84 million barrels a day for the past two years .
This , of course , is exactly consistent with the peak oil hypothesis , which predicts that supply constraints will force up prices , destroying growth in demand .
It will be some years before we can tell for certain , but it is entirely possible that we 're in the middle of peak oil right now .
That 's certainly consistent with the predictions of Kenneth Deffeyes , Colin Campbell , Matthew Simmons , and other geologists and oil industry analysts .
This has n't stopped the peak oil deniers from continuing to press their suit .
Vaclav Smil , an instructor at the University of Manitoba , recently wrote an article for TCS Daily , a right - wing web magazine , that manages to obfuscate mightily on the matter .
Proving that you can demonstrate any trend if you pick the right start and end dates , Smil argued that a modest recent increase was evidence that the peak oilers are wrong , even as OPEC cut its production .
( Of course , he fails to consider that perhaps OPEC cut its production because it cannot continue to expand it . )
He crowed about the fact that oil prices dropped from over $ 70 a barrel in July 2006 to $ 55 in December .
As I write this , Bloomberg reports that futures are trading for $ 61 a barrel .
He also took Saudi Aramco at its word that it can increase production to 11 million BPD by 2011 , even though the company already admitted that it cannot entirely offset declines in its Ghawar oilfield .
Flat production is flat production .
Despite the very high prices and widespread demand destruction , especially in poorer countries , oil producers have not brought more supply on - stream .
That 's just bizarre , unless the oil producers can't bring more supply on - stream .
Some of the biggest producers - Saudi Arabia , Mexico , and the North Sea - are past their production peaks and declining inexorably .
The smaller producers can barely replace those declines , let alone produce a net increase .
Are we really to believe that OPEC simply cut their production because they like pricing their customers out of the market ?

There is absolutly no way anyone on the internet could have not noticed that we hate the MPAA and the RIAA .
Here ’s the internet ’s standpoint in a nutshell in case you ’re on AOL .
The record and movie industries have somehow forced laws and copy protection upon us that prohibit us from doing anything with our commercial audio / video media ( DVDs , HD - DVDs , BlueRay Discs , CDs , … ) except use them in the most traditional sense : put your cd in the cd player and watch your movies on your TV .
They often make us purchase another copy of the material for a different use and do n’t allow us to make backup copies of our own stuff .
( No !
We do n’t want to give it away to other people , just make a copy so in case the original gets scratched we do n’t haveto buy another one … )
We think this is stupid .
Their copy protection gets in the way of legitimate use .
Many have resorted to piracy because it is a ) free and b ) more user - friendly .
Those who do n’t pirate , but still wo n’t put up with their crap are forced to break the law by circumventing copy protection .
We ’re fighting a cat and mouse game .
We crack them , they lock us down and shut down our internetz .
We ’re convinced that if they stopped with their anal schemes everyone would profit .
We would enjoy our media more , and in the end , they would make more money .
Please put your emotions aside for a moment and take a minute to analyze the situation from a sober point of view .
Ever thought we may be wrong ?
I mean … do multi-billion dollar companies really “ not get it ” ?
Here ’s what I think .
What huge music / film production companies want is :
a ) money
b ) more money
c ) you get the point …
In order to make more money , they hire people who will try and figure out how they could best make more money .
They have analysts and analyst - analysts and these analysts have a gigantic budget available available to them .
They do studies and market research and apparently the results of their analysis has shown that if these companies were to give in to our demands , their overall profits will go down .
I know you think this is wrong , hell I think it ’s wrong based on all my knowledge , but believe me , if they would actually make more money by opening up their systems , they would do it .
Why do we assume that gigantic corporations just do n’t have the brains to make logical conclusions about this topic ?
It ’s only in their interest to hurt customers if somehow they make money by doing so !
They know we hate them , and apparently they have no reason whatsoever to tell us why this makes them more money .
So we stay angry .
In the end , could it be that it ’s actually us who “ just do n’t get it ” ?

A teenage girl killed another driver after taking her eyes off the road to send a text message .
Rachel Begg saw Maureen Waites 's car too late and smashed into the back of it , killing the grandmother instantly .
The 19 - year - old , who was texting as she drove home after a date with a boyfriend , told police she had not touched her mobile phone .
But tests revealed she had used it nine times in the 15 minutes before the 70 mph crash .
Begg was sentenced to four years of youth detention after admitting causing death by dangerous driving .
Newcastle Crown Court heard that the crash happened on a wet dual carriageway in total darkness .
Robert Woodcock , prosecuting , said : " Her eyes can not have been on the road ahead , for if they had been , she would have seen Mrs Waites .
Her eyes must have been cast down , and having sent the last message , she realised she was horrifically close to Mrs Waites and probably panicked . "
Mrs Waites , from Wingate , County Durham , had been on the way to Newcastle Airport to pick up her sister .
The court was told the 64 - year - old , who lectured in hairdressing and ran her own salon , made the journey frequently to pick up friends and family .
She had been married to husband George for nearly 50 years .
Her daughter , Helen Adams , said : " As a family we are saddened that a 19 - year - old girl has been given a term of imprisonment .
However , she has shown no remorse or any form of sympathy for our loss .
" The sentence does not reflect the fact that she has taken our mother 's life , which was wholly avoidable .
" We sincerely hope that lessons will be learnt from this sentence today . "
The 38 - year - old solicitor added : " People must stop using mobile phones while driving .
The consequences can be fatal and it causes nothing other than heartbreak . "
Jools Townsend , of road safety charity Brake , described the sentence as " deplorably low " .
" Rachel Begg will probably be free in just two years , " she added .
" A woman has lost her life and a family has been devastated by her violent and sudden death , all for the sake of sending a text message . "
She called on the Government to make the courts impose tougher sentences on drivers caught using mobiles and to extend the law to cover hands - free kits .
The fine for using a hand - held phone while driving was doubled to £ 60 earlier this year .
Motorists now also face three penalty points .
Surveys show that a third of drivers flout the law by making or receiving calls at the wheel .
Begg , who had been working at a bank prior to training as an accountant , had passed her driving test 18 months before the incident on the A696 last November .
The court was told the teenager from Ponteland , Northumberland , suffered post - traumatic stress as a result of the crash in which she damaged her neck .

Google 's punning department suffered a blow today , when the powers that be in Mountain View decided that Froogle , the giant 's damp squib shopping comparison site , should have a less silly name .
It 'll henceforth be known by the more anodyne corporate monicker Google Product Search .
Froogle launched in 2002 , but the link from the Google front page was removed last year after the service received a cool reception .
Google has apparently realised that people just search for what they want from the main page , but Google Product Search will still be available for those who want it .
The firm 's shopping talons are now pointed at PayPal , with a big push for payments service Google Checkout .
Marissa Mayer , Google 's vice president of search product and user experience , said she did n't think the Froogle pun was obvious enough .
Her eulogy to Froogle is here .
If Google 's punning department needs training , The Register 's world - leading agile wordplay boutique would like to make its services available on a per hour consultancy basis .

The Kyoto agreement aimed to cut carbon emissions worldwide
Canada remains a signatory to the landmark international agreement to reduce greenhouse gases .
But the Conservatives have rejected most of the targets since forming a minority government in 2006 .
The bill gives the government 60 days to table a detailed plan for getting in line with the Kyoto targets .
But the Conservative government has caused controversy by calling those targets unattainable and a threat to Canada 's economy .
The new law is binding but Canada 's Environment Minister , John Baird , has called the vote a stunt .
Fierce debate
He has suggested the minority government might simply ignore it , essentially challenging the opposition to bring down the government and force a spring election .
Such a scenario would be unpopular with politicians across the political spectrum .
The vote comes after months of fierce debate between the Conservatives and the opposition Liberals over each other 's environmental policies .
The Conservatives accuse the Liberals of doing very little to reduce greenhouse gases during the 12 years they were in power .
But the Conservative government has been on the defensive over its own record .
One environment minister has already lost her job over a series of mistakes , and an embarrassing letter written by the Canadian Prime Minister , Stephen Harper , in 2002 recently surfaced .
It derided the Kyoto accord as a socialist scheme designed to suck money out of rich countries .
According to General Bergner , Mr. Mashadani is the most senior Iraqi operative in Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
According to some reports , he served in Saddam Hussein ’s Special Republican Guard and later became an insurgent with the group Ansar Al Sunna .
About two and a half years ago , Mr. Mashadani joined Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , where he served as the Media Emir , or publicity director , the general said .
General Bergner said that Mr. Mashadani was also an intermediary between Mr. Masri in Iraq and Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri , whom the Bush administration says are remotely supporting and guiding Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
Critics of the administration have accused it of exaggerating the relationship between the groups , however .
An important part of the American strategy against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has been to drive wedges between the group , other insurgent groups and the Sunni population , and General Bergner ’s briefing continued that theme .
“ Mashadani confirms that al - Masri and the foreign leaders with whom he surrounds himself , not Iraqis , made the operational decisions , ” General Bergner said .
As proof that Mr. Mashadani had been captured , the military displayed a picture of him and an identification card the general described as the false ID he was found with .
Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has fired its own shots in the publicity war .
Videos have been issued under the banner of the Islamic State of Iraq that were said to show a bomb attack in Diyala on an American Bradley armored vehicle and an assault on an Iraqi military checkpoint .
In one recent statement , the Islamic State of Iraq made light of the American code name for its offensive in Baquba , Arrowhead Ripper , by saying that “ the arrows have been returned to the enemy like boomerangs , ” according to the SITE Institute , a United States group that monitors international terrorist groups .
Scott Adams , father of the Dilbert comic strip , recently had the misfortune to spend a number of hours editing comments for his blog only to have them disappear without a trace , much to his surprise , shortly after he published them .
Veky wants to know who was at fault .
His question implies that it just might have been Scott himself .
Dear Tog : Scott Adams moderated 500 comments to his blog and then deleted them permanently despite prominent warnings about permanent deletion .
Whose fault was it ?
~ Veky Not Scott
A chain of five errors led to Scott Adams losing his work .
Not one of those errors was his .
They had been made months and even years before Scott Adams ever started work on his blog .
His was an accident waiting to happen , an accident that has almost certainly befallen a large number of other individuals who have had the misfortune to use the same software .
When I was becoming a pilot , my instructor stressed that aircraft accidents typically are the result of a series of unfortunate errors and events , each of which in isolation would have been survivable , but , piling as they did one atop the other , resulted in tragedy .
For example , en route to Tahoe , my instructor and I landed at a small Sierra Nevada fly - in campground .
Another aircraft had landed earlier , and the pilot discovered a mechanical problem that prevented them from taking off .
He asked if we would give him a ride to Tahoe , so he could call for help .
( We were way out of cell phone territory . )
My instinct was to immediately say , “ yes . ”
Our aircraft was fitted out for four passengers , after all .
My instructor , however , gave him a clear , “ no , ” telling him that he would arrange for someone to come to his aid , but that the guy was n't getting aboard our airplane .
Sure , it was a hot day , which reduces lift , and we were at a somewhat high altitude ( though little higher than Denver , Colorado ) but still , it seemed embarrassingly rude .
My instructor 's response continued to seem rude right up until I was on final for South Lake Tahoe airport , at 6750 feet , and hit a downdraft .
We began to drop like a rock .
I made the runway , but with no altitude to spare .
Had we had a passenger on board , we and our aircraft would have been strewn across a broken granite landscape .
Almost certainly , none of us would have survived .
In my case , three events would have led up to that crash :
The mechanical breakdown of a completely different aircraft
The willingness of a pilot to reduce his safety margin by taking on an unexpected passenger A sudden , unpredictable downdraft Numbers one and three were unavoidable .
Number two was avoidable , and , fortunately , my instructor had the experience and judgment to break the chain by refusing to add a third passenger to what was already a fully - loaded plane for the prevailing conditions .
( Small plane manufacturers are permitted to fit planes with more seats than can be used safely under more extreme conditions , such as high altitude and high heat . )
Today , I would break the chain , too .
Quite often , pilot error is a factor in plane crashes .
Pilots can be trained and retrained , so spotting pilot error is an important component of aviation accident investigation .
We , however , gain no benefit from seeing our pilots , our users , as at fault .
Our job is to build systems that either eliminate or survive pilot error .
Scott Adams is an experienced " pilot , " with thousands of hours of technology use behind him .
For him to lose this amount of information , something must be seriously flawed in the design , and it 's the design we must examine .
The Scott Adams Accident Investigation Let 's look at what went wrong in the case of Scott Adams 's blog .
What were the cascading errors ?
Error One : User Model did n't reflect the Design Model Scott Adams believed that there were two documents holding his comments .
The first was what he termed the “ temporary holding " database , useful only until he “ published ” the 500 comments to what he assumed was a second , publicly - accessible database .
The designers , on the other hand , thought there was only one database , on account of there really was only one database .
Per Don Norman 's conceptual model , the designer develops a “ Design Model ” of the software , communicates it through the “ System Image ” the look , feel , and behavior of the interface .
The user , in turn , attempts to recreate the Design Model through experiencing the software .
This understanding then forms the user 's assumptions , the filter through which they will interpret all further instructions .
Norman Conceptual Model , Illustrated by Laurie Vertelney
The communication failed in this case , as evidenced by Scott 's dangerously wrong User Model , but why did n't he realize his mistake ?
Users can fail in two different ways in their attempts to accurately recreate the Design Model :
The user ends up with a fragmented model .
The user ends up with a complete model , but it is wrong .
In the first case , the user has a lot of questions and is generally on notice that things could go awry .
In the second case , the users believe they have successfully " solved the puzzle . "
They have no questions since they do n't realize that the reconstructed model is wrong .
This second case is the dangerous one : The Designer and Users are working from two different sets of assumptions , neither knows it , and neither takes any action to correct it .
The users , for minutes , days , or even months , systematically misinterpret what the designer “ says . ”
Consider the following instructions for entering a swimming pool :
Go to the edge Confirm that the bottom is more than six feet down .
Hold your hands over your head Begin leaning forward while bending at your knees
Push off the edge for maximum lift and ensure that your head points straight down for proper entry Now , consider what would happen if you thought these instructions were , instead , for descending into the crater of a volcano .
If users only worked from the information contained in the System Image , they would likely create reasonably accurate User Models .
They do n't .
Rather , they intermingle their past experiences with information extracted from the System Image when building the User Model .
When their past experiences fail to jibe with the system image , or when the system image is ambiguous , users are highly likely to misinterpret the designer 's intention .
Start with proper field studies to ensure that you understand the previous experiences of your users , so that your System Image either tracks the users ' previous experiences or clearly communicates where the System Image parts with those experiences .
Error Two : Misleading metaphor Designers , knowing users depend on previous experience , attempt to invoke specific experiences by using metaphors .
Metaphors , accurately applied and properly communicated , can greatly accelerate the process of building an accurate User Model .
Objects like the trashcan , for example , enable users to instantly grasp a deep understanding of a computer feature they may have never previously encountered .
Metaphors must be true to the original .
You can , with some success , improve upon the original , but you must never create something that is either “ less than ” or that simply ignores the most fundamental features of the original .
If you do so , you will confuse the users every time , always to their detriment .
An example of “ less than ” can be seen in the spread of the trashcan icon into individual applications .
Usually , throwing something in an application 's trashcan instantly and permanently destroys it .
That 's clearly “ less than ” either a real trashcan or a desktop trashcan , where you can pull stuff out within a reasonable length of time .
Ignoring / changing the fundamental features of the original is just wrong .
That 's how Scott Adams was victimized : “ Publish ” has had a very specific meaning in the public 's mind since at least the 1800s .
It consists of the mass replication and distribution of a document , with the original document , the draft , having little or no further usefulness after publication has been accomplished .
Scott Adams is keenly aware of this real - world publish model , being a published author , used to supplying drafts and computer images that are then reproduced in the millions .
At some point in the past , some people associated with databases , almost certainly a group of systems programmers , decided to drastically redefine “ publish ” from the traditional “ mass replicate ” to “ set a little flag . ”
That one naive move set the stage for tens of thousands of disasters .
( BOCTAOE .
The blog people could make the argument that , if we go back to the 1400s and before , publish had a much looser definition , one that could even encompass “ setting a little flag . ”
I invite them to use that more generous interpretation as long as all their users were all born before 1400 .
Otherwise , they should stick with the contemporary , more narrow , understanding . )
Choose only metaphors you can implement in a manner sufficiently analogous to the real world that users do not misinterpret the System Image .
If you are forced to use a defective metaphor , like the database “ publication ” metaphor , explicitly and repeatedly tell new users the differences between the definition with which they are likely familiar and the redefined meaning within your application or weblication .
Error Three : Confirmation Dialogs Ambiguous
A confirmation ( warning ) dialog must use wording that ensures a prudent person will not be able to misinterpret the meaning .
In this case , the dialogs kept warning Scott Adams about destroying what he considered now - useless information .
Of course , he Okayed them .
Who wants to keep useless information ?
Had the dialogs said , “ Remove from publication and Destroy the only copy of this information in existence ? ” he probably would have reconsidered his decision .
( The confirmation should have also offered help that further explained the difference between the real - world understanding of publication and the blogging application 's use of the term . )
The blog programmers did n't invent this error .
Microsoft , for years and years , has been sabotaging new users with their “ Save Changes ? ” dialog that greets the user when they attempt to close a document window .
I had a friend of generally high intelligence , but new to computers , who spent eight hours creating a long and complex document , one he assumed was being continuously saved as had been done when he used a typewriter or pen and paper .
Right before he was ready to quit , he decided to make a few changes to what he had written .
Then he clicked on the close box only to be asked , “ ... Save changes ? ”
He considered what he had typed in the last few minutes and decided that it was better before his changes .
He clicked , “ No . ” Instantly , his last 8 hours of work was irrevocably deleted .
The word , “ changes , ” invokes the revising / remodeling experiences of new users .
People reserve that word exclusively for changing something that already exists .
The laziness of the Microsoft programmers in not having alternate wording for a previously - unsaved document cost my friend and probably tens of thousands of other new users a lot of hard work .
Any time you inject ambiguity - noise - into the System Image , you are causing your users distress or worse .
In the case of Microsoft , they have probably caused users a loss of hundreds of thousands of hours of productivity over the years , all to save an hour or less of programming , a pretty poor trade - off .
Work with a writer to develop all your dialog wordings .
Then ask people other than designers and engineers to feed back to you what the dialog means .
When you discover an ambiguity , rework and retest the dialog until ambiguity ceases to exist .
Error Four : Confirmation Substituted for Undo Often , developers wanting to avoid undo will throw in a confirmation dialog instead .
Confirmation dialogs are only effective in the odd case ; confirmations that pop up every single time an operation is completed are quickly ignored , with the user learning , for example , to click , then press Return , instead of just clicking .
The only effect of such dialogs is to make the developers feel good : “ The users may be screwing up , but we warned them , so it is their own fault . ”
No , it is n't .
Any time your user loses any work , consider it your fault , and figure out how to prevent it from happening to anyone else .
Solution : Creating the Illusion of Deletion
For some bizarre reason , we seem to have settled on always , always , always giving users undo for such critical operations as deleting a single character .
When users delete an entire document , however , we offer no possible recovery .
That , in the real world , would be evidence of insanity .
In the earliest days of the computer world , it was sometimes unavoidable .
Now , it is inexcusable , particularly since large - scale undo is often so easy to implement with the use of a little magic .
The key to magic is that there are two performances :
The one the magician is actually doing , and the one you think he is doing .
If they coincide , the magic does n't work .
One of the keys to this separation is time :
The actual manipulation - removal of the ball from under the cup , moving the coin from the top of the table to the underneath , etc. - either occurs before you think it did ( anticipation ) or after you think it did ( premature consumption ) .
This separation of illusion from reality can work to our advantage as well .
In the case of a deletion , We throw up a confirmation dialog The user confirms
We delete the file
We tell the user we deleted it .
What if we left out step three , at least for a while ?
The user can now experience that familiar sinking feeling that only occurs after we tell them the document is gone , go to the Edit menu , discover to their delight an active Undo and , magically , get all their information back .
It requires no reconstruction of anything .
We just reopen the same window we just blinked out .
In many cases , you wo n't be able to give the user the ability to undo for very long , sometimes not even past the user 's next action .
Even this allows the user to recover from accidental keystrokes or mouse clicks , all without putting undue burden on the programmer .
In the case of removing 500 records permanently from a database , however , leave them around for a little while longer , long enough for the user to become aware of his or her error .
In this case , flag each “ deleted ” record , causing it to no longer be displayed , but still available for undo .
If it is the entire database , flag the whole document , keeping it around at least until the end of the session .
Do consider privacy and security tradeoffs when offering such functionality .
Any time the user believes information is gone , but it is n't , mischief can ensue .
Most users , however , are now aware that even information they have explicitly and irrevocably removed can be reconstructed by any 17 year old kid with the proper track and sector disk utility .
Ensure that you first offer universal Undo .
Only then , display confirmation dialogs for unusual activities .
Error Five : No Usability Evaluation
The first four errors , in this case , are pretty fundamental , and no human - computer interaction designer should have made any of them .
Still , errors , particularly in failing to recognize ambiguity , are going to creep in .
Our safety net is user testing , something obviously missing in this case .
I doubt the blogging developers would have had to study more than a handful of users before uncovering Scott 's “ temporary holding database ” User Model .
One can only hope that , with that realization , the team would have made significant changes to ensure the flawed interpretation was no longer possible .
In my thirty years of programming / designing , I have never seen a serious design flaw like this reach the light of day where even a minimal usability program was in place .
Do usability testing , even if it is informal and cursory .
Even testing a single user representative of your intended audience can be a real eye - opener .
This was a preventable accident .
If any one of these design errors had not been committed , Scott Adams would likely have 500 more comments and fewer gray hairs .

A characteristic pathology of most neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of abnormally folded proteins within or around nerve cells .
These protein aggregates are insoluble and toxic , but it is still not known whether they cause , or are caused by , pathogenesis of the conditions .
Alzheimer ’s Disease , which the most common form of dementia and the most widely researched of all the neurodegenerative diseases , is characterized by the presence of tau protein aggregates within neurons , as well as aggregates of beta- amyloid ( Aβ ) protein , which forms amyloid plaques in the spaces between neurons .
Aβ is a peptide of between 39 - 42 amino acid residues , encoded by the APP ( amyloid precursor protein ) gene .
The molecular genetics of APP , and its cellular processing , are very complex .
The gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce various peptides which perform different , and as yet unknown , cellular functions .
Aβ is generated by the sequential cleavage of the full - length APP gene product by the enzymes β- and γ-secretase , and is insoluble and amyloidogenic ( prone to aggregation ) .
Up to 10 % of cases of Alzheimer ’s Disease are associated with mutations in the APP gene which alter the actions of enzymes on APP , such that Aβ is synthesized in greater amounts .
The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( TSEs ) are a group of related neurodegenerative diseases with which the accumulation of abnormally - folded proteins is associated .
In the case of the TSEs , which include bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE , or ‘ Mad Cow Disease ’ ) , scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt - Jakob Disease ( CJD ) in humans , the protein which accumulates within cells is the prion protein ( pronounced pree-on ) .
The prion protein is found in all cells but its function is unkown .
In the TSEs , it adopts an abnormal three - dimensional conformation , which makes it insoluble and prone to aggregation .
This abnormal prion underlies TSE pathogenesis .
According to the prion hypothesis , the prion protein is the infectious agent which transmits the TSEs between organisms .
( Prion is an abbreviation for proteinaceous infectious particle . )
Abnormally folded prions are believed to initiate a nucleation - polymerization reaction upon infection ; that is , the abnormal prion proteins act as a “ seed ” , causing the normal cellular prion proteins to adopt the abnormal configuration , which makes the molecules prone to self - polymerization and aggregation .
Some of these aggregates are then disassembled , and the fragments dispersed to seed the formation of more aggregates .
It is thought that TSEs are transmitted by the consumption of infected meat ; one form of human prion disease , kuru , is believed to be transmitted during the ritual of mortuary cannibalism practised by the South Fore peoples of Papua New Guinea .
A recent paper in the journal Science provides some evidence that Aβ can , like the prion protein , initiate the nucleation - polymerization in cells into which it is introduced .
Meyer - Luehmann , et al used two strains of transgenic mice in their experiments .
Mice of one strain ( APP23 ) over - produce the 40 - amino - acid Aβ peptide , while mice of the other strain ( APPPS1 ) over - produce the 42 - amino acid peptide .
In both strains , Aβ plaques are deposited in the brain as the animals age , but the strains differ in the distribution and appearance of the plaques .
The experiments involved taking brain extracts from deceased Alzheimer ’s patients or from aged mice of both strains , and injected them into the brains of young mice of both strains , before they had developed the symptoms of the disease .
It was observed that all extracts had a seeding activity in both strains of mice – they induced the deposition of the Aβ peptide , which aggregated to form plaques in the brains of the mice into which they had been injected .
The seeding activity was both time - and concentration - dependent ( i.e. seeding increased with time , and with greater concentrations of Aβ in the extracts ) , but differed depending on the strain of mouse the extract was taken from , and the strain it was injected into .
However , if the extracts were treated with anti-
Aβ anti bodies , or heated so that the structure of the Aβ molecules was destroyed , the seeding activity was abolished .
Similarly , if the host mice were immunized against
Aβ before they were injected with the extracts , seeding did not occur .
Finally , no seeding activity was observed when any brain extract was injected into the brain of normal mice , suggesting that , if Alzheimer ’s was indeed found to be infectious , an infected individual would have to be genetically predisposed to the condition in order for it to develop .
One could predict that the accumulation of abnormal proteins in other neurodegenerative diseases – e.g. alpha -synuclein in Parkinson ’s Disease and huntingtin in Huntington ’s Disease , may also occur as a result of a prion - like seeding process .
But for me , the most puzzling question of all is this : how would an Alzheimer ’s infection be transmitted ?

Antique violins may have been chemically tuned .
The secret to a smooth sound may lie in boiling the wood with salts .
Simple pest control techniques may have given rise to the greatest violins ever made .
Biochemists say the key to the instrument 's sweet sounds come not only from their construction but also from chemicals used to treat wood .
For hundreds of years people have tried to duplicate the tone of Italian violins such as a Stradivari and a Guarneri .
Now scientists say at least part of the secret is to boil the wood in minerals .
A team of scientists lead by Joseph Nagyvary of Texas A&M University , College Station , used nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy to analyse the chemical makeup of wood in antique and modern - day instruments .
Slivers of the wood used to make modern violins were compared with the shavings of five antique instruments from the 1700s .
Included in the mix were a Stradivari violin and cello , a Guarneri violin , a Gand & Bernardel violin from Paris and a Henry Jay viola from London .
Pest control
The results show that molecules of hemicellulose ( short - chained polymers of sugar found in the cell walls of wood along with cellulose and lignin ) in the Stradivari and Guarneri instruments had broken down — an effect of chemical reactions such as oxidation and hydrolysis .
That could , in some cases , be a result of natural aging of the woods .
But Nagyvary says the most likely explanation is that the wood was chemically treated .
Oxidizing agents such as salt or copper , for example , could have been used to protect the wood from pests .
" What we can see is the result of elaborate wood treatment , " says Nagyvary .
" Woodworm and fungus were significant problems for the craftsman .
They probably boiled the wood in a brine that contained various minerals to exterminate infestations . "
Exactly what chemical recipes were used is unknown .
The end result ?
Wood that is harder , lighter and produces a smoother sound .
Fiddling with wood
Researchers , musicians and craftsmen have attributed the striking quality of tone from antique instruments to everything from the high density of the wood used ( thanks to climate conditions that led to slow tree growth during a certain period of history ) to the way the wood was heat - treated , or even some unknown property of the varnish .
" There is a lot of muck and magic about this type of thing , " says Julian Vincent , a biomimetics specialist at Bath University in the UK .
He says Nagyvary 's work looks sound , but it is hard to know if his theory is right without taking two pieces of the exact wood used by Stradivari , treating one and not the other , and comparing the sound of the instruments produced .
ADVERTISEMENT
Nagyvary has n't quite done that , but he has made a violin using a chemical treatment similar to the one he supposes was used in the past ( he keeps his exact recipe secret ) .
At a recent meeting of the Japan Society of Applied Physics in Tokyo , his violins were praised by professional musicians .
Valued at up to $ 10 million each , Stradivari violins are few and far between .
With only about 600 remaining today , it is difficult to get wood to study .
Nagyvary 's team plan to burn what little wood they have to work out its mineral composition .
They wo n't have these results until next year .

Milk
Although it may sound unbelievable , a male goat in north China is able to produce milk !
This white goat is only about a meter tall and two meters long , and it lives in a village in Hebei province .
It 's owner , Mr An Guisuo of Cao village , Zhengding county , reportedly said he bought the four - year - old goat for US $ 131 from a nearby villager for hybridization half a year ago .
During that time , he was doubtful of whether the goat with a pair of large breasts would breed successfully .
But all his doubts of the male goat were cleared when one of his female goats gave birth to several lambs .
When questioned regarding on how he made the discovery of the male goat 's milk , Mr An explained that he accidentally discovered some white liquid that flowed from the male 's breasts , and hence he tried squeezing them to see if they produced milk .
Since that event , he has milking and drinking almost half litre of milk obtained from it every day .
Professor Sang Ruizi of Hebei Agricultural University said that it 's possible internal secretion stimulated the male goat 's breasts to produce milk .

Japan urges ' severe action ' against NKorean missile tests
TOKYO , June 28 ( AFP ) Jun 28 , 2007
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called Thursday for a tough international response to North Korea 's latest missile tests .
" We must seek a severe response in the international community , " Abe told reporters after the United States confirmed that North Korea had test - fired several short - range missiles Wednesday into the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) .
Abe said the tests violated a UN resolution calling for an end to ballistic missile programmes , but he said they did not pose a direct threat to Japan .
" North Korea must respond to the concerns of the international community .
It should make more effort to improve people 's lives rather than to fire missiles , " he said .
The latest tests came as UN inspectors prepared to visit a reactor at the heart of North Korea 's nuclear programme in their first on - site inspection there in nearly five years .
DKos :
The GOP is trying to frame Murtha 's plan of requiring improved troop readiness as the exact opposite .
According the GOP : Murtha's plan
is to " cut funding " ,
is a " strategy to pull the rug out from under our troops " , and
is a " slow bleed " approach .
RESPONSE
If we do n't make sure to hammer the point that Murtha 's plan calls for the very opposite soon and often , the GOP lies will prevail .
Murtha 's plan calls for
Sufficient soldier training ,
Sufficient equipment , and
Reasonable deployment and leave time .
Murtha 's plan protects the troops .
It pulls the rug out from under Bush by protecting the troops from his abuse of their readiness to serve .
A new salvo has been fired in the perennial war over Wikipedia 's accuracy .
Thomas Chesney , a Lecturer in Information Systems at the Nottingham University Business School , published the results of his own Wikipedia study in the most recent edition of the online journal First Monday , and he came up with a surprising conclusion : experts rate the articles more highly than do non-experts .
This less - than - intuitive finding is the conclusion of a study in which Chesney had 55 graduate students and research assistants examine one Wikipedia article apiece .
Each participant was randomly placed into one of two groups : group one read articles that were in their field of study , while group two read randomly - assigned articles .
Respondents were asked to identify any errors that they found .
Those in the expert group ranked their articles as generally credible , higher than those evaluated by the non-experts .
Chesney admits that this is unexpected , but has a possible explanation : " It may be the case that non-experts are more cynical about information outside of their field and the difference comes from a natural reaction to rate unfamiliar articles as being less credible . "
Whatever the reason for the results , they will cheer defenders of Wikipedia 's accuracy , though Chesney urges caution in extrapolating too generally from his study .
For one thing , the sample size was small .
For another , 13 percent of those in the " experts " group reported finding mistakes in their assigned articles .
Whether this is better or worse than traditional , expert - based encyclopedias depends on who you ask .
Nature did a highly - publicized comparative study between Wikipedia and the Encyclopedia Britannica last year in which they found that the two were similar in terms of accuracy .
Britannica disputed those findings and still claims to offer a more reliable product .
Chesney 's study was not intended to settle the debate .
He notes that , whatever Wikipedia 's comparative accuracy , plenty of people ( academics included ) are using it , and he simply wanted to see whether Wikipedia could be considered accurate enough to be worth using .
His study suggests that it can , but that caution — and further research — needs to be used before citing anything learned from Wikipedia as a fact .

Bones in the Basement
of Franklin's London Digs
We 're sure there 's no connection between the e-mail we sent to a group called the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House and the subsequent addition to their Web site .
After all , we were only trying to find out a little more about an item we had seen in a church newsletter about some � bones being found in the basement of 36 Craven Street in London , where Franklin lived from 1757 through 1774 .
Having been tipped off to that item by an alert alumnus this past spring , we poked around a little and eventually made our way to the Friends '
Web site -- www.rsa.org.uk/franklin/ -- which was full of information about Franklin 's London residence and the group 's recent efforts to restore it .
But there was nothing , alas , about the sort of skull - diggery we were after .
So we sent an e-mail , stating our journalistic interest in the house and its restoration , and asking if anyone knew anything about those old bones .
We never got an answer .
Then , weeks later , we decided to make one last visit to the Web site -- and there , on the Benjamin Franklin Centre 's home page , was a brand new red-and - black hyperlink : ! Stop Press !
Bones found at No. 36 ! Stop Press !
So we stopped , and we clicked , and found ourselves reading about how enough money had finally been raised to start the repair - work needed to prevent No. 36 from collapsing .
Then we hit pay dirt : " This work , which started in late 1997 , has led to the discovery of the remains of 10 bodies hidden beneath the floor of the basement .
The remains , 200 - year - old bones , were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house .
As most of the bones show signs of having been dissected , sawn , or cut with one skull having been drilled with several holes , the supposition is that they were the results of illegal medical experiments . "
Stop the press , indeed .
Enter one William Hewson , husband of Mary " Polly " Stevenson , the daughter of Franklin 's landlady .
" In the early 1770s , Dr. Hewson was in partnership with William Hunter who , with his brother John , was one of the founders of surgery in England .
After a dispute with Hunter was resolved , with the help of Franklin , Hewson is believed to have established a rival school and lecture theatre in the Stevenson house . "
And there , in the basement , according to a Westminster coroner , Hewson apparently buried those " anatomical specimens " -- a prudent move , since the corpses had undoubtedly been obtained by illegal grave - robbing .
" The discovery is seen as providing an important insight into a time when significant developments were beginning to take place " in surgery , the Web site notes .
" As someone who helped Polly and Hewson , Franklin can be seen as part of that history .
There is , of course , no suggestion that Franklin was a grave robber or a participant in the lectures . "
Whew .
Franklin did serve as representative for the Pennsylvania Assembly and chief agent for the American colonies ( a function not unlike that of ambassador ) during his 17 years at 36 Craven Street ; he also invented bifocal glasses and watertight bulkheads for ships and entertained such figures as Edmund Burke , James Boswell , Adam Smith , and Thomas Paine .
The house , between what is now Charing Cross Station and Trafalgar Square , is the only still - standing residence of Franklin in the world , having barely survived years of neglect and German bombs in World War II .
Recently , the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House joined forces with the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts , Manufactures , & Commerce ( of which Franklin was a member ) to raise money for the restoration .
Hewson , incidentally , died in 1774 ( the year Franklin left London ) , having contracted septicaemia when he cut himself while dissecting a partially decomposed corpse .
He was 34 years old .
" Franklin continued to support the widowed Polly , who ultimately followed him to America , " the Web site states .
According to the University Archives and Records Center , both of her sons went to Penn : William Hewson , C1788 , G1791 , and Thomas Tickell Hewson , C1789 , G1792 .
Thomas , like his father , became a doctor .

My first crush was on John Travolta in Grease .
Do you think that 's disgusting ?
It is a bit , thinking about it now .
But we did n't have that many videos when I was a kid , so he was the one I watched .
I must have been about seven , but I watched it with my older sister , so I guess my crush was n't really age - appropriate .
I liked his dancing .
And I wanted to be Sandy so bad , and Sandy liked him , so I liked him too .
My secret crush now is Christian Bale - he was Batman , right ?
But he 's too old for me , and married .
I guess I 've carried on liking the same kind of leather - clad boy all my life .
It must have set off some kind of pattern .
My ex-boyfriend looked like a bad boy , but he was n't at all .
I 'm not really a flirt , but I am a girl .
I 'm not a tramp , or a whore , but I do manipulate men when I feel like it .
Girls bat their eyelashes , and act like they do n't know anything in front of guys they like , or give a little bit of eye contact , but not too much , or a bit of touching .
Or being coy .
Sure , I do a bit of that .
Men do it too , though .
They have different games they play , which can be fun , but I 'm not too into game - playing .
I do n't have time to deal with people who are going to mess around .
I 'm single at the moment .
Happily so .
I 'm a really good relationship girl - I really like being in a relationship , but I 'm so young right now I do n't want to be too serious .
I want to go out and meet people .
It 's fun to be single because you 're not tied down .
I get lonely sometimes though , when I wish I had someone to call , or share things with .
I 'm not , like , a crazy feminist .
I think women definitely need men .
Like , I could n't imagine having a girlfriend !
There are things that you get from one another , as well as the physical stuff , that are essential .
Guys make me feel secure and comfortable , when I 'm scared or need attention .
They bring stability .
And affection .
And fun .
And drama .
You learn so much from a boyfriend .
It 's hard to put into words I guess .
I do n't believe in having one partner for your whole life , but I hope I get married .
I want to have a husband and two kids and a nice little life baking pies .
I 'm quite romantic .
It 's definitely important to have someone make you feel special .
But sometimes you have to teach a boy what you want .
I was talking to a girlfriend the other day who has n't had a boyfriend in a really long time , and she was like , ' Why can't I get a boyfriend ?
I 'm going to write down a list of all the things I want in a guy , and I 'm not going to waste my time with anyone who does n't tick all the boxes . '
And the list had everything from ' not leaving clothes on the floor ' to his deep morals and stuff .
It 's kind of a good idea .
The most important things on my list would be that he has to be in the business , so he understands how hard it can be , with the lifestyle , but that he has to have other interests outside of work .
He has to be adventurous , and teach me new things , and have a strong faith , and make me laugh , and be cute .
I 'm kind of crazy , so I like boys who do n't take themselves too seriously .
I learn a lot about myself in a relationship .
It improves you , definitely .
You adapt .
Women are definitely home - makers .
We 're obviously very different from men .
But everyone 's looking for love , in the end .
Men are n't as strong as women .
And they do n't have as big an attention span .
They want things immediately , from food to girls .
The women I know are more successful than the men .
It 's hard for me to meet someone .
I do n't need someone who , like , has as much as me , but I do n't want someone who has much less because then you never really feel taken care of .
And it would always make a guy feel not like a man .

The album Dignity is out now
A Dutch reality television show in which a terminally ill woman is to select one of three contestants to receive her kidneys when she dies is to air this week despite criticism that it pushes the boundaries of the format too far .
The government has called for De Grote Donorshow ( The Big Donor show ) to be dropped because it is " unethical " and " wretched " but the broadcaster BNN said it would go ahead to highlight the difficulties of searching for kidney donors .
In the show , due to be broadcast on Friday , a woman identified only as Lisa , 37 , will select a recipient based on their history , profile and conversations with their families and friends .
Throughout the 80 - minute show , viewers will be invited to send Lisa text messages to advise her .
The ruling coalition parties the Christian Democrats and the Christian Union have condemned the show .
But BNN 's chairman , Laurens Drillich , said the show would increase by a third the participants ' chances of getting a new kidney .
" The chance for a kidney for the contestants is 33 % , " he said .
" This is much higher than that for people on a waiting list .
You would expect it to be better , but it is worse . "
BNN said it wanted to focus on the plight of kidney sufferers as a tribute to its founder , Bart de Graaff , who died of kidney failure five years ago in spite of several transplants .
There is evidence that an increasing number of Dutch viewers have been turning away from reality TV , of which the Netherlands is a pioneer , because they believe the subject matter too risque .
One show to come under the spotlight is Spuiten en Slikken ( Shooting and Swallowing ) in which the presenters experiment with drugs and a range of sexual exploits .
Patty 's
Fort celebrated colonic irrigation , with the scatological remains shown in full on screen .
But attempts in 2005 to launch a sperm donor show , in which a woman was to select a father for her baby in front of the cameras , collapsed following a huge public outcry .
Vehicles may crowd the asphalt of downtown Los Angeles freeways above ground , but below ground hundreds of newly discovered bacteria thrive by munching on heavy oil and natural asphalt .
Trapped in the Rancho La Brea tar pits 28,000 years ago , the bacteria are equipped with special enzymes that can break down petroleum , environmental scientists at the University of California , Riverside report in a recent issue of Applied and Environmental Microbiology .
The petroleum - dismantling enzymes could be used to clean up oil spills , create new medicines and manufacture biofuels , among other uses .
" Asphalt is an extreme and hostile environment for life to survive , " said Jong - Shik Kim , who initiated the study .
But “ these living organisms can survive in heavy oil mixtures containing many highly toxic chemicals ” with no water and little oxygen , he said .
Bacteria that survive on petroleum produce methane gas as waste , so when Kim and his colleague Dave Crowley noticed the gas bubbling out of the oily soil , they knew they had found something unique .
The two eventually sequenced groups of the tar pit bacteria ’s DNA to be certain .
" Previously , some bacteria had been cultured from the asphalt , ” Kim said , “ but no one had been able to extract DNA from the asphalt to study the entire microbial community . ”
To identify the bacteria and their unique enzymes , Kim and Crowley froze the tar with liquid nitrogen and then pulverized it into a powder .
With the tar - hungry bacteria exposed , the scientists extracted the DNA .
But where did the oil - munching bacteria most likely come from ?
" Soil microorganisms that were trapped in the asphalt , ” said Crowley .
But the bugs ’ long - lost relatives may have also originated from underground oil reservoirs .

GIANT CATS
Giantism and its various causes are more fully discussed in
Giant Cats
FAT CATS
There is a difference between size ( a giant cat with normal proportions ) and sheer weight ( obesity ) .
Where available , I have given some measurements to indicate whether the cat was a big specimen overall or simply very obese .
Unlike dogs , there is less size variation since cats do n't possess the genes for huge size .
Hybridization of domestic cats with wild species may produce larger cats .
Most " giant " cats are grotesquely obese .
An indoor lifestyle is producing more and larger feline couch potatoes - bored compulsive nibblers , overweight , unstimulated and bone idle .
Feline obesity is more common in the USA where more cats live indoors , but it is on the increase in Britain .
Overeating , genetic causes and metabolic disorders are the main causes .
Hypothyroid conditions cause cats to gain weight because they do not burn off calories .
Male Female Neuter ( either sex ) Average Adult Weight 6.2 Ib ( 2.81 kg ) 5.4 lb ( 2.45 kg ) 7 - 11 Ib ( 3 - 5 kg ) Average Adult Length
( See Note 1 ) Total : 28 - 29 in ( 71-73 cm )
Tail : 11 in ( 28 cm ) Total : 26 in ( 66 cm )
Tail 9.5 in ( 24 cm ) No data Ragdoll 15 - 20 lb ( 6.8 - 9.07 kg ) 12 - 15 lb ( 5.44 - 6.8 kg ) No data Maine Coon 12 - 18 Ib ( 5.44 - 8.16 kg )
Up to 20 lb not uncommon 8 - 10 lb ( 3.63 - 4.53 kg ) 25 - 30 lb recorded
( 11.33 - 13.6 kg ) Total Length Tail length Weight Note 1 : Clarence ( 1970s ) owned by Mrs Milinda Los of Burnaby , British Columbia , Canada 41.5 in ( 105.4 cm )
13 in ( 33 cm ) 17 Ib ( 7.7 kg ) Note 2 : Thomas O’Malley ( 1970s ) owned by Hilda John of Cardiff , South Wales 41 in ( 104 cm ) 12 in ( 30 cm ) 37 lb ( approx 17 kg )
Media reports of 40 lb ( 18.14 kg ) Maine Coons are either myths or obese individuals .
The heavy - boned Persians and Himalayans may also exceed 20 lb ( 9.07 kg ) .
In February 1952 a cat - owner from Southsea , Hampshire , England owned a 35 Ib ( 15.8 kg ) black Persian called " Khita " whose 3 brothers each exceeded 20 lb ( 9.07 kg ) .
Male Siamese can reach a considerable size and weight .
In 1977 , Becky Bisby of Raytown , Missouri , USA had a chocolate - point neutered male called " Sam " who weighed 20 lb ( 9.07 kg ) .
In October 1981 a male Russian Blue named " Kasha " belonging to Nettie Sohmers of Yonkers , NY , USA weighed in at 25 lb ( 11.3 kg ) .
In 2003 , Laura K Baker 's cat , Brody , weighed in at 25 lb aged 7 years .
However , Brody is a rare Klinefelter ( XXY ) tortoiseshell male cat and his size is due to Klinefelter syndrome .
A 19th Century Lithograph called " Large Cat " records what it describes as " this noble specimen , domesticated at 175 , Oxford Street ... very docile though his unusually large size conveys to the beholder , at first sight a contrary impression . "
Measured at 25.75 lb , the 7 year old cat was said to be " extremely active and rarely inconvenienced by his great bulk . "
The winner of the 1871 Crystal Palace ( London , England ) cat show 's ‘ Heaviest Cat ’ title was a tabby cat weighing 21 lb ( 9.52 kg ) .
Obesity caused by over - feeding and little exercise .
Chelmsford CPL .
In 1936 , " Ginger " of High Holborn , London was reported as " Heaviest Cat in London " at 23 lb 8 oz .
He beat 23 lb " Billy " of Lancaster Gate , London .
In 1938 , Mr E Kay of Sheffield , England has a 21 lb cat called " Bill " who measured 27 in round the chest .
Mary Kennedy of Ayr , Scotland had 2 cats " Dusty " and " Rusty " each weighing 21 lb .
Their mother was also reported to be a heavyweight , suggesting a hereditary cause or over - indulgent owner .
" Tibby " ( undated ) of Northfleet , Kent , England weighed 28 lb and had a huge appetite .
Another undated 28 lb giant was " Joseph " .
In 1959 , " Tiddles " owned by Mary Maynard of Wymondham , Norfolk , England was weighed at 36 lb. " Ginger " , exhibited at the 1969 Herts & Middx Cat Show ( England ) weighed 26 lb .
In the 1970s , " Thomas O'Malley " , owned by Hilda John of Cardiff , Wales weighed 37 lb and had a waist 2 inches bigger than that of his owner .
His mother , brother and sister were all normally sized , suggesting that Thomas had a metabolic disorder .
" Poppa " the tabby owned by Gwladys Cooper of Newport , Gwent , South Wales weighed 44 lb ( almost 20 kg ) in 1983 .
Her other 2 cats weighed 24 lb ( approx 11 kg ) and 14 Ib ( 6.35 kg ) .
" Tiger " the Persian cross owned by Phyllis Dacey of Billericay , Essex , England began growing abnormally at a year old ; in 1979 he weighed 42 - 43 lb ( 19 - 19.5 kg ) with a 12.4 in ( 31.75 cm ) neck , 33 in ( 83.8 cm ) waist and a total length of 37 in ( 94 cm ) .
He was treated for a hormone imbalance ( hypothyroid ) and lost weight rapidly .
He died of kidney disease in 1980 , aged 10 years , weighing 18 lb ( approx 8 kg ) .
" Dinkie " the ginger tom owned by Miss K Dowding of Minchinhampton , Gloucestershire , UK , weighed 42 lb ( 19 kg ) in April 1955 and had a neck 18 in ( 46 cm ) , waist 32 in ( 81 cm ) and total length 40 in ( 101 cm ) .
" Gigi " the female tabby belonging to Miss Anne Clark of Carlisle , Cumbria , UK fluctuated between 37 - 40 lb ( approx 17 - 18 kg ) , peaking at 42 Ib ( 19 kg ) in 1970 and had a waist 37 in ( 94 cm ) , total length 36 in ( 91 cm ) .
The most famous feline fattie was 32 lb ( 14.5 kg ) " Tiddles " who lived in the ladies ’ lavatory at Paddington Station , London , England for 13 years .
Tiddles was adopted in 1970 as a stray 6 week old kitten by lavatory attendant June Watson .
He dined on chicken livers , lambs ’ tongues , kidneys , rabbit or steak brought in by his admirers and had his own personal fridge .
Tiddles continued to grow in girth and received fan - mail from around the world as well as appearing in news reports .
His weight was due to overeating , but vets ' attempts to put him on a diet failed ( largely thwarted by titbits from admirers ) .
Tiddles easily became ‘ London Fat Cat Champion ’ in 1982 at 30 lb ( 13.6 kg ) .
He was put to sleep in 1983 after vets found fluid round his lungs .
Tiddles had essentially eaten himself to death - killed by kindness - and photos show a grotesquely overweight and sad - looking cat , immobilised by his own girth .
In my opinion , over - feeding a cat to this extent ( despite veterinary advice ) constitutes cruelty .
A ginger and white male called " Spice " owned by Loren Caddell of Ridgefield , Connecticut , USA reached 43 lb ( almost 20 kg ) in 1974 and peaked at an unconfirmed 46 lb ( almost 21 kg ) before being prescribed a special diet and medication for acute hypothyroid .
He died in 1977 , weighing 35 Ib ( almost 16 kg ) .
In 1977 a weight of 53 lb ( 24 kg ) was claimed for a male tabby named " Boots " living in Hamilton , Ontario , Canada but photographic evidence failed to substantiate this claim .
Tiddles of Paddington Station
In 1982 , the American " National Enquirer " tabloid staged a ‘ Heaviest Cat ’ competition .
It was won by a 41 lb ( almost 19 kg ) neutered tabby called " Baby " owned by Mr Maefred Slawson of Constableville , NY .
Baby reportedly had a gargantuan appetite .
Neutered male tabby " Himmy " owned by Thomas Vyse of Redlynch , Cairns , Queensland , Australia peaked at 45 lb 10 oz ( 20.7 kg ) in 1982 .
Himmy had a neck circumference of 15 in ( 38 cm ) , a waist of 32 in ( 81 cm ) and a total length of 38 in ( 96.5 cm ) .
Despite his weight , Himmy was reported to be a moderate eater and probably had an underactive thyroid .
He had to be carried about in a wheelbarrow and died in 1986 of respiratory failure .
In 2001 , there was a claim of 87 lb by a giant mutant cat from Canada .
" Snowball " was reported to be the offspring of two cats found near a research facility in Canada and to be properly proportioned , not obese .
Photographic analysis indicates a fake and the " former employee " apparently did not appear in the records of the company he apparently formerly worked for !
The photo is included here to demonstrate what can be done a photo .
A previous Guinness World Record Holder for longest ( and contender for the heaviest ) cat is Snowbie , owned by Lorna Sutherland of Ellon , Aberdeenshire , Scotland .
In 1997 , 4 year old Snowbie measured almost 41 inches ( 103 cm ) from nose to tail - tip .
Some sources originally gave his weight as 98 lbs ( 44 kg ) , though other sources cited his weight as a more realistic 32 lb in 1999 ( note : possibly a submitted weight of 44 lb was erroneously logged as 44 kg ) .
Guinness 's printed edition gave a believable 47 pounds and other sources have claimed an he has tipped the scales at 53 pounds ; in fact fluctuations of several lbs are very possible with such obese cats .
Snowbie was neutered at 3 months old , after which he apparently just kept growing .
He stands 13 inches ( 33 cm ) tall with a 12 inch ( 31 cm ) tail .
He also has a pampered lifestyle and like Paddington 's Tiddles , probably an over - indulgent diet .
Guinness no longer record fattest or heaviest cats although other publications still list modern fat cat records .
On 21st February , 2003 , what was believed to be the world 's current fattest cat was discovered in Russia .
Five - year - old Katy weighs over 20 kilogrammes ( over 44 lbs / 3 stone 2lbs ) .
According to her owner , Katy has lost interest in everything but food after being put on contraception .
She has a 68.6 cm ( 27 inch ) waist and according to her owner she ploughs through sausages at the rate of one - and - a - half per minute .
The previous record holder , an Australian named Himmy , was 2 kilos ( 4.4 lbs ) lighter .
A fat cat photo circulated on the internet and by email as " Munchkin the Monster Cat " and many thought it was a photo - manipulated fake .
The cat is genuine and his real name was Sassy .
Sassy was born in Virginia , USA and moved to Canada in 1991 with his owner .
He started gaining weight after being neutered and also slept a great deal .
The Blair Animal Hospital could not find any problems or underlying reasons for his weight gain .
Sassy was fed diet cat food , but in 1999 his weight had reached 35 lbs ( 15.9 kg ) .
In 2001 Sassy was 40 lbs ( 18.1 kg ) , but he lost 8 lbs ( 3.6 kg - the bodyweight of an average cat ! ) shortly before he died .
Sassy was a moderate eater and did not eat table scraps , though he apparently enjoyed a little chicken or tuna .
Tubcat became an Internet sensation in 2002 and was touted as the fattest kitty ever .
Matt Tedrow has provided some details .
Tubcat 's picture initially appeared in US Weekly , p. 96 , on October 1 , 2001 .
The cat 's real name is Tulle , and the 12 - year - old girl holding him is Tahabita ( spelled Tabitha elsewhere ) Pedersen .
They 're from Denmark , and Tulle was 6 years old and 43 lbs when the picture was taken ( only 4 lbs less than Himmy ) .
Tulle hit 19.2 kilos , but died of diabetes ( and may have had heart problems ) , a common side - effect of obesity , in January 2008 .
Although Tubcat / Tulle is dead , he unfortunately started a trend of people putting up photos of their own obese cats , some of which may have been deliberately overfed to outdo Tubcat .
Although Guinness have wisely ended their fattest cat category , Tubcat and similar sites contribute to the sad trend in overfeeding cats and causing premature death in pursuit of publicity .

In April 2004 , Mikesch , a German cat weighing 6 times a cat 's normal weight was taken to a Berlin animal shelter while the elderly owner went into a nursing home .
The man had been feeding Mikesch 2 kilograms of mince each day compared to a normal diet of 300 grams of food daily .
Mikesh's weight reached 18.5 kg and he was unable to take more than 4 steps without becoming exhausted .
Mikesch 's heart , joints and breathing were all suffering due to his excessive weight and the cat could not clean himself properly .
Mikesch was put on a strict weight - reducing diet .
Although Guinness World Records no longer recorded fat cats , the unofficial record in April 2004 was a cat called OT from Minnesota who weighed in at 18.55 kg .
In February 2006 , another immensely fat cat was reported , this time in China .
The 33 pound nine - year - old cat has a 31.5 inch waist and resides in Qingdao , Shandong Province .
Surprisingly for a country where cats are most often kept as working animals , this is a cossetted pet who has to be helped onto a bed to pursue his other favourite pastime of sleeping .
Obesity has not yet taken a toll on the cat 's health and his appetite , rather than any medical cause , is to blame for his obesity .
His main diet is a whopping 6 lbs of chicken and pork daily , but he is not interested in fish .
A 44 lb ( 20 kg ) cat named Princess Chunk was found wandering the southern New Jersey community of Voorhees in July 2008 .
The Camden County Animal Shelter sought the owner and were trying to get the cat on a diet as well as getting her to take some exercise on a leash .
However , the obese cat went to New York to appear on talk shows , potentially fuelling the misguided idea of feline fat acceptance .
The cat turned out to be a male named Powder that had been abandoned by a woman whose home was repossessed .
Whoever adopts
Powder will need to get the cat 's weight down if the pet is not to develop heart disease , joint problems and diabetes .
The average adult male cat is 28 - 29 inches long ( 71 - 73 cm ) including a tail of 11 inches ( 28 cm ) .
The average adult female cat is 26 inches long ( 6 cm ) including a tail of 9.5 inches ( 24 cm ) .
There is great variation between breeds .
Snowbie measured almost 41 inches ( 103 cm ) from nose to tail - tip , including his 12 inch ( 31 cm ) tail .
Guinness have now distanced themselves from animal obesity records and instead record " Longest Cat " .
The world 's longest cat , outdoing previous holder Snowbie , is 8 year old Maine Coon Leo ( full name Verismo's Leonetti Reserve Red ) , owned by Frieda Ireland and Carroll Damron of Chicago weighed in at 15.8 kg ( 35 lb ) and measured 121.9 cm ( 48 in ) from nose to tail .
Leo 's diet includes dry cat food , green vegetables , basil , parsley and blue cheese .
Leo 's vet , and Guinness judges , stress that Leo is not overweight and that he holds the record for his length , not his weight .
A red longhair called Clarence , born in December 1974 and owned by Mrs Milinda Los of Burnaby , British Columbia , Canada , measured 41.5 inches ( 105.4 cm ) long and had a 13 inch ( 33 cm ) tail .
A British cat called Thomas O'Malley , born in 1972 and owned by Mrs Hilda John of Cardiff , South Wales , measured 41 inches ( 103 cm ) long and had a 12 inch ( 30 cm ) tail .
A male cat called Pinky , owned by Darren Kreit of Southgate , London , was recorded as having a disproportinately long tail in 1978 ; Pinky 's tail was 14 inches ( 35.5 cm ) long .
DWARF AND MIDGET CATS
Dwarfism , miniature breeds , the various causes and the implications of keeping dwarf and midget cats are more fully discussed in Dwarf and Midget Cats
Dwarfism and midgetism has been recorded in cats .
Achondroplasia dwarfism affects the arm and leg bones giving a normal - sized body with short legs .
Midgetism ( pituitary dwarfism ) produces a small individual with normal body proportions .
Another form of dwarfism produces a compact cat with shorter than normal legs and a short body ; the proportions of legs , body and head are visibly " wrong " but the cat is neither a Munchkin - type nor a midget .
Other causes are metabolic disorders ( lack of growth hormone ) and congenital defects ( birth defects ) which cause the individual to stop growing .
I have seen dwarf cats in severely inbred feral cat colonies .
Some genuine feline dwarfs have weighed under 4 lb ( under 2 kg ) when fully - grown .
A diminutive female shorthair called " Kitu " owned by Wanda Mitka of Laverton , Victoria , Australia was examined at the University of Melbourne School of Veterinary Science in 1979 .
Kitu was 7.87 in ( 20 cm ) tall at shoulder , but perfectly formed and in perfect health .
Her diminutive stature was due either to a genetic mutation or a congenital problem ( birth defect ) causing her to simply stop growing .
Smaller yet was a male Siamese / Manx cross called " Ebony - Eb - Honey - Cat " owned by Angelina Johnston of Boise , Idaho , USA .
In 1984 , aged 4 , he weighed only 1 lb 12 oz ( 792 g ) but ate as much as a 12 lb ( approx 5.5 kg ) cat in the same household .
A " boisterous " dwarf male cat named " Pete " ( b 1973 ) owned by Jackie Reed of Bognor Regis , Sussex , England weighed only 12 oz ( 339 g ) at the age of 3 months compared to 3.4 lb ( 1.6 kg ) for his normal - sized littermates .
Pete 's weight never exceeded 2 lb ( 907 g ) when he was full grown .
A 2 year old dwarf female owned by Mrs M Wildgoose of Gillingham , Kent , England weighed only 2 lb 15 oz ( 1.3 kg ) in 1983 .
More recently , the worlds smallest cat was reported to be a male blue point Himalayan ( Colourpoint Persian ) named " Tinker Toy " who stands 7 cm ( 2.75 inches ) at the shoulder and 19 cm ( 7.5 inches ) long - presumably excluding tail .
Information about his weight does not seem to be available so it is n't possible to compare his size to that of " Pete " .
In November 2003 the Guinness Record was held by 2 year old Itse Bitse who measured 9.52 cm ( 3.75 inches ) high and and 38.1 cm ( 15 inches ) long .
In July 2004 , there were 3 other contenders for the Guinness title of " World 's Smallest Living Domestic Cat " .
In July 2004 , there were 3 other hopefuls for the Guinness title of " World 's Smallest Living Domestic Cat " .
Mr Peebles , from Pekin , Illinois , USA , weighs only 3.3 lbs ( 1.5 kg ) at 2 years old ( normal weight for a 2 year old cat is 8 - 10 lbs /3.6 - 4.5 kg ) .
Mr Peebles is now full grown and his small size is due to a genetic mutation ; he also has spinal problems and a disproportionately large head .
Mr Peebles ' vital statistics were confirmed as 6.1 inches ( 15.5 cm ) tall and 19.2 inches ( 48.76 cm ) from his head to the tip of his tail ( his tail is just over 7 inches / 17.8 cm ) which , unfortunately for his claim , is larger than Itse Bitse .
A 7 year old cat called Maggie , from Colfax , California , USA , is claimed to weigh less than 3 lbs ( 1.36 kg ) and to be smaller in size than Mr Peebles .
A 2 year old cat called Gizmo from Marlton , USA , weighed in at only 2 lbs ( 0.9 kg ) and her small stature is believed to be due to a genetic mutation .
The vital statistics of Maggie and Gizmo have not yet been independently verified .
Genuine miniature cat breeds are a new development in the cat fancy though there are several small cat breeds .
Adult Singapura males weigh approx 6 lb ( 2.7 kg ) and females weigh as little as 4 lb ( 1.8 kg ) .
Some healthy adult female Siamese cats weigh as little as 5 lb ( 2.26 kg ) though some male Siamese can reach 20 lb ( 9 kg ) .
Some Siamese breeding lines give smaller , more " fragile - looking " cats than others and the old - style Siamese cats are more robust than the rather skinny modern version of this breed .
The Mei-Toi was once advertised as a genetically miniature cat with no accompanying details .
Latest information is that the Mei-Toi is now bred with Munchkins .
The Munchkin 's short legs are due to achondroplasia which stunts the growth of the long bones ; they are therefore normal - sized cats with short legs .
The Toybob is a Russian miniature breed , no larger than a normal 3 - 4 month kitten .
Toybobs have short , solid bodies and excellent muscles , with a short tail or pompom - like bobtail .
Through a carefully selected breeding program begun in the mid 1980's , a breeder from Staten Island , New York , USA successfully " down - sized " Persians and Himalayans ( i.e. by breeding only the smallest cats in the bloodline ) to consistently produce genetically smaller versions .
All other physical features and personality traits remained the same as their larger counterparts .
The miniaturisation is variable and cats bred vary according to the size they reach at 9 - 10 months of age .
Mini females™ weigh 6 - 8 lbs and Mini males™ are 8 - 10 lbs .
The Pixie™ females are 4 - 6 lbs with Pixie™ males weighing 6 - 8 lbs .
The smallest category , Teacup females are a mere 2 - 4 lbs while the Teacup males are 3 - 6 lbs .
It is not always possible to determine which kittens in a litter will reach which of these size categories .
Miniature kittens are more vulnerable ( e.g. to temperature fluctuations ) than normal sized kittens .
Being miniature poses health problems to pregnant cats so the breeding females must be 4 - 8 lbs in weight and breeding males are 4 - 10 lbs .
The trademarking of the " Mini " prefix may be a problem since this prefix is a standard part English and " Mini- Himalayans " have occurred in the past ( unconfirmed reports from Europe ) .
The other diminutive Persians are Bonnie Arnold 's Toy Persians which mature at about 3 - 4 pounds , compared with the normal 14 pounds .
In contrast to the down - sizing breeding program , these are the result of a sudden mutation .
Her Teacup Persians and Toy Persians began in 1995 when a spontaneous genetic mutation occurred within the sperm - producing cells of a 14 lb breeding male Persian called " Treker " .
76 % of kittens sired by Treker are miniatures .
Toy Persians mature at around 5 lb while Teacup Persians mature at 3 - 4 lbs pounds ( it is not always possible to determine which kittens will end up which size ) .
Despite their small size , the diminutive cats are apparently perfectly healthy .
Several other miniature cats have been reported in the last several years ; these include miniature Siamese and number of miniature random - bred cats .
Genetically small cats are now being used in some breed programs to create Mini-versions of popular breeds : Mini-Bengals , Mini-Munchkin , Mini - Keuda - in fact once the mutation for miniature cats has appeared , it can be introduced into any breed .
There are problems where miniature ( dwarf or midget ) female cats are allowed to breed - if the kittens reach full term and are not miniature , a caesarean section is needed as their larger heads cannot pass through the miniature mother 's birth canal .

A while ago I mentioned that oil producing countries are starting to go renewable .
In that post I mentioned how they are just getting their toes wet , well not the UAE , they are diving in .
Abu Dhabi which holds more than 90 % of the oil reserves of the United Arab Emirates announced they are going to be spending 350 million dollars on a 500 MW solar plant .
Which to me seems like a typo , as that seems like A LOT of solar for only 350 million .
But if they even produce 1/5th that much it will be one of the largest solar power plants in the world .
If it ’s not a typo , well that is going to be one hell of a big solar plant .
The 500 megawatt plant , expected to begin operations in 2009 , is part of Abu Dhabi ’s drive to cut dependence on hydrocarbon power generation , said Sultan al - Jaber , chief executive of state - owned Abu Dhabi Future Energy Co. …
The emirate eventually hopes to provide solar power to 10,000 homes and is setting up a special economic zone for the alternative energy industry , Jaber said .
“ We … do not want to be 100 per cent dependent on ( hydrocarbon power ) , Jaber said .
“ We have an economic development programme dedicated to establishing an entirely new economic sector focused on alternative energy and sustainable technologies , ” he said .
The plant will be the first of its kind in the Gulf , home to oil and gas producers who supply a fifth of the world ’s energy needs , he said . ( via )
What this tells me is that oil producing nations realize that they will soon run out of cheap oil .
Look for them to introduce renewable energy sources in reverse proportion to the amount of cheap oil they think they have left .
They want to be able to sell oil to foolish countries ( * cough * us * cough * ) at super high prices and still have plenty of energy left over .
We could just cut out the middle man and build our own solar plants , show em that “ these colors do n’t run ! ”
I kid about the hyper- nationalism but am serious about positioning America as a world leader in renewable energy .
I feel it would benefit the citizens of this nation , and help the rest of the world as well .

University of Arizona astronomers who are probing the oxygen - rich environment around a supergiant star with one of the world 's most sensitive radio telescopes have discovered a score of molecules that include compounds needed for life .
" I do n't think anyone would have predicted that VY Canis Majoris is a molecular factory .
It was really unexpected , " said Arizona Radio Observatory ( ARO ) Director Lucy Ziurys , UA professor of astronomy and of chemistry .
" Everyone thought that the interesting chemistry in gas clouds around old stars was happening in envelopes around nearer , carbon - rich stars , " Ziurys said .
" But when we started looking closely for the first time at an oxygen - rich object , we began finding all these interesting things that were n't supposed to be there . "
VY Canis Majoris , one of the most luminous infrared objects in the sky , is an old star about 5,000 light years away .
It 's a half million times more luminous than the sun , but glows mostly in the infrared because it 's a cool star .
It truly is " supergiant " -- 25 times as massive as the sun and so huge that it would fill the orbit of Jupiter .
But the star is losing mass so fast that in a million years -- an astronomical eyeblink -- it will be gone .
The star already has blown away a large part of its atmosphere , creating its surrounding envelope that contains about twice as much oxygen as carbon .
Ziurys and her colleagues are not yet halfway through their survey of VY Canis Majoris , but they 've already published in the journal , Nature ( June 28 issue ) , about their observations of a score of chemical compounds .
These include some molecules that astronomers have never detected around stars and are needed for life .
Among the molecules Ziurys and her team reported in Nature are table salt ( NaCl ) ; a compound called phosphorus nitride ( PN ) , which contains two of the five most necessary ingredients for life ; molecules of HNC , which is a variant form of the organic molecule , hydrogen cyanide ; and an ion molecule form of carbon monoxide that comes with a proton attached ( HCO + ) .
Astronomers have found very little phosphorus or ion molecule chemistry in outflows from cool stars until now .
" We think these molecules eventually flow from the star into the interstellar medium , which is the diffuse gas between stars .
The diffuse gas eventually collapses into denser molecular clouds , and from these solar systems eventually form , " Ziurys said .
Comets and meteorites dump about 40,000 tons of interstellar dust on Earth each year .
We would n't be carbon - based life forms otherwise , Ziurys noted , because early Earth lost all of its original carbon in the form of a methane atmosphere .
" The origin of organic material on Earth -- the chemical compounds that make up you and me -- probably came from interstellar space .
So one can say that life 's origins really begin in chemistry around objects like VY Canis Majoris . "
Astronomers previously studied VY Canis Majoris with optical and infrared telescopes .
" But that 's kind of like diving in with a butcher knife to look at what 's there , when what you need is an oyster fork , " Ziurys said .
The Arizona Radio Observatory 's 10 - meter Submillimeter Telescope ( SMT ) on Mount Graham , Ariz. , excels as a sensitive stellar " oyster fork . "
Chemical molecules each possess their own unique radio frequencies .
The astronomers identify the unique radio signatures of chemical compounds in laboratory work , enabling them to identify the molecules in space .
The ARO team recently began testing a new receiver in collaboration with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory .
The receiver was developed as a prototype for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array , a telescope under construction in Chile .
The state - of - the - art receiver has given the SMT 10 times more sensitivity at millimeter wavelengths than any other radio telescope .
The SMT can now detect emission weaker than a typical light bulb from distant space at very precise frequencies .
The UA team has discovered that the molecules are n't just flowing out as a gas sphere around VY Canis Majoris , but also are blasting out as jets through the spherical envelope .
" The signals we receive show not only which molecules are seen , but how the molecules are moving toward and away from us , " said Stefanie Milam , a recent doctoral graduate on the ARO team .
The molecules flowing out from VY Canis Majoris trace complex winds in three outflows : the general , spherical outflow from the star , a jet of material blasting out towards Earth , and another jet shooting out a 45 degree angle away from Earth .
Astronomers have seen bipolar outflows from stars before , but not two , unconnected , asymmetric and apparently random outflows , Ziurys said .
Ziurys said she believes the two random jets are evidence for what astronomers earlier proposed are " supergranules " that form in very massive stars , and has been seen in Betelgeuse .
Supergranules are huge cells of gas that form inside the star , then float to the surface and are ejected out of the star , where they cool in space and form molecules , creating jet outflows with certain molecular compositions .
Back in the 1960s , no one believed molecules could survive the harsh environment of space .
Ultraviolet radiation supposedly reduced matter to atoms and atomic ions .
Now scientists conclude that at least half of the gas in space between the stars within the 33 - light - year inner galaxy is molecular , Ziurys said .
" Our results are more evidence that we live in a really molecular universe , as opposed to an atomic one , " Ziurys said .

" I ’m the commander in chief , see , I do n’t need to explain , I do not need to explain why I say things .
That ’s the interesting part about being president .
Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something , but I do n’t feel like I owe anybody an explanation . "
~ George W. Bush
Harvard Professor of Government Harvey C. Mansfield ‘s May 2 Wall Street Journal essay  The Case for the Strong Executive is a remarkable brief on behalf of unreconstructed fascist rule through an Executive emancipated from the rule of law .
Mansfield , who unblushingly admits that the alternative to the rule of law is " tyranny , " insists that the " defects " of our system of liberty under law suggest " the need for one - man rule . "
Seriously .
He really wrote those words .
And he apparently meant them .
He likewise maintains that the rule of law " is inferior to the living intelligence of a wise man on the spot . "
This presumably would be true of our incumbent tyrant , an individual who displays no symptoms of either intelligence or wisdom .
To the best of my admittedly limited knowledge , Mansfield — who is making his bid to become the neo-conservative Giovanni Gentile — is the first American public intellectual of consequence to offer the unflinching declaration , by way of an op - ed in a prominent mainstream periodical , that the rule of law is disposable — and that the executive power supposedly embodied in the president exists apart from the law .
Mansfield refers to the struggle between  the strong executive and its adversary , the rule of law — a formulation that cannot co-exist with the constitutional mandate ( which is also cited by the professor ) that the president take care that the laws be faithfully executed .
If the executive is an adversary of the law , how can he carry out the function of enforcing it ?
Like John C. Yoo and other exponents of unlimited executive power in the Bush Regime , Mansfield believes that the president draws his power not from the Constitution but from  Necessity  — or , as Machiavelli ( whose dubious authority the professor repeatedly invokes ) puts it , la necessita che non da tempo ( the necessity that allows no time ) .
In times of crisis , therefore , the president , as head of the energetic branch of government , can exercise plenary power , at least according to Mansfield ’s model .
In this he would certainly be in agreement with the energetic chief executive who seized extraordinary powers to February 28 , 1933 to deal with a crisis precipitated by the burning of Germany ’s Reichstag Building .
But this comparison is somewhat unfair …. to Hitler and his followers , that is .
The Nazi definition of Fhrerprinzip posited that the chief executive was the embodiment of the General Will .
This was explained in the Organization Book of the German National Socialist Party :
The Führer - Reich of the [ German ] people is founded on the recognition that the true will of the people cannot be disclosed through parliamentary votes and plebiscites but that the will of the people in its pure and uncorrupted form can only be expressed through the Führer … .
He shapes the collective will of the people within himself and enjoys the political unity and entirety of the people in opposition to individual interests … .
[ His ] power is not limited by checks and controls , by special autonomous bodies or individual rights , but it is free and independent , all - inclusive and unlimited … .
He is responsible only to his conscience and the people ….
In practice , of course , Hitler and his clique did n’t defer to the will of the people  in any meaningful sense .
Be that as it may , Mansfield ’s version of the  Leader Principle  is actually more radical than the official Nazi version of that doctrine , since he begins with the assumption that the president — by virtue of some divine afflatus , perhaps ? — is endowed with insight superior to that of the common people , and thus has the power , nay , the moral responsibility to defy the public will :
 A strong executive is requisite to oppose majority faction produced by temporary delusions in the people .
For the Federalist , a strong executive must exercise his strength especially against the people , not showing them ‘ servile pliancy … .
‘ Responsibility ’ is not mere responsiveness to the people ; it means doing what the people would want done if they were apprised of the circumstances . 
I would n’t presume to know Mr. Mansfield ’s unspoken desires and motivations .
It is significant , though , that the lines above saw print just a day after the Grand and Glorious Decider , in defiance of public opinion , vetoed a military appropriations measure that oh - so - tentatively prefigured an end to his precious war .
Here are a couple of " energetic executives " who shared Mansfield ’s hostility to the rule of law and civil liberties .
I ca n’t help but suspect that this was —
I ’ll be delicate here — an act of rectal osculation by a servile court academic .
It is also a complete inversion of the description offered in the Federalist of the executive ’s role .
What the Founders understood , and the Idiot King ’s war in Iraq demonstrates beyond dispute , is that a lawless executive is the public official most likely to induce and capitalize on temporary delusions of the people . 
The strength and energy the executive is supposed to exercise consists of holding fast against transient democratic pressures to aggrandize the central government ; it is not his role to use whatever powers he can arrogate to himself to overcome public opposition to expensive and freedom - devouring central government undertakings .
As it happens , Mansfield has as little use for individual liberty as he has for the rule of law .
This is n’t surprising , since these two concepts are intimately intertwined — just as foreign war is joined to executive lawlessness in unholy wedlock .
 In our time ,  the professor pontificates , an opinion has sprung up in liberal circles particularly that civil liberties must always be kept intact regardless of circumstances .
This opinion assumes that civil liberties have the status of natural liberties , and are inalienable . 
As Thomas Jefferson might interject at this point ,  Well , duh . 
Mansfield , however , disdains the notion that liberties of any sort inhere in the individual , urging instead that we accept a crude utilitarian premise .
The needs of the many — as perceived by the lawless executive — nullify the rights of the few :
 Civil liberties are for majorities as well as minorities , and no one should be considered to have rights against society whose exercise would bring society to ruin .
The usual danger in a republic is tyranny of the majority … .
But in time of war the greater danger may be to the majority from a minority , and the government will be a greater friend than enemy to liberty .
Vigilant citizens must be able to adjust their view of the source of danger , and change front if necessary .
‘ Civil liberties ’ belong to all , not only to the less powerful or less esteemed , and the true balance of liberty and security cannot be taken as given without regard to the threat . 
It ’s important to recognize — as Mansfield certainly must — that the present argument over  the true balance of liberty and security  does not involve only civil liberties ,  but also the most basic individual rights and immunities long recognized in our Anglo - Saxon culture .
We ’ve long since ceased to argue over how to fine - tune the constitutional assignment of powers , or even over whether the Constitution should be followed at all .
At this point , freedom - focused people are trying to restore the Magna Carta by undoing the Bush Regime ’s repeal of the Writ of habeas corpus .
Regarding that fundamental , definitional due process guarantee — the literal foundation of our system of liberty under law — the official position of the Bush Regime today is exactly the same as that of Hitler ’s regime when it suspended habeas corpus on February 28 , 1933 :
Any individual , citizen or non-citizen , can be deprived of the law ’s protection at the whim of the Executive , and imprisoned indefinitely without legal recourse .
Totalitarianism could be described as the creation of order without law through a regime claiming limitless power ( power without limit , resting directly on force , restrained by no laws , absolutely unrestricted by rules ,  as Lenin put it ) .
Professor Mansfield ’s protracted exercise in undergraduate - level sophistry is intended as a defense of the Bush Regime ’s version of this lawless order .
What better evidence can we find to support the once - controversial proposition that  Harvard Hates America ?

You can use it as a hash from a 2D coordinate to an integer .
Some curves preserve locality ; for example , points that are nearby in 2D space are likely to have similar Hilbert distances .
It ’s an isomorphism : you can turn a distance back into a 2D coordinate , in some cases quite easily .
Locality - preserving hashes can be useful for clustering nodes of an R - tree , which is the generalisation of a B - tree to spatial data .

The Hilbert curve is a fractal space - filling curve that is rather pretty to look at .
A Hilbert curve of order n traces a single path over a square of side 2^n units , as you can see in the images from MathWorld above ( with curves of order 2 through 6 ) .
If you pick a point p from within the square covered by a curve , and trace out the curve until you reach that point , the number of intermediate points that you passed through along your way to p is called the Hilbert distance .
The notion of distance along a space - filling curve is useful for a few reasons .
There ’s a nice algorithm for computing the Hilbert distance of a 2D point that ’s linear in the order of the curve ( or logarithmic in the size of the side of the square you ’re trying to cover ) .
To put this into useful terms , a “ 10 megapixel ” camera typically has a resolution of 3766 ×2800 pixels .
To cover every pixel with a Hilbert curve , you ’d need a curve with 4096 points on a side , which is an order - 12 curve .
You can compute the Hilbert distance of any point in your 10 - megapixel photo with 12 steps of the distance algorithm .
Here ’s an implementation of this Hilbert distance algorithm in Haskell .
As you can see , each step requires a few comparisons , a few shifts , and a handful of arithmetic operations , so it ’s fairly cheap , and the loop unrolls and constant - folds well .
There ’s some controversy in the literature over whether a Hilbert curve gives better spatial locality than a Lebesgue ( also known as a Z - order , or Morton ) curve .
It ’s certainly the case that computing the Lebesgue distance is much cheaper than the Hilbert distance , as it ’s possible to finagle an answer using a fixed , unconditional sequence of bit - twiddling operations to interleave the bits of the x coordinate with those of the y.
I have n’t myself checked to see which curve better preserves locality .
It ’s certainly easier to see how to extend the Lebesgue bit - fiddling hack to a higher dimension , while the given Hilbert code is a bit of a head wrecker .
Remember when Chertoff blamed the media for his failing during Hurricane Katrina ?
Download Download ( small file )
What gives Chertoff the right to tell the country that he has a " gut " feeling that we 're going to be hit with a terrorist attack this summer ?
" Summertime seems to be appealing to them , " he said of al - Qaeda .
" We do worry that they are rebuilding their activities . "
Still , Chertoff said there are not enough indications of an imminent plot to raise the current threat levels nationwide .
And he indicated that his remarks were based on " a gut feeling " formed by past seasonal patterns of terrorist attacks , recent al - Qaeda statements , and intelligence he did not disclose .
There is an assessment " not of a specific threat , but of increased vulnerability , " he added .
The administration said they had proof Iraq was going to nuke us so we could invade them .
Better get Jack Bauer on the case .
He 's supposed to protect us and make sure that does n't happen .
Where does he get off inciting fear throughout this country ?
He 's not employed to tell us his feeling or his inner child .
He should be instructing all of Homeland Security to be on high alert and not try to scare the beejesus out of America .
This is a calculated move to ratchet up the terror in this country to help Republican candidates --- PERIOD .
They are far behind in raising money and in all the polls .
He should be fired , but of course since he 's being instructed to say these things ( sounds like a Cheney / Rove play ) he wo n't be .
What a tool ... Update : I forgot about Tom Ridge 's phony terror alerts ... This White House will never stop lying to us .
About five million people in the United States are living with Alzheimer ’s , according to the Alzheimer ’s Association , an advocacy group funded by individual donors as well as foundations and major corporations , including drug makers .
Without a cure or new treatments , the number of those with the disease could grow to 13.2 million by 2050 , the National Institute on Aging estimates .
“ I think this is going to be the disease , and maybe one of the biggest health care political issues of my generation , ” says Robert Essner , 59 , Wyeth ’s professorial chief executive .
“ It ’s hard for anyone to envision how to provide health care in the United States if you ’re going to have to deal with the burden .
You just start to add up the cost , 20 years from now as my generation gets old — it ’s phenomenal . ”
Mr. Essner will have more than a host of grateful baby boomers awaiting him if Wyeth ’s crusade is successful .
The company could snare a big financial payoff from what still amounts to a risky bet , one that has already cost Wyeth about $ 450 million in research funds .
But with a treatment that slows progress of the disease possibly selling at more than $ 20,000 a year , the company ’s Alzheimer ’s program is one reason that some analysts are voicing renewed enthusiasm about Wyeth ’s stock , which had been weighed down for years by costly fen - phen diet drug litigation .
Wyeth is hardly the only company looking for Alzheimer ’s treatments .
Virtually every large drug maker and a number of smaller biotechnology companies are working to develop Alzheimer ’s drugs , with several hundred ideas under study .
Several companies are expected to announce results of clinical studies during an international Alzheimer ’s meeting that is under way in Washington .
“ There seems to be a current of excitement , ” said Peter Davies , a biochemist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx , who has studied Alzheimer ’s for 30 years .
Dr. Davies is working with Eli Lilly and Applied NeuroSolutions on a possible course of treatment that is such a secret that he will not say anything about it .
“ I would n’t say it ’s a race , ” Dr. Davies said , “ but this is novel and we want to get a jump on therapeutics . ”
The four Alzheimer ’s treatments now on the market work by regulating the action of chemical neurotransmitters in the brain .
The drugs — Aricept by Eisai and Pfizer , Exelon by Novartis , Razadyne by Johnson & Johnson and Namenda by Forest Laboratories — have shown mixed results treating Alzheimer ’s symptoms and do nothing to stop the disease ’s progress .

Two years ago my father phoned to tell me that a new prescription from his oncologist — what amounted to his last line of defense against the cancer he had been battling for years — was beyond his reach financially .
His previous treatment had worked far better for him than for the average patient with his condition , but its efficacy had dwindled during a long sabbatical from drug treatment , during which he underwent a major surgery .
Now faced with either an old drug regimen that no longer worked or a prohibitively expensive new drug , his only realistic option , he told me , was to forgo further medication .
In other words , he was prepared to die .
I had a hard time accepting this .
With his engineer ’s mind , my father had managed to navigate his way through the murky realms of conflicting treatments and doctors ’ opinions , keeping himself alive far beyond his original prognosis .
At the time of his call to me , he was fit and strong , and his cancer — which had been stabilized by the previous treatments — was currently progressing at an almost imperceptible rate .
Yet I knew what he probably did not : that his end from this particular disease would be , in the words of an oncologist friend , “ one of the worst deaths possible . ”
If there was any way around this , any way at all to spare or delay the suffering that lay ahead , I was prepared to try it .
Two years later , and a few months after my father died , my mother took the train cross-country to visit me in California .
Somewhere in Nebraska — in the course of a 10 - hour Amtrak delay — Congress passed the Medicare drug bill .
During the dreary wait for railroad repairs , a fellow passenger asked my mother what she thought of this bill .
She did n’t like it , she said , at which point the passenger confessed to being an employee of AARP , and added that the AARP employees did n’t like it any better themselves .
The consensus - of - two was that this was a welfare plan not for the elderly or the sick , but for the phenomenally healthy pharmaceutical industry .
I knew that his end from this particular disease would be , in the words of an oncologist friend , “ one of the worst deaths possible . ”
If there was any way around this , I was prepared to try it .
Somehow , in hearing my mother tell this story , the saga of my father ’s misadventures in the American health care system came full circle .
Triggered by his call two years earlier , I had become something I had never imagined — a smuggler and a fraud — in pursuit of that which my father had never conceived of upon retirement 12 years earlier : a prescription costing so much that it would justify the purchase of an expensive supplemental drug - insurance plan .
My family of immigrants , once eager for a piece of the buoyant American economy , found ourselves wondering if we would have fared better in virtually any other industrialized country on earth , where the impossible choice between bankrupting ourselves , breaking the law , or forgoing lifesaving treatments did not exist .
“ I do n’t know why Americans resent paying taxes , ” my father often said during my childhood .
“ They do n’t seem to understand that taxes provide them with things they need . ”
By the end of his life , I think he resented taxes himself , perceiving that too much of the wages of the middle class was spent on corporate entitlement programs , including those aiding the $ 235 billion - a- year global pharmaceutical industry .
By the time of his death , the business of prescription drugs had become the most profitable industry in America , with a staggering campaign war chest of $ 29.4 million in 2002 — enough funds to employ in excess of 600 lobbyists , more than one for every member of Congress , and enough power to make elections and legislation in its own image .
The new drug my father ’s oncologist was prescribing for him was well known to me ( for legal reasons , I will omit its name and the manufacturer ’s name ) , for it had a fearsome reputation from decades earlier .
How expensive could this drug be , I wondered , when all the research and development had been done 40 years ago , at a fraction of the modern costs ?
A hell of a lot , was the answer .
I still do n’t know why .
But in my father ’s case , it was about $ 47,000 a year , with the potential to triple , based on his clinical response , to $ 141,000 a year .
At this rate , in seven years , he could conceivably have spent a million dollars .
Although he had profited from decades of employment in North America , he had not profited well enough to pay for that , and he was realistic enough about his medical future to resist becoming “ spent out ” — the current jargon for those who have anted up all in pursuit of staying alive — leaving him and my mother financially ruined ( at which point , ironically , they would have been eligible for free drugs ) .
Like millions of frustrated others , I turned to the Internet , hoping to find some way of acquiring what my father needed .
There was a whole cadre of us out there , I learned , seeking drugs for ill parents , or spouses , or children .
There were those looking , and those giving — including the survivors of the deceased , who were willing to pass along the remnants of no-longer - needed prescriptions .
Like addicts , we identified ourselves by first name only , and our missives were sad and apologetic .
“ I am sorry , ” wrote a fellow sufferer , who had originally thought he could help me with my father ’s drug .
“ I looked everywhere I could think of and could n’t find any _____ .
It must have been thrown away or used , I guess .
My dad tossed a ton of stuff .
I think I was too disturbed by my mom ’s death to rigorously look through it at the time .
I am very sorry . ”
How expensive could this drug be , I wondered , when all the research and development had been done 40 years ago , at a fraction of the modern costs ?
Answer : $ 47,000 a year , with the potential to triple to $ 141,000 .
Upon my father ’s retirement in 1991 , he automatically became covered by Medicare and chose to purchase supplemental AARP hospitalization insurance .
He decided against the supplemental prescription - drug insurance because , as he later told me , he could not conceive of any drug costing enough to justify paying $ 2,400 a year for it .
For me , one of the more painful aspects of our predicament was the fact that my father , a son of the Depression and of World War II , prided himself on always being prepared for the bleakest prospects the future might deliver .
But not even his darkest imaginings could prepare him for the breathtaking ascent in the price of drugs — costing Americans $ 213.4 billion in 2003 — which he regarded as a personal failure of his preparedness skills .
Because more than a third of Medicare patients have no prescription - drug benefits , Congress enacted the Medicare drug bill last December , at an estimated cost of $ 400 billion over the next decade .
In the weeks following its passage , it became a matter of morbid curiosity to me to assess whether or not the new law would have solved my father ’s problems .
If he had survived , here is what he might have looked forward to : After paying a $ 420 annual premium , plus a $ 250 annual deductible , the government would have covered 75 percent of his prescription costs up to $ 2,250 ; he would then have been responsible for all payments up to $ 5,100 , at which time the government ’s catastrophic aid would have kicked in , paying 95 percent of his drug expenses .
So I estimate that he would have been responsible for $ 6,115 of his $ 47,000 cancer drug .
Would he have paid that much ?
I ca n’t say for sure .
Locked into a fixed income that was in decline along with the stock market , he might have decided against it .
Generally speaking , if my father had been a very low - income senior , he might have fared better under the new plan , unless he lived in a state where Medicaid had been paying for prescriptions without charging him deductibles or premiums .
If he had been a middle - income senior with modest drug costs , he would probably have fared no better and might have ended up paying more in annual premiums than his drugs cost .
If his expenditures had fallen into the “ doughnut hole , ” between $ 2,250 and $ 5,100 , he would have found little relief .
Ironically , his worst - case scenario under the new plan would have been a complete reversal of what had been the best - case scenario , i.e. , a retiree who still enjoys employer - paid health coverage .
Such people were once the lucky few ; but under the new legislation , all 3.8 million of them stand to lose that coverage entirely .
And those whose new Medicare drug bene - fits will be provided via privately run programs could find themselves denied expen - sive drugs , say , ones that cost $ 47,000 .
So who will fare well ?
Doctors and hospitals will get a boost , because a scheduled cut in their Medicare payments has been eliminated .
The insurance companies will receive new subsidies designed to encourage them to cover seniors and the disabled .
But the really big winners will be the drug companies , who are estimated to see a 9 percent increase in sales , or $ 13 billion in additional profits per year .
After a lot of fruitless trolling , my Internet searches eventually led me to a pharmaceutical company overseas that made the same drug my father needed under a different brand name for roughly $ 1,200 a year — absurdly cheaper than the $ 47,000 a year the American company was demanding ( and roughly one - fifth what my father would have paid under the new Medicare bill ) .
What would you do ?
Well , I did it too — and can now add drug smuggling to the dubious accomplishments on my résumé .
My family was not alone .
For years , patients with AIDS or cancer have been buying drugs from Mexico , either because these drugs are not available in the United States , or because they are available more cheaply south of the border .
More recently , Americans have begun wandering north .
The first organized busloads of drug - buying American seniors crossed into Canada in the mid-1990s , and currently , between 1 and 2 million Americans of all ages buy Canadian drugs via the Internet .
It ’s easy to see why .
Cholesterol - lowering Lipitor costs $ 127 in the United States , $ 60 in Canada ; the anti-arthritis drug Celebrex costs $ 106 here , $ 41 there .
Having spent much of my adult life traveling and working overseas , and having many personal contacts in foreign countries , I had the means to procure a doctor in the country that manufactured the drug , get a prescription , fill it at a pharmacy there , and bring it home .
We had concerns , though .
I worried that U.S. Customs , or even airport security , might ask what I was doing with so many foil - wrapped packets of pills .
To offset this possibility , I opened all the packets and emptied their contents into prescription bottles I had brought along .
Yet this solution raised another concern : the memory of a news story a few years ago about an American woman trapped in a hellhole of an overseas jail because she had prescription drugs in mismatched bottles .
Luckily , when smuggling my father ’s prescription , no one ever stopped or questioned me , and aside from some sweaty moments feeling like a drug runner ( and hoping I did not look like one ) , the process went smoothly .
Over time I was also able to use non-American friends as coyotes to smuggle refills .
Within a couple of months , my family ’s other concern — that the foreign drug would be ineffective — proved groundless .
Scans showed my father ’s tumors , which had previously been advancing , were in retreat ; his doctors were delighted with his response and even more tickled to learn how he had overcome the impossible limitations of the American health care system .
My father ’s current supply of the drug was running out , and we did n’t know if an interruption in treatment would enable the cancer to renew its attack .
We split his daily dose in half , trying to eke out his supply .
When the delay continued , we halved it again .
A few months later I discovered that we might be able to import the drug quasi-legally into the country .
“ We have sent ______ to the USA many times , ” wrote my contact at the overseas pharmaceutical company .
“ We have contacted DHL and they advised that , if the doctor clearly specifies the doses in the prescription , they think there will be no problem in USA customs . ”
Filled with optimism at reclaiming the status of law - abiding citizens , we sent off the money and the order .
But the process took longer than anticipated .
My father ’s current supply of the drug was running out , and we did n’t know if an interruption in treatment would enable the cancer to renew its attack .
We worried .
As weeks passed and the shipment still had not arrived , we worried some more , and then split his daily dose in half , trying to eke out his supply .
When the delay continued , we halved it again .
Eventually , we heard from U.S. Customs that the package was being held by the Food and Drug Administration , which was not convinced of the legality of this import or of my father ’s need for this foreign drug .
We provided a slew of hastily improvised reasons why this formula was better than the American formula , pointedly avoiding the only real reason — because the FDA had advised us it was not a valid one — which was that the foreign version was monumentally cheaper , and the only one we could afford .
The FDA was not swayed .
“ We cannot vouch for the efficacy of this foreign drug , ” my FDA case officer told me , as I struggled to liberate my father ’s shipment .
I said that I was n’t asking them to vouch for it , because I already knew that it worked , and would be happy to send my father ’s scans as proof .
The FDA likes to cite the dangers of buying drugs from abroad ( even drugs made in the United States and sold in Canada ) , and it is true that there ’s an alarming rise in counterfeit drugs — those made with fake ingredients or diluted doses of the real ingredients .
But buying from American pharmacies is risky too .
Recently , an AIDS patient in San Francisco discovered that his prescription for Serostim , bought through a CVS pharmacy , was actually a fertility drug .
Last August , the FDA pulled 1.8 million doses of counterfeit Lipitor from American pharmacies , but not , it admits , before some was used .
In December , Eli Lilly halted sales to five U.S. drug wholesalers after a counterfeit version of a drug ( which Lilly would not name ) was purchased .
Also that month , federal agents seized some 1 million pills of counterfeit Celebrex , Bextra , and Allegra from a Florida warehouse .
So are American drugs any safer than Canadian ?
To date , the FDA cannot name a single American who has been injured or killed by prescriptions bought from licensed Canadian pharmacies .
Under the new Medicare drug bill , Americans are now expressly forbidden from importing U.S. - made drugs available more cheaply from overseas .
Here ’s how it works : I can go to Europe and buy their wine for less or go to Asia and buy their clothes for less ; American corporations can buy their raw materials for less from overseas , or they can move their operations abroad in order to hire cheaper labor or management .
But in a mind - boggling reversal of the American principle of supply and demand , I cannot purchase cheaper drugs and bring them home .
And try as I might , I cannot imagine who is benefiting from such laws other than the U.S. drug companies .
The regulations did not protect my father — who was desperately seeking his next dose — and were conceivably killing him .
When his supply finally ran dry , we tided him over with a diluted dose from the leftover prescription of a dead person .
When the FDA threatened to destroy his shipment , I contacted my senators and my representative , asking for help .
Dianne Feinstein ’s and Lynn Woolsey ’s people would not or could not give any .
But Barbara
Boxer ’s folks did , inspiringly , and within 48 hours of my request they had sprung my father ’s package from the clutches of the FDA , just in time for the Fourth of July .
In another bizarre aspect of the new Medicare drug bill , Congress has forsworn its ability to negotiate lower drug prices — because this would amount to government price controls , say some lawmakers .
Never mind that by purchasing in such gigantic quantities the government could bargain for a better price — one of the working tenets of capitalism .
Never mind that it already does negotiate for lower prices through the Department of Veterans Affairs .
As things currently stand , the costs of best - selling drugs in America are 77 percent higher than in Canada and Europe ( where prices are tightly regulated ) , enabling the drug companies to milk 66 to 75 percent of their profits from American consumers , who in essence subsidize cheap pills for Canadians and Europeans .
Yet despite this unwitting generosity , I cannot legally visit those countries and reimport what my subsidy sold them on the cheap in the first place .
I can go to Europe and buy their wine for less or go to Asia and buy their clothes for less ; American corporations can buy their raw materials for less from overseas , or they can move their operations abroad in order to hire cheaper labor or management .
But in a mind - boggling reversal of the American principle of supply and demand , I cannot purchase cheaper drugs and bring them home .
Defenders of this aspect of the bill claim that high prices are needed to counteract the enormous costs of research and development of new drugs , the much - touted $ 800 million - plus per new drug , spent over 10 to 15 years of testing .
But is this where the pharmaceutical industry really spends its profits — that 30 to 40 percent annual return on equity that has made it the most profitable business on earth three of the last five years ?
Apparently not .
In 2002 , the nine top publicly traded U.S. companies that market popular drugs to seniors spent $ 45.4 billion on advertising ( restricted in Canada and Europe ) , on marketing ( including billions ’ worth of free drug samples to physicians ) , and on administration .
Meanwhile , they spent only $ 19.1 billion on R&D , much of which is on testing new uses ( and thus new profit centers ) for already approved drugs .
The marketing blitz works .
Americans currently buy more than twice the number of prescriptions as Europeans , and sales of the 50 most heavily advertised drugs jumped 24.6 percent between 1999 and 2000 .
To offset the costs of all this advertising , the drug companies now practice rampant price inflation in the United States , escalating the retail costs of drugs each year by more than three times that of actual inflation .
Although the federal government appears unwilling to address this problem , some states are responding .
In February 2003 , New York sued GlaxoSmithKline , Pharmacia Corp. , and Aventis for illegally inflating what the state and its Medicare recipients paid for prescription drugs through an elaborate pricing scam .
Minnesota is currently suing the pharmaceutical companies ( which state officials call “ the other drug cartel ” ) , because 85 percent of new drug R&D is performed by the National Institutes of Health and tax - funded university labs .
Both suits are pending .
Meanwhile , the costs of generic drugs , those once trusty alternatives , are rising nearly twice as fast as brand - name drugs , due in part to the consolidation of the generic - drug industry .
So even thrifty patients are joining the ranks of the one - fifth of Americans who currently cannot afford what their doctors prescribe and are forced to skip doses , or entire prescriptions , in order to make ends meet .
The pipeline for my father ’s drug worked well for the remainder of 2002 .
But at the end of that year , a package foundered on the shores of the FDA , and not even Barbara Boxer ’s people could wrestle it free .
The government was cracking down on imports , and although my contact officer at the FDA was sympathetic , she nixed the few remaining loopholes almost as soon as she thought them through .
In the end , she suggested that I try the prescription - drug - assistance program of the U.S. pharmaceutical company that made the drug my father needed .
We had already tried this — back in the beginning — following the advice of one of my father ’s doctors , who suggested that we need not be “ entirely truthful ” as to his financial situation on the application .
So we lied , but only a little , and were rejected .
Now , a year later , we would try again , and I was prepared to be utterly ruthless this time .
It did not feel like stealing because , in all honesty , I did n’t feel bad about milking a company so willing to do the same to us .
When I queried a representative at the prescription - drug - assistance program as to whether my father needed to be indigent to be accepted , she said no , not indigent .
Then , miraculously , she coughed up one small brilliant truth , which in the ensuing silence I knew she was already regretting .
“ We do n’t actually check anything you say on the application , ” she told me .
It was like being given a key to the City of Health .
We submitted the new application for my father , the almost - indigent , and were accepted .
The new drugs began arriving free from our former $ 47,000 - a- year nemesis .
In retrospect , the whole process of getting this drug for my father — although difficult and painful — was easier for my family than it would be for many others .
We were willing and financially able to travel overseas , to ask help of ( or harass ) our elected officials , to pour our collective energy into pioneering a solution .
At the beginning of our search , my father had already spent his retirement years on what I estimate to be the equivalent of a full - time job managing his own health care — either researching it , administrating it , or undergoing it .
I ca n’t imagine this was what he had envisioned for his golden years , but he did the work stoically , employing the same problem - solving talents he had used as a private contractor on classified Defense projects for the U.S. government .
But by the time his cancer drugs began arriving free of charge , his health was failing .
In the last months of his life , he could no longer negotiate a phone call to wrangle with drug companies or government agencies .
He could not have managed finding alternate sources of the drug .
If he had been like millions of others without the strength to help themselves , or without resourceful helpers , he would have died earlier .
As many must do .
A couple of months after his free drugs arrived , my father entered the hospital for the last time .
His drugs came with him and were administered until nearly the end .
Amazingly , his prescription was still working , was still holding the cancer in check .
The drug ’s initial promise had proved well worth all the subsequent troubles and anxieties , buying him another year of life at least , so that he did not die from his cancer , the worst possible death , as I had feared .
Instead , his heart quit , possibly due to problems with other treatments attendant to his condition .
Or maybe he was worried about the way his full - time job managing his health care had become ours .
At any rate , he was tired .
He let us go .
Will the medicare drug bill help ?
Maybe .
But I have absolutely no doubt that the smuggling will go on .
The bus trips to Tijuana and Toronto will continue to deliver the desperate who have no alternative but to pay $ 14 for the Tamoxifen that would cost them $ 60 at home .
The flights around the world to cheap pharmacies and drug companies will not disappear simply because the government will , beginning in 2006 , pay 75 percent of drug costs for seniors spending less than $ 2,250 a year .
One - quarter of Americans under the age of 65 have no prescription - drug benefits whatsoever , and they will remain highly motivated to search elsewhere .
I continue to get requests from the others out there with first names only who are looking for the same drug my father once used .
I am more than happy to tell them what I know , how to work the system , how to break the law .
Only when the prices of drugs fall into some compliance with the rest of the world will the black market subside .
I wonder if the pharmaceutical giants ever calculate what would happen to their profits if they lowered their prices and wooed back all the lost consumers like my father who are fleeing to the far ends of the earth .
Or if , by making drugs affordable , they might not attract all those who simply throw away their prescription slips because they cannot afford the drugs — or those who stagger their doses for the sake of economy .
In response to the high prices , a few states and municipalities are beginning to flex their bargain - hunting muscles too .
Springfield , Massachusetts , is reimporting drugs from Canada for its city employees .
Burlington , Vermont , plans to follow .
Boston announced it will do so for 7,000 employees and retirees , saving an estimated $ 1 million a year .
New Hampshire plans to reimport for its prison population and Medicaid patients .
Initially , the U.S. government seemed to take this trend in stride .
But last December , when Illinois announced its plan to save $ 91 million by reimportation , Governor Blagojevich was warned by the feds that such a move would be illegal .
“ Our law is very specific , ” said a government spokesperson .
“ It ’s not ‘ will not . ’
It ’s ‘ cannot . ' ”
And drug companies are also being aggressive : GlaxoSmithKline warned Canadian pharmacies to stop selling to Americans or their supplies would be shut down .
In the wake of this anarchy , a few in Congress are re-examining a bill sponsored by Rep. Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota that would allow reimportation from FDA - approved facilities in 25 industrialized countries and employ technology to prevent counterfeiting .
But if the pharmaceutical industry gets its way , such legislation will die — turning an increasing number of sick and desperate Americans into outlaws , or forcing them into early graves .
Meanwhile , my contact information floats in cyberspace , and I continue to get requests from the others out there with first names only who are looking for the same drug my father once used .
I am more than happy to tell them what I know , how to work the system , how to break the law .
“ Thanks so much ! ” one contact responded .
“ ( And thank goodness for email and the wonderful network of caring people such as you . )
This is terrific information !
Until the FDA comes to its senses , it seems that those overseas are truly our friends . ”
Others write to me of their struggles when the loved ones they fought so hard to save die .
“ My mom was very religious , so I read the Bible .
But sometimes nothing seems to help .
My mom was a kind of optimistic , cheerful type person .
So it is going to be hard to find something to compensate for that , as well as her caring and love for me .
I mean , you do n’t find that anywhere else in the world . ”
No , you do n’t .
And that ’s why the pipeline wo n’t close until the cheap drugs come home again .
Jul 31 , 2006
I woke up this morning at 8:30 am having contractions .
From the start they were 5 minutes apart , and I just knew , today 's the day , here we go ...
My dream was originally to have the baby at home alone with my husband Don , but as you all know , that dream got shattered to bits .
So after two widwives offered their services for free , I figured that was the route I would take .
But I could n't get over my disappointment at not having the unassisted birth with DH that I wanted , so I decided like 2 weeks ago to just try and go it alone , with Donny watching over me from his place on the mantel .
So this morning I 'm puttering around , laying out a shower curtain on the floor beneath the mantel , then a sheet over it , then towels and chux pads to absorb everything .
I sat on the toilet for a while and contracted there , while Catty explored the birthing area .
Then I decided to try laboring in the shower and rubbing my belly while I contracted , because that helped a lot last time .
Not this time .
We got out of the shower pretty quickly , and brushed our teeth and I put a diaper on Catty , contracting all the while .
Now it was 9:30 , I 'd been in labor one hour , and nothing seemed to be helping .
After my last labor which took 62 hours , I was starting to panic about how bad the contractions were getting this early in the game .
So I ate half a piece of bread , and drank a protein shake for energy , then I struggled into my bikini and headed outside to get the cover off the pool .
I climbed into the water , and WTF ??
It was COLD !!
Not relaxing at all !!
I settled down to see what contractions in the water felt like , and the answer was " not good " .
I clawed at the edge of the pool and nearly bit a hole in the plastic .
Catty climbed into the pool with me , fully dressed , diaper and all , so I had to try to undress her and make sure she did n't drown while I kept contracting .
Ugh .
Ok , pool did n't work , shower did n't work , toilet did n't work , I was in pain , and I wanted an epidural !!
NOW !!
I managed to drag myself inside to the phone , where I called the midwife 's cellphone .
She did n't answer .
Panic !
I called her home number , finally her son answered and I was shouting at Catty to quit crawling all over me so she 's crying and I 'm moaning and panting , and the midwife gets on the phone and hears us , and says " I 'll be right over ! "
So my plan now is for the midwife to take Catty to her babysitter 's place , and then take me to the hospital .
I crawl around gathering up Catty 's things , get her dressed in dry clothes , fill up a sippy cup , all the while stopping to bend over and howl every 3 minutes .
Then I feel like I have to use the toilet again , so I sit there and contract , but I 'm pushing at the same time - great pressure in the butt region , like I 'm taking the world 's biggest poo .
I wipe with some T.P. and check , there 's no poo - something tells me to get back to my birthing area under the mantel , so I do .
It 's now 10:30 , I 've been in labor for 2 hours .
Where 's the !@ ? #$@ ( midwife ???
I kneel over my birthing area and no doubt about it , each contraction is making me push for real .
Baby on the way !
Then there was a pop ! and fluid gushed out of me .
I looked down , my water had broken all over the towels .
It was n't clear fluid , but not much I could do about that now !
Baby moving down inside me ...
For an instant I 'm scared , as I feel the head crowning , but I shouted , " Donny , give me strength ! " and he did !
Two contractions and the head was out !
Then I thought to myself , is n't this the part where the rest of it just " slips out real easy " ?
But no such luck .
The baby 's head was there wiggling , I could feel it , but it was n't just " slipping out " , he was stopping to rotate , which is normal , but I could n't see down there , so I started thinking he was stuck for a panicky minute or two .
And it really only was a minute before the next contraction came , and SQUIP !
Out came the baby !
And there I was , sitting there in my living room , holding a little baby boy I had just delivered all by myself .
With Donny watching down over us , of course .
The baby sounded like he had some fluid still in him , so I used my mouth and sucked out his nose and mouth so he could breathe .
I turned him upside down and thumped his back , then sucked again .
And viola !
He said , " Waaaaahhhh ! "
Catty came running in from the TV room when she heard the squawky little cries of the baby .
She stopped in her tracks and stared .
Then she said " baby ! baby ! " and came running up to examine him closer .
I wrapped the little guy up in a blanket and then took some pics of Catty and the baby checking each other out , and then the doorbell rang .
I stuffed a towel between my legs , went to the front door , peeped my head around at the midwife , and said , " I do n't need you anymore , you can go home ! "
And she was like , " well at least let me check you ... "
Then I threw open the door and there 's me , Catty , and Baby Donny in my arms !
She nearly fell over in shock !
LOL !
So the midwife cleaned up most of the mess and gave the baby a bath while I took a shower .
I got on the scale and I weighed 3 pounds less than my PP weight !
Heh !!
Then I came downstairs and we weighed and measured the baby .
I only gained 7 pounds this pregnancy , but baby Donny weighed 8 pounds , 10 oz !
The same exact weight that Catty was !
( and I gained 40 pounds with her ! )
If this kid had been born on his due date , or 6 days late like Catty was , I would have had the 9 - lb baby I was hoping for , darnit !
Oh well , close enough , eh ?
Just like last time , I 'm healthy as an ox , no complaints .
No tears or any damage down below , either .
The midwife took Catty to the babysitter she uses for her kids , and Catty will spend the day there while I get some down time .
I 'll go pick Catty up tonight , I guess .
No , I do n't have anyone here with me , as we were n't expecting him until the 11th , but I 'm glad I 'm all alone .
It will give me some time to see whether I can handle the newborn and Catty together by myself or not .
Right now , I feel like a million bucks .
Right now , I feel like I can take on the world !
Hell , I delivered a baby all by myself , and I feel great !
Now if only raising the baby can be as easy as having it ... wish me luck - I 'm gonna need it !

Wow .
Larry O'Brien posted his blog 's Technorati rank today and I was quite surprised that his blog is not more popular than it is .
Obviously a lot of people are missing out on a blog that has become one of my favorites .
I 've only been reading Larry 's blog for a few months , but he seems like one of those rare folks who really understand both technology and business at a deep level .
Several of his recent posts have been on the topic of concurrency and the manycore era .
He 's really got me thinking lately about how big of a paradigm shift we 're going to see over the next decade .
Single - core CPUs have been getting faster for so long that we just take it for granted .
Larry 's right .
There is a huge impedance mismatch between tomorrow 's manycore CPU and today 's mainstream programming languages , operating systems and tools .
Not too far in the future , people are going to order a Dell and get a machine with a 16 - core CPU .
Most of us are writing code that will only utilize 1/16th of that chip .
Most of us do n't know how to write software that can effectively utilize 16 cores .
I 've also been seeing a bunch of recent blog posts about Erlang , the tagline for which should be " When people create a new programming language to implement a really great new idea , why can't they use a C - style syntax ? " :-)
Seriously , Erlang 's notion of concurrency is so simple and yet so smart .
Critical sections and locks and mutexes and synchronization are really , really hard .
Erlang eliminates all that crapola by simply prohibiting threads from sharing memory .
The only way two threads can communicate is by sending messages to each other , with copy semantics applied to any data in the message .
( Erlang 's term for a thread is a " process " , implying that it 's much heavier than a thread when in fact the exact opposite is true .
Erlang 's processes are actually very , very lightweight threads . )
I realize I 'm saying nothing new here .
Joel Spolsky posted his rant about map / reduce and functional languages over two weeks ago .
Chris Sells posted his version of this blog entry back in December 2004 .
Erlang was invented 19 years ago .
But the fact is that there is still time to prepare for the many opportunities that are coming in the manycore era .
I bet some of those opportunities are going to be worth a lot of money to somebody .
I normally discourage entrepreneurs from placing bets on major industry changes .
The desire to work on things that are innovative and revolutionary arises from an unrealistic and glamorized concept of entrepreneurship .
The next wave is exciting , but there is plenty of money on the current wave .
In fact , there 's a shocking amount of money to be made still working on the previous wave .
But for me , this particular paradigm shift inspires confidence .
So , to all you would - be entrepreneurs who are always wanting to ride the next wave , start thinking about how mainstream programmers are going to create apps which effectively use CPUs with lots of cores .
And start reading Larry O'Brien 's blog . :-)
According to his most recent approved biographer William Simpson , the aircraft , described as Bandar 's " private plane " , is heavily used .
He says the aircraft flight log includes such destinations as St Lucia in the Caribbean , Rio de Janeiro , Casablanca , Cape Town and Honolulu .
Prince Bandar 's lawyers said last night the aircraft was purchased and fitted out by BAE for the Saudi ministry of defence " pursuant to the al - Yamamah programme " .
It was part of the deal , they said , that " BAE continues to be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the plane " .
The lawyers said the plane was owned by the Saudi air force and had been used by other Saudi dignitaries including King Abdullah and the foreign minister Prince Faisal .
It would be wrong to suggest it was a " corrupt gift " , the legal representatives said .
Prince Bandar denies any impropriety in allegations that he has been paid more than £ 1bn by BAE for his part in arranging the al - Yamamah deal , which was under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office until Tony Blair halted the inquiry on " national security " grounds .
The prince says payments consisted of Saudi official funds and were used for purposes approved by the Saudi ministry of defence .
BAE also deny any impropriety , saying all payments were made with UK government " express approval " , and were confidential .
Yesterday , the attorney - general , Lord Goldsmith , officially admitted that facts were withheld from the international anti-corruption watchdog , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , about Bandar payments .
He said the " national security " cover - up was to prevent leaks to other foreign countries .
The OECD panel is monitoring Britain 's compliance with its anti-bribery treaty , and expressed " serious concern " after a police inquiry was halted .
Lord Goldsmith says he was ignorant of the OECD cover - up move , made by Serious Fraud Office officials .
Writing to Menzies Campbell , leader of the Liberal Democrats , Lord Goldsmith said : " Indeed , I did not know the judgment the SFO had reached about this issue until it arose in the media last week . "
He added : " I gave no orders , instructions or advice to the SFO about that . "
He said Jonathan Jones , his director - general , was present at the Paris meetings " to deal with ... the national security aspects " .
He said Mr Jones " was aware generally of what the SFO proposed to say and participated in discussions in preparation for the working group meeting " .
But he said " what level of detail to give about particular payments " never arose in those discussions
At the Paris meetings of the OECD anti-bribery panel , where prosecutors from the US department of justice were present , the SFO assistant director voluntarily " disclosed ... that they were investigating a series of payments to a senior Saudi official " .
But " the individual was not named , nor were details provided of the payments " .
Lord Goldsmith said : " The OECD did not ask for any more details . "
He added : " The SFO would have been cautious about unnecessarily revealing information which could have gone widely into public circulation , leading to the very damage to national security which the decision to stop the investigation was designed to avoid . "
Sir Menzies said last night : " These events get curiouser and curiouser .
Major decisions ... were taken by officials and not by those with direct ministerial responsibility .
The plain unvarnished truth is that Britain did not reveal significant information to the OECD . "
The US department of justice is understood to be " 99 % certain " to open an investigation in Washington into use of the US banking system for the alleged payments .
Prince Bandar 's aircraft , which he is said to frequently lend to other members of the Saudi royal family , has often been seen by plane spotters landing at RAF Brize Norton , the airfield closest to his 2,000 - acre country estate at Glympton in Oxfordshire , and at an airfield in Colorado near his US ranch at Aspen .

Taxpayer :
Mr. and Mrs. Government :
real cash costs
Attention Taxpayers ..even if you agree we should support alternative energy .. would n't it make more sense to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies from the tax code first and then work from there ?
Instead we have just created competing subsidy progams .
By the end of this entry you will see that oil production subsidies paid for with our tax dollars are very real .
We also know from recent new that biodiesel , solar and ethanol incentives are very real too , especially as of late .
As taxpayers , perhaps we even support the idea that we are helping encourage alternative energy .
Better for national security , the environment etc. .
But imagine you are a policy maker .. lets call them " Mr. and Mrs. Government
" How might that thought process go ? we would like to encourage alternative energy , we have some extra revenue , or at least we can print more money , what shall we do ?
Well , we gave over $ 3 billion to the Big Oil over the last 5 years , so we will want to top that for the ethanol producers right ?
... lets raise taxes or increase our debt and give $ 12 billion to Big Ethanol .
That way they will be $ 9 billion ahead !
Brilliant !
and if we can't raise taxes we will just sell more Debt to China !
I love you , i'm so glad we are helping save the world together .
Me too , we are so smart !
Uh ... hold on there .. can we do a math and logic check ?
The total taxpayer cost there is $ 15 billion and results in a $ 9 billion dollar alternative energy lead .
Could n't we just eliminate the $ 3 billion to oil , and give $ 9 billion to alternative energy , resulting in a $ 6 billion savings , with equal relative advantage to alternative energy ?
Equal realtive ... huh ?
Um hold on , we need to check our campaign finances first ..... we 'll get back to you on that .
I 'm sorry , yes that example was arbitrary and capricious , and probably was n't how the incentives all developed .
But at any point in time , we could pull a move like " Taxpayer " suggests and save some cash right ?
Hey blogger ... you did n't answer the question ... are oil subsidies real ?
Oh yes , and here I will discuss just one of them .
As a young accountant I remember studying tax code , doing tax returns and finding certain things kind of peculier .
One thing that stuck in my head years ago was " percentage depletion " for oil producers , it may have even been on my CPA exam ?
I filed it in the old cranium and it keeps popping back into my conciousness every time I hear energy policy and taxation dicussed in politics and media .
I decided to do some research and see if it is still around ... yup .
This MIT paper explains it very well , but here is a basic summary :
If you own a farm and you sell $ 100 K worth of milk , it 's taxable revenue right .
But you also bought a tractor , and paid employees etc ...
Thoseactually turn out to be $ 80 K .
Nice deduction ... your taxable income is now ony $ 20 K .
" Percentage depletion " allows fossil fuel producers to deduct on their income taxes a set percentage of their revenue instead of their real costs .
The kicker is , there is no relationship to the real cash costs incurred by that company .
It 's like the farmer getting a deduction of 90 cents on every dollar he makes , even though he only spent 80 cents on deductible expenses .
In the oil industry , this excess of deduction over real costs is estimated at over $ 600 million / year .
And that is just one of the many breaks fossil fuel producers get .
Percentage depletion for the oil industry , tax credits and subsidies for biodiesel and ethanol .
The best way to support alternative energy , may just be to end all subsidies across the board !
With billions annually going to percentage depletion , farm subsidies galore , direct subsidy and tax credits for solar , biofuels .. how the hell is anyone supposed to really know what the true cost of a gallon of ethanol or a gallon of unleaded really is ?
And if we factor in or account for the Externalized costs of oil ( great subject ) , perhaps alternative energy does n't even need subsidies at all ?
Labels : Externalities oil subsidy ethanol biodiesel tax policy
How Much Money Do You Need to Retire ?
No matter how much money that we may have , we will never be truly comfortable retiring ; since we can not estimate how much money we will need in retirement .
For example , lets assume that you paid off your house , so you no longer have a mortgage or rent to pay , and you have exactly one million dollars to invest for retirement .
Since you want to retire immediately , you want to put your money in safe and insured U.S. Saving Bonds and Certificate of Deposits ( CDs ) from banks .
A reasonable interest rate for these types of accounts is an average of 6 % .
Therefore in the first year , you will earn $ 60,000 in interest .
Assuming an inflation rate of 3 % , you would have to put $ 30,000 earned back into your principle of bonds and CDs , so that you get the same amount of money each year after inflation .
Therefore , you only have $ 30,000 per year , excluding inflation , to spend on taxes , insurances , transportation , medical expenses , and regular monthly bills such as food , gas , electricity , etc .
In most parts of the United States and with the average lifestyle of retires , this is not enough money to retire .
If you have twice the amount in principle ( two million dollars instead of one million dollars ) , then you would be earning $ 60,000 a year after inflation .
This is a much more reasonable for living in most parts of the United States and with todays lifestyle .
You might be saying ,  Hold on for a second , no one lives forever , so you can take money out of your capital each year . 
Let s say you again no longer have a mortgage to pay , have a million dollars to invest earning an average of 6 % , and need $ 60,000 a year to live ( and you need to increase this amount by 3 % each year for inflation ) .
In this scenario , your million dollars will be completely spent in less than 23 years .
Do you plan on living more or less than 23 years ?
Do you need more or less than $ 60,000 a year to live in retirement ?
To make calculating even more difficult , it is unlikely that you will invest all of your retirement money in bonds and CDs .
Instead , you will be investing roughly half of your money in 401Ks , mutual funds , stocks , annuities , etc. that earned an average of 7 - 10 % in the last 50 years .
Keep in mind , this is only an average and has a huge variation from year to year .
Using the previous scenario but earning an average of 8 % a year using risky investments , this new scenario will make you money last almost 32 years but involves much more risk .
Let s say after two years in retirement , you lose a large percentage of your investments from typical market volatility .
This may force you to return to the work force .
Additionally , you will have to expect unpredictable bills into your retirement calculations , such as periodic medical bills , an unusually long life , a new car every decade or so , possible assisted living , etc .
This list goes on and on .
You will probably need more money than anybody can reasonably predict , especially since it is nearly impossible to guess how long you will live with any accuracy .
Therefore , I hope I have convinced you to seriously think about how much money is needed when retiring .
And try to never touch your investment principle and always factor the rate of inflation , otherwise you may run the risk of not having enough money in retirement especially if you live a very long life with a lot of medical bills .
And if you are extremely conservative with your investments and lifestyle needs , then you will need at least 2 million dollars plus a home that is already paid to retire in 2007 .

Two news stories arose in the same week , each illustrating the significance of living one ’s life with integrity .
The first involved allegations that Republican Congressman Mark Foley had engaged in explicit sexual e-mail conversations with teen - aged male pages .
The other informed us of the killing and wounding of a number of young Amish children by a deranged man .
In the mirror images of these events are reflected both the pathological nature of our world , as well as a vision of how a society might function when men and women live with principled wholeness .
By u201 Cintegrity , u201D
I mean living one ’s life without contradiction or moral confusion ; being integrated — or centered — in thought and action ; expressing both spiritual and material values without conflict ; and having an uncomplicated mind with which to function , creatively , in a complicated world .
The reaction of the political establishment and its self - styled opinion leaders to the Foley matter illustrates the utter lack of integrity in political systems .
Statists and a bamboozled public can recite the virtues of u201 Cpeace , u201D u201 Cfreedom , u201D u201 Cprotection of life and property , u201D u201 Cresponsibility , u201D and other life - sustaining qualities to be sustained by the state while , at the same time , engaging in wars , restraints on individual liberty , the killing and looting of individuals , and acting without being accountable for the consequences of their behavior .
The state — which enjoys a legal monopoly on the use of violence — does nothing more than steal people ’s property , force them to do what they do not choose to do , and kill millions upon millions of persons whom it is convenient to its interests to destroy in wars and genocides .
Such perversions — far more damaging to young people and to a nation than are lewd e-mails — pass without criticism within the halls of state , academia , or media studios .
That so many of us continue to see the political system as essential to u201 Csocial orderu201D reflects our intellectual and spiritual bankruptcy , as well as providing testimony to the remarkable effectiveness of the state ’s propaganda machinery .
The state survives on our individualized lack of integrity .
For most of us , our thinking and emotions are in conflict ; our principles are muddled .
It is our weaknesses that keep it strong .
Not wanting to confront the contradictions that lie within our unconscious minds , many of us eagerly project our self - directed fears onto others , and demand their punishment , a debilitating practice upon which the state depends for its existence .
Mr. Foley provides a vivid example of how this trait corrupts all sense of integrity in both the individual and the political institution .
As a man with an apparent penchant for sexual conversations with teen - aged boys over the Internet , he was Co-Chairman of the Missing and Exploited Children Caucus , and authored legislation — u201CInternet Crimes Against Childrenu201D — that may have criminalized his actions .
The political establishment has circled the wagons against Mr. Foley , treating his offense as sui generis .
But his wrongs pale in comparison with those regularly engaged in by virtually all members of congress and the executive branch : including the use of outright lies , forgeries , and other forms of deceit to fabricate conflicts with other nations .
On the basis of such intrinsic and pervasive dishonesty , the state sends young men and women off to foreign countries to kill or maim innocent people , and be killed or maimed themselves .
The use of torture against anyone the state deems u201Csuspiciousu201D is now widely accepted in Congress and , apparently , among the general public .
Such dishonest and destructive acts continue with only token objection .
But let someone direct lascivious e-mail messages to teenagers and the forces of self - righteous indignation are loosed .
By contrast , if there is a sizeable community of people in America who live with a more centered sense of wholeness than do the Amish , I have not discovered it .
I have long admired these people , and spend one class session each year discussing them in my informal systems of order seminar .
One year , after a lengthy description and analysis of their ways , one of my students asked whether it was possible for non-Amish people to go live with them .
u201CWhy would you want to do so ? , u201D I inquired .
u201CDo you share their religious views , or have a desire to do farm work ?
Are you prepared to live the austere lifestyle upon which they insist ?
u201D
My student answered u201Cnou201D to these questions , acknowledging that she was too much of a Southern California person to make such a fundamental change in how she would live .
u201CSo , what is so powerful about the Amish that attracts you to the possibility of living amongst them ?
u201D , I asked .
u201CIs there something about the integrity of their lives that you find so compelling ?
u201D I then urged my students to explore the question of whether there is a way of emulating the Amish system in a major urban setting .
It is the integrity of the Amish that attracts most of us and makes us want to defend their freedom to live as they do .
Over the years , state and federal governments have tried to force the Amish into their coercive systems , such as government schools , Social Security , military conscription , jury duty , etc .
The Amish — consistent with their peaceful ways — have always refused such participation .
I recall , in the mid-1960s , the efforts of one state school system to force Amish children to attend government schools .
A front - page newspaper photograph was about as expressive of the contrast between these two cultures as you could find : an armed sheriff ’s deputy chasing Amish children through a cornfield in order to force them onto a school - bus .
The scene was so repugnant to any sense of human decency that even most Republicans and Democrats insisted that the state drop its efforts .
There seems to be a widely - held sentiment in society — perhaps faint echoes from our dying inner voices — that the Amish should be left alone .
Those who wonder if it is possible for people to live in a condition of anarchy need look no further than the example of the Amish .
These people refuse to have any dealings with the state — except for the taxes they are forced to pay — and respect the inviolability of one another ’s person or property interests .
Their contracts with one another are grounded in nothing more than mutual promises to perform .
Their system of protection and security is found in one another , not in institutions .
Anyone who deviates from Amish community standards need fear no jails , fines , beatings , or confiscation of their property : the neighbors will simply refuse to deal with them — to withhold their approval — until the offender reforms .
To the Amish , their work — particularly as farmers and carpenters — is the worldly expression of their religious views .
Unlike many of the rest of us — whose divisive separation from our work is reflected in negative bumper - stickers — the Amish find wholeness in their labors .
Nor do the Amish regard technology as an u201 Cevilu201D ; they resist bringing anything into their communities that will make them dependent on the outside world .
Thus , the automobile is not looked upon as the u201 Cwork of the devil , u201D but as a tool which , if brought into their lives , will make them dependent upon tire and parts manufacturers , oil companies , and the suppliers of other auto necessities , the net effect of which would be to destroy their system .
The Amish community provides its members no more guarantees of protection from hostile elements than does the dominant political structure in America .
Not unlike our experiences on 9/11 , the Amish world was terribly disrupted by the intrusion of a destructive force from the outside .
Though the innocent victims were at work in a humble schoolhouse rather than towering skyscrapers , the Amish shared with others the painful consequences of disturbed men from a deranged world who could find only in their suicidal attacks the most effective expression of their conflict - ridden madness .
I doubt , however , that members of the Amish community will respond to the slaughter of their children in the same way most Americans reacted to 9/11 .
Even with the holes ripped into the fabric of their culture , the Amish will be able to transcend these horrible events without sacrificing the integrity upon which their lives are founded .
They will not put aside the principled nature of their society , but will find comfort and energy within it .
They have already demonstrated this .
But for those of us who still struggle with the meaning and effects of 9/11 , and who do so on the basis of principles and practices that are a mass of confusion , conflict , and contradiction , our responses have proven consistent with the normally neurotic — and often psychotic — foundations upon which our social systems rest .
Our alleged principles and values — which have long found expression only as empty abstractions rather than integrated into our sense of being — were among the first unwanted cargo to be thrown overboard , lest they prove a hindrance to the onrushing sea of fear and doubt in which we found ourselves .
We eagerly jettisoned our compasses as well , allowing the politically ambitious to chart new directions for us , and obeying their urgings to u201Cstay the courseu201D to wholly unknown destinations .
The Amish will survive their pain , bruises , and broken hearts , but they will do so intact .
Their values will sustain them , while ours have been lost in the darkness in which we live our lives .
Such are the pragmatic , real - world , u201 Cbottom lineu201D contrasts — and consequences — between living with and without integrity .
Perhaps my seminar student was on the right track when she asked whether it was possible to live in such a community as the Amish enjoy .

Among other gag - worthy characteristics , the new immigration bill announced last week is said to cost over 2 trillion ( yes , it seems we have a couple of trillion to spare , according to the new , new math ) .
A country already mired in debt and credit needs to shell out 2 trillion about as much as breaking the law should be the prerequisite for citizenship under the rule of law .
The 380 - page bill , fruit of three months of high - sounding wrangling , gives the immediate right to work ( the Z visa ) , to some 1220 million illegal workers who got into the United States before January 1 , 2007 .
Heads of household would have to return to their home countries within eight years , and they would be guaranteed the right to return .
Applicants would also have to cough up a $ 5,000 penalty .
That 's thousand , not hundred .
Chump change for migrant workers , of course .
Confirmed .
This administration 's math is delusional , its laws are contradictory , and now we also know its alphabet is backward :
" Z visa " is followed by " Y , " a guest worker program which has some merit to it , in so far as it emphasizes good education and good skill sets .
Brownie points for that .
Never mind that guest workers families are broken up and they themselves usually end up held hostage to their employer 's whims and ever - changing paper requirements .
But " Y " follows " Z " in another way too .
As in , Y bother .
If you 're going to have a law , then apply it fairly to everyone .
Or , do n't have the law .
Ted Kennedy claims the whole business is about bringing people out of the shadows .
If lurking in the shadows is the criterion , why not bring in insurgents from Iraq too … that would at least put an end to the killing of troops ; it would supply cheap labor to businesses .
And solve a crisis that , after all , the government did create .
Of course , the government created this one too .
Does anyone think migrant workers paid less than minimum wage are going to be able to cough up $ 5000 ?
And if they could or could n't , would it matter ?
Because , we already know where this will end — with some border patrolmen hand - in - glove with criminals who 'll run a racket built on it ; with a whole industry of racketeers built on that , as there already is on fake documentation ; with the innocent in trouble and the guilty off the hook .
And then , finally , when the abuse stinks to heaven , there will be even more high - sounding wrangling in government ( all at taxpayer expense ) , and everyone will decide the simplest thing is to cancel the whole thing and go home … until they come back with the next way to drive a nail into the coffin of the US economy .
So , when we are told that this alphabet of errors is not going to be recited until the number of border patrol agents has been doubled ( adding 6,000 new agents , bringing the total to 18,000 ) , border fencing strengthened ( 200 miles of vehicle barriers and new surveillance towers ) , and a verifiable , high - tech ID - card system for immigrants operational , all in the space of 18 months , let 's figure that the Noah Webster Standard American usage of this is that it's a whole new era of bungling bureaucracy about to be inaugurated .
And the only new money forthcoming to finance this fiasco - in - waiting will be collected from employers , who will now be fined for hiring undocumented workers .
Perfect .
The federal government shunts the costs of its own inability to man the borders to tax - payers .
Then it shoves off the mess of this guacamole onto its citizens .
If Americanness is defined by citizenship and citizenship is defined by law , can the government enforce its own laws while violating the law of the land ?
If Americanness is not defined by citizenship , then we need a debate about that .
Nobody wants to demonize immigrants .
Least of all an immigrant like me .
If money can go anywhere in the world to make a return on investment ( and it should ) , labor should be free to move where it wants to find work .
But here 's the rub .
Not all movement of capital is the genuine , productive result of investment activity .
A lot of it is driven by interference in the market in the form of state intervention in the money supply .
The result of that is speculation .
And speculative flows can flood a country , jack up the prices of everything and then in a trice flow out , creating financial disaster .
That 's not the free market .
That 's state - created financialization .
We know that .
And the state affects the labor market like that too .
Letting labor move as it will is one thing .
Subsidizing and incentivizing its movement through public services is another .
That imposes unbearable costs on local communities , bankrupts the state , and causes cultural and economic problems .
Add to that another thick layer of DC bureaucracy and you have a recipe for disaster .
Especially when the registration of these 12 – 20 million illegals has to be done in 90 days .
In an article in the Washington Times , Emilio Gonzales , the director of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services thinks that time - line needs to be doubled or tripled if the process is not going to go the way of the fraud - ridden 1986 amnesty of a mere 3 million people : “ We ’re litigating cases today from 1986 , " he says .
But , Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff thinks it 's all fine and dandy .
“ Chertoff told CNN that the bill would help him better focus his resources .
“ Right now , I ’ve got my Border Patrol agents and my immigration agents chasing maids and landscapers .
I want them to focus on drug dealers and terrorists .
It seems to me , if I can get the maids and landscapers into a regulated system and focus my law enforcement on the terrorists and the drug dealers , that ’s how I get a safe border . ”
( " Immigration Breakthrough Could Pave the Way for Citizenship , " CNN , May 22 , 2007 )
By the way , Michael Chertoff , chief muck - a- muck of the Department of Homeland Security , knows all about how to handle terrorists … and immigrants … and safety .
He 's the guy on whose watch New Orleans was hit , first with Katrina …and then with FEMA .
It was he who ran the 9 - 11 investigation .
Chertoff was the senior Justice Department official on duty at the F.B.I. command center just after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
With all but impossible speed , he ID'd the terrorists and made the link to Osama bin Laden .
He pushed to merge domestic surveillance and foreign espionage which , until then , had been kept strictly apart under US law .
( " The Patriot Act's Impact , " Duke Law Journal , Nathan C. Henderson , November 15 , 2002 . )
Chertoff also authorized the unconstitutional detainment of thousands of Middle Eastern immigrants — including Middle Eastern Jews — without charges .
As head of the DOJ ’s criminal division , he told the CIA how far to go in interrogations .
( “ Amid Praise , Doubts About Nominee ’s Post - 9/11 Role , ” Michael Powell and Michelle Garcia , Washington Post , January 31 , 2005 ) .
With Viet Dinh , he co-authored the unconstitutional USA PATRIOT Act , enacted on October 26 , 2001 .
( “ Bush nominates new Homeland security chief , " January 12 , 2005 ) .
He 's even done a stint as defense in a terrorist trial .
Put in charge of the 9 - 11 investigation , Chertoff defended Dr. Magdy el - Amir , a leading New Jersey neurologist at the heart of a terrorist web based in Jersey City , alleged to have funneled millions to Osama .
Some say Chertoff may have shielded el - Amir from criminal prosecution .
( " Trail of Terror , ” Chris Hansen and Ann Curry , NBC ’s Dateline , August 2002 and The Record , Bergen County , NJ , December 11 , 1998 ) .
Nice rsum .
According to CNN , Republican Rep. Brian Bilbray of California , chairman of the Immigration Reform Caucus , had this to say about the new immigration bill :
“ The ‘ compromise ’ announced today by Sen .
Kennedy will reward 12 million illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship — what part of illegal does the Senate not understand ? ”
At least , we already know what part of the Constitution this government does n't .
And , Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina says the bill “ wound up being about what it means to be an American … I think we ’ve got a deal that reflects who we are as Americans . ”
Maybe , under this administration , we have .

Hajara survived the trials but cannot now hear or speak
Pfizer lawyers argued in Abuja that the amendments had been improperly filed .
The Nigerian government wants $ 7bn in damages and compensation for the families of the children who died or suffered serious side - effects .
Some 200 children took part in trials for a new anti-meningitis drug in 1996 .
Pfizer says the trials were lawful .
The court rejected a bid by the Nigerian government 's counsel to include 85 new claims - in addition to an earlier 54 , agreeing with Pfizer that it had been improperly filed .
Officials in Kano say more than 50 children died in the experiment , while many others developed mental and physical deformities .
But Pfizer says only 11 of the 200 children in the drug trial died .
We did not suspect that the children were being used for an experiment
Hassan Sani
Family anger over trials
Pfizer tested the then unregistered drug in Nigeria 's north - western Kano State during an outbreak of meningitis which had affected thousands of children .
Following pressure , the Nigerian government set up an expert medical panel to review the drug trial .
It concluded that the experiment was " an illegal trial of an unregistered drug " and a " clear case of exploitation of the ignorant " .
" We did not suspect that the children were being used for an experiment , " Hassan Sani , the father of a girl who was tested , told the BBC in Kano recently .
" The American doctors took advantage of our illiteracy and cheated us and our children .
We thought they were helping us , " he said .
Pfizer denied any wrongdoing and said its trial of Trovan was conducted in accordance with Nigerian regulations .
The Pfizer experiment was cited by many as a reason for the mass rejection of polio vaccinations in many parts of northern Nigeria in recent years .
A gene mutation can radically alter the chances of survival for men with prostate cancer , new research has found .
Men who carry a mutated form of the BRCA2 gene seem to succumb to this type of cancer a decade earlier than those with a most common version of the gene .
Experts say that screening for the BRCA2 gene mutation – which is better known for raising the risk of breast cancer – could improve the outcome of prostate tumour treatment .
Our knowledge of BRCA2 dates back to 1995 , when researchers first identified this gene and began to understand its effect on breast cancer .
Women with mutations in either BRCA2 or the related BRCA1 gene face up to a seven - fold increase in the risk of breast cancer .
Advertisement
In recent years , scientists have started to piece together how BRCA2 mutations also influence men ’s health .
Doubled risk
Studies have found that men who carry certain variants of BRCA2 face a doubled risk of prostate cancer , and are six times more likely to develop pancreatic cancers than people with a normal version of the gene .
Laufey Tryggvadottir at the Icelandic Cancer Registry in Reykjavik and her colleagues decided to see if the BRCA2 mutation had any impact on the progression of prostate cancer once it developed .
According to the Prostate Cancer Foundation , prostate cancer strikes one in six men in the US .
And Tryggvadottir says that when doctors conduct autopsies of elderly men who have died from a wide range of causes , including traffic accidents , they find cancerous prostate cells in two - thirds of these men .
But she stresses that only a fraction of men die as a result of prostate tumours :
“ The big challenge today is how to distinguish between a lethal cancer and a harmless one . ”
Howard Soule of the Prostate Cancer Foundation in Santa Monica , California echoes this view : “ It would be helpful to know whose prostate cancer is aggressive and whose cancer is non-lethal . ”
Radically shorter
To help address this challenge , Tryggvadottir and colleagues retrieved prostate cancer biopsies that had been taken from 527 patients and deposited in their registry over the past few decades .
Researchers analysed the DNA in these samples and found that 30 of the men tested positive for a BRCA2 mutation , known as 999del5 .
Men with this mutation had an average survival time of 2.1 years following their cancer diagnosis – a decade shorter than patients with the normal gene , who lived 12.4 years on average .
“ That ’s radically different , ” says Soule , who adds that patients would likely want to know which of these dramatically different prognoses applies to them .
Moreover , the new study revealed that carriers of the inherited gene mutation received their cancer diagnosis at an average age of 69 – five years earlier than those free of the mutation .
This indicates that the cancer developed earlier , so Tryggvadottir suggests that men with a history of BRCA2 - related breast cancer in their family begin prostate screening at age 45 , a few years before the generally recommended age of 50 .
Watchful waiting
She adds that having a faulty version of the BRCA2 gene makes cancer more likely because the gene encodes for a protein involved in DNA repair .
Typically , if a man has high levels of prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) , doctors will conduct a biopsy of the organ .
If the cells ’ DNA looks relatively normal , physicians recommend a period of “ watchful waiting ” , because removal of the prostate can lead to unwanted side effects , including impotence and urinary incontinence .
Soule says that the new findings represent a step towards that goal of having “ a test to know who should have their prostate removed today and receive aggressive therapy , and who should have watchful waiting ” .
Immediate surgery and chemotherapy can prevent the tumour from spreading through the body .
Researchers estimate that 0.5 % of men in Iceland carry the 999del5 BRCA2 mutation , and that a similar proportion of men through the world carry this or other BRCA2 mutations .
While the overall percentage of men who have the mutation is small , Tryggvadottir says these men likely represent a large number of those with lethal prostate cancer .
Each year 28,000 men die of prostate cancer in the US alone , according to Soule .

SAN FRANCISCO , Aug. 1  A freelance journalist and blogger was jailed on Tuesday after refusing to turn over video he took at an anticapitalist protest here last summer and after refusing to testify before a grand jury looking into accusations that crimes were committed at the protest .
The freelancer , Josh Wolf , 24 , was taken into custody just before noon after a hearing in front of Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court .
Found in contempt , Mr. Wolf was later moved to a federal prison in Dublin , Calif. , and could be imprisoned until next summer , when the grand jury term expires , said his lawyer , Jose Luis Fuentes .
Earlier this year , federal prosecutors subpoenaed Mr. Wolf to testify before a grand jury and turn over video from the demonstration , held in the Mission District on July 8 , 2005 .
The protest , tied to a Group of 8 meeting of world economic leaders in Scotland , ended in a clash between demonstrators and the San Francisco police , with one officer sustaining a fractured skull .
A smoke bomb or a firework was also put under a police car , and investigators are looking into whether arson was attempted on a government - financed vehicle .
People who have moved recently are more likely to switch their phone service over from a landline to VoIP or wireless - only service , according to a report by Telephia .
The communications research company surveyed over 7,000 US households to produce its quarterly Total Communications Survey results , which showed that nearly half of all households who moved residences within the past year had switched to some form of nontraditional phone option for the home .
Of those who moved within the last year , 51 percent stayed with an old - school landline carrier , compared with 73 percent of those who had not moved recently .
While only 9 percent of those who had n't moved were using a mobile wireless carrier as their sole phone service , a surprising 25 percent of recent movers fell into that category .
Other popular nontraditional phone services among recent movers included a cable provider 's phone options ( 13 percent ) , other VoIP providers ( 6 percent ) , and " other " ( 5 percent ) .
Comparatively , those who had not moved recently used those same services at 10 percent , 4 percent , and 4 percent respectively .
Recent movers tend to be made up of the younger , more early - adopting crowd , according to Telephia .
They may have a lower overall household income than nonmovers , but they tend to spend more on communication and entertainment services than those who have not moved recently .
It 's also easier to consider new telephony options when moving , because all household services enter a state of flux before settling on something new .
" Movers tend to consider all available connectivity options in an unconstrained purchase environment , " said Telephia 's product director Christianne Pang in a statement .
VoIP and mobile - only solutions tend to be cheaper than landline options .
But while price alone does n't seem to be enough to make most customers switch services , those in the throes of a move are often more motivated to go with cheaper services .
The trend could be good news for mobile and VoIP phone carriers who are working on gaining market share .
" Our carrier clients regard this segment as an important early indicator of market share shifts , " Pang said .
" [ Movers ] represent an opportunity for providers to land long - term customers who probably wo n't make a switch until the next move . "
Americans are n't the only ones moving to alternate phone services .
A recent study by the European Commission said that the overall number of mobile - only households increased by four percent between winter of 2006 and April 2007 to 22 percent .
The number of households with landlines in Europe decreased five percentage points to 72 percent in that time period as well , and 17 percent of households with Internet access reported using it for VoIP calls .
The EC report states that the main reason for customers to stay with their current service is because they 're satisfied with the service and have no compelling reason to consider switching .
But if Telephia 's data tells us anything ( and translates well across the pond ) , then perhaps Europeans getting ready to move might have a good reason to consider alternate options after all .
Shuttle forecast : Desert landing ?
The only time a space shuttle touched down at NASA 's landing strip in the New Mexico desert , in 1982 , the air held so much grit that workers spent days cleaning it out of the ship .
They even had to chip out a hardened mixture of dust and fuel from the thrusters .
Now NASA is preparing for the possibility that , for the first time in 24 years , it will once again have to land a shuttle at that same strip , the White Sands Space Harbor .
After 13 days in orbit , shuttle Discovery is due to touch down Friday as early as 3:56 p.m. ET .
It will not be a standard shuttle landing because NASA has less time to play with , and it will force NASA to make some difficult choices .
A combination of tight schedules and bad luck conspires to make a White Sands landing more likely than in other years .
Bad weather is forecast Friday for both the shuttle 's primary landing site at Florida 's Kennedy Space Center and the backup site at California 's Edwards Air Force Base .
Good weather is forecast for White Sands .
" I would n't go so far as to say any of the sites is a leading candidate , " mission operations chief Phil Engelauf said Wednesday , while conceding that " today 's forecast looks more encouraging for White Sands than for the other sites . "
Before this mission , NASA always managed shuttle flights so the ship could spend an extra day in space in case of equipment problems and another extra day for bad weather .
This time , the bad - weather day was eaten up by an unplanned spacewalk to fix a balky solar panel on the International Space Station .
That leaves only one day 's cushion .
On Sunday , the shuttle would run out of fuel to make power .
So for the first time in the shuttle 's 25 - year history , NASA officials are racing to prepare all three landing strips for the first landing opportunity Friday .
Usually only the strip at Kennedy Space Center is readied for the first landing opportunity .
Shuttles are stored and groomed for flight at Kennedy and also launch from there , so landing in Florida saves NASA time and money .
When weather has been bad at Kennedy , NASA also has prepared the backup site at Edwards Air Force Base .
Fifty of the shuttle 's 114 safe returns have been at Edwards .
NASA prefers not to land at Edwards because the shuttle must be shipped from California to Florida atop a special Boeing 747 jet .
That costs $ 1 million and adds a week or more to the time needed to turn the shuttle around for the next flight .
White Sands has never been prepared for a first landing attempt because it has less infrastructure than the other sites .
The cold temperatures expected this weekend make it more likely that thrusters would leak and pipes would freeze .
That adds " risk to the ground personnel , " said a memo sent to Discovery 's crew Wednesday and posted on NASA 's website .
Then there 's the dust , which gives White Sands its name .
It 's " white and very fine , almost like talcum powder , " says Gordon Fullerton , the pilot of shuttle Challenger for the 1982 New Mexico landing .
He said the dust got into " every fissure of the orbiter . "
At least landing at White Sands would not be more difficult for Discovery commander Mark Polansky , says Jack Lousma , Columbia 's commander for the ' 82 landing .
As part of their shuttle training , astronauts fly a jet that mimics the shuttle 's handling over White Sands , so " the crew is very familiar with the area , " he says .
On Friday , entry flight director Norm Knight will have to juggle all three sites and decide whether it would be best to bend rules about acceptable landing weather .
" The one thing we always like to have is more options and more margin , " Engelauf said .
" We 've taken a little bit of the latitude off of the table . …
It makes Norm 's job a little more difficult . "

Haskell 's overloaded numerical classes can be ( ab ) used to do some symbolic maths .
This is in no way a new discovery , but I thought I 'd write a few lines about it anyway since I 've been playing with it the last few days .
First we need a data type to represent expressions .
We want constants , variables , and function applications .
But we do n't want to fix the type of the constants , so that will be a parameter to the type .
And we also take the opportunity to derive Eq and Show .
Now we can actually claim that the type Sym N is a number if N is a number .
Let do it : A small interactive session shows that we are on the right track .
We can type in normal looking expressions , but when they are printed the Show instance is used so we get to see the raw syntax tree .
That has its uses , but it gets old quickly .
We want a pretty printer .
To get the precedences right we need to define shows Prec and pass it the right arguments .
It 's a little tedious , but nothing strange .
Let 's try the same examples again : Look we can type expressions and get them back again !
The instance Num ( Sym a ) is n't too bad , the only fishy thing about it is the Eq superclass that is required for Num .
We have Eq for Sym , but it does n't really behave like it should .
E.g. , the expression ' x==1 ' would come out as False since the syntax trees are not equal .
But this is n't really what we would like , ideally ( == ) would also turn into something symbol , but that is impossible with the standard Prelude .
Let 's make some more instances .
A few of these definitions are just there to appease the Haskell numerical hierarchy and supply some operations it need .
Let 's put this code to the test by bringing the Complex number module into scope .
And by that last expression we have recovered the definition of complex sin as it is given in the Data .
Complex module .
Let 's try another one .
Hmmmm , that might be right , but it 's rather ugly .
There 's also a lot of ' 0.0 +...' in that expression .
We need something that can simplify expressions .
It would also be nice if all constant expressions were evaluated instead of stored .
To achieve this we are going to change the representation a little .
The App constructor will store the real function used to work on constants as well as the name of it .
And while we are at it , we 'll get rid of the Var constructor .
We might as well use App with an empty argument list .
Furthermore , since this is starting to look useful , we 'll give the module a proper name and export only the interface we want to be visible .
We will hide the details of the Sym type and just export some accessor functions .
The simplification happens in the binOp and unOp functions .
I have just put some algebraic laws there ( assuming the underlying numeric type is a field ) .
The list of rewrites performed by these functions is far from complete .
It 's just a few that I found useful .
Note how the code in binOp pattern matches on constants like 0 , 1 , and - 1 directly .
This actually works because of the semantics of Haskell pattern matching against numeric literals .
Also note that the constraint on `a ' is just Num , even though we do some simplifications with ( / ) which belongs in Fractional .
The instance declarations have been extended somewhat so that constant expressions in the Sym type will behave as the corresponding expressions in the underlying type .
A small final runAs the final example shows , there is still a lot to do .
Also note how the underlying numeric type has defaulted to Double , and we have a loss of precision in the second to last example .
But an implementation of real numbers instead of floating point numbers will have to wait until a later posting .

Even Nazca booby families do n't stay together after the kids leave the nest these days .
The Nazca booby is a long - lived seabird found in the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador .
Many Nazca booby females switch mates after successfully raising a chick , according to a Wake Forest University study .
You 'll be alone again soon , booby
This is surprising because there is an advantage to staying together , said Terri Maness , a doctoral student who co-authored the study with David J. Anderson , professor of biology at Wake Forest .
The chance of successfully breeding probably improves as the pairs of birds get older and are together longer , as has been found in other birds .
But , often the female seeks a divorce after a few breeding seasons .
Since males significantly outnumber females in the colony studied , there are plenty of bachelors available if the female has a wandering eye .
“ Our study population has 50 percent more males than females , creating the opportunity for females to trade a current mate , which may be worn - out from recent breeding effort , for a ‘ refreshed ’ non-breeding male , ” Maness said .
It takes a lot of energy to raise a chick and the responsibility is shared by both males and females .
They raise one chick at a time .
Parents incubate the egg for 43 days .
Then , it takes another 100 to 120 days of parental care until the baby bird can fly .
The parents will usually continue to provide some meals to the fledgling .
So , if , when mating season rolls around again , a male looks a little ragged from taking care of junior , his mate is likely to choose another .
A male ’s capacity to raise offspring , a quality that can vary with time , may carry more weight with a mate than stellar genes or past breeding success , Maness said .
She used 14 years of data on about 950 males and 700 females in the study .
During that time , the majority of the females in this group gambled on a new mate , sometimes one that had never bred before .
This is one of the few studies that addresses divorce in successfully breeding bird pairs , Maness said .
“ This study really predicts that the probability of divorce increases with the birds ’ success at breeding and raising a chick , because the effort required may tire out the male and consequently his mate may reject him . ”
It also shows that males of this species are probably never permanently in or out of the mating game , in contrast to many other animals , she said .
A male Nazca booby cast off by a current mate may be selected by a different female the next year , after he has had a chance to regain his condition .

[ Updated ; The Mystery of the Tangun Tomb ] Remember my March 28th post , a stream of consciousness that washed against the subject of EU sanctions against North Korea ?
Among the items sanctioned were pure - bred horses , which are the kind not even North Koreans would dare eat — because of who owns them .
That led me to the one location in North Korea where I suspected that such horses might be kept .
I had recently found that location on Google Earth while spying on an area a few miles east - by - northeast of Pyongyang .
Because of the extraordinary security surrounding this complex , I had speculated that it was probably the pleasure dome of none other than His Porcine Majesty :
It ’s not marked , “ Kim Jong Il , the Lodestar of the Universe , lives here , ” but the extraordinary security and luxury of the place suggest as much ( did I mention the anti-aircraft missile sites and the airfield ? ) .
I hope to do a more complete GE tour of this place some time , along with some of the other high - end real estate on this highway , north and east of Pyongyang .
Today , some North Korean defectors are confirming my amateur photo - interpretation , and Yahoo Korea ( in Korean only ) is publishing satellite photos of what it believes to be Kim Jong Il ’s house and palace .
( Translation note : the caption says jip - mu- shil , which I take it means “ home office . ” )
There are at least two different locations shown here .
I ’ve only identified two of these locations ; the one you see above ( see , e.g. , the distinctive oval track in Images 5 and 6 below ) and one other , which I ’m pretty sure I ’ve placemarked , and which is about five miles or so from the other .
The headlines say , “ This is how Kim Jong Il lives ! ” I put together a Google Earth tour of the palace below .
First , here are the published pictures verified by the defectors :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Supposedly , Kim Jong
Il has a whopping 17 palaces , and I ’ve found other candidate locations , including another large complex near Paektu - San and suspect locations in Wonsan and near his plutonium reactor at Yongbyon .
Those will wait for another day .
Update :
For those who know how to use Google Earth or Google maps , if you click the images and enlarge them to full size , you can see the coordinates printed along the bottom of each screen .
Let ’s start our tour about 18 miles northeast of Pyongyang .
Here ’a an overview of the area around the palace .
Note the surface - to - air missile sites , the airfield , and the mysterious political monument .
We ’ll zoom in on those in a moment .
Taking obsessive security to a new level , the road leading from the main Pyongyang highway to the palace is not just gated , it ’s completely fenced off .
Locals ca n’t get near it .
The SAM sites have a characteristic floral shape , making them easy to recognize from above .
Many of North Korea ’s SAM sites are inactive , but not these .
They ’re fresh and well - maintained .
Here ’s the palace complex .
As you can see , there are a quite a few other buildings in the periphery of the complex .
The “ fl ” placemarks show the triple fencing around the place , and the “ G ” placemarks are gates .
You can see two of the fencelines and the bunkers along them here .
So is Kim Jong
Il really that worried about our Special Forces ?
Well , maybe .
Another theory is that he ’s worried about his own special forces .
The large oval object appears to be a horse track .
I ’m watching you , Fat Boy .
Suppose they have those big goldfish in the ponds ?
This complex is right next to the palace , and inside the outer layer of fencing .
That leads me to think that it ’s associated with the palace , but I ca n’t even venture a guess as to what it is .
Two and a half miles past the palace exit on the highway is an airfield .
Off to the right , you can see some aircraft , possibly AN - 2 Colts , parked .
Almost exactly one mile further is this bizarre monument .
It ’s just over 50 yards across at the base .
By any chance , does anyone know what on earth this thing is ?
How about the rest of the North Korean people , you may ask ?
Do they know that their leader lives this way while they starve , and while their kids are stunted from malnutrition ?
In most cases , probably not .
For those who raise such questions , you can learn more about their living arrangements here .
Update 2 : Another mystery solved , and Bruce Klingner wins the cookie .
According to official North Korean historical interpretation , this is the tomb of Tangun .
Another reader who wishes to remain anonymous even e-mails to say he ’s even been there , and was surprised to learn how close he got to Kim Jong
Il ’s main palace without knowing it ( I hope he ’ll let me publish a part of his e-mail ) .
There are ground - level pictures of the tomb here and here , but this one ( ROK blocked ) is my favorite :
My , but he simply projects charisma , does n’t he ?
If Tangun were actually buried here , he ’d be thinking , “ There goes the neighborhood . ”
But he never was .
Once again archaeologists were ordered to make a discovery by the Great Leader himself ( this time , it was Kim Il - sung ) .
Once again , the discovery was made immediately — I just wonder how great life would become had the North Korean scientists been able to produce , say , a high - temperature superconductor upon receiving the proper order from some Dear or Great Leader .
The aging Kim Il - sung instructed them to find the tomb of legendary Tangun , the son of the she - bear and alleged founder of Ancient Choson .
The tomb was found — near Pyongyang , of course .
This once again proved the city ’s credentials as the nation ’s capital for five thousand years .
[ Korea Times , Prof. Andrei Lankov ]
Internet writings about the Tomb of Tangun are dominated by North Korean inspired propaganda about the tomb and its fictitious historical significance .
One can sift through these and find the accounts of more skeptical visitors , too .
How much more interesting a story is when you discover it by accident .
Update : A reader who has visited the “ Tomb of Tangun ” has graciously given me permission to print his description of the place .
“ The Tomb of Tangun ” is indeed a very strange place to visit .
I ’m a trained archaeologist , which is why I had a particular interest in this monument .
My professor at University has specialised in ancient Korean history and it was through him I first got to hear about the place .
He attended a conference in England in the early 1990:s where North Korean scientists presented their findings .
According to him , everyone , including the North Koreans , were “ embarrassed ” by the claims .
Scientists as they were , they fully understood the “ improbability ” of their discovery , and naturally everyone else felt the same way .
But they had be ordered from home to present this “ amazing discovery ” to the world , and there was nothing they could do about it .
Anyway , knowing this background story , I wanted to visit the tomb for myself .
I do not believe it is a major tourist attraction .
My travel agent said the place was just “ too boring ” and , well , a fake too… so why go there ?
All the same , I went with two guides and a driver .
I clearly remember crossing the bridge with the hydroelectric plant and locks , seen on the Google Earth photos , and then continuing for a little bit longer , passing the “ hidden road ” to the palace complex .
I had to pay 10 Euros extra to enter the pyramid , which was opened up by a young lady in military uniform .
Inside there was almost a small labyrinth , leading to the cold burial chamber where two coffins , one for Tangun and one for his wife , stood side by side .
On the wall was a mural painting of Tangun himself .
Surprisingly , my guide suggested that the black wooden covers be removed so we could take a look into the glass coffins .
The lady almost panicked and quickly responded that it was impossible !
Only scientists were allowed to look inside and would also have to pay 100 Euros for the privilege .
I clearly noticed that this explanation did not impress my guide , who might not have believed the story and / or just felt embarrassed I ’d travelled all this way for nothing .
Personally I think it ’s likely that the coffins might have been empty .
Although I did have a 100 Euros on me , I did n’t feel compelled to spend them all there and then …
Outside I looked at the monumental statues and the engraved stones .
The statues were all newly made , which was no secret , however the supposedly ancient , engraved stones did look suspiciously new as well .
Although I did n’t get to see a lot , I do n’t regret going there .
I concluded that the Tomb of Tangun was n’t a memorial over the person Tangun ( fictional or not ) , it was constructed for the “ idea ” of Tangun .
The idea that the founder of Korea came from the north and was buried close to Pyongyang even .
Like so many things in North Korea , it was an entirely political monument .
In retrospect one can wonder if the location of the tomb was chosen for its proximity to the palace ?
It would certainly have a strong , symbolic meaning in that case . ” ( END )
I ’ve agreed to keep the reader ’s identity to myself , as he may want to go back to North Korea .
Yes , I ’m ambivalent about travel to the North , but at least this reader will at least be honestly skeptical about what he observes there .
Thanks much for writing in .

Update :
To see satellite images of North Korea ’s political prison camps , start here .
More North Korea / Google Earth posts here .
We have n't discussed the " grand compromise " immigration bill all that much around here -- and when we have , it 's been primarily to examine the political toxicity of the xenophobia oozing out of the Republican body politic as they oppose any reform , however mild , that gives undocumented immigrants a chance to normalize their status .
And , yeah , I 'll grant you that it 's fun to watch the Republicans implode and poison themselves for decades with the most rapidly growing sector of the electorate .
But the fact that Tancredo and the Minutemen oppose this bill does n't make it something worth supporting .
It 's not .
And when you look at it closely , it 's a bill that progressives ought to vigorously oppose .
In fact , this immigration bill is an historically bad bill , one that will undermine wage markets and which will permanently cripple skills training in vital sectors of the economy .
And -- contrary to Lou Dobbs and the nativists -- the critical problem with the bill has nothing to do with the path to citizenship provided therein .
Hell , everyone this side of the Minutemen agrees that there needs to be a humane path to citizenship for those undocumented workers who are living , working , and contributing in the United States .
The fact that this bill provides a version of that path is about the only positive aspect of the legislation .
No , the fatal flaw in this bill is n't " amnesty " -- it 's the euphemistically termed " temporary worker program . "
The temporary worker program has nothing to do with immigration policy .
To the contrary -- it is a guaranteed cheap labor program grafted on to an immigration bill .
When most people think of " immigration " to the US , they think of people coming to America to build a new life for themselves and their families , just as their ancestors did .
But the temporary worker program has nothing to do with building American families and American dreams .
Under the program , 400,000 - 600,000 guest workers would enter the country every year on two - year visas .
Although the visas can be renewed twice , recipients would be denied any path to permanent residency or citizenship .
In fact , the guest workers would be precluded from even applying for permanent residency while here on temporary visas .
In short , the " temporary workers " will be just that -- " temporary , " and " workers . "
Not " immigrants . "
And they can never be " Americans . "
Instead , we will have created a permanent caste of non-citizens with no hope of ever becoming citizens .
A class of over half - a- million workers without a voice in the political process , here at the sole sufferance of their employers .
And those employers wo n't have to pay their new indentured servants any more than the minimum wage .
See , unlike the existing H - 2B visa -- the visa that governs most " unskilled " temporary workers in the US today -- the proposed temporary worker program contains no requirements that employers pay their temporary help the federally determined " prevailing wage " for their occupation and the geographic area .
Today , if a contractor can't find an qualified electrician to work on a project in Chicago , the contractor can apply for an H - 2B visa .
But the contractor is required to pay any foreign electrician entering the US on the H - 2B no less than $ 53.57 per hour , including benefits .
That 's the prevailing wage for an electrician in Chicago , according to the Department of Labor .
And by requiring H - 2B sponsors to pay their foreign help the prevailing wage , the H - 2B program limits the ability of employers to use guest workers as a tool to undermine wage markets .
The proposed temporary worker plan changes all that .
Under the proposed plan , there is no wage floor .
If the Chicago contractor can't find an electrician in the US to work on his project for $ 20 per hour , he can import a temporary worker who will .
The result will be a swift collapse of wage markets in many industries populated by skilled non-professional workers , like construction .
And all of a sudden , we 'll be hearing that the work of an electrician is one of those " jobs Americans wo n't do , " like fruit picking .
The truth , of course , is that there is no job that an American wo n't do for the right price .
But by creating a steady flow of temporary workers with no ability to stay in the country for more than a couple years , and no practical ability to fight for better wages , the number of jobs that " Americans wo n't do " will grow dramatically .
And they include a host of the jobs that sustain and nourish the middle class .
The construction trades .
Cosmetology .
Culinary arts .
These are jobs that take years to master , and consequently pay quite well , because not just anybody can do them .
But by busting open the labor markets for these jobs , and opening them with no restrictions to folks from countries with much lower costs of living , we will strangle the middle class lives of the millions of Americans who have proudly earned their paychecks with their skills .
Now lawyers , doctors , and a host of other professionals are immune from this sort of threat , because each of those groups have -- through their guilds ( the ABA , the state bar associations , the AMA , NASBA ) -- seized control of the state licensing procedures governing who can ply their trade in each profession .
Politicians , too , have little to fear , as the populace can't seek to replace congresscritters ( or Hill staffers ) with indentured temporary foreign labor .
So the people who crafted this bill , and most of the friends of those people , are immune from its depredations .
Maybe they do n't understand just what this bill will do to broad swaths of middle - class America .
But for Americans who do n't enjoy state protection of their labor markets , the temporary worker program turns an immigration bill into a direct assault on their ability to command a market wage .
And once the temporary worker program is established , it 's hard to imagine that the visa cap will remain at 600,000 per year .
The Chamber of Commerce and its allies in every industry will continue to manufacture worker shortages by artificially lowering wages , and Congress will play along and issue more and more temporary visas .
And one day , we 'll wake up and there wo n't be but a handful of skilled American tradespeople in the US -- because the wage markets will have been deliberately eroded to the point where those positions are filled almost entirely by 21st Century indentured servants .
Domestic training in those trades will have vanished , and even if a young American ( perhaps a first - generation child of immigrant parents ? ) were interested in learning how to weld , there would n't be anyplace to learn .
America will have become like Dubai -- a nation crowded with gleaming skyscrapers built and maintained by exploited foreigners living in labor camps .
There 's no question that we need immigration reform in this country .
We need to find a way to bring the millions of immigrants laboring in the shadows into the light , and into our American family .
And to the extent that we have bona fide labor shortages in this country , we need to address them through an expansion of legal immigration .
But the price of immigration reform cannot be a temporary worker program that exploits foreign workers , limits real immigration , and guts wages for American workers .
This week , the Senate will bring the immigration bill back to the floor , and we 're told that the leadership will use hardball parliamentary tactics to limit amendments .
Word is that the Dorgan - Boxer amendment , which passed earlier this month and seeks to temper the negative effects of the temporary worker program by sunsetting it in five years , will be stripped from the bill .
But unless the temporary worker program is eliminated , or at least seriously modified to provide a wage floor akin to that in the H - 2B program , this bill is not worthy of passage .
Tancredo and his ilk are plainly wrong about immigration .
Immigration is a fact of life , and immigrant workers who are extended the right to organize and the right to become citizens will fight for better wages and conditions alongside their native - born co-workers .
Immigration , you could say , is good for America .
But this bill is n't just about immigration , and we ought not support it simply because the bad guys oppose it .
This is not a progressive bill .
And if we can't get a progressive bill now , it would be better to wait till January 2009 to try again than to pass a bad bill now .
It 's a truism that the US only passes an immigration bill every 20 years ; the last major reform was in 1986 , and the one before that in the mid-60's .
Therefore -- in light of the generational significance of any immigration bill -- if the choice truly is between one with the Chamber of Commerce - crafted cheap labor program and no bill at all , we can afford to wait for a bill that works for all immigrants and for all Americans .
So to Senator Kennedy , and to the other well - intentioned Democrats who want a bill so badly that they have lost sight of the pernicious long - term effects of this compromise , I say : mend it , or we 're gonna end it .
UPDATE : Several folks have noted that the Bingaman amendment , which would limit the number of guest visas to 200,000 per year , and 400,000 at any given time , passed during the earlier debate on the bill .
I regret the oversight , although the cap number could easily be lifted following passage of the bill , and passage of the Bingaman amendment does not in a substantial manner alter the corrosive effect the a temporary worker plan without meaningful wage floor is likely to have on American wages .
There ’s no backlight , however ; you can read only by ambient light .
Sony would probably argue that this trait makes the Reader even more like a traditional book , but it also means that you ca n’t read in bed with the lights off , as you can with a laptop or palmtop .
On the other hand , once those microspheres have formed the image of a page , they stay put without consuming any power .
Amazingly enough , that means that you do n’t have to turn the Reader off , ever .
When you ’re done for the night , just lay it on your bedside table ; the current page remains on the screen without draining any battery power .
( According to Sony , one prototype Reader in Japan has been displaying the same page for three years on a single charge . )
Every instinct in your body will scream against leaving your gadget turned on all the time , but you ’ll get over it .
The only time the Reader uses electricity , in fact , is when you actually turn a page .
One charge is good for 7,500 page turns .
That ’s enough power to get you through “ The Da Vinci Code ” 16 times ( electrical power , anyway ) .
You can recharge the battery either from its power cord or from a computer ’s U.S.B. jack .
The Reader can also display digital photos — they look surprisingly good , considering they ’re being depicted using only four shades of gray — and play music files ( noncopy - protected MP3 or AAC format ) through headphones .
With a good deal of preparation , you could even read along as the same audio book plays .
There are two ways to load up the Reader .
You can copy your texts , photos and music to a memory card ( Memory Stick or SD ) , which goes into a slot on the left side .
That ’s also how you can expand the Reader ’s built - in storage ( 64 megabytes , enough for 80 books ) .
The other option is to import files into a somewhat buggy Windows program called Sony Connect .
It ’s the home base for the Reader in much the way iTunes is the home base for the iPod , although Sony Connect requires you to drag files manually ; it does n’t offer automatic synchronizing with the Reader .
IF A Briton had bought a house in 1975 , by 2006 that happy homeowner would have an asset worth over 14 times more .
Since the mid-1990s an increasing population , supply shortfall and low interest rates have all contributed to the steep increase .
Newly - flush Brits have also pushed up prices by buying properties in neighbouring countries , such as France .
Germany and Japan , by contrast , have experienced relatively modest increases .

Last fall , shortly after I returned from Nigeria , I was accosted by a perky blond college student whose blue eyes seemed to match the " African " beads around her wrists .
" Save Darfur ! " she shouted from behind a table covered with pamphlets urging students to TAKE ACTION NOW !
STOP GENOCIDE IN DARFUR !
My aversion to college kids jumping onto fashionable social causes nearly caused me to walk on , but her next shout stopped me .
" Do n't you want to help us save Africa ? " she yelled .
It seems that these days , wracked by guilt at the humanitarian crisis it has created in the Middle East , the West has turned to Africa for redemption .
Idealistic college students , celebrities such as Bob Geldof , and politicians such as Tony Blair have all made bringing light to the dark continent their mission .
This is the West 's new image of itself : a sexy , politically active generation whose preferred means of spreading the word are magazine spreads with celebrities pictured in the foreground , forlorn Africans in the back .
Perhaps most interesting is the language used to describe the Africa being saved .
For example , the Keep a Child Alive / " I am African " ad campaign features portraits of primarily white , Western celebrities with painted " tribal markings " on their faces above " I AM AFRICAN " in bold letters .
Below , smaller print says , " help us stop the dying . "
Such campaigns , however well intentioned , promote the stereotype of Africa as a black hole of disease and death .
News reports constantly focus on the continent 's corrupt leaders , warlords , " tribal " conflicts , child laborers , and women disfigured by abuse and genital mutilation .
These descriptions run under headlines such as " Can Bono Save Africa ? "
The relationship between the West and Africa is no longer based on openly racist beliefs , but such articles are reminiscent of reports from the heyday of European colonialism , when missionaries were sent to Africa to introduce us to education , Jesus Christ , and " civilization . "
There is no African , myself included , who does not appreciate the help of the wider world , but we do question whether aid is genuine or given in the spirit of affirming one 's cultural superiority .
My mood is dampened every time I attend a benefit whose host runs through a litany of African disasters before presenting a ( usually ) wealthy , white person , who often proceeds to list the things he or she has done for the poor , starving Africans .
Every time a Hollywood director shoots a film about Africa that features a Western protagonist , I shake my head – because Africans , real people though we may be , are used as props in the West 's fantasy of itself .
And not only do such depictions tend to ignore the West 's prominent role in creating many of the unfortunate situations on the continent , they also ignore the incredible work Africans have done and continue to do to fix those problems .
Why do the media frequently refer to African countries as having been " granted independence from their colonial masters , " as opposed to having fought and shed blood for their freedom ?
How is it that a former mid-level US diplomat receives more attention for his cowboy antics in Sudan than do the numerous African Union countries that have sent food and troops and spent countless hours trying to negotiate a settlement among all parties in that crisis ?
Two years ago I worked in a camp for internally displaced people in Nigeria , survivors of an uprising that killed about 1,000 people and displaced 200,000 .
True to form , the Western media reported on the violence but not on the humanitarian work the state and local governments – without much international help – did for the survivors .
Social workers spent their time , and in many cases their own salaries , to care for their compatriots .
These are the people saving Africa , and others like them across the continent get no credit for their work .
Last month the Group of Eight industrialized nations and a host of celebrities met in Germany to discuss , among other things , how to save Africa .
Before the next such summit , I hope people will realize Africa does n't want to be saved .
Africa wants the world to acknowledge that through fair partnerships with other members of the global community , we ourselves are capable of unprecedented growth .

Earth 's temperature could be reaching its highest level in a million years , American scientists said yesterday .
Researchers at Nasa 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies said a further one degree celsius rise in the global temperature could be critical to the planet , and there was already a threat of extreme weather resulting from El Niño .
The scientists said that in the 30 years to the end of 2005 , temperatures increased at the rate of 0.2 degrees per decade , a rate they described as " remarkably rapid " .
Comparison of the current global temperature with estimates of historical temperatures - based on a study of ocean sediment - showed the current temperature was now within 1C of the maximum temperature of the past million years .
Dr James Hansen , who led the study , said further global warming of just 1C could lead to big changes to the planet .
" If warming is kept less than that , effects of global warming may be relatively manageable , " he said .
" But if further global warming reaches two or three degrees celsius , we will likely see changes that make Earth a different planet [ to ] the one we know .
" The last time it was that warm was in the middle Pliocene , about 3 m years ago , when sea level was estimated to have been about 25 meters ( 80 feet ) higher than today . "
The study showed that global warming was greatest at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere .
The study attributed this to the effect of snow and ice melting , leaving dark areas that absorb more sunlight .
Warming was lower over sea than on land , but the research team said the temperature of the western Pacific had been increasing , and was becoming much warmer than the eastern Pacific .
This increased difference could boost the likelihood of strong El Niño weather conditions such as those seen in 1983 and 1998 , when many countries around the world experienced devastating floods and tornadoes .
Dr Hansen said that the increasing temperature could lead to the extinction of some species , which would find it increasingly difficult to find viable habitats .
Plants and animals have been observed migrating towards the poles to find areas where the temperature better suits them .
However , Dr Hansen said that they were not keeping up with the pace at which temperature zones are moving - this movement had reached 25 miles per decade between 1975 and 2005 .
He said : " Rapid movement of climatic zones is going to be another stress on wildlife .
" It adds to the stress of habitat loss due to human developments .
If we do not slow down the rate of global warming , many species are likely to become extinct .
" In effect we are pushing them off the planet . "
The environment group Earthwatch today warned that a change in climate could make the difference between survival and extinction for endangered lemurs in Madagascar .
A 20 - year study of the Milne - Edward 's sifakas lemur found that during dry spells , older females were unable to chew enough leaves to provide their infants with milk .
Lemurs are able to give birth up to five times during the final decade of their lives , but as they get older their teeth become worn , making it harder for them to eat .
If dry periods become more common , they will struggle to feed their young , and the numbers of animals who make it to adulthood will fall .
看護師になるとどこで働いていても激務をこなさなければならないというわけではありません。どの職場でも忙しさがあるのは確かですが、職場の種類によってその性質には違いがあります。全ての職場で看護師全員が忙殺されているというわけではないので、無理なく働こうと考えたら職場をよく考えれば解決可能です。職場を選び間違えてしまった人が転職する理由として大きいのは、職場ごとの忙しさの違いについてよく理解していないからと言えるでしょう。
例えば病床がある病院では勤務時間が長くなりがちであり、夜勤もあるのが特徴です。一方、クリニックでは夜勤はなく、残業もあまりない傾向にあります。しかし、看護師の人数が少なくて担わなければならない仕事の種類が多くなり、責任も重大になりやすいのが特徴と言えます。一般的には残業も少なくて夜勤もないクリニックの方が無理なく働けると考えられるでしょう。しかし、重圧を気にする人にとってはクリニックの方が激務となるかもしれません。職場によって独特の忙しさや職務の負担があるため、現場の種類による違いは理解しておく必要があるでしょう。
どんな仕事をしていきたいかと考えるのも大切ですが、激務事情の違いを理解して職場の種類を選んでおくと無理がなくなって働きやすいのは確かです。予めその点も考慮した上で就職先を決めておけば長く続けられる確率も上がるでしょう。

The US is counting on Iraqi forces to police the area eventually
Brig Gen Mick Bednarek said a big challenge for his 10,000 soldiers was securing areas once they were clear .
The situation inside the city , 60 km ( 35 miles ) north - east of Baghdad , could not be confirmed independently .
Earlier , another US military official said al - Qaeda fighters were being " enveloped into a kill sack " .
As of Sunday , US forces had trapped between 50 and 100 insurgents and were " closing the noose " , Gen Bednarek said .
" It 's the hard - core fighters left - guys who will die for their cause , as misaligned as that is - and they want to kill as many US forces as they can , " the US commander added .
Gen Bednarek predicted it would be weeks before Iraqi police and troops could secure the area .
According to his figures , US forces have killed between 60 and 100 fighters in the city and one American soldier has died in the fighting .
Baquba is the capital of Diyala Province and has long been a centre of Sunni Muslim resistance to coalition and Iraqi government forces .
THIS WAS UNCALLED FOR .
Python , science and what have you .
Here is a true story .
Saturday , after the symposium at Fermilab , I was driving back into the city .
To be honest , I was completely exhausted ; it had been a long day of talks , and I had been up quite late the previous night throwing mine together , resulting in very little sleep .
So I was pretty much ready to crash , certainly uninterested in any sort of activity involving serious brain function .
And then I remembered that the big football game was about to start -- my beloved Penn State Nittany Lions vs. the Ohio State Buckeyes in a titanic battle for Big Ten supremacy .
Sadly , however , I do n't have cable TV at my place ( long story ) .
But I knew how to circumvent this obstacle : a visit to ESPN SportsZone , the modern sports - bar / video arcade that features comfy leather recliners in which you can grab a bite while you watch the game on their huge - screen TV .
A perfect brain - free activity to cap off the evening .
Very un-physics - professor - like behavior , but I 've done worse .
And if all went well , Penn State would even win , preserving their unbeaten record and vaulting them into the national - championship picture .
( Aside : they did win , outlasting 6th - ranked OSU for a rain - soaked 17 - 10 victory in front of 100,000 screaming Penn State partisans .
An incredibly important victory for the program and for legendary coach Joe Paterno , who had inexplicably suffered through four losing seasons in the last five years .
Paterno has been head coach for 40 years , including 20 bowl victories ( best ever ) , 349 total victories ( second - best ) , five undefeated seasons , and two national championships .
He 's also donated millions of dollars to the university -- to build a library .
When Penn State joined the Big Ten a dozen years ago , Paterno was 66 and widely expected to soon retire .
When Barry Alvarez steps down from the head job at Wisconsin at the end of this year , every school in the conference will have experienced a head - coaching change -- except Penn State .
Due to the travesty by which college football chooses its national champion , it will be difficult for PSU to get a legitimate shot at the title this year even if they win all their games .
But if things break just right , the Lions could be headed to the Rose Bowl on January 4th to duke it out with USC for the big enchilada .
Watch out , Clifford , we 're coming for you ! )
So there I am , enjoying my buffalo wings and Guinness and cringing as Ohio State scores the first field goal .
At the table next to me was a group of women who were visiting the big city for the weekend , celebrating the birthday of Caroline , one of their number .
They were also Ohio State fans -- no accounting for taste .
It 's perfectly clear within the restaurant who is rooting for which team , just from the timing of shouts of delight or groans of dismay , so we were soon trading good - natured barbs about the relative merits of our respective squads .
By halftime Penn State was up 14 - 10 , so I was feeling especially magnanimous .
We chatted about what we all did for a living and so forth , and I ended up explaining something about dark energy and particle physics and the big bang .
Caroline , after making a good - faith effort to understand the distinction between quarks and leptons , pleasantly but firmly demanded to know " What is the practical use of all this ?
What can we actually do with it ?
Why is it worth spending time on it ? "
My line on these questions is that there is n't necessarily any practical application ( although there may be spinoffs ) ; we do it as part of a quest to understand how the world works .
I was trying to explain this , with less than complete success .
But then Caroline 's younger sister ( whose name I unfortunately forget , as I would love to give her credit ) , who was a secondary - school science teacher before she had kids of her own , leaned across the table and said " Because the world is not magic .
This is what I always taught my kids , and it's what everyone should understand . "
The world is not magic .
The world follows patterns , obeys unbreakable rules .
We never reach a point , in exploring our universe , where we reach an ineffable mystery and must give up on rational explanation ; our world is comprehensible , it makes sense .
I can't imagine saying it better .
There is no way of proving once and for all that the world is not magic ; all we can do is point to an extraordinarily long and impressive list of formerly - mysterious things that we were ultimately able to make sense of .
There 's every reason to believe that this streak of successes will continue , and no reason to believe it will end .
If everyone understood this , the world would be a better place .
Of course , there are different connotations to the word " magical . "
One refers to inscrutable mystery , but another refers simply to a feeling of wonder or delight .
And our world is full of that kind of magic .
I get to listen to some fascinating talks on neutrinos and particle accelerators during the day , enjoy a statement - making victory over our conference rivals in the evening , and be handed a nugget of marvelously distilled wisdom from a woman in a sports bar who I had never met and will unlikely ever see again ( a Buckeye fan , no less ) -- these are all magical .
We should n't feel disappointed that the march of understanding removes an element of mystery from the world ; we should be appreciative of how much there is to know and the endless variety of ways in which our sensible universe continues to surprise us .
The very fact that our world is comprehensible should fill us with wonder and delight .
The world is not magic -- and that 's the most magical thing about it .
I was trying to think of an analogy .
Black market jumped to mind , but these items are n't illegal nor illegally obtained .
Surprisingly , the best analogy I found was illegal immigration .
In large part , many psychiatrists and primary docs have the luxury of proclaiming that they " do n't give out Xanax and Percocet " because there is somewhere else for those patients to go .
Dr. Smith from University Clinic does n't have to haggle over # 10 Percocets because the patients can go to other doctors who are much more -- comfortable , let 's say -- giving out # 90 Percocets a month .
But let 's ask a different question : what would happen if all of these doctors disappeared ?
If there was no fast and easy way to get prescribed legal Xanax , would all the Xanax seekers just disappear ?
When patients complain about doctors , it 's usually about overcharging and undercaring .
When doctors complain about doctors , however , it 's usually about those with " loose " practice , especially in the inner cities , who seem to overprescribe Xanax and Percocet .
In this case , illegals supply a required function that the existing distribution of the laborforce does not satisfy .
Without that supply of illegals , the very existence of the industries that use them would be threatened .
There would not be as many restaurants , or as many different kinds .
And costs would be reduced elsewhere , maybe in unsafe ways .
Additionally , like illegal immigration ( and black market economies ) , the situation exists in the open -- precisely because of its necessity .
So if the " loose " Percocet prescribers disappeared , two things would happen : first , Percocet would be pushed into the ilicit underground trade .
It is already partly there .
It would become more abused with the removal of even the rudimentary medical supervision .
Second , the practice of medicine itself would change drastically .
It 's easy to say that low back pain should only be treated with NSAIDs or physical therapy and weight loss , but it 's easy only because the the 100 million scripts a year for Percocet are being written by people who do n't say that .
It 's also easy to be dogmatic that SSRIs should be the first line agents for the treatment of anxiety as long as you 're willing to purposely ignore the 50 million combined yearly scripts for Xanax and Klonopin that non-academics are writing .
( For reference : Lipitor is 63 million . )
These commonly maligned inner city doctors actually serve as a pressure valve on the rest of medicine , in the same way that illegal immigration is a pressure valve on labor and industry .
I 'm not judging the actual clinical utility of these drugs , nor am I saying that " loose " practice is good or bad .
I am thinking about what role , if any , such practice has in the larger scheme of medicine .
And I 'm convinced that it 's actually quite enormous .
What proportion of the inner city population , for example , goes for routine preventative medical care -- checkups , , blood draws , etc -- only because that doctor also gives them Percocet for back pain ?
How many people fill the Glucophage only because there 's a Percocet on the same script ?
I have no idea -- is it 15 % ?
If it is , is it ethical , by " not prescribing narcotics , " to create circumstances in which patients self - select inferior medical care ?
Let 's assume Dr. Smith is one of the best doctors in America and he has unparalleled success at treating diabetes in his patients .
However , he never gives Percocet or other narcotics : " that 's my policy . "
Patients looking for Percocet -- for abuse or legitimate purposes -- will not go to him , and consequently get inferior diabetes care .
Is this ethical ?
I 'm not saying that the Dr. Percocet wo n't give good care ; I think you understand that my point is how seemingly unrelated medical decisions may in fact be the key medical decisions .
From a simple patient advocacy perspective , I think it 's possibly both disingenuous and unfair to have a " policy " on narcotics .
Whether the risks outweigh the benefits is n't something that can be answered a priori-- each patient 's situation is different .
So saying " I do n't give Xanax " willfully ignores the uniqueness of each patient 's existence , as well as the clinical data that says the thing actually does work .
Treating the patient with maxims and guidelines that result in the patient leaving treatment to go elsewhere is , arguably , the opposite of medical care .
Medical treatment often requires unorthodox and unproven maneuvers , but always with an eye towards the risks and benefits , and to the single goal of improving the patient 's condition .
I do n't have all the answers , but I have a lot more questions .
April 2 , 2007  --
For the first time in its history , the U.S. Supreme Court has waded into the political debate on global warming .
Under the Bush administration , the Environmental Protection Agency or EPA has argued that carbon dioxide and the like are n't pollutants under the Clean Air Act , and therefore , the agency has no power to regulate them .
In a sweeping 5 - 4 decision released Monday , the Supreme Court rejected that position , declaring that Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from cars .
Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion , and was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy , David Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer .
The Supreme Court majority decided US motor - vehicle emissions make a " meaningful contribution to greenhouse gas concentrations " and hence , to global warming .
" A well - documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
Respected scientists believe the two trends are related , " Justice Stevens wrote .
Bush Administration Defeat Delights Environmental Groups
Environmental groups applauded the Court 's decision .
" It 's an important signal that the Bush administration cannot continue to ignore the problem of global warming for political reasons when the science is so clear and there 's such clear pressure from the public to move forward , " said Josh Dorner , spokesperson for the Sierra Club in Washington D.C .
" An enormous victory for the fight against global warming , " declared Doug Kendall , whose group Community Rights Counsel filed an amicus brief in the case on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors .
" The Supreme Court has recognized both the importance of the problem and the need for the federal government to act on the solution , " Kendall said , arguing the decision is a major victory for states who want to rely on the congressional Clean Air Act .
" The Supreme Court 's decision , in Massachusetts v. EPA , repudiates the Bush administration 's do - nothing policy on global warming , " said David Doniger , Natural Resources Defense Council 's attorney in the case .
Greenpeace , the well - known environmental group , viewed the decision today as a political victory against the Bush administration 's policy on climate change .
" What this ruling shows is the degree to which the Bush administration just continues to be out of step , not only with the science , but with congress and public opinion , " said Chris Miller , director of global climate change at Greenpeace .
" All of these years that the Bush administration has been in office , instead of trying to find out ways that they can combat global warming , they 've been denying the science , they 've been fighting lawsuits ... so this is a big defeat for them , and it's also a big defeat for the automotive industry that spent a lot of time energy and effort trying to beat this back , " said Miller .
The automotive industry , which stands to be affected the most by any change in government regulation , reacted favorably today , arguing the ruling may be good for automakers in the long run .
" The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers believes that there needs to be a national , federal , economy - wide approach to addressing greenhouse gases , " said Dave McCurdy , president and CEO of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers .
Many U.S. vehicle manufacturers have said they would like to see a national standard for emissions , instead of the current system of different standards in every state .
EPA Defends Bush Administration Climate Change Policy
Today the EPA responded to the Supreme Court decision with a defense of the Bush administration 's climate change policy .
" EPA is reviewing the Court 's decision to determine the appropriate course of action , " said Jennifer Wood , press secretary for the EPA .
" The Bush Administration has an unparalleled financial , international and domestic commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions , " Wood said , arguing the administration has a goal to reduce greenhouse gas intensity 18 percent by 2012 .
" The president 's policy achieves near - term reductions , while investing in long - term solutions , " she said .
During a White House press briefing today , deputy press secretary Dana Perino argued the administration has already tried to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by increasing mileage standards for light trucks and SUVs through the Department of Transportation 's CAFE program .
" The way to get cars to be more efficient is to burn less gas and to go more miles and that 's what we 've been working to do , " said Perino .
When asked why the administration has declined to mandate that businesses cap their greenhouse gas emissions , Perino said , " we did not move forward with a full , mandatory cap because we believe that it would have been harmful to United States businesses . "
" Everyone is emitting up into the air , " said Perino , " and if there are no actions taken by the major developing countries , like China and India ... you 're going to put the American economy at a great disadvantage , push American businesses overseas , and then do nothing for the environment , " she said .
Dissenters of the Supreme Court decision included some of the more conservative justices , including Justices Scalia , Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts .
The dissenting Justices questioned whether concern over global warming is warranted .
" The Court 's alarm over global warming may or may not be justified , but it ought not distort the outcome of this litigation , " wrote Justice Scalia in his dissension .
" No matter how important the underlying policy issues at stake , this Court has no business substituting its own desired outcome for the reasoned judgment of the responsible agency , " wrote Scalia .
Historic Decision Does Not Equal Action
Eleven states joined Massachusetts in bringing the suit against the EPA , including California , Connecticut , Illinois , Maine , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington State , along with numerous other environmental groups and nonprofit organizations .
Fourteen " friend of the court " briefs were also filed from independent scientists , former EPA administrators , former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , electric power companies , state and local governments , and others .
However , some of those same groups say it may be years before any real change is taken by the EPA .
" It puts a process into motion that essentially compels the EPA to at some point issue regulations on carbon dioxide , " said Dorner .
" I think , obviously , that process will be a slow one and we might see some action in Congress before that process comes to full fruition .
It just moves things down the field one more step . "
Court Dives Into Heated Debate
The Supreme Court had three questions before it :
Do states have the right to sue the EPA to challenge its decision ?
Does the Clean Air Act give EPA the authority to regulate tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases ?
Does EPA have the discretion not to regulate those emissions ?
The Court said ' yes ' to the first two questions and , on the third , it ordered EPA to re-evaluate its contention it has the discretion not to regulate tailpipe emissions .
The Court said the agency has so far provided a " laundry list ' " of reasons that include foreign policy considerations and added that the EPA must tie its rationale more closely to the Clean Air Act .
Global Warming 's Political Rise
The political climate has changed dramatically over the issue of global warming since the court agreed last year to hear the case -- the Supreme Court 's first on the subject .
In November of 2006 , Democrats took control of Congress and pledged to make global warming a national issue .
In February , the world 's leading climate scientists reported global warming is " very likely " caused by man and is so severe that it will " continue for centuries . "
An interesting development in the politics of climate change is how the issue of global warming is playing out in the 2008 presidential campaign .
" Virtually all of the frontrunners for the 2008 presidential bid are significantly stronger on this issue ( than the Bush administration ) , " said Chris Miller of Greenpeace , pointing to '08 candidates Sen.
Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , and Sen , John McCain , R.Ariz. , who all advocate capping greenhouse gas emissions .
But perhaps one of the biggest political players in the climate change arena is former Vice President Al Gore .
His Academy Award - winning documentary , " An Inconvenient Truth " , which makes the case for prompt action on climate change , has gained widespread attention and applause , not to mention giving Gore a microphone to the world during the Oscars .
Standing alongside David Guggenheim , director of the Gore - inspired documentary , on stage , Gore proclaimed , " My fellow Americans , people all over the world -- we need to solve the climate crisis .
It 's not a political issue .
It 's a moral issue .
We have everything we need to get started with the possible exception of the will to act .
That 's a renewable resource .
Let 's renew it . "
The former Vice President turned environmental activist also recently testified before both the House and Senate on the issue of global climate change , spurring rumors of another presidential bid , all of which have been downplayed but not entirely rejected by Gore .
ABC News ' Jan Crawford Greenburg , Ariane DeVogue , and Dennis Powell contributed to this report .
Twentieth Century Fox has subpoenaed YouTube , demanding that the site provides the details of users who uploaded four episodes of " 24 " and twelve episodes of " The Simpsons " .
The request is dated January 18th , but was only discovered today - it reads :
On or about January 8 , 2007 , Fox became aware that a subscriber ( " the Subscriber " ) of YouTube Inc.s '
Internet - based service uploaded pirated copies of the works onto YouTube , making it available for illegal viewing over the Internet to anyone who wishes to watch it .
Fox has not authorized this distribution or display of the works .
The subpoena request YouTube , Inc. to disclose information sufficient to identify the Subscriber so that Fox can stop this infringing activity .
What 's worrying about this is that Fox is going after the uploaders themselves , rather than just issuing a DMCA and getting the clips pulled .
Google is known for protecting its users ' details to the greatest extent possible - last year , the company refused to hand user 's search queries over to the Department of Justice .
With that in mind , it seems unlikely that they 'll concede .
In fact , YouTube 's success seems so heavily based around permitting uploads of copyrighted material ( and then quickly seeking deals with the content creators ) , that legal actions against individual users could cripple its growth .
That said , this is n't the first time a company has subpoenaed YouTube : Paramount Pictures successfully got them to hand over the details of YouTube user Chris Moukarbel , who was was sued for copyright infringement on June 16th 2006 for uploading dialog from the movie “ Twin Towers ” .
That was before the Google acquisition , of course , and things have changed substantially since .
The record suggests that what Bush described in his autobiography as " a fair hearing and full access to the courts " meant in reality nothing more than that a case had received some sort of legal attention at all state and federal levels .
In the case of Karla Faye Tucker , the first woman executed in Texas in more than a hundred years , Bush wrote to at least two constituents that he had refused to grant a reprieve precisely because " the courts , including the United States Supreme Court , " had " reviewed the legal issues in this case " and denied all appeals .
But clemency is a political act , not a judicial one .
By eliminating " legal issues " from executive consideration , Bush in effect refused to address what were often the condemned person 's strongest claims .
Indeed , the fact that courts have rejected a defendant 's legal claims arguably places an added burden on a governor — as the conscience of the state and the literal court of last resort — to conduct a scrupulous review .
This is especially true in Texas , where more than a third of executions in the United States since 1976 have occurred ; where half of all capital cases are overturned on appeal because of errors during trial ; where seven innocent men have been freed from death row , including one under Bush ; where , according to The Dallas Morning News , nearly a quarter of the condemned were represented by attorneys who had been disciplined for professional misconduct ; and where 30 percent of those executed under Bush between his inauguration in 1995 and June 11 , 2000 , according to the Chicago Tribune , were represented by attorneys who presented no mitigating evidence or only one witness during the sentencing phase of the trial .
Given this environment , Gonzales 's neglect of mitigating evidence in the clemency - review process is highly problematic .
But the real problem with citing thorough court review as a standard for denying clemency is that none of the 152 executions Bush approved would have landed on his desk had the cases not already passed through all the courts .
To assert — as Bush did — that defendants have " full access to the courts " does not establish any sort of guideline for ensuring due process ; it merely describes the judicial process .
Although Terry Washington 's guilt was never seriously disputed , in at least two other capital cases profound doubts about guilt were raised by the defense but virtually ignored by Gonzales .
In the case of David Wayne Stoker , for example , Gonzales devoted just eighteen sentences to the extraordinarily complex circumstances of the crime , leaving out essentially all the mitigating evidence and failing to address a multitude of questions about both the evidence against Stoker and his due - process rights .
Ronnie Thompson , a key state witness , initially told the police , and then the court , that Stoker had confessed to a 1986 murder .
But following Stoker 's conviction Thompson recanted , explaining that he'd lied in court because the prosecutor had threatened to bring a perjury charge against him if he did n't stick to his original account .
Bush should have been told that .
During Stoker 's trial , in 1987 , Thompson 's wife , Debbie , left him to move in with Carey Todd , the prosecution 's chief witness ; she got a piece of the Crime Stoppers reward that Todd received for naming Stoker .
Gonzales failed to mention that drug and weapons charges against Todd were dropped the very day he testified against Stoker ; and that Todd thus had an apparent motive for setting him up .
Gonzales also failed to mention that a state investigator , a police officer , and Todd all lied in court about what Todd received for his testimony ; that the jury was n't told about Todd 's possible motive for framing Stoker ; and that James Grigson , a psychiatrist who testified that Stoker was a sociopath who would " absolutely " be violent again ( thereby making him eligible for a death sentence ) , had never even examined Stoker .
Grigson , whose expert testimony has helped send dozens of men to death row , earning him the nickname Dr. Death , had been expelled from the American Psychiatric Association two years before the Stoker case was reviewed by Gonzales and Bush , because his testimony had repeatedly been found to be unethical .
Another expert medical witness against Stoker , Ralph Erdmann , had relinquished his medical license in 1994 after pleading no contest to seven felonies tied to falsified evidence and botched autopsies .
A special prosecutor 's investigation of Erdmann concluded that he falsified evidence in at least thirty cases , and that if " the prosecution theory was that death was caused by a Martian death ray then that was what Dr. Erdmann reported . "
All this information was in the public record , yet Gonzales mentioned none of it in his memorandum to Bush .
New Army documents reveal US knew of and approved torture before Abu Ghraib scandal RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday May 2 , 2006 Print This | Email This BREAKING HARD -- FROM AN ACLU RELEASE TO RAW STORY .
# New Army documents released by the American Civil Liberties Union today reveal that Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez ordered interrogators to " go to the outer limits " to get information from detainees .
The documents also show that senior government officials were aware of abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan before the Abu Ghraib scandal broke .
" When our leaders allow and even encourage abuse at the ' outer limits ' , America suffers , " said Anthony D. Romero , ACLU Executive Director .
" A nation that works to bring freedom and liberty to other parts of the world should n't stomach brutality and inhumanity within its ranks .
This abuse of power was engineered and accepted at the highest levels of our government . "
Among the documents released today by the ACLU is a May 19 , 2004 Defense Intelligence Agency document implicating Sanchez in potentially abusive interrogation techniques .
In the document , an officer in charge of a team of interrogators stated that there was a 35 - page order spelling out the rules of engagement that interrogators were supposed to follow , and that they were encouraged to " go to the outer limits to get information from the detainees by people who wanted the information . "
When asked to whom the officer was referring , the officer answered " LTG Sanchez . "
The officer stated that the expectation coming from " Headquarters " was to break the detainees .
The ACLU also released an Information Paper entitled " Allegations of Detainee Abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan " dated April 2 , 2004 , two weeks before the world saw the pictures of torture at Abu Ghraib prison .
The paper outlined the status of 62 investigations of detainee abuse and detainee deaths .
Cases include assaults , punching , kicking and beatings , mock executions , sexual assault of a female detainee , threatening to kill an Iraqi child to " send a message to other Iraqis , " stripping detainees , beating them and shocking them with a blasting device , throwing rocks at handcuffed Iraqi children , choking detainees with knots of their scarves and interrogations at gunpoint .
The ACLU said the document makes clear that while President Bush and other officials assured the world that what occurred at Abu Ghraib was the work of " a few bad apples , " the government knew that abuse was happening in numerous facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Of the 62 cases being investigated at the time , at least 26 involved detainee deaths .
Some of the cases had already gone through a court - martial proceeding .
The abuses went beyond Abu Ghraib , and touched Camp Cropper , Camp Bucca and other detention centers in Mosul , Samarra , Baghdad , Tikrit , as well as Orgun - E in Afghanistan .
" These documents are further proof that the abuse of detainees was widespread and systemic , and not aberrational , " said Amrit Singh , a staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants ' Rights Project .
" We know that senior officials endorsed this abuse , but these officials have yet to be held accountable . "
Last week , the government authenticated that two videos released by the Palm Beach Post in March 2005 were videos that the government was withholding from the ACLU 's Freedom of Information Act request .
The videos are part of a set that has come to be known as the " Ramadi Madness " videos and were made by members of the West Palm Beach - based Bravo Company , 1st Battalion , 124th Infantry Regiment .
The two scenes the government authenticated are called " See Haj Run " and " Blood Clot . "
They depict scenes of urban battle and persons being captured and detained by U.S. forces .
Among the more than 9,000 pages of Defense Department documents made public by the ACLU today are several investigations detailing cruel and degrading treatment and killings .
The investigations include :
An investigation into the death of a detainee at Forward Operating Base Rifles near Al Asad , Iraq established probable cause to believe that several soldiers assaulted a detainee and committed negligent homicide , and conspired to cover up the death .
The detainee died when a soldier lifted him up from the floor by placing a baton under his chin , fracturing his hyoid bone .
It appears that the soldiers received written letters of reprimand and counseling .
The full document is online here .
A heavily redacted e-mail dated May 25 , 2004 shows that a presumed officer or civilian government official was told of three reports of abuse of detainees described as " probably true / valid . "
One detainee was " in such poor physical shape from obvious beatings that [ name redacted ] asked the MP's to note his condition before he proceeded with interrogation . "
Another detainee was " in such bad shape ... that he was laying down in his own feces . "
These cases seem to have occurred in Abu Ghraib and Camp Cropper .
The full document is online here .
An investigation shows a doctor cleared a detainee for further interrogations , despite claims he had been beaten and shocked with a taser .
The medic confirmed that the detainee 's injuries were consistent with his allegations , stating , " Everything he described he had on his body . "
Yet , the medic cleared him for further interrogation , giving him Tylenol for the pain .
There is no indication that the medic reported this abuse .
The full document is online here .
Today 's documents come in response to a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request filed by the ACLU , the Center for Constitutional Rights , Physicians for Human Rights , Veterans for Common Sense and Veterans for Peace .
The New York Civil Liberties Union is co-counsel in the case .
To date , more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released detailing the torture and abuse of detainees .
The ACLU recently launched a new powerful search engine for the public to access the documents at www.aclu.org/torturefoiasearch.
The search engine allows people to uncover details about abuse that may not have been reported in the media , said the ACLU .
The FOIA lawsuit is being handled by Lawrence Lustberg and Megan Lewis of the New Jersey - based law firm Gibbons , Del Deo , Dolan , Griffinger & Vecchione , P.C. Other attorneys in the case are Amrit Singh , Jameel Jaffer and Judy Rabinovitz of the ACLU ; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the NYCLU ; and Barbara Olshansky of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
Kiss the Mediterranean goodbye .
Ditto the Red Sea and its wonderland of coral reefs and exotic sea life .
And prepare for the day when San Francisco has a gritty new suburb : Los Angeles .
Indeed , much of Southern California , including the Baja Peninsula , will eventually migrate up the west coast to make Alaska even more gargantuan .
Geologists have long prided themselves on their ability to peer into the distant past and discern the slow movements of land and sea that have continuously revised the planet ’s face over eons .
Now , drawing on new insights , theories , measurements and technologies — and perhaps a bit of scientific bravado — they are forecasting the shape of terra firma in the distant future .
The maps and animations by these scientists are helping explain core principles of geology to increasingly wide audiences .
Schools , textbooks , museums , Web sites and television shows now routinely feature images of what the forecasters say the planet will look like eons from now .
And geologists are using the forecasts to deepen their own investigations of plate tectonics .
“ It ’s tremendous , ” said Warren J. Nokleberg , a senior research geologist at the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park , Calif .
“ It lets students and scientists better appreciate the mobile Earth , to see where it ’s going .
That ’s very powerful . ”
43 % of first - time home buyers put no money down By Noelle Knox , USA TODAY WASHINGTON 
As housing prices soared last year , an eye - popping 43 % of first - time home buyers purchased their homes with no-money - down loans , according to a study released Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors .
The trend is potentially ominous .
The real estate market is cooling in some areas , and rates on adjustable - rate loans are creeping up .
As a result , some no -money - down buyers could owe more than their homes are worth .
Who are entry - level buyers ?
Survey of home buyers reveals : Median age : 32 Median household income : $ 57,200 Median down payment : 2 % * Purchased with no money down : 43 % *  on home costing $ 150,000
Source : National Association of Realtors , 2005 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers
The median first - time home buyer scraped together a down payment of only 2 % on a $ 150,000 home in 2005 , the NAR found .
Already , home prices in many areas are declining , and the " For Sale " signs are hanging in front yards longer .
There 's now at least a 50 % risk that prices will decline within two years in 11 major metro areas , including San Diego ; Boston ; Long Island , N.Y. ; Los Angeles ; and San Francisco , according to PMI Mortgage Insurance 's latest U.S. Market Risk Index .
" In a number of areas , particularly on the coasts , they have a high risk of price declines in the next two years , " says Mark Milner , chief risk officer of PMI .
Red - hot home building , acquisitions , remodeling and refinancing in recent years helped drive the economy and raise fears of a real estate bubble .
Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research says that if housing prices fall at least 10 % , it could be even more damaging than the collapse of the high - tech stock bubble in 2000 .
" If we do get a spike in mortgage rates , and a modest decline ( in the housing market ) turns into a rout , there 's almost no bottom to that , " Baker says .
" That 's a crash scenario . "
Baker and other economists are concerned that many lenders have pushed a series of creative but potentially dangerous loans to help more Americans afford a home .
The traditional 30 - year loan with a fixed rate remains the most popular way of financing , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association .
But about one - third of homeowners take out riskier loans , such as interest - only or flat - minimum - payment mortgages .
" These non-traditional loans transfer risk to the borrower , " Milner says .
NAR President Thomas
Stevens says he is n't worried that nearly half of first - time home buyers put no money down , but adds , " If the number was higher than that , I 'd be concerned . "
5 Facts About Money That Your Banker Never Told You
Earlier on , I wrote an article about some historical trivia surrounding our beloved currency .
Today , I will resume the money facts but this time , with a more practical bent .
These facts are ACTUALLY useful and could change how you look at money .
FACT # 1 : There ’s such a thing as the penny debate .
Why is the penny still around ?
It seems like an inconvenience to use .
Well if you found out it was worth more to make a penny than its face value , would n’t you still hold on to it ?
There have been active debates on the plight of the penny online and offline from mainstream news to online community commentary , which I am republishing below .
The big question : should we scrap the penny or keep it in circulation ?
Pros : Gallup polls show that 2/3 of Americans want to keep the cent around .
A pro-penny lobby even exists called Americans for Common Cents .
Polls found that 58 percent of Americans stash pennies in piggy banks , jars or drawers instead of spending them like other coins .
Some people eventually redeem them at banks or coin-counting machines , but 2 percent admit to throwing pennies out .
Still majority recognize the penny as part of American history and tradition .
It ’s a hedge against inflation , by virtue of the accurate pricing it can offer consumers .
Charities love the penny as they are a common form of donation .
Without the cent , they would suffer greatly as the penny is the most frequently donated coin , and charitable organizations receive tens of millions of dollars a year in pennies alone .
Small business merchants prefer the penny for easier cash transactions .
Other penny lovers are contractors who help supply pennies and consumer advocates who fear the rounding up of purchases .
It is believed that doing away with the penny will hurt the economy by causing nearly $ 650 dollars per year in a sort of “ penny tax ” that would only benefit businesses .
Prices would be changed so that store owners would keep the change from the rounding required without pennies .
During economic recessions , penny circulation increases dramatically as people roll and spend them .
The government has also made over $ 500 million in profit from the penny in the last 15 years which has kept the national debt from rising as fast , so it is unlikely that the penny will go away any time soon .
Some shrewd folks on community sites have suggested that if pennies are worth more than 1 cent , you could theoretically go to the bank and take all your money out as pennies , sell them for their base metals to be melted down , and make a profit from this process .
You can then repeat this process indefinitely which hints at potential arbitrage opportunities to be exploited .
But if this turned out to be a popular scheme , then the government would probably close this loophole .
Is this legal ?
Until we hear of a case that proves otherwise , then it is believed to be so .
Cons :
The penny is also called the “ nuisance coin ” for obvious reasons .
It is extremely rare to find a vending machine that will accept pennies ( though contrary to popular belief , a penny is legal tender ) so it ’s no surprise that most people simply keep their pennies in a jar and never use them , or just do n’t keep them at all .
It ’s worth more to produce than its face value due to higher metal prices , for the first time in history .
The Mint ’s announcement is a milestone , because coins have historically cost less to produce than the face value paid by receiving banks and have usually been moneymakers for the government .
The cost of materials alone is already higher than the cent ’s face value .
Above and beyond that , there is also hardware and labor to produce coins which should also be considered as part of the total cost !
We pay taxes on a currency that appears unused , obsolete and undervalued .
Just like the pro-penny group , we have the anti-penny brigade .
FACT # 2 : Your torn up dollar bill or mutilated coin can still be worth something .
If you ’ve somehow torn or destroyed a paper bill , or bent a coin ( although I would n’t know how this could be done ! ) , there is hope !
You can redeem slightly damaged currency from your local bank , but for serious cases , you may have to do more .
Paper money that has been mutilated or partially destroyed may in some cases be redeemable at full face value .
Any badly soiled , defaced , torn , or worn - out currency that is clearly more than half of the original note can be exchanged at a commercial bank , which processes the note through a Federal Reserve Bank .
More seriously damaged notes — those with clearly less than half of the original surface or those requiring special examination to determine their value — must be sent to the Department of the Treasury for redemption .
You can try to claim the equivalent of your damaged money by following these steps .
FACT # 3 : Not all unauthorized coin production is considered counterfeiting .
Say what ?
It ’s actually all a matter of terminology .
Now do n’t try this at home or you ’ll still end up where the sun do n’t shine .
It is universally thought that any unauthorized production of coin money is an act of counterfeiting .
Technically , this is not so .
Only those coins illegally produced from metal of less value than the original coins are considered to be counterfeit coins .
Though still a criminal act , the unauthorized production of coins of the same metallic value is considered to be “ duplication . ”
At any rate , those who choose to help the Fed with its printing and coinage work often end up doing perfectly legal duplication work in license - plate production at their state penitentiaries .
FACT # 4 : Know how and when it is illegal to destroy money .
Nothing in the law forbids anyone from destroying coins , in spite of a belief to the contrary .
Defacing or mutilating a coin and then passing it as currency is another matter .
The intent to commit fraud is what is being penalized in this case .
As far as paper money is concerned , leaving money in your pants pockets to be drenched in a washing machine wo n’t harm your bills .
That ’s because they are made out of linen and cotton fibers , which are n’t affected by water .
On this note , here ’s an interesting but unverified observation from an online forum :
It ’s illegal to modify money in a fraudulent way ( i.e. make a defective mint Penny and sell it for a thousand dollars ) , but it is perfectly legal to retrieve the base metals from money , just as it is legal to possess shredded paper money ( and use it for stuffing pillows , toys , etc ) .
FACT # 5 : There are many security features built into the paper bill .
Of course you already know that it ’s tough to get away with counterfeiting money .
There are many security features built into a paper bill today .
Some such features include the use of cotton and linen rag paper to make money so it should be obvious that it is against the law to produce or handle this type of paper .
Special inks , microprinting , color shifting ink , distinctive colors per denomination , watermarks and embedded polymer strips have been added to our bills to prevent their duplication and recreation .
Above all this , the Treasury redesigns notes every seven to ten years .
Here are some graphics that point out the security features on our money !

I joined Facebook today .
I resisted as long as I could .
I could n’t help but notice a recent surge of other people I know signing up recently as well – nor could I shake off the odd sense of déjà vu .
It seems like such a short time ago that MySpace was the place to be in terms of social networking – now it seems that ’s all over and Facebook is now the ‘ site du jour ’ .
It ’s not the first time something like this has happened , either – there have been countless communities online that have grown , peaked , and slowly faded into obscurity .
Like a roving band of wildebeest , it seems communities arrive en masse , graze for a while , and move on to pastures anew .
The current crop of Web 2.0 sites seem to have amplified this trend – there are more and more sites cropping up with a community angle , so now people hungry for social interaction on the web have a near boundless choice for their communal appetites .
As surely as Facebook has risen to challenge MySpace , and as Digg has all but displaced Slashdot , in the not - too distant future there will be other sites which rise to threaten the current generation .
Perhaps the MySpace killer is already out there , just waiting for a chance to break the mainstream ?
Modelling Social Network Communities Growth
The early days of a community site are its most fragile - most start - ups will fail without ever making it past this phase .
Those familiar with running forums or sites with a community aspect will know how hard it is to get a sustained level of activity without a solid user base – avoiding the tumbleweed can be difficult .
With work and persistence some sites will begin to make headway – a small , closely - knit community can develop .
Many community sites will persist at this level , with no real reason to change – others may get lucky and find a break – whether it ’s a link from a major blog ( TechCrunch or similar ) , getting on the front page of Digg ( or Reddit , Netscape , etc ) , or even a news report or feature in the mainstream media .
Such buzz can cause a massive spike in traffic – propelling the previously unheard - of site into the view of thousands more people , and potentially kick - starting a chain reaction large enough to push into the mainstream .
Of course , there are no guarantees – a spike in interest from a single link can come and go very quickly , with little net benefit .
The social networking site Virb has had its fair share of buzz – it ’s been on Digg , been featured on a few high - profile blogs , but has a fairly modest Alexa ranking of around 5,000 ( at the time of writing ) .
It ’s firmly in the ‘ crunch ’ phase of start - up sites – the ‘ Valley of Uncertainty ‘ .
For Virb , there are two possible paths – the first is unfettered and gradually accelerating growth , the other is to remain in the doldrums indefinitely .
With such a great deal of competition in the social networking sphere , it could go either way .
Facebook is the perfect example for a site currently in the midst of meteoric growth – from an Alexa ranking of around 50,000 in 2005 to around 100 in 2006 , to 18 today in 2007 .
Little wonder that people are eager to acquire the site – even at a stupidly high price .
Such rapid growth is unsustainable , of course – and ultimately such popularity will reach a peak .
There are but a finite number of people to populate any given social network , and humans are notably fickle creatures .
Ultimately the usage levels for any given site will stabilise – social networking site Bebo and social news site Reddit are both in neutral - growth periods – not to say that future growth is impossible , but without intervention the user base is unlikely to spontaneously increase .
For the top few sites that attain popular appeal , a healthy period of traffic and utilisation follows the peak in usage – established services such as Flickr , MySpace and Digg have such sustained appeal that they persist at a relatively stable level – the ‘ Plateau of Ubiquity ‘ , if you please .
How long a site persists here depends on several factors , principally including the fierceness of competition and the rate at which a site can evolve to keep its users happy .
The internet is a fast changing place , and to hold a position of dominance with so many fresh upstarts is not easy .
While a community site can revitalise , innovate and hence prompt additional growth , life at the top is tough .
For many once - reigning sites a slow yet inexorable decline is inevitable .
The once mighty Slashdot is still very popular – it’s in the Alexa Top 500 – but slipping further and further away from the pole position it once held , with younger upstart Digg usurping its audience .
Social networking and community - led sites dominate the top ranked sites on Alexa , second only to the search engine contingent .
With such massive reach and the potential for direct marketing , it ’s not in the least surprising that the top of such sites are seeing such lucrative buyouts – $ 580 m for MySpace , $ 1.65 b for YouTube , and a touted $ 1b for Facebook .
I do n’t doubt that some of these acquisitions are worth it – the potential to reach people directly on the sites where they spend most of their time is valuable indeed .
I guess I ’ll see you all on Facebook .
For now , at least .

WiFi is coming to the fast lane as European automakers like DaimlerChrysler make progress on in - car networking systems designed to make driving safer .
DaimlerChrysler has just announced the successful field testing of the WILLWARN research project , which turns vehicles into WLAN routers .
Cars equipped with the system can relay information about temperature , road conditions , fog , or road obstructions to vehicles within 500 m , warning other drivers about problems so that they can take corrective action .
The WILLWARN project uses existing vehicle sensors such as the anti-lock braking system , electronic stability control , thermometer , or navigation system to detect black ice and road problems , and it can integrate with in - car radar and collision systems to report the location of road obstacles or disabled vehicles .
The system is part of the PReVENT initiative , a European project designed to reduce automotive fatalities .
The WLAN radios in the vehicles function much like normal WiFi routers , creating an ad - hoc mesh network with the other cars in the vicinity .
Road information is propagated through the mesh so that vehicles well out of radio range can be alerted to problems on the road ahead .
The system is designed to work with the Car2Car Communication Consortium , which communicates with other vehicles over a 5.9GHz connection .
The WLAN system is designed to be cheap , but it 's not going to do much until lots of other cars come with compatible systems installed .
DaimlerChrysler , one of the big backers of the new technology , suggests that " radio beacons at the side of the road " be installed so that early adopters have some incentive to use the technology .
These beacons would apparently transmit weather and traffic information to cars driving past .
In the future , when such technology is common , engineers have visions of expanding it to integrate it with GPS and mapping systems to help route cars away from gridlock .
European carmakers have been working on innovative electronic systems for years , most designed to increase safety , like DaimlerChrysler 's 24GHz short - range radar for collision detection .
Siemens , which supplies parts to the industry , has also been hard at work on a system that can identify speed limit signs and alert drivers when they are going too fast .
The new technology sounds great , but special attention has to be paid to the interface .
When I imagine some of my elderly relatives attempting to pay attention to the road while their car tells them the speed limit and flashes black ice warnings , I shudder .
Fortunately , carmakers are also hard at work on the human - machine interface for these new devices , and the fact that they recognize the interface as a potential problem point is encouraging .

BBC News , Tehran
Hundreds of women have been arrested for " bad hijab "
It is the talk of the town .
The latest police crackdown on Islamic dress has angered many Iranians - male , female , young and old .
But Iranian TV has reported that an opinion poll conducted in Tehran found 86 % of people were in favour of the crackdown - a statistic that is surprising given the strength of feeling against this move .
Police cars are stationed outside major shopping centres in Tehran .
They are stopping pedestrians and even cars - warning female drivers not to show any hair - and impounding the vehicles and arresting the women if they argue back .
Middle - aged women , foreign tourists and journalists have all been harassed , not just the young and fashionably dressed .
Individual choice
Overnight the standard of what is acceptable dress has slipped back .
I want the whole world to know that they oppress us and all we can do is put up with it
Tofiq , 15
Hard - won freedoms - like the right to wear a colourful headscarf - have been snatched away .
It may sound trivial but Iranian women have found ways of expressing their individuality and returning to drab colours like black , grey and dark blue is not something they will accept easily .
" If we want to do something we will do it anyway , all this is total nonsense , " says a young girl , heavily made up and dressed up .
She believes Islamic dress should be something personal - whether you 're swathed in a black chador or dressed in what she calls " more normal clothes " .
Interestingly many women who choose to wear the all enveloping chador agree - saying it's a personal choice and should n't be forced on people .
" This year is much worse than before because the newspapers and the TV have given the issue a lot of coverage compared to last year ; it was n't this bad before , " says Shabnam who 's out shopping with her friend .
Permission denied
At the start of every summer the police say they will enforce the Islamic dress code , but this year has been unusually harsh .
Thousands of women have been cautioned by police over their dress , some have been obliged to sign statements that they will do better in the future , and some face court cases against them .
Even shop mannequins considered " too revealing " are dealt with
Though the authorities want coverage internally to scare women - they do n't want the story broadcast abroad .
The BBC 's cameraman was detained when he tried to film the police at work and the government denied us permission to go on patrol with the police .
" Really we do n't have any security , " complains Shabam 's friend Leyla .
" Since we came out this morning many people we met have continuously warned us to be careful about our headscarves and to wear them further forward because they are arresting women who are dressed like this , " she says .
Boutique owners are furious .
Some shops have been sealed - others warned not to sell tight revealing clothing .
One shopkeeper selling evening dresses told us the moral police had ordered him to saw off the breasts of his mannequins because they were too revealing .
He said he was n't the only shop to receive this strange instruction .
Respect
There 's even been less traffic on the streets because some women are not venturing out - fearful they will be harassed .
And it 's not even safe in a car .
Taxi agencies have received a circular warning them not to carry a " bad hijabi " .
" They have said we should n't carry passengers who wear bad Islamic dress and if we do we have to warn them to respect the Islamic dress code even inside the car , " said one taxi driver .
And it 's not just women who are being targeted this year .
Young men are being cautioned for wearing short sleeved shirts or for their hairstyles .
Morad - a hairdresser whose gelled hair is made to stand straight up - says it 's necessary for him to look like this to attract customers .
" These last few days I do n't dare walk down the main roads looking like this case I get arrested , " he says .
" I use the side streets and alleys . "
Morad is scared because his friends have told him they 've seen the police seize young men and forcibly cut their hair if it 's too long .
Fifteen - year - old Tofiq who'd also gelled his hair to stand on end said he too was afraid but he was n't going to change .
" I want the whole world to know that they oppress us and all we can do is put up with it , " he said .
Some parents have complained that harassing the young over their clothing will only push them to leave the country .
But one MP has said those Iranians who cannot cope with Islamic laws should leave .
Some commentators have suggested that the government is conducting this crackdown to distract attention from the rising cost of living in Iran and increasing tension with the international community over the nuclear issue .
If so , it 's a strategy that risks alienating people who 've got used to years of relative social freedom and do not want to return to the early days of the revolution when dress rules were much more tightly enforced .
SAN JOSE , Calif . - Hershey Co. has sued a Lafayette man who admitted to making marijuana - laced candy and soft drinks , claiming his products violated the company 's trademarks .
Kenneth Affolter , 40 , was sentenced in March to more than five years in prison for manufacturing forbidden treats with names like Stoney Rancher , Rasta Reese 's and Keef Kat . [ MSNBC ]
Hershey 's suit , filed earlier this month in U.S. District Court in San Jose , accuses Affolter of trademark infringement , trademark dilution and unfair competition .
Location :
I never thought this day would come .
But when greed and idiocy converge , the effects can be catastrophic .
I 'm not an expert in trademark law , but those do n’t sound like Hershey products to me .
Unfair competition !?
To whatever pathetic extent this man actually competed with Hershey , he 's now been taken out of commission by the Drug Enforcement Administration .
If there 's anything unfair going on here , it 's the incarceration of a man who provided marijuana edibles to sick people .
So I guess Hershey Co. has nothing better to do than piss off stoners around the world , which is foolish for reasons so obvious they need not be stated .
And all they 're asking for is $ 100,000 from a man who is now either destitute due to legal fees and forfeiture , or has buried his assets so deep that neither DEA nor Hershey 's will ever see a dollar .
Suddenly those irresistible Hershey 's Cookies & Cream™ bars do n't sound so good .
If Nestle™ has a decent white chocolate product , I can cost Hershey $ 50 a year on my own .
Who 's with me ?
The stranglehold of 2 - party domination in the USA
As a voter in the USA today , you 've effectively got only 2 choices in any election .
At most .
The top two parties , the Democrats and Republicans ( modulo party name - changes that occurred during the early 1800s ) , have won every single presidential election since 1824 .
( The present names were settled on in the 1860s . )
The total combined percentage of congressmen , senators , and presidents from any party besides the top two is since the Civil War has been ( rounded off to the nearest integer ) 0 or 1 % .
There has been a generally declining trend too , since it reached peaks of around 5 % at times between 1860 and 1920 , but those days are gone .
As I write this in 2005 , there is exactly one member of the 435 - strong US House of Representatives who is not a Democrat or Republican ( Bernie Sanders ) .
And there is exactly one such member of the US Senate ( Jim Jeffords ) but he does not really count since when he was elected , he was a Republican .
( Jeffords quit the GOP while in office after a fight with Bush . )
So count him as half .
That is 1 - and - a- half non-major - party members who are senators , congressmen , and high executive branch posts , out of about 550 total , i.e. the rate is about 1 in 370 .
And since both Jeffords and Sanders are partyless , the third - party percentage is zero .
And if you think having only 2 choices is a bad marketplace , think again : really you usually only have one choice – i.e. no choice – just like a dictatorship !
Why do I say that ?
Because the system has gradually gotten more and more rigged and corrupted by , e.g. gerrymandering and big money donations preferentially to those already in office – to the point where in recent decades 98 % of the time a congressman tries to get re-elected , he succeeds .
In other words , if congressmen wanted to stay in office and managed never to die , then they would last for an average time - span of 100 years .
That is greater longetivity than has been achieved by any dictator .
Dictators like Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro can only stand in awe of US congressmen .
Update ( 2018 ) : it appears USA re-election rates are now more like 96 % , not 98 % ; and it is no longer true that death in office is more likely than defeat .
Still , this is pretty bad .
During 1951 - 2017 USA
House re-election rates always were between 85 and 99 % .
In contrast Canada during 1960 - 1995 had re-election rates always between 39 and 72 % , except for 85 % in 1993 .
India during 1965 - 1995 had re-election rates always between 40 and 85 % .
These differences are probably related to the USA having enormous gerrymandering while Canada was very nongerrymandered , and India 's appeared to be intermediate between Canadian and USA levels .
And to add insult to injury , the person in charge of the elections is usually purposefully selected to be maximally biased .
Compare that 98 % re-election rate ( which is also true for US state - house elections , at least in all the big states ) with Ireland ( 83 % ) and India ( below 50 % ) ; US House races are less competitive by a wide margin than those of any other freely elected national legislative body in the world .
In fact , US congressmen are more likely to die in office than to be defeated – same property as " kings . "
Turnover in the old Soviet Politburo exceeded that of the US congress .
To add insult to injury – the two major parties take advantage of their pre-eminence to further demean and diminish third parties :
The " commission on presidential debates " is made up solely of unelected high Democrat and Republican party officials and lets other candidates participate , or refuses to let them , at their pleasure .
" Major parties " are granted ballot slots with no effort required for most positions in most US states .
Meanwhile " minor parties " often need to surpass difficult hurdles to get on the ballot .
( That way , even on the fairly rare occasions when one of the major parties does not run a candidate , the third parties are still safely shut out . )
Such as signatures by three percent of all the registered voters in Florida , an enormous requirement upheld by a court in 1994 ; meanwhile the Democrats and Republicans required zero signatures due to the their major - party status .
" The Law of France is impartial : it is illegal for both the rich and the poor to sleep under bridges . "
Richard Winger , editor of Ballot Access News , reports that Georgia in 1943 enacted an even higher hurdle : new party and independent candidates must submit a petition signed by 5 % of the number of registered voters in order to get on the ballot for any office !
Previously , any party could get on the ballot just by requesting it .
The result has been that since 1943 , there have been zero third - party candidates on the Georgia ballot for U.S. House of Representatives .
Arkansas and West Virginia have even more outrageous ballot access laws .
The Libertarian Party in 2000 raised $ 2.6 million for its presidential campaign , and had to spend $ 250,000 just trying to get on the ballot in Pennsylvania and Arizona alone .
Here 's a quick survey of ridiculous US state ballot access laws .
( Libertarian 2 - time US Presidential candidate ) Harry Browne reports : in my home state of Tennessee , Republicans and Democrats are listed on the ballot with their party labels .
But candidates of any other parties must be listed as " Independent . "
Thus anyone entering the polling booth determined to vote against the two major parties must know already which third - party candidate to vote for .
If he does n't , he 'll be afraid to choose among the " Independents , " not knowing which of them might be a Nazi or Communist .
For a similar pathology , consider the Ohio 2006 Governor race .
Donation size limits , e.g. a $ 2000 limit , can work against third parties who otherwise , e.g. could get a big boost from a wealthy philanthropist .
( The only way around that is if their candidate himself is a zillionaire . )
Similarly , government campaign subsidy laws often are written in such a way that only the major party candidates can take advantage of the taxpayer - funded pot .
( Former Libertarian US Presidential Candidate ) Harry Browne reports :
The $ 2,000 - per- person donation limit works to the advantage of Republicans and Democrats .
They can promise large governmental benefits to industry leaders , who in exchange will promise to collect large numbers of $ 2,000 donations for the candidates .
We have nothing similar to offer , and so we have to raise the money one person at a time .

" There are thousands of names , tens of thousands of phone numbers , and there are people there at the Pentagon , lobbyists , others at the White House , prominent lawyers — a long , long list , and as well , the women who work for the service , David , include university professors , legal secretaries , scientists , military officers . "
Although after six years of Bush - rule nothing shocks me , this scandal has the potential to take down a lot of prominent people , and this is just the beginning .
By refusing to accept the plea bargain offered to her , Jeane Palfrey is going to trial and naming names .
Could this be the call service that " Dusty " Foggo was allegedly getting his party favors from ?
Which White House employees are involved ?
Which Pentagon officials , lobbyists and prominent lawyers are we talking about here ?
If Bill Clinton 's impeachment taught us anything , it's that the American people have an insatiable appetite for sex scandals .
Ca n't wait to see where this one goes .
And how ironic is it that the man charged with combating worldwide prostitution just resigned because of his fetish for prostitutes ?
Perhaps overcome with excitement ( and forgetting that Apple does n't like such pre-emptive disclosures ) , Sun 's Jonathan Schwartz announced today at Sun event in Washington D.C. that Apple would be making ZFS " the file system " in Mac OS 10.5 Leopard ( video link , requires RealPlayer ) .
In fact , this week you 'll see that Apple is announcing at their Worldwide Developer Conference that ZFS has become the file system in Mac OS 10 .
Rumors of Apple 's interest in ZFS began in April 2006 , when an OpenSolaris mailing list revealed that Apple had contacted Sun regarding porting ZFS to OS 10 .
The file system later began making appearances in Leopard builds .
ZFS has a long list of improvements over Apple 's current file system , Journaled HFS +.
More information on ZFS is available at the ZFS homepage and Wikipedia .
For live coverage of WWDC ( text and photos ) , you know where to turn .
I see them EVERYWHERE !!
But beside the facts that THEY GOT MARRIED and have a gaggle of kids , the juicy details on their relationship are nowhere to found .
Does he love her ?
Does she love him ?
Is she a wild child or is she really as intellectual as her spectacles suggest ?
Is she styling her hair now to make her look less dudelike ?
He 's an idiot , is n't he ?
Or is he a smart jock ?
Did he accept a challenge to turn her into prom queen ?
Did he win ?
Is that how their love bloomed ?
Does he still have that V - cut shirt ?
Why does he part his hair so far over ?
Do their kids know how famous their folks are ?
Are they kinda pissed that the ad describes their beautiful union in such an incredulous manner ?
With a question mark AND an exclamation point ?!
Are they getting a cut of some serious Classmates.com dough , because they 're undoubtedly the official faces of the brand ?
Have they leveraged that fame into any kind of book , TV or movie deals ?
You know what ?
How bout their names ?
I just want to know their names !!!!** Until then , their fake names will be Piper and Axl .
Someone just sent me this .
Now with 2 exclamation points and 2 question marks !!??
How far can they go ?!?!?!?!
Ohhhh , you can't fool me Sam From The Classmates Member Care Team !!
Piper and Axl are real !!
Real I tell you !!
In real life and in people 's hearts !
You can't " act " or " employee " true love like that !
What ?
Are their 7 kids all acting as well ?
The search continues ... Man , the internet is like magic .
I love it .
Allegedly , there could be a 20 - year age gap between these lovebirds !!
Just think , if we can somehow find Piper and Axl and have them somehow meet , it could be just like the end of Sleepless in Seattle .
It would just click .
Or something .
Anyway , here 's the latest possible 411 ( according to comments ) :
Her real name may be Susan ; maybe married to Edward and graduated in 1979 Could have gone to Wall High School in NJ and graduated in 2001 OR could have gone to Georgetown District High School in Georgetown , Ontario , Canada and graduated around 1998 or 1999 ( insert Journey 's " Do n't Stop Believin " here ) PIPER / AXL UPDATE 4:SLUT !!!!
SOMEONE OWES EVERYONE AN EXPLANATION !!!
NOOOOOOO !!!!
HE LOVED YOU , PIPER !!!
AND GAVE YOU 7 KIDS !!!
AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY HIM ????
WTFFFFFFFFF !!!( I hope the number of F's properly portrays my disgust at this unsettling discovery .
I 'm going to take a couple of Advils and just lie down and watch Oprah .
GOD NO !!
LOOK WHAT THIS HAS DONE TO ME !!)
PIPER / AXL UPDATE 5 : Well well ... look who just went and TRADED UP BIG TIME !!!

I 'm no physicist , but the combination of the heat of the hair dryer with the extreme cold of the compressed air ( turned upside down ) looks like it can cause the dent to expand and contract quickly enough that it pops back to its original shape .
I can't verify how well this works ( the video offers some proof ) , but if the dent 's there and you 've got nothing to lose , it 's worth a try .
If you 've got a more cogent explanation for why this works than what I 've offered , enlighten us in the comments .
Thanks Joe !

Analyses of a national sample of individuals with alcohol dependence ( alcoholism ) reveal five distinct subtypes of the disease , according to a new study by scientists at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ( NIAAA ) , part of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
" Our findings should help dispel the popular notion of the ' typical alcoholic , ' " notes first author Howard B. Moss , M.D. , NIAAA Associate Director for Clinical and Translational Research .
" We find that young adults comprise the largest group of alcoholics in this country , and nearly 20 percent of alcoholics are highly functional and well - educated with good incomes .
More than half of the alcoholics in the United States have no multigenerational family history of the disease , suggesting that their form of alcoholism was unlikely to have genetic causes . "
" Clinicians have long recognized diverse manifestations of alcoholism , " adds NIAAA Director Ting - Kai Li , M.D , " and researchers have tried to understand why some alcoholics improve with specific medications and psychotherapies while others do not .
The classification system described in this study will have broad application in both clinical and research settings . "
A report of the study is now available online in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence .
Previous efforts to identify alcoholism subtypes focused primarily on individuals who were hospitalized or otherwise receiving treatment for their alcoholism .
However , recent reports from NIAAA 's National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ( NESARC ) , a nationally representative epidemiological study of alcohol , drug , and mental disorders in the United States , suggest that only about one - fourth of individuals with alcoholism have ever received treatment .
Thus , a substantial proportion of people with alcoholism were not represented in the samples previously used to define subtypes of this disease .
In the current study , Dr. Moss and colleagues applied advanced statistical methods to data from the NESARC .
Their analyses focused on the 1,484 NESARC survey respondents who met diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence , and included individuals in treatment as well as those not seeking treatment .
The researchers identified unique subtypes of alcoholism based on respondents ' family history of alcoholism , age of onset of regular drinking and alcohol problems , symptom patterns of alcohol dependence and abuse , and the presence of additional substance abuse and mental disorders :
Young Adult subtype : 31.5 percent of U.S. alcoholics .
Young adult drinkers , with relatively low rates of co-occurring substance abuse and other mental disorders , a low rate of family alcoholism , and who rarely seek any kind of help for their drinking .
Young Antisocial subtype : 21 percent of U.S. alcoholics .
Tend to be in their mid-twenties , had early onset of regular drinking , and alcohol problems .
More than half come from families with alcoholism , and about half have a psychiatric diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder .
Many have major depression , bipolar disorder , and anxiety problems .
More than 75 percent smoked cigarettes and marijuana , and many also had cocaine and opiate addictions .
More than one - third of these alcoholics seek help for their drinking .
Functional subtype : 19.5 percent of U.S. alcoholics .
Typically middle - aged , well - educated , with stable jobs and families .
About one - third have a multigenerational family history of alcoholism , about one - quarter had major depressive illness sometime in their lives , and nearly 50 percent were smokers .
Intermediate Familial subtype : 19 percent of U.S. alcoholics .
Middle - aged , with about 50 percent from families with multigenerational alcoholism .
Almost half have had clinical depression , and 20 percent have had bipolar disorder .
Most of these individuals smoked cigarettes , and nearly one in five had problems with cocaine and marijuana use .
Only 25 percent ever sought treatment for their problem drinking .
Chronic Severe subtype : 9 percent of U.S. alcoholics .
Comprised mostly of middle - aged individuals who had early onset of drinking and alcohol problems , with high rates of Antisocial Personality Disorder and criminality .
Almost 80 percent come from families with multigenerational alcoholism .
They have the highest rates of other psychiatric disorders including depression , bipolar disorder , and anxiety disorders as well as high rates of smoking , and marijuana , cocaine , and opiate dependence .
Two - thirds of these alcoholics seek help for their drinking problems , making them the most prevalent type of alcoholic in treatment .
The authors also report that co-occurring psychiatric and other substance abuse problems are associated with severity of alcoholism and entering into treatment .
Attending Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12 - step programs is the most common form of help - seeking for drinking problems , but help - seeking remains relatively rare .

Amazon could be the next major name to dive into the world of unprotected music sales .
Various rumors have been picking up over the past couple of weeks that the online retailer was readying itself to launch an MP3 download store in May , which some see as one of the only retailers that will be able to truly challenge Apple 's ubiquitous iTunes Store .
According to a report in the UK's Times Online , Amazon has approached " all the music majors in the past fortnight " in order to launch its MP3 store in May but may have some trouble meeting its own deadline .
Apple plans to start selling DRM - free music from EMI in May through its own music store , which could be the cause for Amazon 's rush .
The report speculates that if the Internet giant is successful in launching on time , it may initially launch with unprotected music from EMI as well .
Initial reports about Amazon 's MP3 store came from Billboard , saying that that Universal Music Group had partnered with Amazon to sell unprotected music , mostly in the form of classical tracks .
Such a move would be crucial to DRM - free music sales , as Universal currently holds the top position among all music labels and would send a strong message to labels who are nervous about following EMI 's lead .
" If Universal goes [ DRM - free ] , then everyone has to follow , " an anonymous music executive told Reuters on Friday .
However , today 's report in the Times debunks the speculation about Universal as " wide off the mark . "
Even if Amazon does manage to launch its unprotected music store with Universal 's blessing , it will still have to fight to keep up with Apple .
Apple has begun contract renegotiations with various major record labels that will extend into the summer , and industry execs told Reuters that Apple now has the upper hand in pressuring them to go DRM - free due to the company 's position in the market .
While the labels may keep a strict poker face to the public on the topic of DRM , in private , an industry source hinted that following EMI into DRM - free waters is " only a matter of time . "
PowerPoint : shot with its own bullets
Imagine a world with almost no pronouns or punctuation .
A world where any complex thought must be broken into seven - word chunks , with colorful blobs between them .
It sounds like the futuristic dystopia of Kurt Vonnegut 's short story Harrison Bergeron , in which intelligent citizens receive ear - splitting broadcasts over headsets so that they cannot gain an unfair advantage over their less intelligent peers .
But this world is no fiction -- it is the present - day reality of a PowerPoint presentation , a reality that is repeated an estimated 30 million times a day . [ 5 ]
Stanford University 's Cliff Nass was quoted in the New Yorker [ 1 ] saying that PowerPoint " lifts the floor " ; it allows some main points to come across even if the speaker mumbles , forgets , or is otherwise grossly incompetent .
But PowerPoint also " lowers the ceiling " ; it makes it harder to have an open exchange between presenter and audience , to convey ideas that do not neatly fit into outline format , or to have a truly inspiring presentation .
This is what I was getting at when I created the Gettysburg PowerPoint presentation ( figure ) , [ 2 ] a parody that has been viewed by hundreds of thousands of frustrated PowerPoint sufferers .
I used PowerPoint 's AutoContent Wizard ( which Parker [ 1 ] calls " a rare example of a product named in outright mockery of its target customers " ) , adding only the slide " Not on Agenda ! " to the standard format .
Nobody should be surprised that PowerPoint does not measure up to the great speeches of history , such as Lincoln 's Gettysburg address .
And it is certainly a shame when a potentially interesting presentation is dumbed down by another formulaic over - application of PowerPoint .
But when PowerPoint leads not just to boredom but to bad decisions , it is a tragedy , not just a shame .
For an example of excellent decision - making without PowerPoint , consider the agenda of Apollo programme - manager George Low , on Aug 9 , 1968 .
[3 ]
At 0845 , Low met with Houston center - director Robert Gilruth to recommend that the Apollo 8 mission attempt a lunar orbit , an ambitious change from previous plans .
Gilruth agreed .
At 0900 , Low met with flight - director Chris Kraft , who verified the technical feasibility .
At 0930 Low , Gilruth , and Kraft agreed to present the idea to Werner von Braun .
They flew to Huntsville to meet von Braun and others at 1430 that afternoon .
The lunar orbit plan was tentatively approved that day .
Just 4 months later , Apollo 8 orbited the moon , sending back the first photograph of an Earthrise over another world .
Think what Low accomplished in the time that many present - day beaurocrats take to select their fonts and backgrounds .
He achieved consensus on a billion - dollar decision about one of the most complex engineering projects of all time , with enormous implications for national security .
PowerPoint cannot help you do that .
In current - day NASA , the need to cram complex facts into PowerPoint 's limited format may have contributed to poor decisions in the Columbia tragedy , according to a recent essay by the graphic designer , Edward Tufte . [ 4 ]
Tufte points out that the limited resolution of PowerPoint slides makes it impossible to fit complex charts and graphs , or even full English sentences .
As a result the intended meaning of a presentation may be obscured .
How can you make informed decisions like George Low's ?
The key seems to be to gather experts who are knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter , and have them cooperatively discuss a series of questions designed to explore the limits of technical feasibility .
They must strive to reach the best decision rather than to persuade each other .
The Chicago Tribune [ 5 ] quotes Sherry Turkle , from Massachusetts Institute of Technology : " a strong [ PowerPoint ] presentation is designed to close down debate , not open it up "
Design your presentations and your meetings to take advantage of the people gathered there , not to bore them .
If everyone has set their remarks in stone ahead of time ( all using the same templates ) then there is little room for the comments of one to build on another , or for a new idea to arise collaboratively from the meeting .
Homogeneity is great for milk , but not for ideas .
Use visual aids to convey visual information : photographs , charts , or diagrams .
But do not use them to give the impression that the matter is solved , wrapped up in a few bullet points .

I admit , it ’s a provocative headline .
But it ’s true .
Article Continues Below
However compelling the message , however great the copy , however strong the sales argument … the way a page is designed will have a dramatic impact on conversion rates , for better or for worse .
Before I go any further , I want you to look at three versions of the same offer page :
I know , they wo n’t win any design awards .
They were n’t intended to .
But they are functional and familiar .
A reader going to any one of these pages will be able to quickly figure out what the message is , and what they are being asked to do .
Version A is the original .
Version B follows the same basic layout , but we made some minor copy changes .
In version C , we changed from a one - column format to two - column format .
We wanted to test the impact of bringing more of the page content onto the first screen .
Be honest with yourself and decide now whether B or C beat A , and by what percentage # section2
Do n’t scroll down and look for the answer .
You ’re a designer , an expert in web design .
So put your money where your credentials are and write down some figures now .
Write down a percentage by which B did better or worse than A .
And a percentage by which C did better or worse than A .
The design choices you make have a profound impact on results #section3
I imagine you have some way of measuring the success of your site .
Maybe it ’s about sales .
Maybe it ’s based on readership .
But one way or another , your site has a purpose .
But I do n’t think most designers truly understand the effect their design choices can have on achieving that purpose .
And yes , I ’m sure you do some usability testing .
And that likely gives you some broad , if sometimes confusing insights into what ’s working and what is n’t .
But do you test different page designs ?
#section4
By testing , I do n’t mean asking a few folks around the office ; I mean doing a live test that demonstrates — with hard figures — what site visitors actually do .
Testing like that is a beautiful thing .
There is no space for fancy arguments .
An expert ’s credentials and opinions mean squat .
When you serve alternative versions , one after the other , and measure reader actions , you get the real deal .
You get what is .
Do you do that ?
It ’s a scary thing .
But if you are serious about achieving your site ’s purpose , and if testing can show you which version of a page does best , then where is the argument not to test ?
Here ’s how design choice can make a difference #section5
Here are just a few of the design elements we have found can make a significant difference to the performance of a web page :
The position and color of the primary call to action
Position on the page of testimonials , if used
Whether linked elements are in text or as images
The amount of “ white space ” on a page , giving the content space to “ breathe ”
The position and prominence of the main heading
The number of columns used on the page
The number of visual elements competing for attention
The age , sex and appearance of someone in a photo
OK … now for the results of the test .
A /B/C Split Test Page A Page B Page C Percent of traffic 34 % 33 % 33 % New sales 244 282 114 Change N/ A 15.57 % - 53.28 %
Version B , with the minor copy changes , resulted in a 15.57 % increase in sales — that represents a big revenue jump for a site with high sales volumes .
Version C , in which we changed the regular , one - column format into a two - column format , resulted in 53.28 % fewer sales .
That ’s an astonishing reduction in sales and revenues , resulting from a design change that was intended to improve the performance of the page .
Now , just pause for a moment and think of all the design choices you have made over the last year , and the reasons why you made them .
And think about the huge impact those choices might have had on the performance of the sites you worked on .
Some concluding thoughts … #section6
The figures from this test are shocking .
But they are not exceptional .
Design changes really do have a huge impact on conversion rates .
Here are a few things to consider :
If you have some pages on a site which are critical to its overall success , instigate a program of A/B split testing .
You can not afford to guess ; you have to know .
Be aware that however strong the copy and text on a page , its performance is very much dependent on the way in which it is presented .
In other words , design choices can enhance or diminish the power of the words .
Talk with your writers .
Ask them how they think the message would best be presented .
Then test some different versions .
A good writer should have some strong instincts when it comes to the layout of the text .
One way or another , it ’s important to accept that none of us — neither designers nor writers — know what the “ best ” page design or copy is until we test .
In a business environment where marketers demand an accountable performance from every web page , it ’s time to put aside the assumed expertise of design and copy “ gurus . ”
The way forward is to test , and let our readers show us which designs work best , and which copy works best .
While this may be uncomfortable for some , the end result is that we will become much better web designers and writers .
Filesystems ( ext3 , reiser , xfs , jfs ) comparison on Debian Etch
Posted by hansivers on Fri 21 Apr 2006 at 11:10
There are a lot of Linux filesystems comparisons available but most of them are anecdotal , based on artificial tasks or completed under older kernels .
This benchmark essay is based on 11 real - world tasks appropriate for a file server with older generation hardware ( Pentium II / III , EIDE hard - drive ) .
Since its initial publication , this article has generated a lot of questions , comments and suggestions to improve it .
Consequently , I 'm currently working hard on a new batch of tests to answer as many questions as possible ( within the original scope of the article ) .
Results will be available in about two weeks ( May 8 , 2006 ) Many thanks for your interest and keep in touch with Debian - Administration.org !

Why another benchmark test ?
I found two quantitative and reproductible benchmark testing studies using the 2.6.x kernel ( see References ) .
Benoit ( 2003 ) implemented 12 tests using large files ( 1+ GB ) on a Pentium II 500 server with 512MB RAM .
This test was quite informative but results are beginning to aged ( kernel 2.6.0 ) and mostly applied to settings which manipulate exclusively large files ( e.g. , multimedia , scientific , databases ) .
Piszcz ( 2006 ) implemented 21 tasks simulating a variety of file operations on a PIII - 500 with 768MB RAM and a 400 GB EIDE - 133 hard disk .
To date , this testing appears to be the most comprehensive work on the 2.6 kernel .
However , since many tasks were " artificial " ( e.g. , copying and removing 10 000 empty directories , touching 10 000 files , splitting files recursively ) , it may be difficult to transfer some conclusions to real - world settings .
Thus , the objective of the present benchmark testing is to complete some Piszcz ( 2006 ) conclusions , by focusing exclusively on real - world operations found in small - business file servers ( see Tasks description ) .
Test settings
Hardware
Processor : Intel Celeron 533
RAM : 512MB RAM PC100
Motherboard : ASUS P2B
Hard drive : WD Caviar SE 160GB ( EIDE 100 , 7200 RPM , 8MB Cache )
Controller : ATA /133 PCI ( Silicon Image )
OS
Debian Etch ( kernel 2.6.15 ) , distribution upgraded on April 18 , 2006
All optional daemons killed ( cron , ssh , saMBa , etc . )
Filesystems
Ext3 ( e2fsprogs 1.38 )
ReiserFS ( reiserfsprogs 1.3.6.19 )
JFS ( jfsutils 1.1.8 )
XFS ( xfsprogs 2.7.14 )
Description of selected tasks
Operations on a large file ( ISO image , 700MB )
Copy ISO from a second disk to the test disk
Recopy ISO in another location on the test disk
Remove both copies of ISO
Operations on a file tree ( 7500 files , 900 directories , 1.9GB )
Copy file tree from a second disk to the test disk
Recopy file tree in another location on the test disk
Remove both copies of file tree
Operations into the file tree
List recursively all contents of the file tree and save it on the test disk
Find files matching a specific wildcard into the file tree
Operations on the file system
Creation of the filesystem ( mkfs ) ( all FS were created with default values )
Mount filesystem
Umount filesystem
The sequence of 11 tasks ( from creation of FS to umounting FS ) was run as a Bash script which was completed three times ( the average is reported ) .
Each sequence takes about 7 min .
Time to complete task ( in secs ) , percentage of CPU dedicated to task and number of major / minor page faults during task were computed by the GNU time utility ( version 1.7 ) .
RESULTS
Partition capacity
Initial ( after filesystem creation ) and residual ( after removal of all files ) partition capacity was computed as the ratio of number of available blocks by number of blocks on the partition .
Ext3 has the worst inital capacity ( 92.77 % ) , while others FS preserve almost full partition capacity ( ReiserFS = 99.83 % , JFS = 99.82 % , XFS = 99.95 % ) .
Interestingly , the residual capacity of Ext3 and ReiserFS was identical to the initial , while JFS and XFS lost about 0.02 % of their partition capacity , suggesting that these FS can dynamically grow but do not completely return to their inital state ( and size ) after file removal .
Conclusion :
To use the maximum of your partition capacity , choose ReiserFS , JFS or XFS .
File system creation , mounting and unmounting
The creation of FS on the 20 GB test partition took 14.7 secs for Ext3 , compared to 2 secs or less for other FS ( ReiserFS = 2.2 , JFS = 1.3 , XFS = 0.7 ) .
However , the ReiserFS took 5 to 15 times longer to mount the FS ( 2.3 secs ) when compared to other FS ( Ext3 = 0.2 , JFS = 0.2 , XFS = 0.5 ) , and also 2 times longer to umount the FS ( 0.4 sec ) .
All FS took comparable amounts of CPU to create FS ( between 59 % - ReiserFS and 74 % - JFS ) and to mount FS ( between 6 and 9 % ) .
However , Ex3 and XFS took about 2 times more CPU to umount ( 37 % and 45 % ) , compared to ReiserFS and JFS ( 14 % and 27 % ) .
Conclusion :
For quick FS creation and mounting / unmounting , choose JFS or XFS .
Operations on a large file ( ISO image , 700MB )
The initial copy of the large file took longer on Ext3 ( 38.2 secs ) and ReiserFS ( 41.8 ) when compared to JFS and XFS ( 35.1 and 34.8 ) .
The recopy on the same disk advantaged the XFS ( 33.1 secs ) , when compared to other FS ( Ext3 = 37.3 , JFS = 39.4 , ReiserFS = 43.9 ) .
The ISO removal was about 100 times faster on JFS and XFS ( 0.02 sec for both ) , compared to 1.5 sec for ReiserFS and 2.5 sec for Ext3 !
All FS took comparable amounts of CPU to copy ( between 46 and 51 % ) and to recopy ISO ( between 38 % to 50 % ) .
The ReiserFS used 49 % of CPU to remove ISO , when other FS used about 10 % .
There was a clear trend of JFS to use less CPU than any other FS ( about 5 to 10 % less ) .
The number of minor page faults was quite similar between FS ( ranging from 600 - XFS to 661 - ReiserFS ) .
Conclusion :
For quick operations on large files , choose JFS or XFS .
If you need to minimize CPU usage , prefer JFS .
Operations on a file tree ( 7500 files , 900 directories , 1.9GB )
The initial copy of the tree was quicker for Ext3 ( 158.3 secs ) and XFS ( 166.1 ) when compared to ReiserFS and JFS ( 172.1 and 180.1 ) .
Similar results were observed during the recopy on the same disk , which advantaged the Ext3 ( 120 secs ) compared to other FS ( XFS = 135.2 , ReiserFS = 136.9 and JFS = 151 ) .
However , the tree removal was about 2 times longer for Ext3 ( 22 secs ) when compared to ReiserFS ( 8.2 secs ) , XFS ( 10.5 secs ) and JFS ( 12.5 secs ) !
All FS took comparable amounts of CPU to copy ( between 27 and 36 % ) and to recopy the file tree ( between 29 % - JFS and 45 % - ReiserFS ) .
Surprisingly , the ReiserFS and the XFS used significantly more CPU to remove file tree ( 86 % and 65 % ) when other FS used about 15 % ( Ext3 and JFS ) .
Again , there was a clear trend of JFS to use less CPU than any other FS .
The number of minor page faults was significantly higher for ReiserFS ( total = 5843 ) when compared to other FS ( 1400 to 1490 ) .
This difference appears to come from a higher rate ( 5 to 20 times ) of page faults for ReiserFS in recopy and removal of file tree .
Conclusion :
For quick operations on large file tree , choose Ext3 or XFS .
Benchmarks from other authors have supported the use of ReiserFS for operations on large number of small files .
However , the present results on a tree comprising thousands of files of various size ( 10 KB to 5 MB ) suggest than Ext3 or XFS may be more appropriate for real - world file server operations .
Even if JFS minimize CPU usage , it should be noted that this FS comes with significantly higher latency for large file tree operations .
Directory listing and file search into the previous file tree
The complete ( recursive ) directory listing of the tree was quicker for ReiserFS ( 1.4 secs ) and XFS ( 1.8 ) when compared to Ext3 and JFS ( 2.5 and 3.1 ) .
Similar results were observed during the file search , where ReiserFS ( 0.8 sec ) and XFS ( 2.8 ) yielded quicker results compared to Ext3 ( 4.6 secs ) and JFS ( 5 secs ) .
Ext3 and JFS took comparable amounts of CPU for directory listing ( 35 % ) and file search ( 6 % ) .
XFS took more CPU for directory listing ( 70 % ) but comparable amount for file search ( 10 % ) .
ReiserFS appears to be the most CPU - intensive FS , with 71 % for directory listing and 36 % for file search .
Again , the number of minor page faults was 3 times higher for ReiserFS ( total = 1991 ) when compared to other FS ( 704 to 712 ) .
Conclusion : Results suggest that , for these tasks , filesystems can be regrouped as ( a ) quick and more CPU - intensive ( ReiserFS and XFS ) or ( b ) slower but less CPU - intensive ( ext3 and JFS ) .
XFS appears as a good compromise , with relatively quick results , moderate usage of CPU and acceptable rate of page faults .
OVERALL CONCLUSION
These results replicate previous observations from Piszcz ( 2006 ) about reduced disk capacity of Ext3 , longer mount time of ReiserFS and longer FS creation of Ext3 .
Moreover , like this report , both reviews have observed that JFS is the lowest CPU - usage FS .
Finally , this report appeared to be the first to show the high page faults activity of ReiserFS on most usual file operations .
While recognizing the relative merits of each filesystem , only one filesystem can be install for each partition / disk .
Based on all testing done for this benchmark essay , XFS appears to be the most appropriate filesystem to install on a file server for home or small - business needs :
It uses the maximum capacity of your server hard disk (s )
It is the quickest FS to create , mount and unmount
It is the quickest FS for operations on large files ( > 500 MB )
This FS gets a good second place for operations on a large number of small to moderate - size files and directories
It constitutes a good CPU vs time compromise for large directory listing or file search
It is not the least CPU demanding FS but its use of system ressources is quite acceptable for older generation hardware
While Piszcz ( 2006 ) did not explicitly recommand XFS , he concludes that " Personally , I still choose XFS for filesystem performance and scalability " .
I can only support this conclusion .

Shadowfast was my very first car .
My earliest adventures with him took place during high school , my last during a break from college .
In his final form Shadowfast was an amazing machine , capable of matching or surpassing almost any other street - drivable car on the road -- and off .
Drag strip , interstate , winding mountain road -- you name it , he did it .
And that was just his racing credentials .

In the accounts below details like names , dates , and more have been changed for reasons which should become apparent to readers .
I also include a partial list of the actual events from which these stories are drawn for those who are interested .
At times it seems as though we ’ve gone back in a time machine to the darkest , sub - zero days of the Cold War era , when Americans were frantically digging bomb shelters in their back yards , Godless Communism was on the march , and the jackboots of the KGB were just inches away from our waiting necks .
Tony Blair , lecturing the Russian leader at the G - 8 meeting , opined that the Western world , on behalf of which he presumed to speak , is " becoming worried , fearful about what was happening in Russia today , the external policy . "
These remarks echoed Dick Cheney ’s sally last year against Russia ’s alleged attempt to use oil and gas as " tools of intimidation or blackmail , either by supply manipulation or attempts to monopolize transportation . "
That was said in response to Russia ’s threat to raise the price of energy previously sold at subsidized Soviet - era rates to Ukraine  a capitalistic act that was a bit too radical for the supposedly pro-free - market Cheney .
The Brits ’ beef with Putin also has to do with oil and gas .
The Russian seizure of British oil assets in Siberia is being cited by free - market types as evidence that Putin is moving toward " corporatism , " but is this any more " corporatist " than legislation currently on the books in the U.S. that forbids foreign ownership of key industries such as airlines and telecommunications ?
The hypocrisy is breathtaking .
Who can forget the Dubai port - management brouhaha , when Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike demagogued the issue to score political points by conjuring the alleged threat posed by a Middle Eastern - based company having anything to do with maintaining our  rapidly decaying  " vital " infrastructure ?
The Dubai episode inaugurated a crackdown by U.S. regulators and inspired a host of economically disastrous yet politically popular measures in Congress that confirm " corporatism " is on the march in Washington at least as much as it is in Moscow .
Remember when Chinese investors sought to buy out the oil company Unocal ?
The uproar was deafening , and the deal was scotched .
So it turns out that British Petroleum is no more badly treated in Russia than Chinese - owned CNOOC Ltd. is in the U.S.  which , come to think of it , is perhaps why the Brits are so irked .
According to the mainstream news media ’s pampered pet pundits , Russian President Vladimir Putin is the reincarnation of Josef Stalin , and Russia under his rule is rapidly " backsliding " into " authoritarianism . "
According to Andrei Illarionov , a former economic adviser to Putin and now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , the resurgent Russian military is about to take out its neighbors and seal a reestablished Warsaw Pact in the blood of Georgian , Ukrainian , and possibly even Polish innocents .
The British , in particular , have been hyping this " new Cold War " narrative for all it ’s worth  which , when it comes right down to it , is n’t very much .
Is Russia embarked on a return to authoritarianism ?
The answer has to be an unequivocal no .
After all , Putin has not closed down a single Russian " dissident " media outlet  instead , like their counterparts in the U.S. , Russian media barons , at the head of vast corporate conglomerates , have bought up the major television networks and newspapers and imposed a Fox News - like unanimity on correspondents and pundits alike .
While this may make for boring television and patently predictable punditry , it does n’t make Russia a fascist state , as all too many people who ought to know better are trying to imply .
I had to laugh when I heard the thrilling news that " hundreds of people " marched through the streets of St. Petersburg recently to protest Putin ’s supposedly repressive regime .
This was one of a series of " dissidents ’ marches " being held by the " opposition "  a seriocomic coalition of chess champion Gary Kasparov and neo-fascist crackpot Eduard Limonov .
Hundreds , eh?
Hundreds of thousands of antiwar marchers over the years protesting America ’s policy in Iraq have failed to garner as much publicity as this little band did in record time  now is n’t that odd ?
Odder still is the nature of the " opposition " itself : Limonov is a punk - rock skinhead " idol " and sometime novelist whose crazed views are best summed up by his National Bolshevik Party ’s graphic incorporation of Soviet and Nazi symbols to create the single most repulsive party emblem in all of recorded history .
Kasparov , aside from his well - known exploits in the game of chess , is a pawn of American neoconservatives : his real constituency is n’t in Russia , where he remains an obscure political figure , but in Washington , D.C. , where he stands amid such neocon luminaries as Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , and James Woolsey as a member of the Center for Security Policy .
The Center is a major neocon propaganda outfit headed by longtime neocon activist Frank Gaffney , whose name is virtually synonymous with the military - industrial complex .
Kasparov served on the Center ’s National Security Advisory Council along with Woolsey .
The neocons , by the way , are deeply committed to the Chechen cause and have been in the vanguard of the movement to demonize Putin as a latter - day Stalin : the list of endorsers of the American Committee for Peace in Chechnya replicates the seating arrangements at the front table at an American Enterprise Institute awards dinner .
It was Richard Perle , you ’ll recall , who averred that Russia ought to be expelled from the G - 8 on account of Mikhail Khodorkovsky ‘s arrest for crimes ranging from embezzlement to conspiracy to commit murder .
The neocons have allied themselves with the Russian oligarchs , who amassed fantastic wealth in post - communist Russia by means that might meet the approval of Tony Soprano , not the Better Business Bureau .
These oligarchs seethe at their expulsion as they plot from abroad to return the country to their clutches .
For years now , an unsavory popular front of Chechen terrorists , neoconservative hawks , and shady Russian oligarchs wearing Moss Lipow dark sunglasses and gobs of gold chains has massed at the gates of Moscow , demanding the ouster of the czar  and the clamor has now been taken up by Western governments .
" It would be funny if it was n’t so sad " was Putin ’s response to the U.S. insistence that Poland and Czechoslovakia put anti-missile technology in place in order to guard against the supposed " threat " from an attack launched by Iran .
The joke is that the Iranians do n’t have missiles that can reach either Warsaw or Prague .
To pretend that these anti-missile systems are aimed at an " enemy " other than Russia is the measure of the West ’s disdain for Putin : like a schoolyard bully who " accidentally " shoves his victims on the playground , they do n’t even bother to convincingly conceal their belligerence .
Putin ’s counterproposal to help set up a missile - interception system in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan is a deft deflection of Western claims that Putin poses a renewed Russian threat to the security of Europe .
If the U.S. and Britain are genuinely concerned about a possible Iranian strike at the former Eastern bloc , then they ’ll sign on to Putin ’s generous offer .
Their hesitation , one has to conclude , speaks volumes about their real motives for putting up the missile shield in the first place .
Just as the demonstrators in the streets of Russian cities are seemingly intent on provoking the Russian police into a violent response , so the Western powers  alarmed at the rise of Putin on the world stage as the Americans ’ chief antagonist and most eloquent critic  are engaged in a series of large - scale provocations , including but not limited to the Eastern European missile shield .
Another irritant to Russia ’s increasingly fractious relations with the West is the issue of Kosovo ’s independence .
Again , the Western love of double standards comes into play here , with Kosovo ’s alleged " right " to nationhood being upheld by an American president while the corresponding " right " of Russian - speaking ( or pro-Russian ) areas of the former Soviet Union , such as Abkhazia and the Transdniester Republic , to independence goes unrecognized by the West .
The real evidence , however , of just how badly relations between Russia and the West have deteriorated is the strange case of Alexander Litvinenko and the mystery surrounding his death .
Having covered this subject at length in previous columns , I wo n’t elaborate on the arcane technical and other details of this downright weird episode , which seems like a story straight out of a Hollywood thriller , except to say that the " official " version of how Litvinenko came to be poisoned by a rare radioactive substance , polonium - 210 , stinks to high heaven .
This narrative , which holds that Litvinenko was targeted by the KGB because of his alleged status as a Russian " dissident " living in exile in London , does n’t hold up under even the most forgiving scrutiny .
After all , why kill him with a rare and easily traced substance  and with such an overdose that the cost alone would seem to rule out this method  when a simple shot in the back of the head would suffice ?
The sheer amount of disinformation and propagandistic nonsense dished out by the British tabloids alone on the subject probably consumed enough paper to deforest half of South America .
Nor is the British indictment of Andrei Lugovoi enough to paper over the huge holes in the " official " story .
Lugovoi , at any rate , is fighting back , with revelations that the Brits and Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky tried to recruit him to root out the dirt on Putin .
In any case , the Litvinenko affair emanates the aura of a gigantic , somewhat sinister scam , perhaps involving the smuggling of polonium and the involvement of Islamic terrorist cells associated with the Chechens .
What ought to worry us is that someone was possibly trying to assemble a " dirty bomb " of the type Jose Padilla was accused of masterminding  in the heart of London .
There seems little doubt the color - coded " revolutions , " with Western material and moral support , targeted the former Soviet " near abroad " and aimed at reducing Russian influence and putting Putin on the defensive .
The construction of a missile - defense system in Eastern Europe was the last straw .
What had been primarily a propaganda campaign aimed at the Kremlin has now taken a decidedly military turn , one that bodes ill for the future and the cause of peace .
There are those who never reconciled themselves to the end of the Cold War  that crucible in which the pestilential sect known as the neoconservatives was born and raised  and it seems a supreme effort is being made to revive it .
Today we hear endless stories about how the Russian leader and his country pose a threat to Western interests : Russia is " authoritarian , " newly aggressive , " anti-Semitic , " and , yes , even " homophobic . "
As the memory of 9/11 fades and the meaning of that historic disaster is increasingly disputed , the War Party needs fresh enemies whose alleged evil will thrill the popular imagination and satiate their hunger for villainy .
Putin , flush with oil money and eager to regain Russia ’s place in the sun , fits the bill nicely .
The truth is more prosaic .
Putin is no dictator , and Russia , far from backsliding into neo-communism , is in a better position than ever to create a middle - class - based liberal democracy with the rule of law roughly comparable to the system that prevails in the West .
The general rise in the Russian standard of living , after a catastrophic post - communist decline , puts a brake on any backward - looking authoritarian movement ( neo-communist or otherwise ) making appreciable progress .
That this occurred under Putin is the reason for the Russian president ’s enormous popularity and accounts for the marginalization of his opponents .
As much as Western liberals and neocons loathe Putin and the prospect of a resurgent Russia , it does n’t look like regime change is on the agenda in the former Soviet Union , in spite of millions being poured into the region by Western governments to aid the opposition .
The endless provocations aimed at the Kremlin will only have the effect of irritating the Russian bear  and creating yet more anti-American and anti-Western sentiment .
As if we do n’t have enough of that already
Russia has come a long way from being the land of the gulags , and it is never going to go back to that  not unless the West succeeds in looting that country , once again , and creating a Russian version of the Weimar Republic .
This is precisely why lunatics of Eduard Limonov ’s ilk have joined the opposition as its noisiest and most visible wing  because the rise of Putin , who created order out of mafia - inspired chaos , short - circuited the Weimar Russia scenario and diverted the Russians down a different path .
" " Pi is an extremely interesting number that is important to all sorts of mathematical calculations .
alengo / Getty Images
Pi has mesmerized mathematicians for 4,000 years .
It 's the rarest of mathematical constants , an unfailingly accurate ratio that 's also neverending .
The digits of Pi have been calculated out to more than 22 trillion decimal places without ever repeating ( that 's called an " irrational number " ) .
The definition of pi is simple :
It 's the ratio of a circle 's circumference divided by its diameter .
But what 's remarkable is that no matter the size of the circle you are measuring , that ratio of circumference to diameter will always equal 3.1415926535897 , usually shortened to 3.14 .
Divide the circumference of a tennis ball by its diameter and you get 3.14 .
Divide the circumference of the planet Mars by its diameter and you get 3.14 .
Divide the circumference of the known universe by its diameter — you get the point .
As one mathematician put it , " Pi is part of the nature of the circle .
If the ratio was different , it would n't be a circle . "

The following figure shows how the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 1.27 inches ( 32.35 millimeters ) is equal to a linear distance of 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters ) :
" " HowStuffWorks
As you might imagine , 4.0 ( the circumference ) / 1.27 ( the diameter ) = 3.14 .
Pi is critical to several basic calculations in geometry , physics and engineering , including the area of a circle ( πr2 ) and the volume of a cylinder ( πr2 ) h .
When the ancient Babylonians attempted to measure the precise areas of circles back in 1900 B.C.E. , they assigned a value to pi of 3.125 .
The ancient Egyptians came up with 3.1605 .
The Greek mathematician Archimedes ( 287-212 B.C.E. ) and the Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi ( 429-501 C.E. ) are co-credited with calculating the most accurate approximations of pi before calculus and supercomputers gave us the definitive answer [ source : Exploratorium ] .
In 1706 , the self - taught Welsh mathematician William Jones assigned the Greek letter π to this magical number without end , possibly because π is the first letter of the Greek words for periphery and perimeter .
The symbol 's use was later popularized by 18th - century Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler but was n't adopted worldwide until 1934 .
The fact that pi can be found everywhere — not only in circles , but in arcs , pendulums and interplanetary navigation — and that it 's infinitely long has inspired a cult following that includes plenty of geeky tattoos and even its own national holiday .
Keep reading to learn how you , too , can celebrate National Pi Day .
So will he get a chance to cure Mary Cheney and her lover Heather Poe ?
And if Mary and Heather are cured , then will Heather still be the parent of their child ?
Has Bush at least asked Mary to try to be cured by his Surgeon General nominee ?
Or does Bush not believe that his Surgeon General nominee ’s anti-gay science is legit , and if so , then why is he nominating him at all ?
Fortunately , this nutjob needs to be confirmed by the Senate .
And Hillary and Obama will be playing a key role in that confirmation :
“ A date has not been announced for confirmation hearings for Holsinger ’s appointment .
He will go before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions , chaired by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , D - Mass .
Three Democrats on the committee are presidential candidates : Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut , a graduate of the University of Louisville law school . ”
I trust the Democrats wo n’t be confirming a “ cure the gays ” nut as our next Surgeon General .
As Mitch McConnell always reminds us , it takes 60 votes to pass anything in the Senate .
Hopefully the Democrats have been listening .

[ 2015 Sep 10 ] Release of Bugzilla 5.0.1 , 4.4.10 , and 4.2.15
Today we have several new releases for you !
All of today 's releases contain security fixes .
We recommend that all Bugzilla administrators read the Security Advisory that was published along with these releases .
Bugzilla 5.0.1 is our latest stable release .
It contains various useful bug fixes and security improvements :

[ 2015 Jul 30 ] Bugzilla 4.2 will be EOL on 2015/ 11/30
As discussed on the Bugzilla developers mailing list / newsgroup and confirmed by project leads , Bugzilla 's new release policy is to end - of - life the oldest supported major version four months after a new major release .
Since this is the first time we 're enacting this policy , we 've extended the date to be 4 months from today rather than from Bugzilla 5.0's exact release date ( July 7th ) .
Thus Bugzilla 4.2 will be end - of - lifed on 30 November 2015 .
This means no fixes of any kind will be issued for Bugzilla 4.2 from that date onwards .
As usual , all Bugzilla admins are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of Bugzilla as soon as possible , especially those running 4.2 or earlier .
To expand a bit further on our new EOL process , after a new major release , we will support three major releases ( including the new one ) for four months .
After four months , we will drop support for the oldest one .
We will continue to support the remaining two until four months after the next release .
For example , currently we support 4.2 , 4.4 , and 5.0 .
In four months ' time we will drop support for 4.2 and support only 4.4 and 5.0 .
When the next major version comes out , it may be 6.0 instead of 5.2 depending on the changes , we will support 4.4 , 5.0 , and 5.2 .
Four months later , we will drop support for 4.4 and support only 5.0 and 5.2 .

[ 2014 Aug 27 ]
Notice about a user data leak from landfill.bugzilla.org
Some email addresses and encrypted passwords for test builds on landfill .
bugzilla.org were temporarily posted on a publicly accessible server .
One of our developers discovered that , starting on about May 4th , 2014 , for a period of around 3 months , during the migration of our testing server for test builds of the Bugzilla software , database dump files containing email addresses and encrypted passwords were posted on a publicly accessible server .
This resulted in the accidental disclosure of the email addresses and encrypted passwords of about 97,000 users .
As soon as we became aware , the database dump files were removed from the server immediately , and we ’ve modified the testing process to not require the database dumps .

Anybody can write and distribute their own Extension -- Bugzilla 3.6 includes very detailed documentation on how to write and distribute Extensions , and even includes a script that will set up the framework of a new Extension for you so that you can get right to coding .
Bugzilla 3.6 ships with one simple Extension that you can enable , and there are also already a few publicly - available Extensions for Bugzilla 3.6 , that any Bugzilla 3.6 installation can install to add new functionality to their system .
Some developers have been using pre-release versions of the new Extensions system in Bugzilla 3.6 , and here 's what they have to say about it :
Bugzilla Extensions really help me to do my customizations , giving me flexibility and reducing the impact in the tool 's core .
Congratulations Bugzilla team !
- Tiago Mello , IBM Linux Technology Center .

[ 2008 November 15 ] NASA Uses Bugzilla for Endeavour Shuttle and International Space Station
On Friday , November 14 , 2008 , mission control at NASA had its first live use of a two new problem - tracking systems .
These new systems are based on Bugzilla , with customizations by Everything Solved and the NASA Ames Research Center Human - Computer Interaction Group , with support from the San Jose State University Foundation .
The first piece of software is called PRACA ( the Problem Reporting and Corrective Action System ) , and it is used to track problems discovered while building and testing shuttle components , so that mission control and various NASA departments can have problem - solving information at their fingertips .
PRACA will also be used for the future Constellation space program due to begin in 2010 .
It will replace 40 different database systems at various different departments of NASA , centralizing problem tracking for the Constellation program .
Another system based on Bugzilla , IFI ( Items for Investigation ) , is used for tracking in - flight problems during International Space Station missions .
NASA has been an active contributor to the Bugzilla Project , funding the development of numerous upstream features in Bugzilla , including all of the new custom field types that will appear in Bugzilla 3.2 , and even more custom field features that will appear in Bugzilla 3.4 .
The Bugzilla Project is proud that it has been able to play such an important role in mankind 's exploration of space .
We are happy that our open - source software may one day help us reach the stars .

3.2rc2 is stable enough to use in small production environments , but major installations should wait for 3.2 final before upgrading .
We fixed a security bug in all releases that are coming out today , so there is also a Security Advisory to read .
Other than 3.2rc2 , there are three other releases : 3.0.6 , 2.22.6 , and 2.20.7 . 3.0.6 has some minor bug fixes , 2.22.6 brings Perl 5.10 compatibility to the 2.22 series , and 2.20.7 is just a security release .

[ 2007 May 09 ] Release of Bugzilla 3.0 !
In 1998 , the first open - source version of Bugzilla , 2.0 , was released to the world without much fanfare , just this little post on the netscape.public.mozilla.announce newsgroup .
Nine years later , Bugzilla is used by thousands of companies around the world with millions of total users .
It has become the de-facto standard in open - source bug tracking .
Thousands of companies have moved away from their costly commercial bug - tracking systems to Bugzilla , usually finding Bugzilla more flexible and more full - featured than the system they 'd been paying thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars for , and proving that open source software really can produce a competitive product .
Today , the Bugzilla Project is extremely proud to announce the release of Bugzilla 3.0 , and just like Terry said in 1998 , " We like the new version much better , and hope you will too . "
Here 's just a sampling of the major new features in version 3.0 :
Custom Fields
mod_perl support for greatly - improved performance
Per -Product Permissions
XML - RPC Interface
Create and Modify Bugs by Email
and much , much more ...
Bugzilla 3.0 also has a much - improved code base over previous versions of Bugzilla .
Improvements are still happening , but long - time customizers and coders of Bugzilla will notice significant improvements .
And if you have n't seen Bugzilla code since 2.16 or so , prepare to be ( pleasantly ) surprised !
As always , we welcome open source contributors to Bugzilla , which is made entirely by volunteers around the world .
You too can be part of the team that makes a product used by thousands of people daily .

Most of us feel a rush of righteous certainty in the face of a moral challenge , an intuitive sense of right or wrong hard to ignore yet difficult to articulate .
A provocative medical experiment conducted recently by neuroscientists at Harvard , Caltech and the University of Southern California strongly suggests these impulsive convictions come not from conscious principles but from the brain trying to make its emotional judgment felt .

Portrait Of The CIA As An Artist
By Lila Rajiva
20 January , 2007
Countercurrents.org
A ccording to Frances Saunders , in her well - documented book , “ The CIA and the Cultural Cold War , ” the CIA financed and groomed the avant - garde art movement from which abstract expressionism , performance art and the other freak shows of the art world emerged .
In the 1950s , at the height of the Cold War , the Agency wanted to move the center of art away from the social realism of European artists , which threatened the status quo with its powerful , realistic depictions of the human condition .
So , it brought to national attention a group of bohemian artists who were busy struggling on the sidelines painting abstract scenes devoid of any identifiable representation of human figures .
The groups included the likes of Robert Motherwell , Jackson Pollock , Mark Rothko , and William de Kooning .
In 1947 when Pollock dipped a stick into a gallon of diluted house paint and swirled and dripped color across his canvas , he had set off a new style in art .
The man was famous for splattering paint on his canvasses any which way to create his paintings .
Sometimes he even got young models with paint rubbed over their naked bodies to roll across the canvasses .
So dissolute was Pollock that he was called the wild man of expressionism .
After he became famous , rich people would invite him to their parties hoping he would live up to his reputation and pee in the fireplace .
All the new artists were rebellious , disaffected , self - destructive .
Pollock himself was killed in a drunken car crash in 1956 …. that looked suicidal .
Another suspicious car accident finished off sculptor David Smith .
And in the decade following , Kline drank himself to death , Smith died in a car accident , and Mark Rothko slashed his arms and bled to death after announcing , “ " Everyone can see what a fraud I am . "
That should have been enough of a hint that there was something dead - end in the whole business .
But the CIA took a larger and more pragmatic view .
It thought that the would - be geniuses might be useful props in an impending face - off with Joe Stalin .
Of course , many of the artists themselves were socialist in sympathy or at least , they made gestures in that direction .
Rothko , for instance , agreed to a commission from New York ’s swankiest of the swank , the Four Seasons restaurant , solely in order to torment the patrons with claustrophobic scenes .
He had modeled them on Michelangelo ’s blocked off windows in the vestibule of the Laurentian Library in Florence .
Michelangelo ’s anteroom of death , leads off the cloister of the Medici church of San Lorenzo , and is a nightmare in architecture .
Rothko was hell bent on reproducing its suffocating effect in the New York watering hole .
“ I hope to ruin the appetite of every son of a bitch who ever eats in that room , " he gloated , He wanted his paintings to make “ those rich bastards ” " feel that they are trapped in a room where all the doors and windows are bricked up . "
The CIA bankrolled a whole bevy of professional pointy heads and public pontificators like Irving Kristol , Isaiah Berlin , Stephen Spender , Sidney Hook , Daniel Bell , Dwight MacDonald , Hannah Arendt , and Mary McCarthy .
It was especially fond of ex-leftists like Ignacio Silone , Stephen Spender , Arthur Koestler , Raymond Aron , and George Orwell who had ratted out establishment Stalinists .
Money poured into cultural journals like the famous Partisan Review and Kenyon Review , among others .
The Congress of Cultural Freedom was another Agency outfit , set up as an umbrella organization to bring together all possible opponents to Stalinist totalitarianism .
All claimed , of course , that they were motivated only by their own convictions and threw up their hands in astonishment when they were later informed that CIA hand - outs were behind all those plushy conventions at Lake Como and Paris .
But their surprise seems a tad rehearsed .
How could they not have known whom they were working for ?
And why else would sophisticated intellectuals with a keen eye for the atrocities of the Soviet Empire manage to wink … or shut both eyes … to what the America was up to in Guatemala , Greece , Iran , and Korea ?
Or to the U.S. support for the killings in Indochina and Algeria ?
How did they not know who was paying their salaries and funding their otherwise defunct rags ?
But the CIA was also involved in co-opting the intellectuals in another subtler way .
It was busy sending boatfuls of American artists to European shores in the hope that the bitter pill of imperialism would go down the throats of critics there better when it was sugar coated with song and dance .
It especially liked to parade black artists like Marion Anderson and Louis Armstrong to undercut criticism about domestic racial policies .
Of course , if the new minstrels forgot to sing according to script and started ad - libbing , like Richard Wright , they were quickly shoved back into the closet .
And then there was MOMA , or the Museum of Modern Art , into which the CIA emptied its coffers , in the hope of unearthing new styles of art that would dilute any tendency to political enthusiasm among artists .
Abstract art was the Agency ’s favorite .
The CIA regarded it as an " anti-Communist ideology , the ideology of freedom , of free enterprise .
Non-figurative and politically silent it was the very antithesis of socialist realism . "
MOMA ’s founder , Nelson Rockefeller , even called it " free enterprise painting . "
Money poured through MOMA and another CIA outfit , the Fairfield Foundation , allowing Abstract Expressionism to rapidly take Europe ’s chicest galleries by storm and change modern aesthetics irretrievably .
The apolitical art of the abstract artists was brandished as true art , because it was not tainted with political concerns .
If this meant simply that we would in the future be spared the stutterings of Jeaneane Garofolo and Michael Douglas on Middle East politics or global warming , then we would be squarely in the CIA ’s camp .
But of course , the CIA had no objection to artists posturing about politics at all so long as it was the right politics – which meant politics that suited the aims of American politicians in the post war period .
And for America in those days what was most important was that the value of “ freedom ” be upheld against the tyranny of Stalinism .
An art that recognized no bounds , restrictions , rules , representations , or models was as suited as anything could be to used as propaganda for freedom .
And so we had a bunch of marginalized , substance - addicted minor talents suddenly being touted as Renaissance geniuses .
Noted critics compared Rothko to Michelangelo .
One professor of art likened his paintings to Annunciations ' .
Another claimed he had seen a student rolling on the floor with joy in front of a Rothko painting at the Tate .
Yet another critic called Pollock ’s drip paintings the Big Bang of modern art and the “ Promethean act ” by which the painter “ stole the sacred fire from Europe ” .
Michelangelo and Rembrandt had both been “ made irrelevant ” by drip painting .
The hyperbole was typical of a public spectacle .
Only repeat a big enough lie often enough , said Joseph Goebbels , the Nazi Minister of Propaganda , and it will quickly become received wisdom with the masses .
It soon became part of the gospel of modernity that art was something completely unrelated to society or politics , free of all recognizable human needs , limitations , restrictions , or conventions .
But the emperor ’s clothes were not always opaque to everyone .
Inevitably , even one besotted critic had to admit that he could spot the raw boody underneath .
There were , it turns out , earthier foundations to the public spectacle of modern art than the Renaissance masters .
Writing about Pollock ’s predilection for squirting paint at random , David Dalton dredges up a memory of the painter recalled by an observant neighbor :
He saw himself standing beside his father on a flat rock , watching his father pissing , making patterns on the surface of the stone . . . and he wanted to do the same thing when he grew up .

In 1957 , German theoretical physicist Burkhard Heim publicly outlined a new idea for spacecraft propulsion .
It was based on his new theory of physics which successfully described Einstein ’s theory of Relativity within the framework of Quantum Mechanics , and it married the two so effectively that he became an instant celebrity .
Such a goal was long sought by Einstein himself , but never realized .
Heim ’s ideas described a “ hyperdrive ” which would locally modify the constants of nature in such a way that a vehicle would be allowed to travel at immense speeds , possibly faster than the speed of light .
Such a propulsion system could theoretically reach Mars in under five hours , and neighboring stars within a few months .
But shortly after he announced his theory , Heim went into isolation , and took his theories and formulas with him .
It would be years before his theories again resurfaced , but when they did , they attracted the attention of NASA , the U.S. military , and the Department of Energy .
About thirteen years before announcing his theory , Burkhard Heim was permanently disabled during an accident while working as an explosives developer in World War 2 .
He was working on an explosive device when it detonated in his hands , severing both of his forearms and severely damaging his eyesight and hearing .
After undergoing a series of operations , Heim distracted himself from the pain by intensely studying Einstein ’s relativity theory .
He registered at the University of Goettingen to study physics , and fulfilled his academic degree requirements with the help of companions .
Heim was able to continue his work in physics because he developed an extraordinarily accurate acoustic memory , able to recall formulas in exact detail once they had been recited to him .
He became involved in physics research at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics , and it was during this time that he made his Heim theory public , along with the hyperdrive propulsion system based upon it .
Einstein ’s relativity theory describes space - time as having four dimensions : three dimensions of space ( allowing for width , height , and depth ) and one dimension of time .
According to Relativity , any object will deform space in proportion to its mass , which causes gravity .
This theory perfectly predicts the behavior of objects in space and time , so long as the object in question is not subatomic in scale .
Quantum Mechanics describes the movements and interactions at tiny scales smaller than atoms , and this theory assumes that space is not deformed by mass , but rather it is in a static , fixed state .
Each theory successfully describes its own sphere , but the two ideas seem to be in some contradiction .
Einstein spent much of his later life unsuccessfully attempting to harmonize these theories as a “ theory of everything . ”
Heim ’s attempt to heal this divide added four “ sub - space ” dimensions to Einstein ’s four , making a total of eight .
Later he decided that two of the dimensions were unnecessary , and removed them from the theory .
His two sub -space dimensions coupled the forces of electromagnetism and gravity , which meant that theoretically , electromagnetic energy could be converted into gravity .
This is the principle that his hyperdrive idea was based upon .
The theory was so compelling and the math worked out so well that after Heim announced it , Wernher von Braun⁠ — the man leading the Saturn 5 rocket program⁠ — contacted Heim and asked him whether the Saturn 5 was a waste of money .
The theory propelled Heim into celebrity status in Germany , where he started appearing in magazines , in newspapers , and on television .
But when he was unable to raise the money to develop the hyperdrive , he retreated into isolation to investigate the theories further .
Progress was slow given that Heim was rather possessive of his theory , particularly on the matter of inviting research from outside of Germany .
Over the years he published a couple of papers whose formulas were able to calculate the masses of the fundamental particles with remarkable accuracy , filling a gap in conventional physics .
He also produced several books on his theories , but they were lengthy , formidable volumes which were only available in German .
In 1982 Heim helped to program his formulas into the German Electron Synchrotron computer , which verified their surprising accuracy , but because Heim had not yet confided in other theoretical physicists on the details of the mass formula derivation , the Electron Synchrotron results were not widely published .
In the 1980s Heim began to work with a theorist named Walter Dröscher who restored the two dimension which Heim had originally discarded from his theory .
The result was the theory of “ Heim - Dröscher space , ” which was a mathematical description of an eight - dimensional universe .
It describes gravity , anti-gravity ( dark energy ) , electromagnetism , and quantum forces .
It also describes the force which would allow hyperdrive to become a reality .
Burkhard Heim died in 2001 , but Walter Dröscher continued the work , and teamed up with a physicist named Jochem Häuser to produce a paper proposing an experiment to test Heim ’s quantum theory .
The experiment calls for a magnetic field of extremely high intensity , but space propulsion researchers at Sandia National Laboratories think it might just be possible to perform the experiment using their “ Z Machine ” X - ray generator .
They decided to wait for the math behind the theories to be better understood before volunteering the use of the expensive piece of equipment .
Because it is so complex and has had relatively little exposure , the Heim - Dröscher theory is still not well understood by most physicists .
But its ability to calculate particle mass with uncanny accuracy has lent it a certain degree of credibility , because no theory before or since Heim ’s can accomplish the same thing .
If the theory is accurate , the hyperdrive propulsion field it allows may make a weekend trip to Mars a reality , and put the stars within our grasp .
Update :
In the years since this article was written , the Heim - Dröscher theory has not held up well to scientific scrutiny .
Still , when physicist John Reed translated some of Heim ’s formulas into software , he found that it was able to derive particle masses as well as Heim had claimed .
Whether this is evidence or coincidence is uncertain , but Dr. Reed concluded , “ I ’m more convinced now that there is really something to his theory .
I do n’t understand much of the math yet .
It ’s very complicated and different from anything I ’m familiar with .
I have a Ph.D. in physics so I know something about physics . ”
With topics ranging from policing and flood protection , to St. George and the coronavirus pandemic , the six top candidates for mayor - president tackled some of the biggest issues facing East Baton Rouge Parish at a forum Tuesday hosted by The Advocate and Louisiana Public Broadcasting .

U.S Terrorism Arrests / Convictions Significantly Overstated
Interesting report ( long , but at least read the Executive Summary ) from the U.S. Department of Justice ’s Inspector General that says , basically , that all the U.S. terrorism statistics since 9/11 — arrests , convictions , and so on — have been grossly inflated .
As summarized in the following table , we determined that the FBI , EOUSA , and the Criminal Division did not accurately report 24 of the 26 statistics we reviewed .
“ EOUSA ” is the Executive Office for United States Attorneys , part of the U.S. Department of Justice .
The report gives a series of reasons why the statistics were so bad .
Here ’s one :
The number of terrorism - related convictions was overstated because the FBI initially coded the investigative cases as terrorism - related when the cases were opened , but did not recode cases when no link to terrorism was established .
And here ’s an example of a problem :
For example , Operation Tarmac was a worksite enforcement operation launched in November 2001 at the nation ’s airports .
During this operation , Department and other federal agents went into regional airports and checked the immigration papers of airport workers .
The agents then arrested any individuals who used falsified documents , such as social security numbers , drivers ’ licenses , and other identification documents , to gain employment .
EOUSA officials told us they believe these defendants are properly coded under the anti-terrorism program activity .
We do not agree that law enforcement efforts such as these should be counted as “ anti- terrorism ” unless the subject or target is reasonably linked to terrorist activity .
There ’s an enormous amount of detail in the report , if you want to wade through the 80ish pages of report and another 80ish of appendices .

Security forces have struggled to contain the lawlessness
Ghazi Hamad , chief spokesman for the Hamas government , said the hope that followed Israel 's pull - out last year had been replaced with " a nightmare " .
Gaza is at the mercy of thugs , he said , and pleaded for an end to deadly clan rivalries .
" Let Gaza breathe , " he said .
Such frank self - criticism is rare among Palestinian leaders , analysts say .
Mr Hamad 's comments came in an article , which was published in Palestinian newspapers on Monday .
He said they were his own views and did not represent the position of his government .
" I am not interested in discussing the ugliness and brutality of the occupation because it is not a secret .
Instead , I prefer self - criticism and self evaluation , " Mr Hamad wrote .
Overwhelming problems
He said life in Gaza City now involved " unimaginable chaos , careless policemen , young men carrying guns and strutting with pride , and families receiving condolences for their dead in the middle of the street . "
And he was also critical of militants who fire crudely - made rockets into Israel , saying ordinary Palestinians paid a high price when Israel responded militarily to such attacks .
Mr Hamad said Gazans should stop laying the blame for their mistakes at the door of the Israeli occupation .
" Our extreme joy at their departure made us forget the most important question : What is our next step ? " he went on .
Hamas swept to power in elections in January and promised to bring law and order to the Gaza Strip .
Mr Hamad 's remarks would seem to be an admission that it has completely failed to do so , the BBC's Alan Johnston in the West Bank says .
But he adds that the best government in the world would have struggled to cope with Gaza 's overwhelming social and economic problems .
Hamas has also been paralysed by the crushing Western and Israeli economic boycott imposed because it has refused to renounce violence and accept Israel 's right to exist .
Today the Open Internet Coalition goes before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet to discuss " Wireless Innovation and Consumer Protection . "
Ben Scott , Washington policy director of free press , said the hearing " ought to be called the ' iPhone hearing ' " due to its relevance to consumer choice with phone devices , open networks , and focus on promoting competition in the wireless market .
Yesterday we took part in the a conference call with members of the Open Internet Coalition who discussed what they plan to address in front of the House Subcommittee .
In attendance were : Tim Wu , professor , Columbia Law School ; Chris Murray , legislative counsel , Consumers Union ; Chris Libertelli , senior director , government and regulatory affairs , Skype ; Ben Scott , washington policy director , free press ; and Gigi Sohn , president and cofounder , Public Knowledge .
Down with anticompetitive lock - ins
One way wireless carriers avoid full - tilt competition is with lock - ins .
According to Chris Murray , the government should consider the effects of " early termination fees , as they relate to what 's happening in terms of innovation in this space , " he said .
" Some companies charge consumers as much as $ 200 to avail themselves to other choices and switch to another carrier .
Murray suggests that termination fees make competition between wireless carriers virtually nonexistent , as people are often unwilling to switch from one carrier to another until their contracts are fully expired .
Worse still , the long lock - ins do n't always provide any proper consideration for consumers entering those contracts .
" We want lower consumer prices , " Murray said when referring to the $ 600 price of the iPhone .
" Consumers do n't get a single dime of subsidy on the new iPhone , but it 'll still get them locked into a two - year deal or penalty to leave the carrier . "
Murray also referenced the Blackberry Worldphone , which has the ability to roam across European and American networks , but in order to use this ability consumers need to pay a $ 20.00 fee .
" What 's going on here ?
The basic fact is that [ Blackberry ] has coupled the market for handsets and applications with the market for consumers . "
Wireless spectrum should be open
Christopher Libertelli , senior director of government and regulatory affairs for Skype , spoke a bit about Skype 's recent letter to the FCC discussing its support for " open wireless internet services based on the Federal Communication Commission 's landmark 1968 Carterfone decision . "
As a brief history behind the decision , in 1968 it was ruled that Thomas Carter 's two - way mobile radio and other devices could access AT&T 's network , provided they did n't cause any damage to it .
Later , it opened up the market to other household items that also used telephone lines , like caller - ID systems and fax machines .
Libertelli said " the Carterfone decision was about establishing consumer rights for both sides of the equation , " with both sides meaning consumers as well as service providers .
Libertelli also feels that there needs to be more competition in the wireless market so that " innovation can be put to work for consumers . "
He added , " Openness will be more valuable because consumers will be able to do more with connections , like talk to family around the world for free and save money on phone bills . "
Gigi Sohn is president and co-founder of Public Knowledge , which is concerned about the 700MHz spectrum auction we reported on yesterday .
According to Public Knowledge , the auction could make it possible for the " development of a third , nationwide broadband Internet provider that could compete with the powerful incumbent telephone and cable companies which control 96 % of [ the ] broadband lines in this country . "
Sohn 's take on the issue is that there are currently four major wireless broadband providers , and although it seems that they compete with each other , they really do n't .
She says , " Each provider has a closed network that limits consumer choice .
This is not serving innovation , and the FCC can ensure that the same mistakes are n't made when it develops its rules for the 700 Mhz doctrine . "
" We should be getting competition from wherever we can find it , " Libertelli added .
" When the Internet intersected with telecom , we received a whole new source of competition .
There are tons of VoIP companies , much more than four .
There needs to be competition for wireless service at the access and software layers of the network . "
The group also discussed the markets in Europe that offer a " robust set of choices for consumers " that are " two or three years ahead of our choices .
We stand here in a country that has traditionally done innovation really well , why can't we do it really well in a wireless space also ? "
In order to improve innovation in the United States , they hope to see a " no blocking , no walking rule . "
The no-blocking rule would allow consumers to walk into any store , buy any phone that they see fits their needs , and run it on a network of their choice .
Murray added , " The time has come for the industry to become a normal industry .
When you switch cable providers , do cable companies say , ' Guess what ?
Your TV is finished ? ' "
Next - gen wireless policy should spur innovation
Tim Wu , a professor at Columbia Law School , said he was going to focus on the big picture of wireless policy today .
In February , Wu discussed the Carterfone decision and wireless neutrality .
Now ,
Wu thinks " we 've reached the end of the first generation of wireless policy , which had mixed results . "
However ,
Wu also sees the intersection between telecom and the internet as a " crucial moment in moving to the second generation of wireless policy . "
With the release of the iPhone last week , we saw the ability that consumers have in promoting a product for a company .
However , these same consumers are also caught up by two " bedrock " rules that Wu feels need to be discussed : " locking and blocking . "
Wu thinks the first rule , device portability , is the most important : " Number portability exists , why can't we bring our cell - phones along to new carriers also ?
Why can't we confidently buy and use unlocked devices in this country ? "
The second rule that needs to be discussed , which Wu thinks is long overdue , is " the ban on blocking . "
He said that carriers have gone before Congress in the past and agreed not to block users from applications and capabilities of phones and that " the carriers are n't keeping their promise in the wireless sector .
No one disagrees that blocking is an anti-competitive conduct . "
Earlier this morning , Meg Whitman , president and CEO of eBay , announced that it too will support the discussion for " openness " in the wireless market , which certainly shows that heavy - hitters are backing the idea for consumer friendly policies in the wireless - market .
A chink in the device portability armor
Wireless carriers wo n't agree with much of what the Open Internet Coalition is pushing , largely because lock - ins and high termination fees create stability for their businesses that they argue is necessary to fund infrastructure .
Coupled with this is the major challenge to true device portability : competing carriers are , generally speaking , all using different networks .
Hence , as much as one might like to make the jump from , say , Verizon to T - Mobile , doing so is not just a jump between two companies .
Rather , Verizon Wireless phones will talk CDMA and EVDO , while T - Mobile supports GSM and EDGE with most of their offerings .
Also , the iPhone is a rarity in that its price is not subsidized by a contract .
Most consumers do get price breaks when signing long contracts , although the advent of the iPhone and its subsequent early success suggests that we may see other " hot " phones debuting without contract subsidies .
DIGG THIS
Republican magazines have begun their pimp operations for the GOP ’s 2008 presidential candidates .
In a recent issue of National Review , Jennifer Rubin , described as " a freelance writer in Washington , D.C. , " pumps up Rudolph Giuliani as " America ’s mayor " and " America ’s prosecutor . "
Giuliani is a media creation .
Giuliani was unknown until in search of name recognition he staged a stormtrooper assault on the financial firm Princeton / Newport involving fifty federal marshals outfitted with automatic weapons and bulletproof vests .
On another occasion he had two New York investment bankers hauled off their trading floor in handcuffs .
Giuliani ’s victims had done nothing and were exonerated .
But Giuliani ’s media stunts served to turn public sentiment against white - collar defendants .
Giuliani once bragged that by giving negative treatment to his targets , " the media does the job for me . "
Giuliani certainly had no difficulty manipulating Wall Street Journal reporters James B. Stewart , Daniel Hertzberg and Laurie Cohen or The Predators ’ Ball author Connie Bruck .
Milken , who had done nothing except make a lot of money by proving Wall Street wrong about non-investment grade bonds , was branded the " Cosa Nostra of the securities world . "
Milken ’s " junk bonds " financed such household names as CNN , Barnes & Noble , Stone Container Corporation , Time - Warner , Safeway , and Mattel .
Milken provided capital to companies with promising futures that lacked investment - grade credit rankings .
Milken operated out of Los Angeles , not Wall Street .
His earnings and those of his upstart firm , Drexel Burnham Lambert , aroused envy and hatred among the Wall Street hot shots .
Milken failed to use his money to purchase political protection in Washington .
Instead , he gave his money to organizations that help poor black children .
Milken was set up perfectly for an ambitious and unscrupulous prosecutor like Giuliani .
Giuliani leaked to his media pimps that a 98 - count indictment was coming down against Milken .
As Milken had done nothing and Giuliani had no case against him , Giuliani ’s strategy was to coerce Milken into a plea bargain .
When Milken failed to send his attorneys to work out a plea arrangement , Giuliani used Laurie Cohen to report eighteen times in the Wall Street Journal that Milken would imminently face an expanded superseding indictment of between 160 and 300 counts .
To increase the pressure on Milken , prosecutors threatened to indict Milken ’s younger brother , Lowell , unless Milken made a plea deal .
US Attorney General Dick Thornburgh quipped to his deputies : " A brother for a brother . "
Afterwards , Giuliani ’s assistant US attorney , John Carroll , told Seton Hall Law School students in April 1992 that Lowell Milken was a " sort of ready chip in the negotiations . "
Giuliani even went so far as to send FBI agents to hound Milken ’s 92 - year old grandfather .
Milken ’s attorneys concluded that Giuliani , lacking any case , was far out on a limb and desperate for a face - saving plea .
They worked out a plea to six minor technical offenses that had never carried any prison time .
But Giuliani was determined to have his victim , and Milken was double - crossed by sentencing judge , Kimba " Bimbo " Wood , and spent two years of his life in prison .
Giuliani ’s assistant US attorney John Carroll later bragged to Seton Hall Law students that in the Milken case " we ’re guilty of criminalizing technical offenses .
. . .
Many of the prosecution theories we used were novel .
Many of the statutes that we charged under . . . had n’t been charged as crimes before .
. . .
We ’re looking to find the next areas of conduct that meets any sort of statutory definition of what criminal conduct is . "
It is a damning indication of the collapse of American law that an assistant US attorney can be well received when he brags to law school students that federal prosecutors frame Americans with novel interpretations that create ex post facto law and violate mens rea — no crime without intent — the foundation of the Anglo - American legal system .
In his book , Payback : The Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution , University of Chicago law professor and dean Daniel Fischel proves Milken ’s innocence .
But when prosecutors are corrupt , innocence is no protection .
Giuliani ’s crimes were not limited to Milken and Princeton / Newport .
After investigating , I concluded that Giuliani framed Leona Helmsley with the suborned perjury of one of Helmsley ’s accountants , whose own infraction in helping to defraud the Miller Brewing Company was dropped in exchange for false witness against Helmsley .
I wrote about Helmsley ’s frame - up in National Review , and my story was picked up by one of the TV shows of the era .
Both Alan Dershowitz and Robert Bork share my conviction that Helmsley was framed with suborned perjury .
Today National Review is a Giuliani partisan , as is the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal .
During Giuliani’s " white - collar crime heyday , " the Wall Street Journal editorial page was busy exposing Giuliani ’s duplicity and misuse of the media to create cases against innocent targets .
Giuliani rode his prosecutions of the rich to the NYC mayoralty , just as he rode 9/11 to become a GOP presidential candidate .
Giuliani ’s career never served justice ; it served his personal ambition , his ego .
That a person so short on integrity could become a candidate for president is a damning indictment of the US political system .
The account of Giuliani ’s prosecution of Milken comes from my book with Lawrence Stratton , The Tyranny of Good Intentions .

“ Dear David , first off i would like to tell you that you are full of **** and did not research the zune enough to know your facts .
“ The following are incorrect , and not limited to : podcasts , giftcards , looks ( which is an oppinion ) , controls , and content .

The deeper we sail into the new online world of communications , the sadder I get about its future .
I ’m OK with criticism , I ’m fine with disagreement , I ’m perfectly capable of handling angry mail .
That ’s not the issue here ( although my teenage correspondent above was , in fact , wrong about every single one of his points ) .
I ’ve even accepted personal attacks as part of the job .
I ’m a columnist ; the heat comes with the kitchen .
But what ’s really stunning is how hostile * ordinary * people are to each other online these days .
Slashdot and Digg.com are extremely popular sites for tech fans .
Each discussion begins with the presentation of an article or Web page–and then opens up the floor for discussion .
Lately , an increasing number of the discussions devolve into name - calling and bickering .
Someone might submit , say , this item to Digg :

“ AWESOME astronomy poem . ” ( posted by MetsFan 3 days ago )
Twinkle , twinkle , little star , how I wonder what you are .
Up above the world so high , like a diamond in the sky ,
Twinkle , twinkle , little star , how I wonder what you are .
Before long , the people ’s feedback begins , like this :
by baddude on 12/11/06
What ’s yr problem , moron .
You already said it ’s a star , why would you then wonder what it is .
Get a clue , or a life .
by neverland2 on 12/11/06
Dugg down as inaccurate .
Stars do not twinkle .
It ’s the shifting atmosphere that causes an apparent twinkle .
Or were you stoned all through science class ?
by mrobe on 12/11/06
yo neverland2 – It ’s a poem , idiot .
Nobody ’s claiming that stars twinkle .
Ever heard of poetic license ?
Honestly , the intellectual level of you people is right up there with a gnat’s .
… and so on .
What ’s worse is that the concentration of the nasty people increases as the civil ones get fed up and leave .
What ’s going on here ?
My current theories :
* On the Internet , you ’re anonymous .
Since you do n’t have to face the person you ’re dumping on , you do n’t see any reason to display courtesy .
* On the Internet , you ’re anonymous .
You worry that your comments might get lost in the shuffle , so you lay it on thick to enhance your noticeability .
* The open toxicity is all part of the political climate .
We ’ve learned from the Red state - Blue state talking heads that open hostility can pass for meaningful conversation .
* Young people who spend lots of time online are , in essence , replacing in - person social interactions with these online exchanges .
With so much less experience conversing in the real world , they have n’t picked up on the value of treating people civilly .
That is , they have n’t yet hit the stage of life when getting things like friends , a spouse and a job depend on what kind of person you are .
* Many parents have n’t been teaching social skills ( or have n’t been around to teach them ) for years , but Web 2.0 is suddenly making it apparent for the first time .
( “ Web 2.0 ″ describes sites like Digg and Slashdot , where the audience itself provides material for the Web site . )
I ’d give just about anything to hear what 15 - year - old Josh ’s parents would say if they knew how little respect he holds for adults ( let alone the English language ) .
Then again , maybe they would n’t be surprised a bit .
The real shame , though , is that the kneejerk “ everyone else is an idiot ” tenor is poisoning the potential the Internet once had .
People used to dream of a global village , where maybe we can work out our differences , where direct communication might make us realize that we have a lot in common after all , no matter where we live or what our beliefs .
But instead of finding common ground , we ’re finding new ways to spit on the other guy , to push them away .
The Internet is making it easier to attack , not to embrace .
Maybe as the Internet becomes as predominant as air , somebody will realize that online behavior is n’t just an afterthought .
Maybe , along with HTML and how to gauge a Web site ’s credibility , schools and colleges will one day realize that there ’s something else to teach about the Internet : Civility 101 .
1 . " Hardly anybody reads me .
" If you believe the hype , blogs — those online journals where people write about everything from politics and sports to their personal lives — will soon be the only thing most people read .
Indeed , the blogging phenom , which blossomed from modest beginnings almost a decade ago , seems unstoppable :
Three years ago there were two million blogs on the web , according to blog search engine Technorati ; today there are more than 60 million .
But the reality behind the stats is that most blogs get few hits .
The most popular do boast huge followings — tech - news site Engadget , for one , has more readers than most print newspapers and magazines .
But beyond the elite few , it drops off significantly — the top 25 blogs account for roughly 10 % of blog readership , according to web - traffic measurement firm ComScore .
To be fair , most bloggers are n't seeking a big audience .
" The pleasure of blogging is in forming a sense of intimacy readers and fellow bloggers can enjoy , " says Rachel Bray , whose Babayaga .ca gets a few hundred hits a day .
So what 's the norm ?
Google CEO Eric Schmidt told a recent gathering of U.K. politicians that the average blog has just one reader : the blogger .
2 . " The more companies pay me , the more I like their stuff .
" Companies looking for ways to profit from the blogging phenomenon have tried everything from buying ad space on blogs to infiltrating discussion forums with hired PR shills .
They 've even created fake blogs to hawk their products .
In December , Sony went live with AllIWantforXmasIsaPSP.com , a " blog " by two fictitious teenagers clamoring to get a PlayStation Portable for Christmas .
The site , which contained videos and strained attempts at youth slang , was quickly exposed as a fraud .
" It was designed to be humorous , " says a Sony spokesperson .
" It did n't come across as intended .
" When such tactics are n't enough , companies will even pay bloggers to praise their products .
In 2006 , Florida outfit PayPerPost sparked controversy by offering to connect advertisers with bloggers willing to drop a company 's name into their daily scribbles for a fee ( between $ 4 and $ 40 per mention ) .
The practice was quickly denounced as online payola , and in December , the Federal Trade Commission weighed in , ruling that word - of - mouth marketers must disclose their sponsorship .
Says PayPerPost CEO
Ted Murphy , " We 're trying to strike a balance that makes everybody happy .
" 3 . " Did I mention I 'm not a real reporter ?
" With major newspapers including " The Washington Post " routinely hosting blogs for columnists and reporters , blogging is gaining credibility .
But beware :
Even those associated with mainstream news outlets are n't subject to the same prepublication safeguards — editing , fact - checking , proofreading — that print publications use .
With blogs " we 're shifting to this world where we 're publishing first and editing later , " says Jeff Jarvis , a journalism professor at the City University of New York and author of the blog BuzzMachine .
While more than one - third of bloggers consider their work a form of journalism , their news - gathering consists largely of borrowing content and posting links to traditional news sources , along with some added commentary .
What 's more , bloggers do n't face the same consequences as journalists for getting it wrong :
In a recent libel case against a woman who posted a critical letter about two doctors , the California Supreme Court ruled that those who post content from other sources are n't liable for defamation .
In other words , bloggers are off the hook so long as they are n't the original author of the mistake .
4 .
" I might infect your computer with a virus .
" Most web surfers know better than to click on a link promising free money or a trip to the Bahamas .
But blogs can contain malicious code just like any other site .
Social - networking hub MySpace , for example , which hosts about one in 10 blogs online , suffered several high - profile attacks last year .
In December hackers altered hundreds of thousands of MySpace user profiles ; the doctored pages directed viewers to a scam site that elicited log - in names and passwords .
Another tactic involves targeting innocent blogs and inserting malicious links into the reader comment section — one click and your computer could be infected .
Allysa Myers , a virus - research engineer at security - software maker McAfee , says researchers now see such attacks , which first appeared less than a year ago , almost daily .
Keeping your operating system , browser and security software updated may help contain the damage , but the responsibility is partly that of web site operators , who need to put proper filters in place so rogue users can't upload bad content .
The bottom line for readers : " If you do n't know the person doing the linking , do n't click on it , " Myers says .
5 .
" I 'm revealing company secrets .
" When Mark Jen started working at Google in 2005 , he was so excited about his new job that the newly minted associate product manager started a blog about it , describing orientation meetings , comparing Google 's pay and benefits package with that of his past employer , and recounting a company ski trip .
Though Jen revealed nothing earth - shattering , his blog soon drew an audience eager for a peek inside the tight - lipped firm .
Two weeks later Jen was fired .
He is n't sure just what he wrote that prompted his dismissal , but " was told somebody at the top wanted me gone , " Jen says .
( Google had no comment on the matter . )
Indeed , companies are only now beginning to realize that employee blogs can be a threat to information security ; so far just 7 % of firms have policies on personal blogs , according to a survey from the American Management Association and ePolicy Institute .
But that does n't mean you can blog with abandon .
" Do n't piss off your boss , " says Robert Scoble , author of " Naked Conversations : How Blogs Are Changing the Way Businesses Talk With Customers . "
Ask about your employer 's stance on blogs and what subject matter is out of bounds before ever typing a word .
6 . " Just because my name 's on it does n't mean I wrote it .
"
In 2005 New York City mayoral candidate Fernando Ferrer 's web log mentioned he 'd attended public schools ; in fact , Ferrer received most of his education in private Catholic schools .
When confronted with the error , his campaign admitted the blog was written by a staffer .
Ferrer 's predicament was hardly unusual : Politicians , business leaders and other public figures routinely employ ghostwriters to produce books , speeches and , more recently , blogs .
One survey conducted by PR consultant David Davis found that only 17 % of CEOs who blog do all their own writing .
However common it is , " ghost blogging " remains controversial .
" It 's a perversion of the real meaning of blogging , which is to put yourself out there , " says Debbie Weil , author of " The Corporate Blogging Book . "
But not everybody agrees the practice is tantamount to lying .
Ed Poll , a law firm management consultant and author of LawBiz Blog , thinks ghost blogging is fine .
" I do n't think anyone who reads a post should care whether the name on it belongs to the writer , " Poll says .
" If you believe everything you read , then shame on you .
" 7 . " My blog is just a stepping stone to bigger and better things .
"
In some blogging circles , scorn for the mainstream media , or " MSM , " is a virtual religion .
Nonetheless , many bloggers have proven eager to join it when the opportunity arises .
Melissa Lafsky , author of the popular Opinionistas blog , was stressed and unhappy as a young lawyer in New York City .
As a kind of therapy , she began chronicling daily life at her firm , relating tales of tyrannical partners and sleepless , embittered young associates , being careful not to reveal her identity .
Her blog soon built a following , gaining mentions in The New York Times and Slate.com .
Eventually , a literary agent came calling , and Lafsky quit her job to write professionally .
" I 'd be getting coffee in some newsroom if not for the Internet , " she says .
Indeed , bloggers are using their medium to pursue jobs in all sorts of industries .
Seeking a spot at Provo Labs , Utah resident Carolynn Duncan created " Why Provo Labs Wants to Hire Carolynn Duncan , " a blog detailing her qualifications to work for the startup incubator .
" It was kind of a flippant idea , " Duncan admits , but it worked — after approaching a company exec at a community dinner and handing him her business card listing her blog 's address , Duncan scored an interview and got the job .
8 .
" I can control what you see on the Internet .
" When search engines like Google calculate their search results — the list you get when you type in specific words — one of the biggest factors in determining order is the number of other sites that link to a given web page .
The reasoning goes that it's a good measure of how useful the content of a web site is to readers — and it often works in favor of blogs .
" There 's no special boost in our algorithm for blogs , " according to a Google spokesperson , " but as part of their nature [ for example , routinely providing fresh content ] , people may link to and from blogs more often .
" Knowing how to game the system , some bloggers will use the power of links to get ahead on search - result lists .
Kansas lawyer Grant Griffiths started the Kansas Family Law Blog in 2005 to promote his practice .
By posting two or three times a day , he says , he soon brought his blog near the top of the list for search terms like " Kansas law " and " divorce lawyers . "
Within 30 days Griffiths started attracting new business and now gets two to three new cases per week because of his high - visibility blog .
Bloggers do n't just use links to promote themselves ; they can also manipulate search results to make their enemies look bad .
In a practice known as " Google bombing , " a coordinated group of bloggers can boost a site 's ranking using negative key words .
Such was the case in 2003 , when enough bloggers linked to George W. Bush 's official White House biography page using the words " miserable failure " to make it No. 1 on the list for a Google search of those words .
9 .
" Blogging just about ruined my life .
"
In 2004 Oregon resident Curt Hopkins was getting ready to fly to Minnesota for a job interview at a radio station .
But before he got on the plane , the station canceled the meeting .
The reason ?
His blog , Morpheme Tales .
Hopkins had made some harsh remarks in it about the Catholic Church a few weeks before the scheduled interview , remarks he suspects sank his chances of getting hired .
Hopkins says he stands by his words , but plenty of people end up regretting a rash posting they did n't expect anyone to read .
In a notorious 2006 incident , the entire Northwestern University women 's soccer team was suspended for a month after photos of their drinking and risqué hazing rituals were discovered online and publicized by the sports blog BadJocks.com .
If you want to blog but still value some measure of privacy , try using one of several blog - hosting services — including Vox , WordPress or Google 's Blogger — that allow you to limit your audience to a select group of your choosing .
10 .
" I 'm already obsolete .
" How long can the blog bonanza last ?
There are already signs of a slowdown :
The growth rate of blogs let up for the first time in third - quarter 2006 , and overall daily postings fell to 1.3 million in September from 1.6 million in June , according to Technorati .
" There 's a certain faddish quality to what 's going on , " says technology writer Nicholas Carr .
" We 're probably at or near the peak of popularity of writing blogs .
" But that 's only a part of the story ; indeed , blogs have begun evolving into a multimedia phenomenon .
It 's now fairly cheap and easy to record video and post it as a video blog , or " vlog . "
And together with podcasts — audio recordings posted online — the number of video blogs has surged , from 4,000 just a year ago to more than 22,000 today , according to vlog directory Mefeedia .
At its core blogging has always been about showing oneself to the world ; with the advent of user - friendly voice and video technology , that idea is becoming more literal every day .
" Is Somebody from Spain Hispanic ? "
A commenter says " no , " " according to the government diversity manual . "
It turns out the answer is more complex — it all depends on which program you look to .
A few examples :
36 C.F.R. § 906.2( k) ( Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation ) : " Hispanic — is an individual who is descended from and was raised in or participates in the culture of Spain , Portugal , or Latin America , or who has at least one parent who speaks Spanish or Portuguese as part of their native culture . "
24 C.F.R. § 81.2 ( The Secretary of Hud 's Regulation of the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) ) : " Hispanic or Latino — a person of Cuban , Mexican , Puerto Rican , South or Central American , or other Spanish culture or origin , regardless of race . "
40 C.F.R. § 35.6015 ( Cooperative Agreements and Superfund State Contracts for Superfund Response Actions ) : " Hispanic American ( with origins from Puerto Rico , Mexico , Cuba , South or Central America ) . "
Cal. Admin . Code § 97700.29 ( Minority Health Professions Education Foundation ) : " For purposes of this chapter , ' Hispanic / Latino ' means a person whose ancestry can be readily traced to Mexico , Puerto Rico , the Caribbean basin , or any other country of Central or South America where Spanish is the recognized official language .
A person shall not be considered Hispanic / Latino solely on the basis of possession of a Spanish surname . "
Cal. Admin .
Code tit. 2 , § 547.80 ( Equal Employment Opportunity Program / State Work Force Data Collection and Evaluation ) : " ' Hispanic ' means any person whose origin is Mexico , Puerto Rico , Cuba , Spain , or the Spanish - speaking countries of Central or South America .
It does not include persons of Portuguese or Brazilian origin , or persons who acquired a Spanish surname . "
Cal. Admin .
Code tit. 22 , § 7130 ( California Department of Aging ) : " ' Minority ' means an ethnic person of color who is any of the following : ... Hispanic -- a person of Mexican , Puerto Rican , Cuban , Central or South American , or other Spanish or Portugese culture or origin regardless of race . "
( Note then that to be a " minority " the Hispanic person must be " an ethnic person of color " of certain " culture or origin " -- but " regardless of race . " )
Fla . Admin . Code Ann. r. 60A -9.001 ( Office of Supplier Diversity ) : " Hispanic American : a person of Spanish or Portuguese culture with origins in Spain , Portugal , Mexico , South America , Central America or the Caribbean Islands , regardless of race . "

Ten Tips for New Trainers / Teachers
Just because you 've used lots of software does n't mean you can write code .
Just because you 've been in lots of buildings does n't mean you can be an architect .
And just because you 've logged a million frequent flyer miles does n't mean you can fly a plane .
But if that 's all ridiculously obvious , why do some people believe that just because they 've taken classes , they can teach ?
( Or just because they 've read lots of books , they can write one ? )
The problem is n't thinking that they can do it , the problem is thinking they can do it without having to learn , study , or practice .
I 'm amazed ( and more than a little disheartened ) how many people believe that simply by virtue of their being skilled and knowledgeable in something , they 're implicitly qualified to communicate , mentor , teach , or train that thing .
It devalues the art of teaching to think that because you 've been a student , you can teach well .
That because you 've experienced learning , you can craft a learning experience .
But with that out of the way , nobody needs a PhD ( or in most cases -- any degree at all ) in education or learning theory to be a good teacher .
Just as there are plenty of great software developers and programmers without a CompSci degree .
People can be self - taught , and do a fabulous job , for a fraction of the cost of a formal education , but they have to be motivated and they have to appreciate why it 's important .
The irony is that most people with this attitude would themselves be insulted if the tables were turned -- if their students did n't think they needed to learn anything from them ... that just going on instinct and winging it would be enough .
So this is my starter list for new trainers and teachers ( I wo n't debate any distinctions between " teaching " and " training " -- we 're talking about one who designs and / or delivers learning experiences , so I do n't care what you call it , what your subject is , or even how old your learners are .
The fundamentals of how humans learn are pretty constant , even if the application of those fundamentals can look quite different on the surface ) .
There are two different lists here -- Eleven Things to Know , and Ten Tips for New Trainers .
This is for newbies , so I 'm sure I have nothing new to say for those of you who are already experienced teachers / trainers .
( A list of reference links is at the very bottom of the post .
These are n't anything more than an off - the - top - of - my - head list , so please do n't think of them as The Complete Story !
And yes , I 'm way overgeneralizing , or this would be book - length . )
Eleven
Things to Know
1 ) Know the difference between " listening " and " learning " .
Listening is passive .
It is the lowest , least - efficient , least - effective form of learning .
That means lectures are the lowest , least - efficient , least - effective form of learning .
Listening alone requires very little brain effort on the learner 's part ( and that goes for reading lecture - like texts as well ) , so listening to learn is often like watching someone lift weights in order to get in shape .
2 ) Know how the brain makes decisions about what to pay attention to , and what to remember .
And here we are back to emotions again .
Emotions provide the metadata for a memory .
They 're the tags that determine how important this memory is , whether it 's worth saving , and the bit depth ( metaphorically ) of the memory .
People remember what they feel far more than what they hear or see that 's emotionally empty .
3 ) Know how to apply what you learned in # 2 .
In other words , know how to get your learners to feel .
I 'll look at this in the Ten Tips list .
4 ) Know the wide variety of learning styles , and how to incorporate as many as possible into your learning experience .
And no , we 're not talking about sorting learners into separate categories like " He 's a Visual Learner while Jim is an Auditory learner . " , or " He learns best through examples . "
Every sighted person is a " visual learner " , and everyone learns through examples .
And through step - by - step instructions .
And through high - level " forest " views .
And through low - level " tree " views .
Everyone learns top - down and bottom - up .
Everyone learns from pictures , explanations , and examples .
This does n't mean that certain people do n't have certain brain - style preferences , but the more styles you load into any learning experience , the better the learning is for everyone -- regardless of their individual preferences .
( And while you 're at it , know that most adults today do not truly know their own learning styles , or even how to learn .
The word " metacognition " does n't appear in most US educational institutions . )
5 ) Know the fundamentals of current learning theory !
( Check out the book links at the end of this post . )
6 ) Know why -- and how - - good advertising works .
It 'll help you figure out # 3 .
Be sure you recognize why this matters .
7 ) Know why -- and how - - good stories work .
Consider the learner to be on a kind of hero 's journey .
If Frodo is your student , and you 're Gandalf ... learn as much as you can about storytelling and entertainment .
Learn what screenwriters and novelists learn .
Know what " show do n't tell " really means , and understand how to apply it to learning .
Humans spent thousands upon thousands of years developing / evolving the ability to learn through stories .
Our brains are tuned for it .
Our brains are not tuned for sitting in a classroom listening passively to a lecture of facts , or reading pages of text facts .
Somehow we manage to learn in spite of the poor learning delivery most of us get in traditional schools and training programs ( and books ) .
8 ) Know a little something about " the Socratic method " .
Know why it 's far more important that you ask the good questions rather than supply all the answers .
9 ) Know why people often learn more from seeing the wrong thing than they do from seeing the right thing .
Know why the brain spends far less time processing things that meet expectations , than it does on things that do n't .
10 ) Know why it 's just as important to study and keep up your teaching skills as it is to keep up your other professional skills .
Yes there ARE professional organizations for trainers , with conferences , journals , and online discussions .
11 ) Know why using overhead slides to deliver a classroom learning experience can -- sometimes ( often ) - - be the worst thing you can do .
( Although yes , in many cases using slides for some select pieces of a course are important , beneficial , and crucial .
What we 're dissing is the practice where the entire class , start to finish , is driven around some kind of slides or presentation . )
12 ) Know how -- and why -- good games can keep people involved and engaged for hours .
Learn how to develop activities that lead to a Flow State .
Ten Tips for New Trainers
1 ) Keep lecture to the absolute minimum .
There is nearly ( but not always ) something better than lecture , if learning is the goal .
If your class involves a combination of lecture and labs , then if you 're short on time -- always cut the lecture , not the exercises !
( Unfortunately , this is the opposite of what most trainers do . )
2 ) It is almost always far more important that your learners nail fewer subjects than be " exposed " to a wider range of subjects .
In most cases , it 's far more important that your students leave able to DO something with their new knowledge and skills , than that they leave simply KNOWING more .
Most classroom - based instruction can be dramatically improved by reducing the amount of content !.
Give them the skills to be able to continue learning on their own , rather than trying to shove more content down their throats .
If your students leave feeling like they truly learned -- like they seriously kick ass because they can actually do something useful and interesting , they 'll forgive you ( and usually thank you ) for not " covering all the material " .
The trainers that get cricism for not covering enough topics or " finishing the course topics " are the ones who did n't deliver a good experience with what they did cover .
3 ) For classroom trainers , the greatest challenge you have is managing multiple skill and knowledge levels in the same classroom !
Be prepared to deal with it .
The worst thing you can do is simply pick a specific ( and usually narrow ) skill / knowledge level and teach to that , ignoring the unique needs of those who are slower or more advanced .
And do n't use the excuse that " if they do n't have the prereqs , they should n't be here . "
Even among those who meet the formal prereq requirements , you can have drastically different levels .
Especially if the teacher who delivered those prereq courses was in the " covering the material " mode .
Sure , your students may have been " exposed " to the prereq material , but just because they heard it or read it does not mean they remember it now , or that they ever really " got it . "
Techniques for dealing with multiple levels :
* Be sure you KNOW what you 've got .
Find out before the class , if you can , by speaking with the students or at least exchanging emails .
If you do n't have access to students prior to the class , then learn as much as you can during introductions !
* Acknowledge the different levels right up front .
The more advanced students are far more likely to get pissed off when they think you do n't even realize or appreciate their level .
By acknowledging it , you recognize their abilities and set the stage for having them act as mentors to the others .
* Have multiple versions of exercises !
Have a " base " level of lab activities that everyone must complete , but have additional interesting , challenging options so that your advanced people are n't growing bored or frustrated waiting for the slower people to finish their exercises .
* For slower people , include graduated hint sheets for exercises .
( More on that in the next point . )
4 ) Work hard to get everyone to complete the lab exercises , but NEVER give out the solutions in advance !
This is closely related to # 3 , because the most likely reason trainers do n't have all students finishing labs is because there are some slower learners ( and I do n't mean " dumber " , but simply less knowledgeable or experienced in the topic than the other students , or they just have a learning style that requires more time ) .
Be sure every students has been successful at the exercises !
And if you give them the solution in advance , you 've robbed them of the chance to seriously kick ass by working through it even when things get difficult .
On the other hand , you do n't want students to become completely stuck and frustrated , so use something like the technique below :
Using graduated hints can work wonders .
Prepare three or more levels of hint sheets for the exercises , with each level more explicit than the last .
The first level can offer vague suggestions , the second can be a little more focused , and the third can be fairly explicit .
Students should be allowed to use these at their discretion , so it 's best if you do n't force the students to go to you for each new level .
Make them available , but make it clear that it 's important they turn to them only after [ insert number of minutes relevant to your exercise ] .
After teaching literally thousands of programming and other courses , I can say with certainty that the vast majority of your students will NOT simply go to the most explicit hints right off .
But this is conditional ...
I 'm assuming that the exercise is relevant and interesting and challenging without being ridiculously advanced or clearly takes more time to complete than you 're able or willing to allow for the exercise .
If your exercises suck , for whatever reason , then hint sheets wo n't fix it .
5 ) Do group exercises whenever possible , no matter what you 've heard .
I 've heard every excuse , " Adults do n't like to do group exercises . " or " Professional developers do n't like to do group exercises . " or " People do n't like to do group exercises when they 're paying big bucks to be here . " or " People from outside the US do n't like to do group exercises ... " .
They 're all bulls ***.
There is a huge social component to learning , regardless of how much we try to eliminate it in the classroom .
There 's a way to do interactive group exercises that works surprisingly well , and is usually quite easy .
A simple formula for group exercises
* Use groups of no more than 3 to 5 .
Try to go above 2 , but after 5 you 'll end up with some people hanging back .
With 3 - 4 people , everyone feels more obligated to participate and be involved .
* When you assign an exercise ( like , say , a two - page diagram of an enterprise architecture that they must label and explain ) , have each person START by working individually for a couple of minutes , THEN get them into their groups ( be sure that they know who their group is BEFORE they start any work on the exercise ) .
* Eavesdrop on the groups and comment or just make sure they 're on the right track .
Drop hints or give pointers if they 're veering into an unproductive approach .
* After a certain number of minutes , give a heads - up warning " 60 seconds left ... " so they can finish up .
* Be certain that someone in each group has the responsibility to record what the group comes up with .
One person should be the designated spokesperson .
* After the exercise is done , keep the people in their groups and query each group about their answers , or any issues / thoughts they had while doing it .
Note : the first few times you do this in any new classroom , students might be quiet or skeptical about doing it , but after the first two or three , they 'll have a hard time imagining how you could do it any other way .
6 ) Designing exercises
The best execises include an element of surprise and failure .
The worst exercises are those where you spend 45 minutes explaining exactly how something works , and then have them duplicate everything you just said .
Yes , that does provide practice , but it 's weak .
If you design an exercise that produces unexpected results ... something that intuitively feels like it should work , but then does something different or wrong -- they 'll remember that FAR more than they 'll remember the , " yes , it did just what she said it would do " experience .
Note that paper and pencil exercises are GREAT .
Even if your teaching programming or any other topic that involves doing .
In our books , for example , we have simple " magnetic poetry " code exercises that do n't involve everyone having to go to the computer .
You can design even simple multiple - choice quizzes , although the more sophisticated the better .
Be creative with creating workbook style exercises when you 're teaching challenging subjects .
In a programming class , for example , I 'll have paper exercises ( that they do both individually and in a group ) that involve everything from , " fill in the rest of this class diagram with what you think should be there " to " fill in each empty method on this sheet with bullet points or pseudo code for what you think should happen there . "
Depending on the classroom , you could even have an exercise that involves one group " teaching " something to another group .
Assign group A to figure out the File API , for example , while group B has to research how and why the Serialization mechanism works the way it does in the lab you just did ...
As hokey as they are , sometimes game - show style quizzes can still be fun .
Especially when there 's a set of topics that DO require boring , rote memorization .
When they have to burn in certain key facts ... you can liven it up and make it a little less painful .
The exercises in our Head First books ( especially HF Java ) are examples of paper execises we do in classrooms , that are separate from hands - on programming " lab " exercises .
The best form of longer lab exercises get learners in the flow state !
This is where your game design studies can really come in handy .
Remember , the flow state comes from activities that are both challenging but perceived as do - able .
Get the challenge level right !
Having multiple levels of hints means that a single exercise can work for a wider range of skill and knowledge levels without being too easy or too hard -- both of which will prevent the flow state .
Exercises should feel relevant !
They should not feel like busy work or strictly practice ( although for some kinds of learning , extra practice is exactly what you need , but in most cases -- you 're looking to increase understanding and memory rather than simply practice a physical skill ) .
If students do n't get the point of the exercise , you 're screwed .
It 's up to you to either have an exercise where the point is dead - obvious , or that you can make a case for .
The exercise does NOT need to be " real world " in the sense of the actual , complex world you live in .
It should , however , reflect a simplified virtual world with its own set of rules .
In a learning experience , you 're usually trying to help them learn / get / remember only a single concept at a time .
Way too many lab exercises that attempt to be " real world " have so much cognitive overhead that the real point you 're trying to reinforce is lost .
7 ) Leave your ego at the door .
This is not about you .
Your learners do NOT care about how much you know , how smart you are , or what you 've done .
Aside from a baseline level of credibility , it 's far more important that you care about how smart THEY are , what THEY know ( and will know , thanks to this learning experience ) and what THEY have done .
I 'm amazed ( and horrified ) by how many instructors do n't ever seem to get to know anything about their students .
You should know far more about them than they know about you .
At the beginning of class , you do NOT need to establish credibility .
You nearly always have a certain amount of credibility in the bank , even if they 've never heard of you .
You can LOSE that credibility by doing things like lying ( answering a question that you really are n't certain about , without admitting that you 're not sure ) , or telling them you really DON 'T know what you 're doing .
But you 'll usually hurt the class if you spend time talking about how great YOU are .
The best way to let them know what you 've done is in the context of a question someone asks , where you simply say , " Well here 's how I solved that on an accounts database I was working on at .... "
But even better if you say something like , " Well here 's how one of my clients / students / wo- workers solved it ... "
8 ) Have a Quick Start and a Big Finish .
Get them doing something interesting -- even if it 's just a group discussion -- very early .
Do n't bog them down with YOUR long introduction , the history of the topic , etc .
The faster they 're engaged , the better .
Do n't let the class fizzle out at the end .
Try to end on a high .
It 's like the movies ... where they usually put the best song at the very end , during the closing credits ... because this often determines the feeling you leave with .
Ask yourself , " what were my students feeling when they left ? "
Too often , the answer to that is , " overwhelmed , and stupid for not keeping up " .
And usually , the fault is in a course that tried to do too much .
That tried to cover ( whatever the hell that means ) too much .
9 ) Try never to talk more than 10 - 15 minutes without doing something interactive .
And saying , " Any questions ? " does not count as interaction !
Whether it's a group exercise , a lab , or at least an individual paper and pencil exercise of some sort ... get them doing rather than listening .
But be sure that the interaction is n't perceived as a waste of time , either .
10 ) Do n't assume that just because you said it , they got it .
And do n't assume that just because you said it five minutes ago , they remember it now .
In other words , do n't be afraid to be redundant .
That does n't mean repeating the same material over and over ... but it often takes between 3 to 5 repeated exposures to something before the brain will remember it , so take the extra time to reinforce earlier topics in the context of the new things you 're talking about .
Great teachers know how to slip in the redundancy in an almost stealth way ... where the thing is looked at again but from a different angle .
It 's up to you to keep it interesting and lively .
11 ) If you 're not passionate , do n't expect any energy from your learners .
That does n't mean being an annoying cheerleader .
Be honest , be authentic , but be passionate .
It 's your job as a trainer to find ways to keep yourself motivated .
A lot of teachers / trainers feel it is n't their job to motivate the students .
But that 's ridiculous .
Even the most motivated person in the world still finds it hard to stay motivated on each and every topic ... especially when it gets tough .
Think about how many technical books you 've sat down to read on topics you were extremely interested in , but then could n't find a way to keep yourself reading .
Motivation for the overall topic and motivation for the individual thing being learned are completely different .
You 're there to supply the motivation for the individual things you 're trying to help them learn .
Your passion will keep them awake .
Your passion will be infectious .
It 's up to you to figure out how to stay passionate , or quit teaching until you get it back .
And finally , do n't think of yourself as a teacher or trainer ... since that puts the focus on what YOU do .
Remember :
It 's not about what YOU do ... it 's about how your learners feel about what THEY can do as a result of the learning experience you created and helped to deliver .
Rather than think of yourself as a teacher or trainer , try getting used to thinking of yourself as " a person who creates learning experiences ... a person who helps others learn . "
In other words , put a lot more emphasis on the learning and a lot less emphasis on the teaching .

One other tip I would give is that when you ARE lecturing and writing stuff on the board , make sure you give time for people to actually write down the text beforing moving on to the next point .
I will usually use the time that they are writing to re-state a previous point that lead to this point and then re-read the point .
In short , realize that it is difficult to write and listen well at the same time , but do n't just stand there for a long pause .

It is nice to hear that you are going to publish your book links .
I thought it would be nice if you had one quite often reading your blog .
In fact , I 've bought some books you 've mentioned , so that probably means I will be facing more expenses , but nevertheless I am looking forward to see those links .
And if you will comment a bit on every book - that would be fantastic indeed .

Thanks for sharing a valuable list of ideas for creating a better learning experience for the student .
It 's not just for new teachers , but it 's a good list of reminders for the experienced educator as well .
I 'll just add that lectures are not always necessarily a poor teaching method .
The Chronicle of Higher Education had a good article about this in the past year .
It featured a number of faculty who are known for providing excellent lectures that keep students fascinated and absorbed in the subject matter .
Like much of teaching , leading a good discussion for example , it 's an art .
Not everyone can do it well .
But let 's not write off the lecture entirely .
At times and for certain content it has its place .

Tarry :
You 're right , I do n't interact enough on the comments .
I put whatever time and energy I have for the blog in my posts , but I should try to dedicate a little more to responding to comments .
Thanks for the reminder .
Sloan : great advice !
I 've really had to work on my whiteboard skills .
I had to learn to write * bigger * , and to change colors , but your advice on giving them time is really important .
Riminatas : I do n't know exactly when I 'll get to it , but I will definitely take your advice and make comments on each book .
Thanks !
Steven :
You 're absolutely right -- I know I 've listened to a lot of gripping lectures that were both engaging AND effective .
And with a conference presentation as opposed to a classsroom , that 's often the only appropriate thing you CAN do ...
I think a good lecture can be awesome and effective , but most of us do n't have great skills for that .
This is something I need to work on -- I use the other techniques , in many ways , to compensate for my weak lecture abilities .
Sacha and Brian :
Thanks !
Einzling : Stay tuned .
There is n't a Head First Teaching coming , but we * are * doing a book that has a lot of learning theory in it ...
I 'm not ready to give the details yet , but I can tell you this * mystery book * will be out in January ; )

I wish I 'd had a copy of this when I had to TA a class in grad school .
I disliked teaching , because I knew I was n't good at it .
And since I did n't like talking in front of a room full of people , I 'd get the students to do group exercises as much as possible , even though I absolutely hated group exercises as a student .
I thought I was just wimping out , but maybe it was better for the students after all ! :)

This is a great post .
I can't wait to see your comments on the books you 'll recommend .
Could you do a set of mini reviews ?
just a couple of paragraphs on why you consider them important .
I was thrown into the training role for a year and a half and I would have loved to have something like this .
The hardest part was having to take 2 hours of material and cram it into 40 minutes .
By running the students through the motions and having the students do a lot of things , they remembered most of it .
Doing is far more effective them lectures in those cases where it applies .

I studied Psychology in the Netherlands ( Europe ) and I really enjoyed reading your intelligent remarks .
I 'm writing a book ( both in Dutch and in English ) on this matter ( learning style , thinking style ) but I expect it to be hard to find a publisher .
I agree with you that we all do verbal thinking and visual learning , but what about meta-cognition indeed ?
I put an answer to this question in my book .

i am confused , there are so much resources on the web and so much books written , that one wishes to study only and to write .
some times your memory is slow so all these rules , as they are just like bridals for our concentration on the topic and focus , they seem quite difficult to remember and to be followed up .
how much one can believe that certain tips are general enough to be applicable to diverse human minds ; and how much is the authenticity .
thanks

THE DAILY SOCIAL DISTANCING SHOW
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis lifts his state 's coronavirus restrictions as the pandemic surges on .
imprimatur 1 . The formula ( =‘ let it be printed ’ ) , signed by an official licenser of the press , authorizing the printing of a book ; hence as sb. an official license to print .
The Oxford English Dictionary ( 2nd. ed. )
Over the last two years I have become deeply and increasingly pessimistic about the future of liberty and freedom of speech , particularly in regard to the Internet .
This is a complete reversal of the almost unbounded optimism I felt during the 1994–1999 period when public access to the Internet burgeoned and innovative new forms of communication appeared in rapid succession .
In that epoch I was firmly convinced that universal access to the Internet would provide a countervailing force against the centralisation and concentration in government and the mass media which act to constrain freedom of expression and unrestricted access to information .
Further , the Internet , properly used , could actually roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media .
So convinced was I of the potential of the Internet as a means of global unregulated person - to - person communication that I spent the better part of three years developing Speak Freely for Unix and Windows , a free ( public domain ) Internet telephone with military - grade encryption .
Why did I do it ?
Because I believed that a world in which anybody with Internet access could talk to anybody else so equipped in total privacy and at a fraction of the cost of a telephone call would be a better place to live than a world without such communication .
Computers and the Internet , like all technologies , are a double - edged sword : whether they improve or degrade the human condition depends on who controls them and how they 're used .
A large majority of computer - related science fiction from the 1950s through the dawn of the personal computer in the 1970s focused on the potential for centralised computer - administered societies to manifest forms of tyranny worse than any in human history , and the risk that computers and centralised databases , adopted with the best of intentions , might inadvertently lead to the emergence of just such a dystopia .
The advent of the personal computer turned these dark scenarios inside - out .
With the relentless progression of Moore 's Law doubling the power of computers at constant cost every two years or so , in a matter of a few years the vast majority of the computer power on Earth was in the hands of individuals .
Indeed , the large organisations which previously had a near monopoly on computers often found themselves using antiquated equipment inferior in performance to systems used by teenagers to play games .
In less than five years , computers became as decentralised as television sets .
But there 's a big difference between a computer and a television set — the television can receive only what broadcasters choose to air , but the computer can be used to create content — programs , documents , images — media of any kind , which can be exchanged ( once issues of file compatibility are sorted out , perhaps sometime in the next fifty centuries ) with any other computer user , anywhere .
Personal computers , originally isolated , almost immediately began to self - organise into means of communication as well as computation — indeed it is the former , rather than the latter , which is their principal destiny .
Online services such as CompuServe and GEnie provided archives of files , access to data , and discussion fora where personal computer users with a subscription and modem could meet , communicate , and exchange files .
Computer bulletin board systems , FidoNet , and UUCP / USENET store and forward mail and news systems decentralised communication among personal computer users , culminating in the explosive growth of individual Internet access in the latter part of the 1990s .
Finally the dream had become reality .
Individuals , all over the globe , were empowered to create and exchange information of all kinds , spontaneously form virtual communities , and do so in a totally decentralised manner , free of any kind of restrictions or regulations ( other than already - defined criminal activity , which is governed by the same laws whether committed with or without the aid of a computer ) .
Indeed , the very design of the Internet seemed technologically proof against attempts to put the genie back in the bottle .
“ The Internet treats censorship like damage and routes around it . ”
( This observation is variously attributed to John Gilmore and John Nagle ; I do n't want to get into that debate here . )
Certainly , authoritarian societies fearful of losing control over information reaching their populations could restrict or attempt to filter Internet access , but in doing so they would render themselves less competitive against open societies with unrestricted access to all the world 's knowledge .
In any case , the Internet , like banned books , videos , and satellite dishes , has a way of seeping into even the most repressive societies , at least at the top .
Without any doubt this explosive technological and social phenomenon discomfited many institutions who quite correctly saw it as reducing their existing control over the flow of information and the means of interaction among people .
Suddenly freedom of the press was n't just something which applied to those who owned one , but was now near - universal : media and messages which previously could be diffused only to a limited audience at great difficulty and expense could now be made available around the world at almost no cost , bypassing not only the mass media but also crossing borders without customs , censorship , or regulation .
To be sure , there were attempts by “ the people in charge ” to recover some of the authority they had so suddenly lost : attempts to restrict the distribution and / or use of encryption , key escrow and the Clipper chip fiasco , content regulation such as the Computer Decency Act , and the successful legal assault on Napster , but most of these initiatives either failed or proved ineffective because the Internet “ routed around them ” — found other means of accomplishing the same thing .
Finally , the emergence of viable international OpenSource alternatives to commercial software seemed to guarantee that control over computers and Internet was beyond the reach of any government or software vendor — any attempt to mandate restrictions in commercial software would only make OpenSource alternatives more compelling and accelerate their general adoption .
This is how I saw things at the euphoric peak of my recent optimism .
Like the transition between expansion and contraction in a universe with Ω greater than 1 , evidence that the Big Bang was turning the corner toward a Big Crunch was slow to develop , but increasingly compelling as events played out .
Earlier I believed there was no way to put the Internet genie back into the bottle .
In this document I will provide a road map of precisely how I believe that could be done , potentially setting the stage for an authoritarian political and intellectual dark age global in scope and self - perpetuating , a disempowerment of the individual which extinguishes the very innovation and diversity of thought which have brought down so many tyrannies in the past .
One note as to the style of this document : as in my earlier Unicard paper , I will present many of the arguments using the same catch phrases , facile reasoning , and short - circuits to considered judgment which proponents of these schemes will undoubtedly use to peddle them to policy makers and the public .
I use this language solely to demonstrate how compelling the arguments can be made for each individual piece of the puzzle as it is put in place , without ever revealing the ultimate picture .
As with Unicard , I will doubtless be attacked by prognathous pithecanthropoid knuckle - typers who snatch sentences out of context .
So be it .
The original design of the ARPANET , inherited by the Internet , was inherently peer to peer .
I do not use the phrase “ peer to peer ” here as a euphemism for “ file sharing ” or other related activities , but in its original architectural sense , that all hosts on the network were logically equals .
Certainly , Internet connections differed in bandwidth , latency , and reliability , but apart from those physical properties any machine connected to the Internet could act as a client , server , or neither — simply a peer of those with which it communicated .
Any Internet host could provide any service to any other and access any service provided by them .
New kinds of services could be invented as required , subject only to compatibility with the higher level transport protocols ( such as TCP and UDP ) .
This architecture made the Internet something unprecedented in the human experience , the first many - to - many mass medium .
Let me elaborate a bit on that .
Technological innovations in communication dating back to the printing press tended to fall into two categories .
The first , exemplified by publishing ( newspapers , magazines , and books ) and broadcasting ( radio and television ) was a one - to - many mass medium : the number of senders ( publishers , radio and television stations ) was minuscule compared to their audience , and the capital costs required to launch a new publication or broadcast station posed a formidable barrier to new entries .
The second category , including postal mail , telegrams , and the telephone , is a one - to - one medium ; you could ( as the technology of each matured ) communicate with almost anybody in the world where such service was available , but your communications were person to person — point to point .
No communication medium prior to the Internet had the potential of permitting any individual to publish material to a global audience .
( Certainly , if one creates a Web site which attracts a large audience , the bandwidth and / or hosting costs can be substantial , yet are still negligible compared to the capital required to launch a print publication or broadcast outlet with comparable reach . )
This had the effect of dismantling the traditional barriers to entry into the arena of ideas , leveling the playing field to such an extent that an individual could attract an audience for their own work , purely on the basis of merit and word of mouth , as large as those of corporate giants entrenched in earlier media .
Beyond direct analogues to broadcasting , the peer to peer architecture of the Internet allowed creation of entirely new kinds of media — discussion boards , scientific preprint repositories , web logs with feedback from readers , collaborative open source software development , audio and video conferences , online auctions , music file sharing , open hypertext systems , and a multitude of other kinds of spontaneous human interaction .
A change this profound , taking place in less than a decade ( for despite the ARPANET 's dating to the early 1970s , it was only as the Internet attracted a mass audience in the late 1990s that its societal and economic impact became significant ) , must inevitably prove discomfiting to those invested in or basing their communication strategy on traditional media .
One need n't invoke conspiracy theories to observe that many news media , music publishers , and governments feel a certain nostalgia for the good old days before the Internet .
Back then , there were producers ( publishers , broadcasters , wire services ) and consumers ( subscribers , book and record buyers , television and radio audiences ) , and everybody knew their place .
Governments need n't fret over mass unsupervised data flow across their borders , nor insurgent groups assembling , communicating anonymously and securely , and operating out of sight and beyond the control of traditional organs of state security .
Despite the advent of the Internet , traditional media and government continue to exercise formidable power .
Any organisation can be expected to act to preserve and expand its power , not passively acquiesce in its dissipation .
Indeed , consolidation among Internet infrastructure companies and increased governmental surveillance of activities on the Internet are creating the potential for the imposition of “ points of control ” onto the originally decentralised Internet .
Such points of control can be used for whatever purposes those who put them in place wish to accomplish .
The trend seems clear — over the next five to ten years , we will see an effort to “ put the Internet genie back in the bottle ” : to restore the traditional producer / consumer , government / subject relationships which obtained before the Internet disrupted them .
A set of technologies , each already in existence or being readied for introduction , can , when widely deployed and employed toward that end , reimpose the producer / consumer information dissemination model on the Internet , restoring the central points of control which traditional media and governments see threatened by its advent .
Each of the requisite technologies can be justified on its own as solving clamant problems of the present day Internet , and may be expected to be promoted or mandated as so doing .
In the next section , we 'll look at these precursor technologies .
The dark future I dread will be the consequence of the adoption , by marketing or mandate , of a collection of individual technologies , each of which can be advocated as beneficial in its own right .
But these technologies , taken together , have consequences less apparent to many yet , I believe , quite evident to some now promoting them .
Each of the following technologies is either currently in existence or the object of an active development effort .
These items necessarily interact with one another , so it is impossible to entirely avoid forward references in discussing them .
If something does n't seem clear on the first reading , you may benefit from re-reading this section after you 've digested the essentials the first time through .
Note : this item discusses a phenomenon , already underway , which is effectively segmenting Internet users into two categories : home users who are consumers of Internet services , and privileged sites which publish content and provide services .
The technologies discussed in the balance of this document are entirely independent of this trend , and can be deployed whether or not it continues .
If you are n't interested in such details or take violent issue with the interpretation I place upon them , please skip to the next heading .
I raise the issue here because when discussing the main topics of this document with colleagues , a common reaction has been , “ Users will never put up with being relegated to restricted access to the Internet . ”
But , in fact , they already are being so relegated by the vast majority of broadband connections , and most are n't even aware of what they 've lost or why it matters .
When individuals first began to connect to the Internet in large numbers , their connection made them logical peers of all other Internet users , regardless of nature and size .
While a large commercial site might have a persistent , high bandwidth connection and a far more powerful server than the home user , there was nothing , in principle , such a site could do that an individual user could not — any Internet user could connect to any other and interchange any form of data on any port in any protocol which conformed to the underlying Internet transport protocols .
The user with a slow dial - up connection might have to be more patient , and probably could n't send and receive video in real - time , but there was no distinction in the ways they could use the Internet .
Over time , this equality among Internet users has eroded , in large part due to technical workarounds to cope with the limited 32 - bit address space of the present day Internet .
I describe this process in detail in Appendix 1 , exploring how these expedients have contributed to the anonymity and lack of accountability of the Internet today .
With the advent of broadband DSL and cable television Internet connections , a segmentation of the Internet community is coming into being .
The typical home user with broadband access has one or more computers connected to a router ( perhaps built into the DSL or cable modem ) which performs Network Address Translation , or NAT .
This allows multiple computers to share a single fast Internet connection .
Most NAT boxes , as delivered , also act as a rudimentary Internet firewall , in that packets from the Internet can only enter the local network and reach computers connected to the broadband connection in reply to connections initiated from the inside .
For example , when a local user connects to a Web site , the NAT router allocates a channel ( port ) for traffic from the user 's machine to the Web site , along with a corresponding inbound channel for data returned from the Web site .
Should an external site attempt to send packets to a machine on the local network which has not opened a connection to it , they will simply be discarded , as no inbound channel will have been opened to route them to the destination .
Worms and viruses which attempt to propagate by contacting Internet hosts and exploiting vulnerabilities in software installed on them will never get past the NAT box .
( Of course , machines behind a NAT box remain vulnerable to worms which propagate via E-mail and Web pages , or any other content a user can be induced to open . )
The typical home user never notices NAT ; it just works .
But that user is no longer a peer of all other Internet users as the original architecture of the network intended .
In particular , the home user behind a NAT box has been relegated to the role of a consumer of Internet services .
Such a user cannot create a Web site on their broadband connection , since the NAT box will not permit inbound connections from external sites .
Nor can the user set up true peer to peer connections with other users behind NAT boxes , as there 's an insuperable chicken and egg problem creating a bidirectional connection between them .
Sites with persistent , unrestricted Internet connections now constitute a privileged class , able to use the Internet in ways a consumer site cannot .
They can set up servers , create new kinds of Internet services , establish peer to peer connections with other sites — employ the Internet in all of the ways it was originally intended to be used .
We might term these sites “ publishers ” or “ broadcasters ” , with the NATted / firewalled home users their consumers or audience .
Technically astute readers will observe , of course , that NAT need not prevent inbound connections ; a savvy user with a configurable router can map inbound ports to computers on the local network and circumvent the usual restrictions .
Yet I believe that as time passes , this capability will become increasingly rare .
It is in the interest of broadband providers to prevent home users from setting up servers which might consume substantial upstream bandwidth .
By enforcing an “ outbound only ” restriction on home users , they are blocked from setting up servers , and must use hosting services if , for example , they wish to create a personal home page .
( With consolidation among Internet companies , the access supplier may also own a hosting service , creating a direct economic incentive to encourage customers to use it . )
In addition , it is probable that basic broadband service will be restricted to the set of Internet services used by consumers :
Web , FTP , E - mail , instant messages , streaming video , etc. , just as firewalls are configured today to limit access to a list of explicitly permitted services .
Users will , certainly , be able to obtain “ premium ” service at additional cost which will eliminate these restrictions , just as many broadband companies will provide a fixed IP address as an extra cost option .
But the Internet access market has historically been strongly price sensitive , so it is reasonable to expect that over the next few years the majority of users connected to the Internet will have consumer - grade access , which will limit their use to those services deemed appropriate for their market segment .
In any case , the key lesson of the mass introduction of NAT is that it demonstrates , in a real world test , that the vast majority of Internet users do not notice and do not care that their access to the full range of Internet services and ability to act as a peer of any other Internet site have been restricted .
Those who assert that the introduction of the following technologies will result in a mass revolt among Internet users bear the burden of proof to show why those technologies , no more intrusive on the typical user 's Internet experience than NATted broadband , will incite them to oppose their deployment .
A certificate is a digital identification of a physical or abstract object : a person , business , computer , program , or document .
A certificate is simply a sequence of bits which uniquely identifies the object it pertains to .
In most cases it is guaranteed that there is a one - to - one mapping between certificates and objects .
To make this less abstract , consider a non-computer analogue : passports .
A passport ( or , more precisely , a passport number , as individuals may , in certain circumstances , obtain multiple physical passports bearing the same number ) , uniquely identifies a person as a citizen of the issuing country .
No two people are given the same passport number , and one person 's attempting to obtain two different passport numbers is considered a crime involving a fraudulent declaration .
A digital certificate is much like a passport .
It is issued by a certificate authority , which vouches for its authenticity .
( In the case of a passport , the certificate authority is the issuing government . )
The certificate authority trades on its reputation for probity — to obtain high - grade personal certificates from recognised authorities , documentation equal to or better than that required to obtain a passport is necessary .
As with passports , certificates issued by obscure or disreputable authorities will engender less trust than those from the big names .
Certificates are in wide use today .
Every time you make a secure purchase on the Web , your browser retrieves a certificate from the e-commerce site to verify that you 're indeed talking to whom you think you are and to establish secure encrypted communications .
Most browser E - mail clients allow you to use personal certificates to sign and encrypt mail to correspondents with certificates , but few people avail themselves of this capability at present , opting to send their E - mail in the clear where anybody can intercept it and you - know - who routinely does .
When you obtain a personal certificate , the certificate authority that signs it asserts that you have presented them adequate evidence you are who you claim to be ( usually on the basis of an application validated by a notary , attorney , or bank or brokerage officer ) , and reserves the right to revoke your certificate should they discover it to have been obtained fraudulently .
Certificate authorities provide an online service to validate certificates they issue , supplying whatever information you 've chosen to disclose regarding your identity .
Having obtained a certificate , you 're obliged to guard it as you would your passport , credit cards , and other personal documents .
If another person steals your certificate , they will be able to read your private E-mail , forge mail in your name , and commit all the kinds of fraud present - day “ identity theft ” encompasses .
While stolen certificates can be revoked and replacements issued , the experience is as painful as losing your wallet and worth the same effort to prevent .
A certificate comes in two parts : private and public .
The private part is the credential a user employs to access the Internet , sign documents , authorise payments , and decrypt private files stored on their computer and secure messages received from others .
It is the private part of the certificate a user must carefully guard ; it may be protected by a pass phrase , be kept on a removable medium like a smart card , or require biometric identification ( for example , fingerprint recognition ) to access .
The public part of the certificate is the user 's visible identification to others ; many users will list their public certificate in a directory , just as they list their telephone number .
Knowing a user 's public certificate allows one to encrypt messages ( with that person 's public key , a component of the public certificate ) which can only be decoded with the secret key included in the private certificate .
When I speak of “ sending the user 's certificate along with a request on the Internet ” or tagging something with a certificate , I refer to the public certificate which identifies the user .
The private certificate is never disclosed to anybody other than its owner .
The scope of objects certificates can identify is unlimited .
Here are some examples , as they presently exist and may be expected to evolve in the near future .
People .
Any individual may obtain a personal certificate from a recognised issuing authority , providing the required credentials to establish their identity .
The certificate authority will first verify the identity of the requester , make sure that person has no other non-revoked certificate issued by it or any other authority , then issue the certificate .
The issuing authority will , upon demand , verify the certificate , providing the minimum legally required identification of its holder and any additional information the holder instructs the authority to disclose .
Minors may obtain certificates subject to parental consent , as is presently required to obtain a driver 's license or enlist in the military .
A parent or guardian may require a minor 's certificate to disclose the minor 's age , which can be used to block access or filter content inappropriate for a person of that age .
Further , if requested , the minor 's certificate may be linked to that of the parent or guardian , who may then read data encrypted with the minor 's certificate .
Certificate authorities undertake to protect the private encryption keys for all certificates they issue , along with any personal information the holder has not explicitly instructed them to disclose ( beyond minimum legal requirements ) .
Certificate holders may update their personal information as needed ( providing suitable documentation when , for example , legally changing a name ) , and may suspend or revoke their certificates if suspected or confirmed to be compromised .
Should the security of a certificate authority be breached , all certificate holders who may be affected must be notified .
Certificate authorities will comply with requests from law enforcement , subject to due process , for recovery of private encryption keys or identity information , including those of revoked certificates .
Companies / Organisations .
As noted above , most Web users already implicitly rely on certificates to confirm the identity of companies with which they do business on the Web .
There 's a lot going on behind that little lock icon in your browser .
If a site asserts its identity based on a certificate issued by “ Bob 's Discount Passports and Pawn Shop ” , an alert pops up to warn the user they may be about to do something really , really dumb .
Similarly , before signing an organ donor contract online , be sure to check out the bona fides of Instant Ca$h for Kidneys and those of their certificate authority .
As the Internet is made increasingly secure , the requirements for obtaining a certificate for an organisation will be brought into line with those for certificates identifying individuals .
Businesses , whether proprietorship , partnership , or corporation ; nonprofit organisations ; educational institutions ; governmental bodies and other kinds of legal entities will obtain certificates by furnishing the kind of credentials currently required to obtain an employer identification number for income tax purposes or a sales tax / VAT number .
As with certificates for individuals , verification will ensure no entity has more than one valid certificate .
Unlike individual certificates , those granted to an organisation may be used to create subordinate certificates for components of the organisation .
Individual offices , departments , etc. may obtain their own certificates , linked to the parent organisation 's , and administered by it .
This delegation may occur to any number of levels , according to the administrative policy of the organisation — whether a subordinate certificate may create further sub-certificates is determined when it is granted and may be subsequently changed .
An important kind of subordinate certificate is that created for staff ( employees , etc. ) of an organisation .
They identify an individual as a staff member and are used by that person for work - related purposes .
The degree to which someone outside the organisation can obtain personal information about a staffer depends on that organisation 's own policy and government privacy requirements .
An organisation is responsible for the actions of its staff using their certificates and may be compelled to identify them for law enforcement purposes .
Whether a staff member can access the Internet from computers on the organisation 's network using their private individual certificate as opposed to the staff certificate , and whether the staff certificate may be used outside the organisation network is up to the issuer and can be easily technologically enforced .
The private encryption keys of a staff certificate can be recovered by the issuer ( or a designated higher level in the hierarchy of certificates issued by the organisation ) , permitting supervision of staff activities and recovery of the staffer 's work product where necessary .
Computers .
The “ system signatures ” computed from hardware properties by present - day “ software activation ” procedures are crude forms of certificates .
The CPU serial numbers in recent Pentium chips ( which can presently be disabled , due to public outcry ) are still closer approximations .
“ Trusted Computing ” platforms will contain a unique certificate for each machine , referred to as a “ credential ” .
Computers in the Trusted Computing era will be assigned a certificate by their manufacturers which cannot be changed by the user .
( As will be discussed in further detail below , it may be possible to transfer the certificate to a new machine if the original system fails . )
A computer certificate uniquely identifies a machine .
It will be used to unlock software licensed for exclusive use on that machine , and to identify network traffic originating from it .
Programs .
A program can be issued a certificate which certifies not only that it has been signed by its publisher , but further verifies its contents have not been modified , using a hash / signature / message digest algorithm such as MD5 .
This technology is already being used for “ signed applets ” for browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer , where a user can ( it is claimed ) validate the publisher of the program and confirm that it has not been subsequently modified before executing it on their machine .
In the “ Trusted Computing ” architecture , every program will bear a certificate attesting to the identity of its publisher and permitting the operating system to confirm that it has not been corrupted .
A Trusted Computing operating system will not execute a program which differs from the signature in its certificate and will periodically , when connected to the Internet , re-verify a program 's certificate to confirm it has not been revoked .
Revoking the certificate of a deployed program effectively “ un- publishes ” it .
Such a program will only continue to run on machines on which it was already installed and which are never subsequently connected to the Internet .
While revocation of a program 's certificate is an extreme measure and can be expected to be correspondingly rare , it provides an essential mechanism to protect the Internet infrastructure from rapidly emerging threats .
If a critical security flaw which creates an immediate peril is found in widely - deployed software , revoking its certificate can pull the plug on the program , requiring users to immediately install an update which corrects the problem .
Content .
“ Content ” refers to any form of digital data : documents , images , audio , video , databases , etc .
Here the issue is n't identity or security , but rather authenticity and ownership rights .
The publisher 's certificate signing your copy of Moby - Dick guarantees that this is Melville 's original novel , as opposed to a version “ enhanced ” by a cheesy - poof addict in which Ahab slays the white whale , builds a starship from the bones , and sets forth to annihilate whales throughout the galaxy .
Programs are , in fact , just a special case of content .
Due to the risk malicious programs pose to individual users and the Internet , priority will be given to securing them but , with the advent of Digital Rights Management ( see below ) , similar provisions will apply to all kinds of data stored on computer systems .
Eventually , every file will be signed with a certificate identifying its creator and incorporating a signature which permits verifying its integrity .
If the contents of a document have been corrupted or its certificate revoked , a Trusted Computing platform will not permit it to be opened , and the Secure Internet will not permit it to be transmitted .
A document bound to a given user 's certificate , that of an organisation , or a specific computer may not be opened by others and will be stored in encrypted form which cannot be decoded without the requisite certificate .
“ Trusted Computing , ” in the current jargon , has little or nothing to do with traditional concepts of software reliability or data security .
Instead , it refers to an effort to embed end - to - end validation of the origin and integrity of data into computing hardware and system software .
One key component is the identification of each computer by a unique certificate , but the ramifications go far beyond this .
In addition to protecting computer users from insecure software ( software not signed with a recognised vendor 's certificate and verified unmodified by its digital signature ) , users are also protected against corruption of data on their own computers .
Data on a user 's own hard drive is encrypted and signed , permitting access rights and data integrity to be verified every time a file is loaded into memory .
This will completely eliminate the risk of viruses corrupting installed programs or data files .
It permits a software vendor to block the execution of any program deemed harmful , even retroactively ( since certificates will be verified online ) .
If a vulnerability is found in a software product installed on millions of users ' machines worldwide , it may be instantly disabled before it puts them at risk , forcing them to immediately upgrade to a new , secure version .
In many cases this will occur automatically — the user need do nothing , nor even be aware of the upgrade to the system .
On a Trusted Computing system , the ability to back up , mirror , and transfer data will be necessarily limited .
Hardware and compliant operating systems will restrict the ability to transfer data from system to system .
For example , software bound to a given machine 's certificate will refuse to load on a machine with a different certificate .
Perforce , this security must extend to the most fundamental and security - critical software of all — the ROM BIOS and operating system kernel .
Consequently , a trusted computing platform must validate the signature of an operating system before booting it .
Operating systems not certified as implementing all the requirements of Trusted Computing will not be issued certificates , and may not be booted on such systems .
Today , buying stuff on the Internet is a big deal — something which many people remain hesitant to do , being well aware of the risks of having their credit card hijacked and the myriad distasteful sequelæ thereof .
With the advent of certificates and Trusted Computing , these fears will dissipate .
With one 's personal certificate ( bound , perhaps , to one or more computers to which one has exclusive access , and secured by a pass phrase , smart card , or biometric identification ) guaranteeing the security of the connection , and certificates on the other end validating the identity of the vendor , much of the tedious process of present - day Internet commerce can give way to a seamless surfing and shopping experience .
A micropayment exchange permits payments to be made between any two certificate holders .
A user makes a payment by sending a message to the exchange , signed with the user 's private certificate , identifying the recipient by their public certificate and indicating the amount to be paid .
Upon verification of the payer 's and recipient 's certificates and that sufficient funds are available in the payer 's account , the specified sum is transferred to the recipient 's account and a confirmation sent of arrival of the funds .
Micropayment transactions can be performed explicitly by logging on to the exchange 's site , but will usually be initiated by direct connection to the exchange 's server when the user makes an online purchase .
Micropayment differs from existing online payment services such as PayPal and e-gold in that transaction costs are sufficiently low that extremely small payments can be made without incurring exorbitant processing fees ; with micropayment it will be entirely practical for Web sites to charge visitors a ten - thousandth of a Euro to view a page ; credit cards or existing online payment services have far too high overhead to permit such minuscule payments .
Note that there need be no upper limit on payments made through micropayment exchanges , and hence “ micropayment ” simply implies that tiny payments are possible , not that larger payments are n't routinely made as well .
The first broadly successful micropayment exchange is likely to be technology driven , but as micropayments become a mass market and begin to encroach on other payment facilities , pioneers in the market are likely to be acquired by major players in the financial services industry .
No more e-commerce paranoia … when you do business with vendors with certificates you consider trustworthy , you need n't enter any sensitive personal information .
Just click “ buy ” , select which of the credit cards or bank accounts linked to your certificate with which you wish to pay ( never giving the number ) , and your purchase will be shipped to the specified address linked to your certificate .
Even if your certificate is stolen , a thief can only order stuff to be shipped to you .
Each user can set their own personal default maximum price per page , per item purchased , per session , per day , per week , and per month .
I call this their “ threshold of paying . ”
No need to subscribe to a magazine 's site to read an article — just click on it and , if it costs less than your €0.05 per-item threshold and all of the other totals are within limits , up it pops — your account is debited and the magazine 's is credited .
If you 're a subscriber , your certificate identifies you as one and you pay nothing … and all of this happens in an instant without your needing to do anything .
The magazine gets paid for what you read , so they 'll put their entire content online , not just a teaser to induce you to subscribe to the printed edition .
And if you like what you read , you 'll return and spend more money there .
Want to start your own magazine ?
Decided your blog is worth € 0.001 per day to read ?
No problem…tag it with your certificate , set up a “ pay to read ” link to it , and listen to the millieuros tinkle into your virtual cookie jar .
Certified micropayment exchanges will , of course , be required to comply with “ know your customer ” and disclosure regulations , adhere to international conventions against money laundering , terrorism , and drug trafficking , and disclose transactions to the fiscal authorities of the jurisdiction of the buyer and seller for purposes of tax assessment .
This will largely put an end to the use of the Internet for financial crimes and eliminate the need for further regulations or constraints on Internet commerce .
Funding Fourmilab :
A Worked Example Just for fun , and to ground this discussion in reality , I worked the numbers for simplistic pay - per- page at my www.fourmilab.ch site .
All things considered , this site costs about € 5000 per month to operate : the bulk being communications and ISP charges , the rest depreciation on server hardware , utilities , and other overhead .
( I do n't count the value of my time , which amounts to many hours but , as one declares on the customs form , is of “ no commercial value ” . )
That works out to about € 167 per day .
I get about 500,000 page hits a day , so to fully fund the site , I 'd need to charge about € 0.0003 — that 's three hundredths of a centime per page .
These “ hits ” are generated by about 30,000 daily visitors ( see the Fourmilab Access Statistics for details ) , so the average cost to each of these users for the pages they view at Fourmilab would be about € 0.005 , half a centime per visit .
Now it 's certainly possible folks who visit Fourmilab would run away screaming at the thought of paying half a centime for the stuff they find here but somehow I doubt it , or at least I 'm confident enough in the value of my scribblings to think that , after the initial shock , they 'd come back .
By way of comparison , a user paying € 50 per month for cable modem or DSL access presently spends about € 0.07 : seven centimes per hour for Internet access whether they 're using it or not .
A naïve calculation of the average duration of a visit to the site from the number of visits per day suggests the average visitor lingers here about 20 minutes .
So , if they spend € 0.005 for documents retrieved during their visit , they 'd spend only about 20 % more for content than they 're already paying for Internet access .
And that would more than defray the costs of operating this site .
I invite proprietors of subscription and advertiser supported sites to work these numbers based on their own access profiles .
Micropayment provides a new business model to support Internet sites which attract large numbers of visitors but which have so far failed to fund themselves with subscriber or advertiser models .
Micropayment permits a site to make access available to whomever chooses to visit the site on a per-page basis ( or , as discussed below , even for excerpts from pages ) .
There is no need for a user to open an account or establish a commercial relationship with the site .
As long as the per page fee is less than the individual 's threshold of paying , the per-page charge is debited automatically from the user 's account and credited to the site's .
There 's no question that if many present - day sites started to charge , say , € 0.001 per page , their traffic would collapse .
But what about the sites you read every day ?
Is it worth a tenth of a centime per page ?
Have you compared what you 'd pay for pages with what you 're paying now for access to the Internet ?
The emergence of Weblogs ( “ blogs ” ) and other forms of independent Internet journalism has raised a variety of issues regarding free use of copyright protected material .
To what extent may a blog excerpt a document published on the Web ( with or without a link to the original source ) ?
Is it permissible for a Web document on one site to link directly to a document deep within another site 's archives , potentially bypassing advertisements on the site 's main page which fund its operation ?
Micropayment provides solutions for many of these problems .
As envisioned by Ted Nelson almost 40 years ago in his original exposition of Xanadu , the problem with copyright is n't the concept but rather its granularity .
( I 'd add , in the present day , the absurd notion that copyright should be eternal , but that 's another debate for a different document . )
Once micropayment becomes as universal as E- mail , a blog will simply quote content from a Web site using an “ excerpt URL ” ( I 'll leave the design as an exercise for the reader ) or provide a link to the entire document .
Readers of the blog will , if the excerpt is below their threshold of paying ( and the total of all excerpts in the blog is also below the threshold ) , see it automatically .
Otherwise , they 'll have to click on an icon to fetch it , approving the payment , before it is displayed .
Similarly , when following a link to a document licensed under one of the Digital Rights Management ( see below ) terms of use , you 'll automatically pay the fee and see the document unless it exceeds your threshold , in which case you 'll have to confirm before retrieving it .
Micropayment will greatly facilitate the deployment of wireless Internet access ( Wi - Fi and its descendants ) .
Wireless access today has an unsettled business model ; some coffee shops and bookstores provide free access to their clients ( and , constrained by Maxwell 's equations , those in the parking lot outside ) as an added value , while hotels , airline lounges , and soon long distance flights en-route provide access for a fee .
With micropayment , your wireless network interface will simply listen for bids of access and choose based on bandwidth and cost , normally accepting the best offer below the cost threshold you set .
If it 's higher than your threshold , or there 's an extreme tradeoff between cost and performance , you may be asked to choose , but usually you 'll just light up your laptop , wait a few seconds , and you 're online .
No mess , no fuss , and it 's guaranteed to cost less than your “ threshold of paying ” .
According to folklore , Michael Faraday , who discovered the principle of electromagnetic induction in the 1830's , was asked by a British politician to what conceivable use electricity might be put .
Faraday replied , “ Sir , I do not know what it is good for .
But of one thing I am quite certain — someday you will tax it . ”
This quotation is , in all likelihood , a myth , but nonetheless there is truth therein applicable to our times .
For electricity , a laboratory curiosity in Faraday 's time , was eventually taxed and , in many unfortunate jurisdictions , made a government monopoly or regulated to such an extent it was indistinguishable from one , inevitably becoming scarce , expensive , and unreliable .
Like electricity , the Internet will eventually be taxed .
As long as there are governments , this is inescapable .
While taxation is never without pain , micropayment can at least eliminate most of the bookkeeping headaches for both merchants and customers , with taxes due for Internet use and commerce collected automatically and remitted electronically to the jurisdiction to which they are owed .
Microsoft also warned today that the era of “ open computing , ” the free exchange of digital information that has defined the personal computer industry , is ending .

Net Plans Are About
by John Markoff , The New York Times , July 24 , 2002 .
Do you own the data
on your hard drive ?
Many computer owners would be astonished to discover the answer to this question is , in large part , no .
A present day mass market computer is typically delivered with more than 1
Gb of software pre-installed , virtually all covered by a vendor 's copyright and licensed to the computer 's owner subject to an End User License Agreement , to which the user must assent , implicitly or explicitly , before using the software .
While the owner of a computer may be permitted by the hardware and software to copy such files , whether making copies is permissible depends upon the terms of the licensing agreement and governing copyright law .
Many files downloaded from the Internet are similarly subject to copyright even if no explicit assent to a license is required on the part of the user ; documents of all kinds are “ born in copyright ” , and absent an explicit declaration to the contrary by the publisher or evidence that copyright has expired , may be used only as permitted by law .
The only files a user can be said to own outright are those containing content exclusively created by the user , and / or from the public domain ; these files a user is free to copy , modify , and distribute at their sole discretion .
Digital Rights Management makes no changes whatsoever to the laws governing use of copyright or licensed material ; it simply embeds enforcement of the already applicable rules into the hardware and software of users ' computers .
Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) is the current buzzword for the technological enforcement of intellectual property rights in digital media .
DRM will implement several categories of right to use content , some of which have no direct analogues in traditional publishing .
This is the traditional model of books , recorded music , videos , and shrink - wrapped software .
You pay a fee for a copy and usually assent to an implicit license not to copy and redistribute it .
However , there is no technological prohibition against your doing so and , in some cases , your purchase entitles you to lend the original document to others without paying additional fees to the publisher .
This is a phrase I 've coined to denote the concept of a document sold to a given individual which is either not transferable or , if so , can not be used to create additional copies .
When you purchase a pay per instance document , it 's “ bound ” to your personal certificate and possibly that of the computer on which you intend to view it .
If you copy the document you 've downloaded ( assuming your Trusted Computing platform even permits this ) to somebody else 's system , they wo n't be able to read it because they do n't have your certificate .
Giving them your certificate is equivalent to handing them copies of all of your credit cards and identity documents … unlikely .
If the document is , in addition , bound to a given computer system , you can read it on that system but , in order to transfer it to another ( for example , from your desktop computer at home to your PDA when going on holiday ) , you 'll need to perform a transfer which will render it readable on the PDA but no longer on the desktop .
You can always , upon your return , transfer it back in the other direction .
Pay per instance also permits ( publisher permitting ) , transfers similar to lending a printed book to a friend .
Suppose you 've downloaded a book to your computer , read it , and now wish to send it to your daughter at college .
No problem — just re-encode the book with her public certificate and E - mail it to her .
Of course , once you 've done that , you wo n't be able to read the book any more on your own system .
There may be a small fee associated with passing on the book but , hey , micropayment makes it painless and you 'd probably have to pay a lot more to mail a printed book anyway .
Publishers can sell library editions , perhaps at a premium , which can be transferred any number of times but , just like a book , the library can't check out a volume to another person until a borrowed copy is returned .
Pay Per Installation is similar to Pay Per Instance , except the content is bound to the certificate of the computer on which it 's installed , as opposed to the personal certificate of an individual .
Any person who uses that computer is authorised to access content bound to its certificate , but such content cannot be used on a different computer .
This category will primarily be used by commercial software installed on a computer .
Pre -installed software will , of course , already be bound to the computer 's factory - installed certificate .
When you purchase software , whether off the shelf or by downloading from the Internet , you will receive a copy which , before it can be used , must be activated online , which will bind it to the certificate of the machine on which it is installed .
The purchase of a copy of the software will usually entitle the customer to a single activation ; additional licenses for other computers may , of course , be bought as needed .
Just as with Pay Per Instance , the publisher of a Pay Per Installation product may permit you to transfer the product to a different computer .
If , for example , you replace your old clunker with a TurboWhiz 40 GHz box , you may be able to move your existing programs to it , going through an activation procedure which will render them unusable on the old machine and bound to the new one .
Or , on the other hand , the publisher may not permit this ; it 's up to the specific terms of the license .
This is how movies worked when I was a kid .
If you wanted to see the movie , you went to the box office , plunked down your fifty cents ( I was a kid a long time ago ) , and received a ticket which entitled you to see the movie ( plus the newsreel , the cartoon , etc. ) once .
When the show was over they turned on the lights and chased everybody out .
If you just had to see it again … another four bits , thank you very much .
This is the golden age media barons dream of while sleeping off the diverse intoxicants they 've ingested at sybaritic Hollywood parties .
As with Pay Per Instance , the content you download is bound to your personal certificate or that of your computer but , in addition , it 's limited to being played a maximum number of times , for instance , once .
Now , instead of struggling to find a song on a music sharing service under constant attack by music moguls , you can simply visit your favourite online music store , find the song that 's been going through your head for the last few hours , download it for a small fee and listen to it …once .
If , having listened to it , you 'd like to play it over and over or put it on a CD for your own use , pay a little more and buy a Pay Per Instance copy .
No more need to buy an album to get one or two hit singles — of course the singles cost more than the filler .
And no , you can't give a copy of the CD you made to your friends , since the songs on it are bound to your certificate and machine .
You can make as many copies as you like of your “ killer tracks ” CD and give them to your friends or sell them on the Net , but everybody who receives one will have to pay the license fee for each track in order to obtain the right to play it .
Note that pay per view has applications outside traditional entertainment media ; evaluation copies of software can be licensed to a user for a maximum number of trial runs , after which the user must either purchase a license permitting unlimited use , or some number of additional runs .
Software vendors offering evaluation copies on this basis are protected , since they record the user 's certificate when issuing evaluation copies , and refuse to issue more than one evaluation copy to any user .
This application of pay per view to software closes the loopholes which have made shareware a difficult business model .
Earlier attempts to protect intellectual property in the digital age have sparked an arms race between copyright owners and those who wish to freely copy protected works .
There are reasons to believe a comprehensive implementation of Digital Rights Management on a Trusted Computing platform will be a much tougher nut to crack , evolving in time toward effectively complete security ( defined as the point at which losses due to copying are negligible compared to the cost to reduce them further ) , much as has happened with digital satellite television broadcasting .
In the United States , the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , enacted in 1998 , criminalises reverse engineering and circumvention of copyright protection mechanisms , and has been interpreted as applying to even the dissemination of information regarding the design and implementation of copy protection technologies .
Given the political consensus which enacted this law , the stakes involved for media companies , and the investment now being made in Digital Rights Management technologies by computer hardware and software vendors , there is every reason to expect the near - term deployment of a highly secure system implementing all the varieties of right to use described above , which will not be widely circumvented .
Once Trusted Computing platforms which protect intellectual property rights are in place , this security can be extended to the Internet itself .
The ARPANET , precursor of the Internet , was designed to explore highly fault - tolerant networks for military communications .
In such networks , all communications links could be secured and the identity of all nodes on the network was known .
In today 's global , open access Internet neither of these conditions obtains , and many of the perceived problems of the present - day Internet are their direct consequences .
Tomorrow 's Secure Internet will be implemented in Trusted Computing platforms , in conjunction with Internet Service Providers and backbone carriers .
Today , any computer on the Internet can connect to any other connected computer , sending any kind of packet defined by Internet protocols .
This architecture means that any system on the Internet , once found vulnerable to some kind of attack , can be targeted by hundreds of millions of computers around the world and , once compromised , be enlisted to attack yet other machines .
The Secure Internet will change all of this .
Secure Internet clients will reject all connections from machines whose certificates are unknown ( this will be by service ; a user may decide to receive mail from people whose certificates are n't known to them , but choosing otherwise will block all junk mail — it 's up to the user . )
On the Secure Internet , every request will be labeled with the user and machine certificates of the requester , and these will be available to the destination site .
There will be no need to validate login and password , as the Secure Internet will validate identity , and , if registered , a micropayment account will cover access charges and online purchases .
Internet Service Providers will maintain logs of accesses which will be made available to law enforcement authorities pursuant to a court order in cases where the Internet is used in the commission of a crime .
In addition , The Secure Internet will protect the intellectual property of everybody connected to it .
Consumers will be able to download any documents on the terms defined by their publishers , which will be enforced by Digital Rights Management .
Publishers will serve documents , each identified by a certificate which identifies its publisher and its terms of use , and includes a signature which permits verification the document has not been corrupted subsequent to publication .
The technological precursors discussed above provide the foundation for the Secure Internet .
A typical individual Internet user visiting Web sites , performing searches , buying products and services online , sending and receiving E-mail and instant messages , participating in chat rooms , news groups , discussion boards , and online auctions will notice little change from the present - day Internet except , perhaps , fewer of the irritations which currently detract from these activities .
But the Secure Internet will be a very different kind of place , due to fundamental changes in the way those connected to it interact .
This section discusses each of these changes in detail .
The following section will sketch the consequences for various kinds of activity on the Internet once they have all been implemented .
Historical Precedent :
Telephone Caller ID
The Internet is n't the first communications technology to suffer from accountability problems .
In the years when telephones went from curiosity to ubiquity , the technology of the time was hopelessly inadequate to create a log of all local calls .
Whether completed through an operator or dialed directly , it was more economical not to meter connections nor log them than go to the expense of keeping records and billing by call .
Trunk ( long distance ) calls were relatively rare in those years ( I was a teenager before it became possible to directly dial another city , and I am younger than Benjamin Franklin ) , and they could be individually logged on paper , and later electromechanically for individual billing .
Notwithstanding a century 's tradition that local calls were anonymous ( unless one recognised the voice ) , most developed countries undertook the substantial cost to retrofit accountability in the form of Caller ID to the telephone system in the 1970's and 80's , rendering movie plots of earlier years which hinged on anonymous telephone calls as difficult to understand by those who grew up with Caller ID as are old movies which prompt present - day teens to inquire , puzzled , “ Why did n't she just call 911 on her cell phone ? ”
Caller ID is an excellent model for the evolution of the Internet .
Its origin was in remediation of the perceived social shortcomings of anonymity created by technological constraints which no longer existed .
And it was implemented and woven into the social fabric in a way which balanced competing priorities .
Individuals can block Caller ID when calling others , permitting anonymous calls to crisis centres and support groups ; emergency services can override the block to identify those who call them , and law enforcement , with a court order , can obtain telephone logs for crime investigations .
So it will be with the Internet .
Many of the problems of the present - day Internet , which engender numerous , mostly ill - considered , proposals for legal remedies , are due to the fundamental lack of accountability on the Internet .
The Internet , as presently implemented , affords its users a rather high degree of anonymity which permits them , if so inclined , to engage in various kinds of mischief with relative impunity .
Providing , or rather restoring , accountability to the Internet is the key technological foundation for fixing a large majority of its current problems .
The present - day anonymity of the Internet was n't designed in — it is largely an accident of how the Internet evolved in the 1990's ; see Appendix 1 for details .
Let us explore how accountability will be restored to the Internet .
The first step in restoring accountability to the Internet will be the introduction of the Internet User Certificate .
This certificate , without which no packets will be transferred across the Internet , uniquely identifies the person ( individual or legal entity ) responsible for sending them .
The best analogy to this certificate is not a telephone number , but rather the call sign with which radio and television stations , including amateur radio operators , identify their transmissions .
The Internet User Certificate is simply the unique identification of the person responsible for sending a packet across the Internet .
An Internet User Certificate is the credential which identifies its sender .
Compared to contemporary Internet access accounts , access by certificate has gravitas .
First of all , one may expect that , given the legal ramifications which certificates will have , sanctions against obtaining or using a certificate under false pretenses will be akin to those for obtaining a passport with forged credentials or presenting a forged driver 's license to a policeman in a traffic stop .
Accessing the Internet with a false certificate is equivalent to driving on public highways with a bogus number plate on your vehicle or crossing a border with a fake passport and will be subject to comparable penalties .
When you connect to the Secure Internet , your certificate will be transmitted to the point of access , which will then validate your certificate .
If its issuing authority fails to confirm its validity , or it has been revoked by its owner due to a compromise , or has been blocked pursuant to a court order , access will be denied .
Once your certificate is validated , you 'll be granted full Internet access , precisely as at present .
Your certificate will be logged along with the connections you make and furnished , on demand , to all sites to which you connect .
This will make e-commerce painless and secure .
Once you 've registered with a merchant , all subsequent communications are secured with your certificate .
You need n't memorise a user name and password for each site , nor worry about a merchant 's site being compromised threatening your security .
As long as you protect your certificate as you would your wallet or credit cards , you 're secure and , in the worst case , should your certificate be compromised , you can always revoke it and replace it with another .
In addition , the computer you 're using to access the Internet will be identified by its own certificate , which will also be provided on demand to sites you access .
While the most commonly used credential is your personal certificate , the computer 's certificate can be used to validate access to remote software components you 've licensed or , for example , to secure remote backups of files from the computer against access from any other computer .
Computer certificates will eventually be built - in by the manufacturer , much like the CPU serial number in Pentium III and later processors or , as is common in Unix workstations , in the form of an identity ( “ hostid ” ) chip which can be transferred from one machine to another in case of hardware failure .
The machine 's certificate will become the primary means of licensing commercial software installed on the computer .
Unlike present day ad hoc machine signature schemes or serial number checks in Unix workstation software , programs licensed to a machine 's certificate will be stored in encrypted form and decrypted with the machine 's private key from its certificate when loaded into memory .
This decryption will be performed in hardware or by the kernel of the Trusted Computing operating system , which itself will be locked to the machine certificate .
The large installed base of computers without certificates or hardware support for Trusted Computing operating systems will necessitate a protracted period of transition during which computer certificates are implemented in software and consequently less secure .
Users could , for example , obtain certificates for their own computers by presenting their personal certificate to the issuing authority .
The certificate would be delivered as a file to be installed on the machine to identify it .
Users may revoke machine certificates when a computer is scrapped or sold .
Once a machine 's certificate is embedded in hardware , computer theft becomes a less attractive criminal enterprise since a stolen machine will report its identity , and the personal certificate of its user , at the moment it connects to the Secure Internet .
If a machine is stolen , its owner may revoke its certificate , rendering it incapable of connecting to the Internet .
Even with certificates implemented in software , revocation ( or , in the case of theft where one hoped to eventually recover the computer , suspension ) of the certificate would block all software licensed to that computer at the moment it next connected to the Internet and performed a certificate validation .
Personal data on the hard drive of a stolen computer would be inaccessible to a thief because it is encrypted with the personal certificate of the owner .
With the advent of certificates for individual Internet users and computers , the Internet will go dark to snoopers .
Those who use the Internet will finally have grounds for confidence their private data , messages , and online financial transactions are secure .
Today , when you connect to an Internet commerce site , your browser receives and validates a certificate from the site which it uses to determine you are , in fact , connected to the site you think you are , not a false storefront put up by a crook intent , say , on collecting credit card numbers .
Your browser then negotiates a session key to encrypt the balance of your transaction with the site .
Typically then , if you 're already a customer , you log in with a user name and password you 've chosen for the site , which are protected against interception by the session 's encryption key .
If you 're a new customer , the user name and password you select , and your address , credit card number , etc. are similarly protected against interception .
With the advent of the Secure Internet , both parties to the transaction , you and the merchant you 're doing business with , will be uniquely identified by their certificates .
When you connect to the merchant 's site , an encrypted channel will automatically be established based on your certificate , your computer 's certificate , the merchant 's certificate , and that of the merchant 's computer .
Compromise of all four certificates would be required to intercept the data you send during the connection .
There will be no need for user names or passwords — your certificate will identify you .
If you 've decided to permit such disclosure , the merchant can even obtain information such as your shipping address , privacy preferences , and the like while validating your certificate .
If you prefer to keep such information private , you 'll have to enter it as you do now , or authorise its transmission to merchants on a case - by - case basis when first doing business .
But certificate - based encryption will extend well beyond Internet commerce .
On the Secure Internet , everything will be end - to - end encrypted in this manner .
When you establish a connection to any site at all , in any protocol , the four certificates involved ( yours , your computer 's , the site 's , and its computer 's ) will be validated and used to negotiate a key for the connection , which will be used to encrypt all data exchanged : E-mail , instant messages , Internet telephony audio , Web pages , everything .
What you exchange with a site while connected is entirely between you and the site .
Snooping by third parties is impossible .
Not only need n't you worry about somebody reading your mail or snatching your credit card number , a snoop wo n't even be able to know which pages you request from Web sites you visit , since the URLs of the pages you request and the content you receive will be encrypted .
( It will remain possible to determine which sites you visit by snooping packets and looking up the IP addresses of those you connect to . )
Certificate - based encryption will protect data on your computer even when you 're not connected to the Internet .
The file system in a Trusted Computing platform will automatically and transparently encrypt all files which belong to you with your certificate .
If multiple people share one computer , each will be able to read only their own files ; without the certificate of the other user , files belonging to that person , even if physically readable , will be gibberish .
If a computer is stolen or an unauthorised person gains physical access to it , users ' files cannot be read unless the criminal has also managed to obtain the certificates of their owners .
Files stored on removable media will be encrypted in the same fashion .
Compromise of private data by scanning backup media ( remarkably , many security - conscious people fail to ponder this threat ) cannot occur since the backed up files are encrypted with the certificates of their owners .
When sending a file to another person on a physical volume such as a floppy disc or recordable CD , it can be signed with the sender 's certificate and encrypted with the public key of the intended recipient who can thereby verify the identity of the sender .
Should the shipment be intercepted by a third party , its contents cannot be read without the intended recipient 's certificate .
With every Internet transaction tagged with the personal certificate of the requester and that of the computer where the request originated , operators of Web sites and other Internet services will be able to “ know their customers ” .
For the first time , Web sites will be able to compile accurate readership statistics , subject to audit by circulation bureaux , as for print publications .
This , in turn , may restore the viability of the advertiser - supported business model for popular Web sites .
Internet traffic can be logged and audited by others , for their own purposes , as well .
The ability to potentially recover a list of certificates of those who accessed a site containing prohibited content such as child pornography will deter those who now rely on the anonymity of the Internet to shield them from prosecution .
Sites indulging in hate speech and / or material of interest to terrorists will find their regular visitors scrutinised by the authorities concerned with such matters .
Societies which wish to control the flow of information across their borders can monitor the activity of their nationals to determine whether they are violating imposed restrictions .
Parents will be able to monitor the activities of their minor children using certificates they 've obtained for them which are linked to the parent / guardian 's certificate .
Digital Rights Management , secured technologically by Trusted Computing systems and legally by sanctions against reverse - engineering and contravention , will provide comprehensive protection for intellectual property of all kinds .
Items downloaded from the Internet : Web pages , books and magazines , music or video files , and all other forms of content will bear certificates which define the terms under which they are licensed to the user , which will be enforced in hardware and software .
Only data created entirely by the user ( for example , documents they 've written , pictures they 've taken ) and content in the public domain will be able to be freely copied , modified , transmitted , published , and used in other ways .
Naturally , users may apply Digital Rights Management themselves to content they create , specifying the terms under which others may use it .
For example , when circulating an E - mail draft of a scientific paper to a group of colleagues for comment , you may wish to “ license it ” exclusively to their certificates to prevent further dissemination should one of them prove indiscreet .
Intellectual property protection can be applied at a fine - grained level .
A Web page may include images and citations from other Web content licensed on various terms ; when the page is viewed , each inclusion is retrieved subject to its own license .
If an included item requires payment , confirmation will be required before downloading it or , if the fee is below the reader 's designated threshold of paying , the fee will be transferred automatically via micropayment .
With all parties on the Internet identified by the certificates they 're required to use to gain access and exchanged with all transactions , and hence mutually accountable for their online interactions , and Trusted Computing platforms guarding against fraudulent credentials or misuse of intellectual property , the foundation will be laid to fully apply certificates to content : every document transmitted across the Internet .
The first application of document certificates is already in use : signed applets downloaded by Web browsers which are run only if the certificate is verified as belonging to a trusted supplier and contains a signature which matches the content of the downloaded code .
( The MD5 checksums or PGP / GPG signatures posted for many OpenSource software distributions can be thought of as a crude kind of document certificate , manually validated by the user against a checksum or signature published on the Web site whence the package is downloaded . )
Trusted Computing systems will require all software they run to be signed with certificates , will verify the signature of each program before executing it and , when online , will ( periodically ) re-validate the certificates of installed programs with their suppliers .
If a program 's certificate has been revoked ( for example , if a critical security flaw has been found in it which requires an update to correct ) , the Trusted Computing platform will refuse to run the program , informing the user of the reason for the certificate 's revocation .
The computer 's operating system will bear its own certificate , which will be validated by the BIOS before the system is booted , protecting against unauthorised changes to the installed system or noncompliant operating systems which do not fully implement the Trusted Computing architecture .
A computer program is nothing more nor less than a sequence of bytes , like any other digital document .
Just as executable programs can , and will , be signed with certificates , so can Web pages , word processor documents , images , music files , and all other forms of digital data be signed .
Certificates are , in fact , an essential part of Digital Rights Management , and will routinely accompany files employing it , eventually encompassing virtually all files obtained from commercial sources .
Now let 's consider what happens when this architecture is extended to the Internet .
I believe the technological precursors described above will eventually be deployed in such as way as to turn the entire Internet into a Trusted Computing platform .
What , precisely , will this mean ?
Well , just as a Trusted Computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents , neither will the Secure Internet transfer any document , in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it .
( And by the time this is rolled out , consumer Internet access will long have been restricted to a short list of protocols on standard ports : HTTP , FTP , SMTP , POP , etc .
The peer - to - peer Internet , where any site could connect to any other on any port with any protocol will have passed into history as , indeed , is already beginning to happen due to NAT routers and firewalls which cannot be configured by the user to accept inbound connections . )
On the Secure Internet , E - mail messages will not be delivered unless signed by the originator 's certificate ; the recipient of such a message will know who sent it .
( A draft standard for a certificate - based mail transfer protocol was published in August 2003 . )
When a request is received by a Web site , it will be signed by the certificate of the requester ; sites will finally know who their visitors are .
And what about the Web page the site sends back to the user in reply ?
Well , that 's where things get really interesting .
Documents returned by Web servers will be required to be signed with a certificate and , as with all other traffic , the certificate will identify the originator of the page and contain a signature which permits the recipient to verify its content has not been corrupted .
But that 's not all a document certificate may be required to contain .
Suppose , in order to be transmitted across the Internet in reply to public HTTP or FTP requests , a document was required also to be signed by an authorised document registry , just as certificates are issued by a certificate authority ?
Imagine you 've just finished adding a new page to your personal Web site describing , say , your idyllic vacation in the Nibi -Nibi islands .
You 've got all the kinks out of the page , and now you 're ready to share it with the world .
Just one more thing … before the page can be transmitted beyond your Web server 's local network , it must bear a document certificate .
So , you pop up the “ Sign page ” box in your editor , click “ Sign ” , and a few seconds later you have a signed page to install on your server , whence anybody can download it .
What happened in those few seconds after you clicked the “ Sign ” button ?
First , the URL of the page was sent , along with your personal certificate , to your designated document registry ( if you do business with more than one , you 'll be asked to select which ) .
The document registry will then download the source for your page and all embedded content ( images , animations , etc. ) , and generate a certificate which identifies you as the author of the page , with signatures for the page and each of its embedded content components .
This certificate is then returned to you , where it 's stored with the Web page on your server .
The document registry will probably charge you a negligible sum of money for the certificate , which you 'll pay automatically with micropayment .
When you update the document , you simply submit the new version and obtain an updated certificate to accompany it .
When users access your document , its certificate is validated and , if good , the document is transmitted to the requester along with the certificate .
The requester can check the signature of what they received to confirm it agrees with what was signed .
If the user stores a local copy of the document ( whether this is possible and , if so , on what basis is up to you , as the author of the page , to determine ; Digital Rights Management will enforce whatever policy you select ) , the certificate will accompany the document and be checked against the document registry whenever it is accessed .
If you update your document you might , for example , tag the signature of the old version at the registry to notify anybody with a copy that an update is available ; the next time they tried to read their local copy , they 'd receive the notification from the document registry and be alerted to the update .
You could even , should you decide to digitally eat your words , revoke the document 's certificate ; anybody with a local copy would then , if online , be notified the document had been “ un- published ” and their copy rendered inaccessible .
This does n't violate the user 's rights in any way — you 're the author of the document ; you own the copyright , and you can control access to it in any way you wish .
You 're doubtless way ahead of me already in thinking of other things these document registries can do … .
First of all , they will , collectively , know when any page is published or an existing page is modified , and can provide this information to operators of search engines , as will be discussed in the next section .
Since the registries compute a document 's signature by examining it and all embedded content , they might , for example , compare those signatures with those of existing documents ( aggregated from all document registries ) and check for matches against documents flagged as copyright protected .
A match might alert the copyright holder of a potential violation by your page .
The document registry might , in the interest of compiling a comprehensive archive of the Web or , perhaps , encouraged by a government mandate , make an archival copy of all documents for which it granted certificates ; imagine how useful such an archive could be in resolving subsequent disputes regarding their content .
Why , the document registry could even , in the interest of wholesomeness or , perhaps , inspired by a public law , examine the contents of the document and match it against profiles of prohibited content , flagging it for possible scrutiny by those who occupy themselves with such matters .
Since a document cannot be transmitted across the Internet without a certificate validated by its document registry , nor can a user who has received a copy of such a document access it once its certificate has been revoked ( except on a machine which is never again connected to the Internet after receiving the document ) , should the document be found to infringe the rights of another party or violate the law in some manner , after this is established through due process of law , the document registry may be ordered to revoke the document 's certificate , un-publishing it .
Some might even fantasise that document registries could , based on signature comparison and heuristic examination of document contents , even refuse to grant a certificate for a suspicious document unless the publisher provided proof it did not violate copyright or laws regarding its content .
But that would constitute prior restraint on publication , which is unthinkable in a free society .
This , then , is the digital imprimatur ; the right to publish as , in olden times , was granted by church or state .
A document 's certificate , its imprimatur , identifies the person ( individual or legal entity ) responsible for its publication , provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified , and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which , on demand , will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked .
Trusted Computing systems and the Secure Internet will perform these functions automatically and transparently ; to a user browsing the Web , everything will look and feel precisely as it does today .
Certificates for variant content documents ( for example , stock quotes , weather information , search results , shopping cart contents at an online merchant site , etc. ) cannot include a content signature because each page returned to a requester is unique .
It would be absurd to demand a new document certificate be issued for each reply page , and doing so would compromise the security of user information it contained .
Dynamic documents may be accommodated within the digital imprimatur by registering a template and granting a document certificate for the result page based upon it .
Registries would examine template certificate requests carefully , especially if made by unknown publishers or those suspected of attempting to circumvent the requirement for document certificates .
Users of template certificates would be subject to audit by the document registry to verify the template was being used in the manner claimed when its certificate was granted .
Note : I am well aware that dynamic documents are a huge , gaping , ugly hole in the digital imprimatur scheme .
I have not expended a great deal of effort thinking about ways to better secure such documents ;
I 'm sure this issue will be explored in detail if and when document certificates are imposed on the Web .
Still , even though dynamic pages account for a large percentage of Web traffic , they are a minuscule fraction of the pages on the Web .
The large organisations responsible for variant pages which get large numbers of hits cannot afford to abuse the privilege of template certificates .
Commercial publishing houses , news media , and other organisations which publish large volumes of information or frequently - changing content ( for example , a newspaper 's site ) may be delegated the authority to act as their own publication registry in the interest of efficiency and quick reaction .
This is analogous to commercial broadcast stations which keep their own program logs .
As with a program log , the publisher 's document registry is subject to audit and must be publicly accessible to verify document certificates and provide notification of new publications .
Evidence of abuse of self - registry will result in withdrawal of the privilege .
It is a well - known fact that no other section of the population avail themselves more readily and speedily of the latest triumphs of science than the criminal class .

Does “ Computer Crime ” Exist ?
Every time an egregious crime is committed by means of , or with the assistance of a computer , the chattering classes become abuzz with the challenges posed by “ computer crime ” and politicians unveil draconian measures to restore law and order on the digital frontier .
But does “ computer crime ” actually exist , and is there a need for extensive new legislation and regulations to come to terms with it ?
I believe the answer to this question is no , and that whatever adjustments are required are minor definitional changes to already existing laws .
Here 's a mental exercise to illustrate this point .
Think of some offence which is usually considered to be a “ computer crime ” .
Now , see if the very same crime could have been committed without the aid of a computer ( albeit , perhaps , with more difficulty or with greater risk to the perpetrator ) .
If this is the case , then the use of a computer is entirely incidental to the crime — if it 's a crime without a computer , how does employing a computer to commit it make it any different ?
If a burglar breaks into a house with the aid of a crowbar , that is not an instance of “ crowbar crime ” requiring new laws regulating crowbars — it is breaking and entering , already a crime , which can be committed with a wide variety of tools .
The worked examples in this section illustrate how , once accountability is present , existing laws suffice to punish misbehaviour on the Internet .
The accountability and security the technologies described in the previous section will provide once fully deployed will put an end to a wide variety of poster child problems of the present day Internet .
Here 's a brief survey of some of the most obvious , each pitched as I expect it to be toward the constituencies concerned with each problem .
Digital Rights Management and Trusted Computing resolve most of the current problems with copyright violation on individual computers , and the Secure Internet will extend these protections to the entire network through document certificates .
Copyright holders can monitor newly published documents for violations and , if detected , begin a procedure which will result in the offending document 's certificate being revoked , un- publishing it on any machine which has stored a copy and is subsequently connected to the Internet .
The added security , plus the ability to make copyright protected documents available under a variety of license terms including pay per view with micropayment , will encourage owners of documents to make them available on the Internet where before they were hesitant due to fear of piracy .
Remember the story about the miscreant who hung a sign on an automatic teller machine that said “ Out of order — please use temporary ATM ” and set up his own bogus ATM next to it which simply read credit card stripes , recorded PINs , and flashed “ Temporarily out of order ” on its display ?
He collected the machine at the end of the day and did the obvious thing with the information it had obtained .
That was a crime .
Or how about the waiters in restaurants who make an extra imprint from your credit card and write down the little code on the back and go wild spending your money .
That 's a crime too , and the only computer used to commit it is made of meat .
Setting up a bogus
Web site or sending E - mail under false pretenses to obtain precisely the same information is likewise a crime .
The end to end encryption of all transactions on the Secure Internet will render identity theft schemes which rely on intercepting messages nonviable .
Trusted Computing platforms will protect against worms and viruses which install “ spyware ” on users ' computers to collect personal information , including credit card numbers , PINs , and passwords .
Access by user certificate will eliminate the need for users to keep track of a long list of login names and passwords , and the resulting temptation to store them insecurely or to use the same name and password on a number of sites , running the risk that if one is compromised , accounts on other sites will be as well .
Micropayment will eliminate the risk of identity theft by rogue merchants who collect credit card numbers from online purchases and then use them fraudulently , since the merchant will be paid through the micropayment exchange for the specific transaction approved by the user , and will never see the details of the account ( credit card , bank transfer , etc. ) with which the user paid .
Only the user can authorise a payment to a merchant ; without access to the user 's certificate , receipt of a payment does not provide the ability to make subsequent fraudulent charges , as possession of an individual 's credit card details does today .
Compromise of a user 's certificate remains a very serious matter , equivalent to having one 's wallet or passport stolen .
Certificates , like credit cards , can be quickly blocked , but a user who loses control of a certificate is in for the painful process of transferring everything bound to the old certificate to the new one .
Attempts to use the revoked certificate will trigger immediate warning flags , and the ability to determine the computer from which the attempt originated will help track down the culprit .
At least with certificate - based access the user need only worry about guarding one credential .
As the Secure Internet is put in place , users must be educated as to the importance of protecting their certificates .
Laws against wiretapping , electronic surveillance , including the laws and regulations governing when it may be employed by law enforcement , already exist and have for decades .
The nature of the Internet , which permits packets to be “ sniffed ” on local networks or intercepted at intermediate relays between the sender and receiver , may facilitate eavesdropping , but every kind of crime committed by such means had already been committed before 1870 on the public telegraph network , mostly by corrupt operators in telegraph offices .
In any case , once all traffic on the Internet is encrypted , eavesdropping will become far more difficult than in any earlier mass communication medium , while meeting the needs of law enforcement subject to due process .
Offering bogus products for sale is fraud , regardless of how orders are solicited and taken , and has nothing to do with computers or the Internet — I received my first Nigerian money scam delivered by the postman in 1982 !
Fraudulent offers made over the Internet constitute fraud no more and no less than identical offers made by a telemarketer or sent by FAX ; no additional legal sanctions are required .
In fact , when accountability is restored to the Internet , it will be far easier to identify and prosecute the perpetrators of such crimes via the Internet than those committed through other means .
The ability to identify the originator of messages of all kinds will deter “ pump and dump ” fraudsters in investment chat rooms and bulletin boards and provide the information needed to identify them should their behaviour merit investigation .
Every communication medium has spawned its own form of mass marketing : in the post : junk mail ; on your FAX : junk FAX ; over the phone when you 're trying to eat your dinner : telemarketers ; I even remember blaring sound trucks trying to get out the vote on election days when I was a kid : junk noise .
The only economic constraint on unsolicited commercial communications is the relationship between the cost to reach a given audience and the anticipated revenue generated from the message .
Spam has become a plague on the Internet simply because an enormous number of pitches can be delivered at negligible cost compared to other media , so regardless of how crude the message or the clientele it is directed toward , there is a reasonable expectation more than enough bottom feeders will respond to turn a profit .
Content - based filtering can eliminate a large percentage of junk mail but provokes an arms race between efforts to disguise junk mail and those of filters to unmask it .
The advent of true accountability on the Internet will make mass Internet junk mail a thing of the past .
With the ability to identify the person ( individual or business ) responsible for transmitting a message ( which will not be delivered without a verified sender certificate ) , those who abuse E- mail can be instantly and unambiguously blacklisted based on their certificates — messages they send will be discarded without any further need for user intervention .
No government involvement is required — a customer of an Internet service provider can subscribe to one or more independent databases of junk E-mail offenders and filter based upon their identities .
If a mass mailer attempts to obtain new certificates with fraudulent credentials or steals the certificates of others to forge messages with stolen identities , they are committing crimes for which they can be prosecuted .
Investigating such offences will be facilitated by knowledge , from the sending machine (s ) certificate , of the computer or computers where the fraudulent messages originated .
If an individual wishes to never see E- mail ( or other communications : for example instant messages , chat room text , news group and bulletin board postings , etc. ) from a given person , they need only press the “ Ban ” button in their client program whilst reading an offending message : subsequent messages signed by that originator will be silently discarded or ignored .
Since all of these media will only accept messages with a valid and verified certificate , filtering based upon it will be absolutely reliable .
The advent of Trusted Computing and the Secure Internet will close most of the vectors through which the present - day plague of computer viruses and worms propagate .
( The distinction between viruses and worms , murky enough already , is irrelevant to this discussion ; in the interest of brevity , I will use “ worm ” to denote all kinds of self - propagating programs , malicious or otherwise . )
As I write these words , my mail log is noting the arrival and automatic disposal of a Sobig .
F mail worm about every three minutes — more than 250 a day for the last several weeks .
Most worms propagate by exploiting security flaws , principally in the widely - used products of one major commercial software vendor .
While it makes sense to focus in the near term on remedying existing flaws and avoiding the introduction of new ones , errors and unanticipated consequences are inevitable in all fields of engineering , and systems should be designed to be robust even in their presence .
It is instructive to observe that most of the recent large - scale outbreaks of worms have propagated due to vulnerabilities already found and fixed well before the programs which exploit them were released into the wild .
The worms were able to wreak their havoc on the Internet because tens of millions of computers had not yet been updated to versions of software which correct the vulnerabilities the worms depend upon .
The combination of Trusted Computing and the Secure Internet will eliminate the risk posed by machines running software with known vulnerabilities .
Every program executed by a Trusted Computing machine will be signed with a certificate from its supplier .
Periodically , the operating system will re-validate the certificates of programs before running them .
When a critical security flaw is discovered in a program , its supplier can revoke the certificate for the vulnerable version of the program .
When a user next attempts to run the program , the operating system will discover the certificate revocation and refuse to run it until the user downloads and installs a patch or updated version which corrects the problem .
The certificate revocation will usually direct the user to the required update which , based on the user 's preferences , may be installed automatically .
Obviously , validating a program 's certificate requires the machine to be connected to the Internet .
But a machine which is not connected to the Internet can neither be infected nor infect other machines , and hence is neither at risk from , nor any risk to , others .
The Trusted Computing architecture will also guard against the mechanisms worms use to infect users ' machines and cause subsequent damage .
Most mail - and Web - based worms work by tricking the user or the user 's Web browser or mail client into executing a program which runs under the current user 's permissions .
A Trusted Computing platform will execute no program which does not bear a valid certificate signed by a supplier the user has chosen to trust , with a signature that matches the program about to be run .
Hence , even if the user is tricked into attempting to run a program , all that will happen is that a warning box will pop up indicating the program does not bear a certificate from a trusted vendor .
Expert users will be able to add vendors to their trusted list , but the typical user will have no need to do so .
Should a rogue vendor be discovered releasing malicious software , revoking the vendor 's certificate will automatically disable all programs signed with it .
Even if a malicious program manages to bypass all these safeguards and infect one or more executable files on a user 's computer , t
GARY LARSON GOES WILD GARY LARSON GOES WILD Larson is drawn to the wild side Endangered animals sold at market in Indonesia Banjo - playing days were an artistic low Larson is drawn to the wild side SEATTLE 
Sightings of retired Far Side cartoonist Gary Larson are about as rare as the exotic vipers , rhinos and cheetahs that graced his daily strip for its 15 - year run from 1980 to 1995 .
Like deer avoiding gun-toting hunters in his panels ( " Do I know this guy ?. .. I 've got to think , " one says as he hides behind a tree ) , Larson is elusive prey .
He rarely gives interviews .
He refused to have his picture taken for this article , preferring to remain anonymous in his home of Seattle , where his T - shirt - and - jeans wardrobe give him protective camouflage against would - be fans who might beg him to pick up his pen again .
But he agrees to endure a face - to - face interview ( " Going into it , my only goal was to survive , " he says later in an e-mail ) for something he cares deeply about — wildlife .
Larson 's cartoons abound with animals : elephants , wildebeest , frogs , bears , horses , salmon , birds , alligators .
The world , however , has n't been as kind to such creatures .
Larson 's hope that his work might aid in ending the destruction being wrought upon them and their habitats , especially in Southeast Asia , has brought him a tiny way out of retirement .
Not to get hopes up :
He 's not drawing again .
But for the first time in four years he is releasing a page - a- day calendar of some of his greatest hits , in stores now .
All his earnings from the 3 million calendars printed , about $ 2 million according to publisher Andrews McMeel , will go to Conservation International for the organization 's work to help end the illegal trade in Asian elephants , Indochinese tigers , Asiatic black bears , pangolins , freshwater turtles , and Siamese crocodiles in Cambodia .
The profits will also fund an awareness campaign in China aimed at reducing acquisition of of threatened species for exotic dishes , traditional medicine and for pets .
There are also projects in Indonesia and other southeast Asian countries as well .
LEARN MORE : Visit Conservation International to learn about the illegal trade of animals Species are going extinct about 1,000 times faster today than they did a few hundred years ago and than they have for most of human history , according to the United Nation 's Millennium Ecosystem Assessment released last year .
It found that in the last 50 years " humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history , largely to meet rapidly growing demands for food , fresh water , timber , fiber and fuel .
This has resulted in a substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth . "
" I can't imagine how we 'll be remembered by future generations if we allow this to happen , " says Larson .
It 's a holocaust , he says , only instead of killing off people , we 'll be " the flora and fauna Nazis . "
Dubbed " the unofficial cartoonist laureate of the scientific community " by Natural History magazine , Larson stepped away from his drawing table and retired from cartooning 15 years ago .
He still put together greatest hits page - a- day calendars but stopped even that in 2002 .
" The daily calendar seemed , to me , like a kind of cartoon black hole , and you did n't have to be a rocket scientist to know that that could n't be sustained indefinitely .
That 's why I pulled the plug on that one after the ' 02 edition .
Kind of a preemptive strike , " he says .
But in early 2006 his publisher Andrews McMeel approached him about doing another one , and Larson had an idea .
For many years Larson — along with a good number of the scientists he so lovingly lampooned — have become increasingly concerned about the environment .
On a diving trip in the Galapagos a decade ago , he met someone who worked with an international non-profit group called Conservation International .
He liked what he heard and become a donor .
Now he wanted to do something bigger .
When his publisher McMeel called , " I knew I had to open my mouth and say something , " he says .
That said , the unassuming Larson is n't convinced of his appeal , even 26 years after becoming a cartoon superstar who was syndicated in more than 900 newspapers , receiving several National Cartoonists Society 's awards for best syndicated panel and having a biting louse — Strigiphilus garylarsoni — named in his honor .
" At least ( the calendar ) can die on the vine for a good cause , " he says .
Species may go extinct , but not his fans .
Far Side calendars sell " four to five times more than any other calendar we have , " says Borders ' Linda Jones .
" I call it the Harry Potter of calendars . "
A massive two - volume set of his entire collected works — at $ 135 a copy — has sold 350,000 , and it was the most expensive New York Times bestseller ever at the time it was published , says Hugh Andrew of Andrews McMeel .
Each of his 23 books of collected cartoons are still in print and they 've sold a combined 45 million copies .
Larson 's genius was that he took the modern sensibility of the comedic revolution going on in the late 1970s , " all attitude and irony , " and married it to the craft of the comic art , says Robert Thompson , a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University in Syracuse , N.Y .
" I 'd put him up there with Krazy Kat 's George Herriman , Nancy 's Ernie Bushmiller and Peanut 's Charles Shultz as one of the great artists who have worked in the field of American comics , " Thompson says .
Larson had a dedicated audience " that just worshiped him , " says Tim McGuire , a professor of journalism at the Walter Cronkite School at Arizona State University , former editor of the Minneapolis Star Tribune and former president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors .
" He definitely broke ground .
Some people just hated it , just did n't get it , why would you run that silliness ?
And his fans were so ardent and so dedicated , " McGuire says .
But you do n't get a sense of his lofty status when you meet Larson for the first time .
He has the air of a very nice person who , if asked by a total stranger at a bus stop to donate a kidney , might find himself saying " Well , I was kind of using it .
But sure , I guess , if you need one that badly ... "
Larson and his wife , Toni Carmichael , like things low key .
One of the reasons they chose Conservation International is because it seemed to fly be flying " under the radar . "
" We started thinking who would be a good organization to work with .
We like them because they seem to be doing conservation in the trenches .
They seemed more into doing the work than making glossy magazines . "
Shy Guy Larson has thinning blond hair and a slightly sheepish attitude .
He arrived a few minutes late for an interview that took two months of careful negotiation with the very protective FarWorks staff that runs his legacy .
" I was worried because we were late .
I thought you might leave , " he says .
This is not a rock star .
But he 'd like to be .
Well , not a rock star .
A jazz guitarist .
Actually , he is a jazz guitarist .
Since retiring , he 's occupied his time with travel and some scuba diving but more and more he 's gravitated back to a long - time love : music .
" I actually find a lot of parallels in jazz and cartooning .
( Maybe the greatest one being how you can suddenly find yourself in deep doo doo ) , " he says later via e-mail .
After college in the early 1970s he and a friend started a band named Tom and Gary , which friends immediately dubbed " two guys as exciting as their names . "
Tom on the trombone .
Gary on banjo .
But in need to pay the bills , he went to work for the Humane Society , as a cruelty investigator .
His cartoons bear the inspirational hallmarks of encounters with pets and their owners .
Consider the man reaching down to pet a dog clutching a chain saw while its owner says " I would n't do that , mister ... Old Zeek 's liable to fire that sucker up . "
Or dogs disguised in hats and coats suddenly leaping over the Post Office counter at carriers arrayed behind it .
It was during his time at the Humane Society that Larson really started working on cartooning .
He first sold a weekly panel to the Seattle Times and then , in 1979 , was offered a syndication deal with the San Francisco Chronicle and the Chronicle Features Syndicate .
" It was no guarantee , but it was a foot in the door , " he says .
For two or three months he drew eight cartoons a week and sent them in , to convince his editors that he could actually keep up with the demands of a daily space .
It was a lot of work .
" One week I submitted eight cartoons and they rejected seven , " he remembers .
But his editor clearly understood the fragile ego of a newly hatched cartoonist .
" He was worried about how I 'd take it .
He sent back line - by - line explanations , telling me which ones were almost there . "
Larson smiles ruefully .
" I sometimes refer to subject matter that 's a little arcane . "
The open question is whether his subject matter became less arcane or it merely seemed less arcane because his cartoons had found their natural audience , the scientists , geeks and nerds of the world to whom Petri dishes and protozoa are Dagwood sandwiches and Charlie Brown 's footballs .
While he appealed to all , his focus on animals and bumpy guys in lab coats has meant that scientists harbor a special soft spot for the Far Side .
It 's almost impossible to visit a lab anywhere in the English - speaking world where there are n't at least a few Far Side cartoons taped to the doors , the windows , the machinery or fluttering on a bulletin board .
In some labs it seems as if the walls themselves might not stand were it not for the accretion of Far Side cartoons that cover every available surface .
" Like most scientists , I find him inordinately clever , " says Don Kennedy , the editor - in - chief of the prestigious journal Science .
" There 's something wonderfully sardonic about the human characteristics he gives to animals .
There are so many particular circumstances in science that can be perfectly illustrated by a wry single frame .
The trouble with Doonesbury is you really need the strip .
Larson gets it in one . "
One of the nation 's preeminent biologists , E. O. Wilson at Harvard , says he , like most scientists , " will be glad to get anything from Larson , even if it 's recycled . "
" Every lab in America is festooned with Gary Larson clippings , " says Wilson .
In the world he creates in his cartoons , so many of which touch on science , " he identifies the foibles of scientists in an affectionate way . "
Wilson notes proudly that Larson , too , began his training as an entomologist ( that would be a bug scientist ) , just as he did .
Then he throws in a plea .
" Tell him if he ever wants to start drawing cartoons again , he 'll have an eager audience awaiting him , " Wilson says .
But Larson says he does n't miss it .
" It was 15 years of deadlines , " he grimaces .
" It can be torture .
The clock is ticking on the wall and I 'm thinking ' Where is this going ? ' and staring at a blank sheet of paper . "
" Every week when my batch of weekly cartoons would go to FedEx it felt like a small miracle .
Then in a few days , it 's ' Here we go again . ' " After 15 years of grinding creativity , Larson had had enough .
He says he respected the readers too much to ever start phoning it in .
And he feared the fate of what 's known in the cartooning world as " The Drawing Dead , " cartoonists whose work goes on for decades without ever changing .
" You know , those cartoonists where you think ' Is n't he dead ? ' or ' Should n't he be dead ? ' " he says .
Larson 's last cartoon ran on Jan. 1 , 1995 and he now lives a quite happy , un - deadlined life , in Seattle with his wife .
" It was a good gig , " he says .
Origins Larson grew up in Tacoma , Wash .
into a family with , as he puts it , " a morbid sense of humor " and an older brother who " scared the hell out of me , " whenever he could .
He went to college at Washington State University in Pullman .
where he started out studying science and ended up studying how to write TV commercials .
After college he " bounced around , " as he says .
It could be that the narrative path of Gary Larson is not yet complete .
Or that it 's part of some meta - narrative so large as to be indiscernible to an ordinary human .
Much like the woman in one of Larson 's cartoons who is on the phone with a neighbor saying " Could you go to your window and describe what 's in my front yard ? " as a giant eye fills her front window .
Today Larson and his wife lead a life that 's remarkably similar to the one they led back when he worked as a cartoonist , without the deadlines .
In a city dotted with newly - retired Microsoft millionaires sporting the highest - end techno gadgets and over - the - top house renovations , theirs is a very low - key withdrawal from the work - a - day world .
They moved from one leafy , green Seattle neighborhood to the next neighborhood over , considered quite tony in its day though not quite so happening today .
They travel , though not as much as they did right after he retired .
For awhile Larson was quite into diving , but he does n't do that as much these days .
They have long raised bull mastiff dogs .
Their last one died a while back , but they 're " in the throes of a puppy search " this month .
Carmichael , Larson 's wife of 18 years , early on took over as his business manager , a task he says he was entirely unfit for .
Trained as an anthropologist , she realized he simply was n't the person to negotiate business deals .
" She 's my pit bull , but a nice one , " he says of her .
Larson says his interest in science , or at least creepy - crawly things , probably had its start at his grandparents ' house on Fox Island in Puget Sound just off the Tacoma Wash .
Shore .
" They lived by a great swamp .
Today it would be called a wetland .
But it was a textbook swamp .
Crystal clear water , sandy bottom .
Salamanders everywhere . "
It was fed by a small creek and right behind the high tide drift line .
The " frosting on the cake " was that the area was a major habitat for western fence lizards .
It was a " wondrous place " where he spent hours playing as a boy , Larson says .
Today the swamp is gone .
" Filled in and a house or two now stands there , and the creek is just a landscape feature through someone 's yard .
But the other creepy thing is that , while the drift line is obviously still there , the lizards are all gone .
I 've gone looking for them , walking among the driftwood on a warm , lizardy kind of day .
Not a one . "
And that 's the problem , he says .
Everything is getting filled in , dug up , overrun and generally made uninhabitable for everything but humans .
Places where animals can live in peace , or at least live , are being destroyed at an increasing rate .
" Our species is rife with greed , war and destruction .
But this is new .
It 's all happening on our watch .
It creeps me out , the rate at which we 're pushing species to extinction , " he says bleakly .
Larson clearly feels an affinity with animals , be they the " charismatic megafauna " that make us all want to race out and save the rainforest ( there 's a reason the World Wildlife Fund uses the panda for its logo ) or lesser newts .
So protecting wildlife is " at the top of my list , " he says .
Some days he finds himself staring at the walls , wondering how things could have gone so terribly wrong for our planet .
Donating the money from the calendar is one attempt at helping to fix it , and stop fixating on it .
" I 'm trying to get it off my conscience , " he says .

Attention is paid to hair .
In our culture the hair industry is huge — shampoos , conditioners , coloring , cutting , shaping , styling .
For “ hair - loss treatment ” alone , Google conjures up 749,000 references .
Some people undergo surgical procedures , sometimes uncomfortable and expensive , to implant hair .
Total hair loss is often an unfortunate and undesirable complication of the agents used to treat and cure cancer .
Yet baldness — the hairless look — can for some represent spirituality and religion , or for others may suggest that they are athletic , smart , cool , reeking of testosterone .
Depending on where you are in your life , what you are doing , your age and sex , baldness is loved or hated — or just accepted .
Baldness can be bought and bought off .
But it is not a medical treatment , at least not since shaving the head for lice was stopped .
In one patient , however , shaving the head was life saving .
A 50 - year - old woman was admitted to the hospital with complaints of severe weakness and difficulty breathing .
She had been quite healthy until the afternoon of the admission , with no history of serious illnesses .
British psychologists have shed light on one of the most enduring mysteries of human courtship : why men persist with chat - up lines that send most women running for the hills .
A survey of people 's reactions to chat - up lines revealed that while women were more likely to favour lines suggesting that a man was a nice guy , or at least fun to be with , men were consistently over - optimistic that women would find them irresistible if their opening gambit was sexually explicit .
The Edinburgh University - based team compiled a list of 40 chat - up scenarios from books , websites and films and asked groups of male and female students to vote on how the woman in each situation was most likely to react .
The chat - up lines used by the men fell into four categories , depending on the impression the man was trying to give of himself .
They ranged from attempts to appear cultured ( " It 's at moments like these when I am reminded of Byron " ) ; to the meaningless compliment ( " Did it hurt when you fell from heaven ? " ) ; the sexual reference ( " I may not be Fred Flintstone , but I bet I can make your bed rock " ) , to the humorous ( " Hi , how do you like me so far " ) .
During the survey , 266 women and 115 men rated the chat - up scenarios from one to five , with one indicating that the woman was likely to stop the conversation immediately .
Unsurprisingly , the study found that women rated chat - up lines depending on their personalities , with extroverted women preferring more humorous approaches and tough - minded women finding " nice guy " chat - up lines a turn - off .
" The interesting difference appeared when we compared the sexes , " said Peter Caryl , a psychologist on the study , which appears in the journal Personality and Individual Differences .
" Despite being deeply unpopular with women , men are unreasonably optimistic about how well their sexually explicit lines will go down , " he said .
The researchers believe it is possible that men use chat - up lines to do more than attract women , choosing their lines so they appeal to personality types they are interested in .
" While the woman 's attractiveness will be known in a face - to - face encounter , the man may need to make a rapid assessment of her personality , and he could potentially achieve this through his opening remark , " the authors wrote .
The study suggested that men's chat - up lines helped to pigeon - hole them into one of four categories : the friendly and considerate " nice guy " ; the industrious and enterprising " provider " ; the confident and strong " leader " , and the fickle and conceited " bad mate " .
" I can't imagine anyone being turned on by this " bad mate " kind of guy , but some women seem to be less put off than others .
If you look like George Clooney , you may be able to get away with a whole range of things , " Dr Caryl said .
Virus writers have unleashed a worm that attempts to delete MP3 files from infected machines .
The Deletemusic worm spreads via removable devices .
As soon as an infected device is accessed the worm will be executed .
Thereafter it copies itself onto all drives , including removable devices , and executes whenever Windows is started up on compromised PCs .
The worm is spreading , albeit modestly , causing a small number of infections .
Anti-virus vendors such as Symantec rate it as a low to no -risk threat .
Malware capable of zapping MP3 files is rare but far from unprecedented .
The Klez - F worm , for example , which was widespread in 2002 , overwrote MP3 files ( and other file types ) on certain days of the month .
The Scrambler worm was programmed to scramble MP3 files to sound like a scratched record while the Mylife - G worm overwrote MP3 files with the words " my lIfE " .
None of these items of malware made any attempt to differentiate between legitimate and illegitimately obtained music files .
The authors of Deletemusic - the latest example of the genre - remain unknown .
Vigilante virus writers or mischief makers are the probable perps though the involvement of music industry itself in some form or another is n't entirely implausible , given past form .
Either way the consequences of infection are serious for infected Windows users .
" With so many people relying on their PCs to store their digital music , rather than physical CDs , a worm capable of deleting an entire MP3 collection could leave someone thousands of pounds out of pocket , " said Orla Cox , Security Operations Manager , Symantec Security Response .
" We would recommend all users with MP3 files on their PCs to remain cautious about the removable media devices they are using in their machines . " ®
The Benefits and Risks of Genetic Engineering and Nanotechnology
There has been a lot of news lately concerning genetic engineering and nanotechnology .
These news reports typically fall under two opposite categories , which are either that these technologies will solve a lot of the world 's problems or they will be the sources of more problems .
Here are some possible benefits and disadvantages with these technologies .
First , genetic engineering and nanotechnology are predicted to be great , because they will directly solve several of the world problems .
For example , genetic engineering researchers are trying ( if they have not already succeeded ) in developing super - antibiotics , designer virus or hunters that only attack certain diseases such as cancer , new abundant food sources ( imagine food growing year round in almost any climate ) , regenerate body parts , and even grass that only grows two inches long so that it never needs to be mowed ( this is my personal favorite ) , just to name a few possible predictions .
Furthermore , nanotechnology researchers are predicting making computers thousands of times faster , smaller , and more energy efficient , and microscopic machines that can even perform medical operations inside the human body .
Imagine a mini - robot painlessly cleaning your arteries from the inside .
I am sure the true outcomes of these technologies are something even the most imaginative person could not possibly imagine .
Naysayers are predicting that these technologies are going to destroy humanity and the planet , and they are asking these types of questions .
What if super - plants cross pollinate with weeds , would we get super - weeds ?
What if nano - machines continuously replicate themselves and ultimately devour the human race ?
Or if we develop super intelligent species or machines that are smarter than human beings , would we be replaced ?
Religious fundamentalists are asking if we even have a right to modify life ?
All of these questions are serious and realistic concerns , but can the human race survive as we are forever ?
No .
Should the human race continuously try to improve the world for the benefit of humanity ?
Yes .
The rewards greatly out weigh the risks , but the risks are greater than the human race has ever faced before .
Only if humanity can practice extremely stringent methods of preventing these technologies from getting out of control , can humanity be guaranteed a future .
Either way , these news reports rightfully predict that these new technologies are the future , unavoidable , somewhat unpredictable , and everyone should heavily invest in the companies researching these technologies to make a small fortune .
Only time will tell who is right .

( CNN ) -- Chinese products have become so prevalent in the United States that they 're on just about every store shelf and in everyone 's reach .
But the sheer volume of imports means many are out of reach of government regulators .
Chinese products have come under renewed scrutiny after a series of recalls this year .
It 's a growing problem that came to a head this summer after American consumers faced scare after scare over Chinese products , from seafood they serve friends to toys they give their children to the food they give their pets .
" China is the Wild West right now because their regulatory system lacks the strong food and drug and cosmetic standards that were developed in the last 100 years , " said Sally Greenberg , senior product safety counsel with the U.S. Consumers Union , the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine .
" Anything that does not meet our standards should not be allowed to be imported . "
Peter Morici , a business professor at the University of Maryland and a former chief economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission , says China is benefiting from a tilted trade balance with the United States that has allowed its manufacturers to run rampant .
Beijing , he says , is " letting manufacturers do whatever they want without regulation to the point that it borders on atrocities . "

" They 're basically producing poisonous products , selling them to their own people and then selling them on to us , " he said .

According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , 40 percent of all consumer products imported into the United States last year -- nearly $ 250 billion worth of goods -- were manufactured in China .
From 1997 to 2004 , the CPSC said , the share of all U.S. imports of consumer products from China increased by nearly 300 percent , a trend that is likely to continue .
The CPSC also said 60 percent of all recalled consumer products in the United States this year have come from China -- from toys and jewelry made with lead - based paint to small , defective space heaters that could result in fires .
See products that have been affected »
There have been other major revelations of tainted Chinese goods .
The United States in late June banned five types of fish and shrimp from China because inspectors found traces of cancer - causing chemicals and antibiotics , including malachite green .
It helps fish survive in polluted , crowded fisheries .
The seafood ban came on the heels of a massive pet food recall earlier this year after thousands of cats and dogs were sickened -- the number of reported deaths varies -- by pet food containing wheat gluten made in China tainted with the chemical melamine .
Beijing stands by its products and says people should not be worried about " Made in China " goods .
" Consumers should n't be scared of Chinese products .
They should have a reputation of being good quality , cheap and safe , " said Qin Gang , a spokesman for the foreign ministry .

China food imports
The following are among the top food products from China brought into the United States :
 Apple juice
 Mandarin oranges
 Confections / candy
 Dried garlic
 Cocoa butter
 Hog guts , bladders , stomachs for sausage casings
 Dry berries
Source : USDA
However , even inside China , there have been shocking revelations in recent months :
Pigs fattened on force - fed wastewater , dairy cows given so many antibiotics they can't produce yogurt from their milk and lard made from sewage .
A Chinese government report earlier this month found that 80 percent of food and products for domestic consumption passed inspection -- meaning that nearly 1 in 5 failed to meet minimal standards .
That 's just the tip of the iceberg , according to Zhou Qin , a dissident writer who has researched China 's food standards .
He said he believes the situation is much worse than anyone realizes .
Farmers and producers , he said , are continually finding new and dangerous ways to cut costs .
He cited the example of a farmer in the south who he said deliberately added a cancer - causing chemical to pigs because it made the flesh look better and less fatty .
When he challenged the farmer about the potential health dangers , Qin said he replied , " People in the city get free health care . "
" The threat is so much more serious than people could ever imagine , " Qin said .
" China has low labor costs , but you can work out how low the price should be .
Businessmen should know something is wrong if the product is cheaper than it should be . "
Test your knowledge on Chinese imports to U.S. »
For its part , Beijing has announced a series of measures to try and stem the flow of tainted products , including an immediate ban on diethylene glycol , a solvent found in antifreeze that was being used in toothpaste .
Beginning in September , all food exports will have an inspection and quarantine symbol to signify the product 's safety .
China also has shut down three companies -- two for producing the tainted pet food and one for the toothpaste .
In addition , Chinese health inspectors have closed 180 food processing factories because authorities say formaldehyde , illegal dyes and industrial wax were being added to candy , pickles , crackers and seafood .
The former head of China 's Food and Drug Administration was executed in recent weeks after being found guilty on corruption charges -- a step the government said should serve notice to others trying to cut corners .
Back in Washington , the issue of just how safe Chinese products are has taken on a renewed focus .
There have been congressional hearings , and just last week President Bush tapped a new government panel to come up with recommendations within 60 days on ways to guarantee food safety and other products coming into the United States .
The head of the panel , Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt , said he has spoken with Chinese officials about the safety of their products and they are " taking this very seriously , and they should . "
" We 're working with many countries , China among them , to assure that their practices are what we would expect as American consumers , " he said .
" I think it 's clear to China that the ' Made in China ' brand is very much something they need to protect . "

The method involves monitoring body temperature
The symptothermal method ( STM ) assesses fertility levels during the monthly cycle by measuring body temperature , and observing cervical secretions .
The Human Reproduction study found using STM correctly led to a rate of 0.4 pregnancies per 100 women per year .
UK experts said natural family planning was effective - provided it was taught properly and carried out correctly .
A University of Heidelberg team assessed STM in a study of 900 women .
The lowest pregnancy rate was found among women who abstained from sex during their most fertile period , as defined by STM .
SYMPTOTHERMAL METHOD
Start of fertile period :
The first fertile day is when the woman first identifies either : 1 ) first appearance or change of appearance of cervical secretion , or 2 ) the sixth day of the cycle .
After 12 cycles , this second guideline is replaced by a calculation that subtracts seven days from the earliest day to show a temperature rise in the preceding 12 cycles .
End of fertile period :
The fertile phase ends after the woman has identified : 1 ) the evening of the third day after the cervical secretion peak day , and 2 ) the evening when the woman measures the third higher temperature reading , with all three being higher than the previous six readings and the last one being 0.2 degrees Celsius higher than the previous six .
Among those who used a barrier method during this time , such as a condom , the pregnancy rate rose to 0.6 pregnancies per 100 women per year .
Even among those women who had unprotected sex during the fertile period , the pregnancy rate was only 7.5 pregnancies per 100 women per year - around a quarter of the rate one would usually expect .
The researchers believe this was because the women probably only had unprotected sex around the boundaries of their most fertile period .
For a contraceptive method to be rated as highly effective it should lead to less than one pregnancy per 100 women per year when used correctly .
Effective alternative
Lead researcher Dr Petra Frank - Herrmann said : " We maintain that the effectiveness of STM is comparable to the effectiveness of modern contraceptive methods such as oral contraceptives , and is an effective and acceptable method of family planning . "
CHANGE IN CERVICAL SECRETION
The amount of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone varies in the menstrual cycle , which alters the quantity and the consistency of cervical mucus
Just before ovulation the secretions become clearer , wetter , stretchy and slippery , like raw egg white
STM is governed by a precise set of rules , which do take some time to learn .
Some studies have suggested that a woman 's libido is higher during her fertile period , and this could be one of the reasons why natural family planning methods have had a reputation for being less effective than other methods of family planning .
However , Prof Frank - Herrmann said : " There are studies that suggest that this is only the case for a small proportion of women , and that , in fact , women also identify other parts of their cycle with increased sexual desire . "
Toni Belfield , of the Family Planning Association ( FPA ) , said : " Natural family planning when taught properly and carried out correctly is a highly effective method of family planning .
" Research has always shown that combining two or more fertility indicators is more effective than relying on a single fertility indicator .
" FPA has always provided full information about natural family planning as this is an important contraceptive choice for women to know about and use . "

Microsoft Invades Accounting
Upgrading to Windows Vista has been banned by the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) , the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) , technology giant Texas Instruments and other corporations and government agencies ( V1 , V10 , V11 ) .
These organizations are evaluating their options , but overseas it 's turning into a stampede to get out of Microsoft software ( V15 ) .
School districts in the U.S. are starting to move entirely to Linux rather suffer the cost of upgrading Windows .
Examples are the Windsor Unified School District in Northern California and the Bexley , Ohio high school district .
Schools making this move have been surprised how easy it is and how much money is saved .
( V6 , V8 ) Leading computer maker HP is reporting " massive deals for Linux desktops " with corporate clients ( V4 ) .
Runner - up computer maker and long time faithful Microsoft ally Dell has been overwhelmed by demand and has started developing Linux desktop preloads for their notebook and desktop computers ( V9 ) .
Even that great bastion of the status quo , the Wall Street Journal , has published an article under the title Linux Starts to Find Home on Desktops ( Business Technology , 13 Mar 2007 ) .
Small business and consumer demand for computers with Windows XP is very high , but Microsoft has moved swiftly to make sure they can't get it .
No sane person wants Vista , so Microsoft is making sure they have no choice .
It 's becoming clear people are going to be holding on to their XP machines as long as they can .
Chip manufacturers in particular face a damaging glut of memory and CPU chips because the anticipated Vista upgrade demand is n't materializing .
One gigabyte of RAM memory is the practical minimum for Vista ( except Home Basic which will run in 500 megabytes ) .
What went wrong ?
Basically , Vista was designed with almost no consideration for the needs of Microsoft 's customers .
James Allchin , co-president of Microsoft's Platform Products and Services Group wrote an internal memo saying that Microsoft had lost touch with customer needs and if he did n't work there he'd buy an Apple Macintosh ( V12 ) .
Allchin retired the day Vista shipped .
Vista and its companion programs , Office 2007 and Internet Explorer 7 , offer precious little Windows users want beyond what 's in Windows XP , but plenty they do n't want .
A confusing new user interface .
Vista actually reduces user productivity according to a consulting firm 's study ( V7 ) .
Blamed for so many security problems , Microsoft has placed security responsibility right where it does n't belong , squarely on the shoulders of the average user .
Confusing security pop-up dialogs are so common users get used to just hitting " Yes " automatically to everything , including malware .
Most existing software is not compatible with Vista .
You will have to purchase upgrades to almost all the software you run and many programs will never be upgraded to Vista .
It 's an exercise in frustration to try to upgrade an XP computer to Vista .
Few Vista drivers are available except for new devices designed for Vista , and manufacturers do n't plan any .
Even many current printers do n't have Vista drivers , and many never will .
Developing Vista drivers and getting them approved by Microsoft is just too expensive .
Vista is effectively a Windows price increase .
Vista Home Basic , shipped with lower cost consumer market computers , is rather minimal , This often forces a $ 79 upgrade to Home Premium ( equivalent to Windows XP Media Center ) or Ultimate for $ 139 .
Vista 's built - in Anytime Upgrade handles that - have your credit card ready .
Actually all versions are on the machine but must be " activated " .

Vista 's built - in handles that - have your credit card ready .

Vista Activation is a hassle and failure prone , but Microsoft says they 'll be turning the screws down even tighter due to rampant piracy already taking place .
This does little harm to the pirates , just to legitimate users ( V5 ) .
Vista Activation , should it fail or be aborted , phones home to Microsoft with enough details to identify your computer and possibly your location ( V3 ) .
Vista 's much ballyhooed security has already been shattered in various ways , and Microsoft 's One Care , intended to protect Vista from malware , has scored at the very bottom in independent tests of anti-malware programs ( V2 ) .

Microsoft 's draconian DRM ( Digital Rights Management ) features not only interfere with your enjoyment of entertainment media you have purchased , but force you to have a much more powerful and expensive machine just to achieve XP level performance ( V14 ) .
Windows Update is now mandatory .
What 's wrong with that ?
You have no defense against patches that break other stuff .
Worse , Microsoft has promised the media moguls they will cripple your computer if any DRM problems are found with your computer 's hardware or drivers - this by Windows Update , of course ( V14 ) .
if any DRM problems are found with your computer 's hardware or drivers - this by Windows Update , of course ( V14 ) .
Microsoft president Steve Ballmer said Vista was so good a service pack would not be needed .
Service Pack 1 went into " critical " development even before Vista 's public release at the end of January .
There are flaws aplenty .
Why did they do this ?
Most new features originally planned for Vista were dropped in favor of one : a draconian DRM ( Digital Rights Management ) scheme .
See my editorial Vista - Broken by Design for the details .
All other features were of lower priority and the needs of customers were disregarded if they conflicted with DRM .
Microsoft hopes to parlay secure DRM into a monopoly on distribution of so called " premium content " .
Once they have lured the studios into the deal and established the monopoly they can dictate terms to the studios the way Apple dictated terms to the record companies based on the iPod success , but on a much larger scale .
Microsoft is depending on the unbounded greed of the media moguls to pull this off , but word is the moguls are starting to wonder if DRM is a good idea after all .
It is causing them a lot of trouble , has done nothing to stop piracy , and has caused tremendous ill will and bad publicity .
Clearly ill will is of no concern to Microsoft .
A recent patent filing reveals they have a whole lot more pain and expense planned for you in the future ( V13 ) .
What should Microsoft do ?
Their most basic mistake is " one size fits all " , holding that an entertainment device is equally suited for business .
This is now obviously and painfully false .
Microsoft should immediately develop a version of Vista for business with DRM completely stripped out .
Perhaps they could disable playing of " premium content " entirely if they could do it cleanly - " premium content " has no place on business computers anyway .
Will Microsoft do this ?
No .
Instead they will " stay the course " , increasing PR expenditures , working on ways to kill Windows XP to force Vista adoption , and ramping up their misinformation and FUD ( Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt ) attacks on Linux to " full rabid " shrillness .
What should you do ?
Every business should be taking a long hard look at moving to Linux .
Yes , there will be costs involved , and employees will gripe initially , but those who have done this find an overall cost savings .
eComStation ( formerly IBM's OS / 2 ) is another good alternative for general business , but lacking specialty applications .
I find it hard to recommend Apple - applications are limited and it's a closed proprietary environment run by a person of proven greed .
It seems like jumping from the frying pan into the fire .
I understand that many small businesses are dependent on specialty software the publishers of which support only Windows - even if it'll actually run on Linux .
It 's time to start pressuring them for Linux versions and / or support .
Remember , there 's worse to come ( V13 ) .
If you happen to be such a software publisher , it 's time for you to take a good hard look at producing Linux versions yourself .
Microsoft has already killed a huge segment of the commercial software industry and you are on their list .
Sooner or later it 's your turn .

PARIS , May 30  The European Union 's highest court ruled today that an agreement providing for the transfer of extensive personal data on air passengers to the authorities in the United States was illegal .
The decision forces the two sides back to the negotiating table at a time when privacy safeguards are increasingly being debated .
The European Court of Justice , in Luxembourg , overruled a May 2004 decision by the European Commission and the European Council , which represents national governments .
The agreement , which took 18 months to negotiate and was set to last through the end of next year , gives American counterterrorism authorities access to 34 different types of information about passengers on all flights that originate from the 25 member states .
The court upheld a challenge to the agreement brought by the European Parliament , which was not consulted when the accord was reached amid intense pressure from the Bush administration following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
However , it sidestepped the thorny question of whether the transfers of passenger records  including names , passport details , credit card numbers , addresses and phone numbers  violated the civil rights of European citizens .
Parliamentary opponents of the agreement nonetheless said they were pleased with the ruling .
" The European Court is saying yes , the European Parliament was right , that the data transfer agreement is illegal , " said Graham Watson , a British member of the European Union Parliament and chairman of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe .
" What will now be needed is some pretty tough talking to get a new agreement in which our concerns about privacy are properly addressed . "
The court gave the European Commission a four - month grace period , until Sept. 30 , to negotiate a new treaty with the United States , during which time passenger records would continue to be provided according to the terms of the original agreement .
" This puts European airlines flying passengers in and out of the U.S. in a real dilemma , " said Watson .
" Either they violate E.U. law and give the U.S. what they want or the risk the States turning around and saying your airplanes can't come here . "
At the Department of Homeland Security in Washington , Jarrod Agen , a spokesman , pointed out that the court 's decision specified that the existing system could stay in force through September .
" The planes will continue to fly and the security data will continue to be exchanged , " he said .
" There wont ' be any lowering of the data protection standards or effect on passengers or disruption to air traffic in the near term . "
Mr. Agen said that the department 's lawyers were still reading the European decision , but that " the court did not take a view on the content of the agreement .
It was looking at process of the European Commission in making the agreement with the U.S. "
Mr. Agen said that all the information now given by the airlines , within a few minutes of the plane 's departure , was information that the United States could obtain by interviewing passengers as they arrived .
Security is strengthened by having it in advance , he said .
The information includes the passenger 's name , the date of the reservation , date and place of ticket issue , payment details , and use of a travel agent , among other items .
The department can use it to look for patterns and identify travelers it finds suspicious , he said .
Europeans are by far the biggest visitors to the United States .
In 2004 , the most recent year available , 9.6 million European Union citizens entered the United States , according to a Department of Commerce survey of air travelers .
That represented 48 percent of all international air travelers entering the country .
European civil liberties groups were outraged when the European Union signed the accord two years ago , arguing that it did not ensure the same degree of privacy protection as exists under European Union law .
The United States did agree to restrict access to the data to certain United States agencies and limited the amount of time that such data could be stored .
But civil libertarians say Washington has so far failed to adequately safeguard the data against hacking or other misuse .
Opponents cited Congressional testimony in February by the director of the federal Transportation Security Administration , Kip Hawley , who said his agency could not yet guarantee that the privacy of passengers ' personal information was fully protected and announced an audit of its system for screening passenger information against a terrorist watch list .
Sophie in 't Veld , a Dutch member of the European Union Parliament and a vocal opponent of passenger data transfers , added that the first evaluation of the agreement 's effectiveness in fighting terrorism was completed in March of this year but that the report has been kept confidential by mutual agreement of the union and United States .
" The one question that has never been answered is , does it actually work ? " said Ms. in 't Veld .
" How many terrorists did they catch ?
How many international criminals ?
How many attacks did they prevent ?
And how many mistakes were made ?
We do not know because this information has never been made public .
It is outrageous . "
Parliamentarians expressed hope that their concerns would be taken into account when European Union and American officials sit down this summer to hammer out a new accord .
However , they were disappointed that the European Court did not explicitly direct the commission and the council to give Parliament joint oversight in approving any new accord .
" The court has indicated that the commission should put it forward as a security measure , which still means that the Parliament would not have to be consulted , " Mr. Watson said .
Nonetheless , he said , " I think that it would be very difficult politically for the commission and governments to do this again . "

UCLA Engineering researcher Jinsong Huang ( left ) and Professor Yang Yang -- they are striving to improve LEDs .
Credit : UCLA Engineering / R.Hutchinson
Two researchers at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science want to make sure future generations of flat panel TV watchers will see games like the upcoming NBA Finals in the brightest , most beautiful color possible — for a lot less money .
Most people do n’t think much about the inner workings of LEDs , or light - emitting diodes , which illuminate today ’s TV screens and cell phones , but making these LEDs more efficient , cheaper and higher quality is the obsession that occupies the daily thoughts of materials science and engineering professor Yang Yang and his graduate researcher Jinsong Huang .
Yang and Huang have recently achieved the highest lumens per watt ever recorded for a red phosphorescent LED using a new combination of plastic , or polymer , infused liquid — and they did it at half the current cost .
Yang and Huang ’s latest record will be presented at the Society for Information Display 2007 conference in Long Beach , Calif. , from May 20 through 25 .
“ That means your next LED flat panel TV could be less expensive , ” Yang said .
“ And the picture will be brighter and clearer than ever before . ”
LEDs are generally measured in lumens per watt .
Lumens , a measure of the perceived power of light , and watts , a standard measure of power , combine to define the optical efficiency of power — in other words , how bright a device is and how much power it consumes .
Current red LEDs generally score around 12 lumens per watt .
Yang and Huang ’s newest device rates a record - breaking 18 lumens per watt .
“ That ’s a significant difference , ” Huang said .
“ Visually , it means you get a higher quality display , and the product is also lighter and thinner .
And with our improvements , you also need less energy , but you get an all - around better product . ”
Conventional organic LEDs are made from a variety of organic semiconductor materials and have a complicated multiple - layer structure formed by expensive thermal evaporation techniques constructed to control charge flow in the device .
Liquid crystal display ( LCD ) televisions , for example , require polarization , color filters and other components to make the resulting picture clear and bright .
The more you build into a product , Yang said , the more energy it takes to run it , and the bigger it is .
In Yang and Huang ’s new polymer light emitting diodes , the devices have a very simple single - layer structure , generated by a much cheaper solution process .
The new LED , or more precisely PLED , developed by the two UCLA engineers uses a polymer powder and liquid mixture added to a previously top - secret material developed by the Canon company to create a paint - like product .
The product is used to coat a layer of glass , and a charge is added .
The end result is a slim single layer of glass with two electrodes .
“ It ’s a much simpler , lighter , thinner and more elegant answer to creating a better LED product , ” Yang said .
Yang began his high - performance PLED research at UCLA Engineering in early 2003 with a then - graduate student named Qianfei Xu , who was part of the professor ’s research group , and achieved a record - high efficiency for green PLEDs .
“ The current results represent our ongoing quest to create better , slimmer , less expensive high - performance PLEDs , ” Yang said .
“ Using our simple solution method , we already have successfully achieved several world records in device efficiency , including 20 lumens / watt white emission fluorescent PLEDs , 30 lumens / watt green emission fluorescent PLEDs and 18 lumens / watt red emission phosphorescent PLEDs .
So our latest red emission PLED is just one of our multiple records .
It ’s a very exciting development . ”
The new technology , which already has been licensed by Canon , should be available to consumers in about three years .

For decades , many of the brightest graduates in economics sought their fortune in finance .
In coming years , they will seek it in marketing , as the Internet gives all companies the information - rich environment once available only in financial markets .
Varian
That ’s the prediction of Hal Varian , an economist at the University of California at Berkeley .
Mr. [… ]
CodeGen
type StackDepth = Int type Gen = CodeGen () StackDepth ( ) addDepth :: StackDepth ->
Gen add Depth i = do d
The addDepth function changes the current stack depth by grabbing the old one , adding the argument and storing it back .
The getState and setState functions do n't generate any code , they just manipulate the state available in the CodeGen monad .
With that out of the way , let 's implement code generation for addition .
gadd ::
Gen gadd = do pop ebx pop eax add eax ebx push eax addDepth ( - 1 ) It pops the two operands off the stack , adds them , and pushes the result .
The net effect on the stack is that it has one word less on it ( I count my stack depth in words ) , so there 's also a call to addDepth .
Subtraction and multiplication are very similar .
gsub ::
Gen gsub = do pop ebx pop eax sub eax ebx push eax add Depth ( - 1 ) gmul :: Gen gmul = do pop ebx pop eax imul InPlace eax ebx push eax addDepth ( - 1 ) On the i386 ( signed ) division and remainder is computed with the idiv instruction .
It divides the EDX : EAX 64 bit number with the given operand .
So we must convert a 32 signed number to a 64 bit signed number , this is simply done by moving EAX to EDX and then shifting right 31 steps .
This will copy the sign bit into every bit of EDX .
Depending of if we want the quotient or remainder we need to push EAX or EDX .
gquot ::
Gen gquot = do gquotRem push eax add Depth ( - 1 ) grem :: Gen grem = do gquotRem push edx addDepth ( - 1 ) gquotRem :: Gen gquotRem = do pop ebx pop eax mov edx eax sar edx ( 31 :: Word8 ) idiv ebx
To put a constant on the stack we simply push it and increment the remembered stack depth .
gconst :: Int ->
Gen gconst c = do push ( fromIntegral c :: Word32 ) addDepth 1 OK , so now for something more interesting .
Assuming we are generating code for a function , we also want to access the arguments to the function .
Where are the arguments ?
Well , according to the IA32 calling conventions the caller pushes the arguments on the stack , so we 'll follow those .
First we have a bunch things on the stack , how many is kept track of in the stack depth in the CodeGen monad , and then the arguments follow in order , pushed right - to - left .
So to get an argument we compute the offset , convert it to a byte offset , and push that word on the stack .
--
Get the Nth argument gargN :: Int ->
Gen gargN n = do d
When generating code for a function we should not clobber any callee - save registers , so to be on the safe side we save all used registers on function entry and restore them on function exit .
On function exit we also return the result in EAX .
savedRegs = [ ebx , edx ] --
Push all register we 'll be using , except eax .
gprologue ::
Gen gprologue = do mapM_ push savedRegs --
Pop return value to eax , restore regs , and return gepilogue :: Gen gepilogue = do pop eax mapM_ pop ( reverse savedRegs ) ret OK , so that was a lot of stuff , let 's put it together for a test .
testGen = conv_Word32ToWord32 ( ) ( length savedRegs + 1 ) $ do gprologue gargN 0 gconst 1 gadd gepilogue main = do test
The testGen function generates the prologue , push argument , push 1 , add , and the epilogue .
The conv_Word32ToWord32 ( from my previous post ) converts the machine code to a Haskell function .
We also have to give the start value of the stack depth .
The stack initially contains the return address and the saved registers , so that 's the number we pass .
Running this gives 11 , as it should .
OK , so let 's actually write a compiler and not just a code generator .
Here is a data type for integer expressions .
data Exp = Con Int | Arg Int | BinOp BOp Exp Exp deriving ( Show ) data BOp = Add | Sub | Mul | Quot | Rem deriving ( Show )
We have constants , arguments ( variables ) , and a few binary operators .
It 's all easily translated to machine code .
translate :: Exp ->
Gen translate ( Con c ) = gconst c translate ( Arg n ) = gargN n translate ( Bin Op op x y ) = do translate x ; translate y ; binop op where binop
Add = gadd binop Sub = gsub binop
Mul = gmul binop Quot = gquot binop Rem = grem
For simplicity , let 's compile only functions of one argument for now .
compileIOW32 :: ( Exp -> Exp ) -> IO ( Word32 -> Word32 ) compileIOW32 f = conv_Word32ToWord32 ( ) ( length savedRegs + 1 ) $ do gprologue translate ( f ( Arg 0 ) ) gepilogue
This function takes an Exp - > Exp function , by giving this function the argument Arg 0 we get an expression to translate .
We tack on the usual prologue and epilogue .
So let 's try it .
main = do let fun x = BinOp Add x ( Con 1 ) test Which prints 11 .
But yuck , writing BinOp etc. is n't nice .
Let 's make some instances .
instance Eq Exp instance Ord Exp instance Num Exp where x + y = BinOp Add x y x - y = BinOp Sub x y x * y = BinOp Mul x y fromInteger i = Con ( fromInteger i ) instance Enum Exp instance Real Exp instance Integral Exp where quot x y = BinOp Quot x y rem x y = BinOp Rem x y
And give it a whirl : main = do let fun x = ( x+1 ) * x `quot` 2 test
And this prints 55 , as expected .
Not bad , a compiler from ( a tiny subset of ) Haskell functions to machine code in a few pages .
But I do admit being embarrassed about generating such incredibly poor code .
But there 's always future blog posts to rectify that .
Labels : Code generation , Compilation , Haskell
In my last post I played a little with Harpy to generate code from what looked like assembly language .
So the next logical step is to make a compiler .
And I mean a real machine - code compiler , not some wimpy byte - code nonsense .
To make life simple ( it is acompiler , after all ) I 'm going to start by generating code that uses the stack all the time .
So all operands will live on the stack and all operations on them will push and pop the stack .
Of course , the code generated from such a compiler will make any serious compiler writer weep .
Thetype in Harpy is the monad used during code generation .
It allows you to keep some extra information around besides the generated code ; it gives you access to a state monad .
I will use the state to keep track of the current stack depth .
( We will see why soon . )

BREAKING : FCC Chairman Kevin Martin said Thursday that the commission told large telcos to stop blocking calls into numbers for the Iowa - based free calling operations , threatening punitive actions if the carriers did n’t comply .
While the immediate FCC pressure was a victory for the Iowa telcos and Internet calling concerns whose services had been blocked by AT&T and Qwest , left unsolved is the separate question of whether or not the large carriers have to pay up the millions in disputed connection fees into the Iowa - based operations .
But Martin , after a scheduled public appearance in Silicon Valley , made it clear that the commission took immediate action against the moves to block or restrict calls , saying they were in violation of FCC rules .
“ We actually contacted the companies that were listed in the press [ reports ] and said our rules prohibit you from blocking consumers ’ access to any of the service providers , ” Martin said .
Martin said the informal communication to the big telcos who were blocking calls was that if they did n’t stop immediately , the commission would start a formal process for legal recourse within days , and “ would end up taking action as we saw necessary . ”
According to Martin , all the offending telcos responded and said they would stop blocking — sort of .
“ One had stopped blocking , but we heard complaints the next week that they were restricting access , sort of narrowing the pipe , ” said Martin .
“ We called them back and said , no , no , you ca n’t artificially degrade [ service ] either . ”
On whether or not the FCC would force AT&T and Qwest to pay disputed access - charge bills , Martin said that was a separate issue , and covered by petitioning processes that might take further time to resolve .
“ If you have a dispute about the intercarrier compensation rules , you can file petitions , and come to the commission to get redress , ” Martin said .
“ But you ca n’t just stop letting consumers make those calls . ”
More from Martin ’s talk with Silicon Valley digerati coming in a later post .

++ FEATURE : Japanese Music File Sharing : a 2007 Update
Over the past few years , I 've often been asked if file sharing
- especially music file sharing - is as widespread in Japan
as in the US and Europe .
My answer has generally been something
along the lines of 'it certainly exists here , but the number
of people doing it is pretty small compared to most other
countries . '
In just the past year , though , we 've seen a sharp
increase in action taken by Japanese record industry and
copyright organizations to step up efforts against file
sharing .
Here is a timetable of the most important developments from
last year :
** Jul. 25 : RIAJ releases the results of a July survey
showing that 3.5 % of Internet users in Japan ( 1.76 million
people ) had used file - sharing software in the past year .
** Sep. 25 : Responding to a motion filed by RIAJ members
and affiliates , the Tokyo District Court orders 3 major
Internet service providers to disclose the names and
addresses of 19 individuals believed to have uploaded
music files using file sharing software .
** Oct. 20 : JASRAC sends a formal complaint to YouTube ,
requesting the company to remove copyrighted content .
YouTube responds by immediately deleting 30,000 Japanese
video files .
** Nov. 26 : A group of Japanese rights organizations , led
by JASRAC and RIAJ , start the ' Ongaku Ihan ' campaign .
Running through Jan. 31 , the campaign is directed largely
at mobile phone users , describing the legal and security
issues surrounding file sharing .
** Nov. 27 : A 45 year - old Nagasaki man is arrested for
offering free copyrighted ringtones on his own mobile site
without permission .
** Dec. 5 : JASRAC formally contacts YouTube , requesting
preventative measures against the upload of copyrighted
videos .
** Dec. 13 : Isamu Kaneko ( the developer of Winny , Japan's
most popular file - sharing application ) is found guilty of
assisting copyright violations and sentenced to pay a fine
of JPY1.5 million ( US $ 12,500 ) .
Kaneko's trial had lasted over
two years , and he is expected to appeal the ruling .
** Dec. 19 : YouTube responds that it would like to send some
of its senior staff for a meeting with JASRAC
** Dec. 21 : A group of Japanese rights organizations , led by
JASRAC and RIAJ , announce that the three major wireless
carriers - NTT DoCoMo , KDDI and SoftBank - have agreed
to take measures to prevent sharing of digital music files
for mobile phones .
I found the last announcement about mobile file sharing
particularly interesting , as well as the Nagasaki arrest
for ringtone uploading , which I believe is the first of its
kind in the world .
I suppose it's not so surprising that mobile file sharing
has become a major concern here - after all , 90 % of digital
music downloads in Japan are to a mobile phone .
Researching
further , though , I was a bit taken aback at just how prevalent
these free mobile sites are , especially compared to just one
year ago , which was the last time I had looked into the issue .
At that time , there were just a handful of sites with very
rough instructions for making your own chaku-uta ( mastertones ) .
This time , though , I was quickly able to find several
' underground ' sites offering free mastertones and full - song
downloads , and also encouraging other users to create and
upload their own files .
Sites such as ' Muryou Shugi '
( which translates roughly to something like ' Free-ism ' )
provide very detailed information now on how to convert
tracks from a CD to the various formats , and anonymous
bulletin board sites such as 2 - channel offer tools for
making the handset - specific adjustments needed to obtain
the best sound quality .
Although it does take a little effort to make your own
mastertone and full - song tracks for mobile phones , the tools
are for the most part readily available .
Each carrier also
issues its own tools to each ' official ' content provider for
enabling the finished file to be set as a ringtone on the
phone .
Just looking at some of the posts on 2 - channel ,
however , it appears that ' unofficial ' tools which do the
same thing are also available to anyone for free download .
It remains to be seen what specific measures will be taken
by the wireless carriers to prevent file sharing and illegal
distribution to mobile phones , but this will no doubt be an
issue to watch in the coming year .

** Mora teams with Mixi for music distribution
Label Gate , a joint venture of Japanese record companies
which runs the Mora online music download service , announced
last month that it will partner with popular SNS service Mixi
to offer music through the ' Mixi Music ' corner of the site .
Mixi music features ranking lists of songs by genre .
Some of
the song titles will contain a Mora icon that starts up
Windows Media Player and allows users to hear a sample or
purchase the song for download .

** RWC to sell tube amp and speaker set for iPod
In brief : On January 25 , RWC will begin selling the
RM -VA1S audio system for iPods in Japan .
The new system is
a tube amplifier and speaker set with a docking port for
all iPod models that is aimed at fans of high - quality ' classic '
audio equipment .
The RMVA1S will have an open price , but is
expected to sell at around JPY69,800 ( US$ 580 )

** Dwango offers two new ' mega - iAppli ' games
In brief : Ringtone and mastertone content provider Dwango
released two new mobile game offerings last month for their
services on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode portal .
The first is a
Japanese geography and history quiz game called
' Go Tochi Kentei ' , while the second is a role - playing
adventure game called ' Fuurai no Shiren MEGA ' .
The games
are both implemented as ' mega - iApplis ' , meaning they use
the latest incarnation of NTT DoCoMo's DoJa platform for
mobile Java applications and have a greater size capacity
than previous i-applis .
The two new games can only be
downloaded to 903i phones , the most recent series of
i-mode handsets .

** Hitachi set to release W43HII handset
In brief : Hitachi announced that it will begin selling its
new W43HII handset for KDDI in mid-January .
The new model
features improved video quality for viewing ' one - seg ' programs ,
and Hitachi says that the handset allows for up to 4 hours
and 15 minutes of continuous viewing .

But what precisely is coming to an end ?
Neoconservatism in all its pomp conceived - in the Project for a New American Century - that , following the collapse of the Soviet Union , the world could be remade in the American image , that the previous bipolar world could be replaced by a unipolar one in which the US was the dominant arbiter of global and regional affairs .
In fact , the Bush administration never came close to this .
For a short time it did succeed in persuading the great majority of countries to accept the priority of the war against terror and seemingly to sign up for it : even the intervention in Afghanistan , in the aftermath of 9/11 , elicited widespread acquiescence .
But the US singularly failed to command a majority of states in support of the invasion of Iraq and garnered even less support when it came to global public opinion .
It demonstrated its unilateral intent by ignoring its failure to gain assent within the UN and invading Iraq , but the subsequent failure of its Iraqi adventure has served only to reinforce its isolation and demonstrate the folly of its unilateralism .
Its strategy in the Middle East - always the epicentre of the neoconservative global project - lies in tatters .
Elsewhere the neoconservative project was stillborn .
North Korea was branded as part of the " axis of evil " but the US , in agreeing to the six - party talks as a way of handling the crisis on the Korean peninsula , tacitly admitted that it simply did not enjoy enough leverage to deal with the Kim regime .
This was demonstrated more forcibly with its failure to prevent the recent nuclear test , and the US 's subsequent dependence on China for seeking some means of engaging North Korea in dialogue .
In fact China has now cajoled the US into accepting the need for it to do something it had previously resisted : entering into direct talks with North Korea , with China playing the role of honest broker .
For all the neoconservative bluster , the US is simply too weak in east Asia - and China too strong - for it to be anything other than a secondary player in the North Korean crisis .
It has been a striking illustration of the slow , remorseless decline of American influence in the region .
Meanwhile , in the region that it has dominated for well over a century , which it has traditionally regarded as its own backyard and in which it intervened with impunity throughout the cold war - namely Latin America - the US is now facing its bleakest ever situation , far worse than anything the Cuban regime represented during the cold war .
The US is confronted with a formidable and well - resourced adversary in Chávez 's Venezuela , and a continent in which the left has made extraordinary progress .
The Bush administration , so far at least , has been quite unable to halt its growing isolation in Latin America and the left 's onward march .
Even in the Middle East , the weakness of the neoconservative position has become increasingly evident in its handling of Iran , another member of the " axis of evil " .
As in the case of North Korea , the US , partly as a result of its preoccupation with the occupation of Iraq , in effect devolved negotiations over Iran 's nuclear ambitions to the group of four consisting of Germany , France , Russia and the UK .
Although the west Europeans have been happy to do most of America 's bidding , Russia has not and nor , it would appear , has China .
Both are permanent members of the UN security council , and both are resistant to sanctions and the threat of military action .
As a result , negotiations over Iran have been mired in something of an impasse .
Of course , if the neoconservatives had felt strong enough , they could have forced the issue in a manner similar to their approach in Iraq .
The point is that they did not .
And now it would seem inconceivable that they can contemplate military action against Iran .
On the contrary , the tables appear to be in the process of being turned : the US , instead of seeking to isolate Iran , is now likely to need Iranian and Syrian support in helping to sort out the debacle in Iraq .
Taken with the failure of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the continuing disaster of the occupied territories , we can see that the US is in retreat .
Ever since 1956 , it has been increasingly and formidably dominant in the region , with Israel riding pillion , and since 1989 it has been the overwhelming arbiter of events there .
This year marks the beginning of the decline of American power in the Middle East , with untold consequences .
Here we can see the cost of Bush 's adventurism for American imperial power .
In failing to understand the inherent limits of US global power consequent upon deeper , though seemingly unrecognised , longer - term global trends , the Bush administration hugely overestimated American power and thereby committed a gross act of imperial over - reach , for which subsequent administrations will pay a heavy price .
Far from the US simply conjoining its pre-1989 power with that of the deceased USSR , it is increasingly confronted with a world marked by the growing power of a range of new national actors , notably - but by no means only - China , India and Brazil .
Just six years into the 21st century , one can say this is not shaping up to be anything like an American century .
Rather , the US seems much more likely to be faced with a very different kind of future : how to manage its own imperial decline .
And , as a footnote , one might add that this is a task for which pragmatists are rather better suited than ideologues .

By PAUL KRUGMANShortly after U.S. forces marched into Baghdad in 2003 , The Weekly Standard published a jeering article titled , “ The Cassandra Chronicles : The stupidity of the antiwar doomsayers . ”
Among those the article mocked was a “ war novelist ” named James Webb , who is now the senator - elect from Virginia .
The article ’s title was more revealing than its authors knew .
People forget the nature of Cassandra ’s curse : although nobody would believe her , all her prophecies came true .
And so it was with those who warned against invading Iraq .
At best , they were ignored .
A recent article in The Washington Post ruefully conceded that the paper ’s account of the debate in the House of Representatives over the resolution authorizing the Iraq war — a resolution opposed by a majority of the Democrats — gave no coverage at all to those antiwar arguments that now seem prescient .
At worst , those who were skeptical about the case for war had their patriotism and / or their sanity questioned .
The New Republic now says that it “ deeply regrets its early support for this war . ”
Does it also deeply regret accusing those who opposed rushing into war of “ abject pacifism ?
” Now , only a few neocon dead - enders still believe that this war was anything but a vast exercise in folly .
And those who braved political pressure and ridicule to oppose what Al Gore has rightly called “ the worst strategic mistake in the history of the United States ” deserve some credit .
Unlike The Weekly Standard , which singled out those it thought had been proved wrong , I ’d like to offer some praise to those who got it right .
Here ’s a partial honor roll : Former President George H. W. Bush and Brent Scowcroft , explaining in 1998 why they did n’t go on to Baghdad in 1991 : “ Had we gone the invasion route , the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land .
” Representative Ike Skelton , September 2002 : “ I have no doubt that our military would decisively defeat Iraq ’s forces and remove Saddam .
But like the proverbial dog chasing the car down the road , we must consider what we would do after we caught it .
” Al Gore , September 2002 : “ I am deeply concerned that the course of action that we are presently embarking upon with respect to Iraq has the potential to seriously damage our ability to win the war against terrorism and to weaken our ability to lead the world in this new century .
” Barack Obama , now a United States senator , September 2002 : “ I do n’t oppose all wars .
What I am opposed to is a dumb war .
What I am opposed to is a rash war .
What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair , weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats , irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne . ” Representative John Spratt , October 2002 : “ The outcome after the conflict is actually going to be the hardest part , and it is far less certain .
” Representative Nancy Pelosi , now the House speaker - elect , October 2002 : “ When we go in , the occupation , which is now being called the liberation , could be interminable and the amount of money it costs could be unlimited .
” Senator Russ Feingold , October 2002 : “ I am increasingly troubled by the seemingly shifting justifications for an invasion at this time . …
When the administration moves back and forth from one argument to another , I think it undercuts the credibility of the case and the belief in its urgency .
I believe that this practice of shifting justifications has much to do with the troubling phenomenon of many Americans questioning the administration ’s motives .
” Howard Dean , then a candidate for president and now the chairman of the Democratic National Committee , February 2003 : “ I firmly believe that the president is focusing our diplomats , our military , our intelligence agencies , and even our people on the wrong war , at the wrong time .
…
Iraq is a divided country , with Sunni , Shia and Kurdish factions that share both bitter rivalries and access to large quantities of arms .
” We should honor these people for their wisdom and courage .
We should also ask why anyone who did n’t raise questions about the war — or , at any rate , anyone who acted as a cheerleader for this march of folly — should be taken seriously when he or she talks about matters of national security .
I am still not sure that I believe it : The Iraqi parliament is going on vacation during the month of August .
The White House offers the lame excuse that , after all , Baghdad is hot in August – sometimes 130 degrees .
May I ask a follow - up ?
How much hotter do you suppose it is if you are a wearing a helmet , full body armor , carrying ammunition and walking foot patrols through Baghdad ?
The last I heard , that is how American troops are spending their August in Iraq .
For me , this does it .
God help the Iraqi people because there is not much America can do to help a government that leaves Americans dying in the streets while the parliament escapes to cooler climes .
Does this mean we should pull out immediately ?
No .
A sudden withdrawal could set the entire region aflame .
The truth is there are no good options left .
But from here on , we need to put aside the dream of building a democracy in Iraq and focus solely on what is in our national interest .
It wo n't be pretty , but for all our good intentions , about all we can do now is try to contain this mess , pull our troops back from the middle of this civil war , and concentrate instead on the terrorist threat that this country faces around the world .
As for what kind of government Iraq needs , let their parliament figure it out .
They can get right on it when the Baghdad weather turns cooler .

Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks .
Forty - five percent of their victims are white , 43 percent are black , and 10 percent are Hispanic .
When whites commit violent crime , only three percent of their victims are black .
See full story linked above for sources .
A society needs to face its problems and deal with them , not studiously ignore them out of irrational ideological reasoning ( PC ) .
Decades ago , when I first started teaching introductory economics , it never would have occurred to me to give an assignment like this .
The idea grew out of my participation in an early pilot program in Writing in the Disciplines , a new pedagogical movement that promises to revolutionize the learning process at every level .
The aim of the program , which was sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation , was to encourage students to write about concepts they were grappling with in the various disciplines .
The initiative was inspired by the discovery that there is no better way to master an idea than to write about it .
Although the human brain is remarkably flexible , learning theorists now recognize that it is far better able to absorb information in some forms than others .
Thus , according to the psychologist Jerome Bruner , children " turn things into stories , and when they try to make sense of their life they use the storied version of their experience as the basis for further reflection . "
He went on , " If they do n't catch something in a narrative structure , it does n't get remembered very well , and it does n't seem to be accessible for further kinds of mulling over . "
Even well into adulthood , we find it easier to process information in narrative form than in more abstract forms like equations and graphs .
Most effective of all are narratives that we construct ourselves .
The economic - naturalist writing assignment plays to this strength .
Learning economics is like learning a language .
Real progress in both cases comes only from speaking .
The economic - naturalist papers induce students to search out interesting economic stories in the world around them .
When they find one , their first impulse is to tell others about it .
They are also quick to recount interesting economic stories they hear from classmates .
And with each retelling , they become more fluent in the underlying ideas .
Many students struggle to come up with an interesting question for their first paper .
But by the time the second paper comes due , the more common difficulty is choosing which of several interesting questions to pursue .
The paper is not a complete substitute for the traditional syllabus .
But the lasting impact of the course comes mainly from the papers .
When students come back to visit during class reunions , the equations and graphs long since forgotten , we almost always end up talking about the questions they have posed and answered during the intervening years .
Structured settlements , also referred to as periodic payments , are the negotiated financial or insurance agreements through which the claimant agrees to resolve a personal injury claim by receiving his settlement in small bits over an agreed span of time on a set schedule .
Majority of the settlement in cases involved in personal injuries are paid in lump sums .
However much some claimant would prefer the lump sum , some cases end in structured payments as deemed in a court of law .
In such cases , structured settlement companies are required .
Such companies buy the structured settlement and give their consumers a lump sum that they require .
However due to the rise of scammers who would take your money and pay you a small portion then disappear with the rest of the
settlement if you are not careful .
Getting a good , honest and trustworthy company is really hard .
Here we give you a review of the best - structured settlement companies in 2018 .

Ms Tamir ( right ) was a leading anti-settlement activist
Yuli Tamir said changes were needed to give Israeli children a proper understanding of their history .
Currently , schoolbooks show Israel 's territorial conquests in the 1967 war - the West Bank , Gaza , East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights - as part of Israel .
International law deems them occupied land that Israel has illegally settled .
The dovish minister is reported to have ordered the books to be changed .
There has been no immediate comment from the prime minister 's office .
Interest group
Ms Tamir 's position is seen as a direct challenge to the Jewish settlement movement , which is a powerful interest group in Israel .
Settlers and their supporters have fought hard against any attempt by governments to withdraw from occupied land , either to foster peace with the Palestinians or enhance Israeli security .
About 430,000 settlers are thought to live in the occupied West Bank , including East Jerusalem , taken from Jordanian control in 1967 .
Another 20,000 live in the Golan Heights which was captured from Syria , and annexed by Israel in 1981 .
" You cannot teach history without knowing the borders Israel used to have , " Ms Tamir told army radio .
" We can't teach children what happened in 1967 if they are not aware where the border runs . "
Right - wing MP Yitzhak Levy accused Ms Tamir of " politicising the education system " .
Ms Tamir - who is a founder of the anti-settlement group Peace Now - countered criticism by saying that ignoring the facts of Israel 's pre-1967 shape also reflected a political viewpoint .
Controversy over school textbooks is not a new phenomenon in the Middle East conflict .
Since the Oslo peace accords in the 1990s , successive Israeli governments have criticised the Palestinian Authority for textbooks which they said negated Israel 's right to exist and incited anti-Israeli hatred among Palestinian children .
Waxman cautions Rice for ' hindering '
Iraq intelligence investigation Michael Roston
Published : Friday May 4 , 2007 Print This Email This The Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has cautioned Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice against hindering investigation into the intelligence used to build the case for the invasion of Iraq .
The warning came after the committee was blocked from taking a deposition from a State Department intelligence analyst who had suggested in 2003 that fears of Iraq 's nuclear program were based on a hoax .
" I am writing to urge you to instruct your staff , particularly officials in your legislative affairs office , not to impede the Committee 's investigation into why President Bush and other senior Administration officials , including yourself , cited forged evidence in building a case for war against Iraq , " wrote Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) in a letter released Friday .
The Committee had written to Simon Dodge , a nuclear weapons analyst at the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research , who had warned the intelligence community in Jan. 2003 that allegations of Iraq seeking uranium from Niger were " probably a hoax " and " clearly a forgery . "
Dodge agreed to fully cooperate with the investigation .
But the committee had been blocked from deposing Dodge by the State Department 's Bureau of Legislative Affairs after they asserted it " would be ' inappropriate ' because the Committee voted to issue a subpoena to compel your attendance at a hearing on your knowledge of the fabricated evidence , " the California Democrat wrote .
Waxman urged Rice to make Dodge available by May 9 , writing , " I trust you will cooperate in this matter and instruct your staff to cease further interference with the Committee 's inquiry . "
The Oversight Committee Chairman also sought a variety of documents from Rice related to the investigation , which he said that she had " failed to provide . "
The full letter can read at the Committee 's website .

It always pays to be suspicious when a U.S. official ramps up fear , but Homeland Security czar Michael Chertoff ‘s “ gut feeling ” remark about an Al Qaeda attack on the U.S. this summer sparks a different suspicion — and a similar sinking feeling : Israel is about to launch a unilateral strike on Iran .
It ’s not a cinch , but that queasy feeling is building .
Seymour Hersh wrote long ago ( in his January 2005 “ The Coming Wars ” ) about such a Pentagon - induced nightmare .
But now that Iraq is a total disaster , the warhawks are stepping up the drumbeat to attack Iran — either by the U.S. or Israel , even arguing that Iran has in effect already declared war on the U.S. by aiding rebels in Iraq .
One of Israel ’s top officials says he ’s got the go - ahead from NATO ’s U.S. and European officials to attack Iran .
Chertoff , aware of a longstanding , fierce debate in the White House over attacking Iran , admits a “ gut feeling , ” saying it ’s about Al Qaeda but probably feeling queasier about what an attack on Iran would do to inflame terrorists .
Condoleezza Rice , said to be an opponent of a U.S. attack on Iran , suddenly cancels a visit to Israel .
For the warhawks , that keeps her out of harm ’s way and blunts her attempts to talk with both Muslims and Jews .
Israel could n’t very well attack Iran while hosting the U.S. secretary of state .
For all you conspiracy theorists out there — and those of you who pooh - pooh this as simply conspiracy theorizing — here are some of the building blocks of that suspicion :
• July 2 : Senator Joe Lieberman ( D - Israel / Connecticut ) tells the Hartford Courant that “ the fact is that the Iranian government has by its actions declared war on us . ”
Lieberman does n’t speak for the entire U.S. government , obviously , but he does speak for a substantial number of powerful warhawks in and out of the White House .
Lieberman adds :
“ The United States government has a responsibility to use all instruments at its disposal to stop these terrorist attacks against our soldiers and allies in Iraq , including keeping open the possibility of using military force against the terrorist infrastructure inside Iran . ”
• July 10 : Israel ’s minister of strategic affairs , Avigdor Lieberman , says Europe and the U.S. have given tacit approval for Israel to unilaterally attack Iran ’s nuclear plants .
From Israel Today :
“ If we start military operations against Iran alone , then Europe and the US will support us , ” Lieberman told [ Israeli ] Army Radio following a meeting earlier in the week with NATO and European Union officials .
Lieberman said the Western powers acknowledged the severity of the Iranian nuclear threat to the Jewish state , but said that ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq are “ going to prevent the leaders of countries in Europe and America from deciding on the use of force to destroy Iran ’s nuclear facilities , ” even if diplomacy ultimately fails .
The message Avigdor Lieberman said the NATO and EU officials conveyed to him is that Israel should “ prevent the threat herself . ”
That ’s not as far - fetched as it sounds .
As conservative anti-war talking head Philip Giraldi notes on the same day as Avigdor Lieberman ’s comments :
It is widely believed that Vice President Dick Cheney and his national security adviser David Wurmser have deliberately limited the playing field because they have no desire to engage Iran amicably and are instead fixated on regime change in Tehran as the only acceptable solution to the “ Persian problem . ”
Cheney has been ably seconded by fellow hawk Elliot Abrams at the National Security Council , who has been working to undercut Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ’s efforts to avoid a war .
Wurmser , meanwhile , has been advising the like - minded at the American Enterprise Institute that Cheney does not believe in negotiations and has promised that the Bush Administration will deal with Iran militarily before its term of office ends .
The Cheney - Wurmser - Abrams axis is opposed to Administration figures like Rice , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , and the intelligence agency chiefs , all of whom are reluctant to do a replay of Iraq in Iran .
The Iraq Studies Group ( ISG ) recommended engaging Iran and all other local players including Syria to help stabilize Iraq and the broader Persian Gulf region .
It also recommended taking serious steps to resolve the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
As “ serious steps ” would consist of Washington pressuring Israel , the ISG report has been coolly received by the White House and with intense hostility by certain Congressmen who are closely tied to Israel .
• July 10 : Chertoff tells the Chicago Tribune ‘s editorial writers :
I believe we ’re entering a period this summer of increased risk .
We ’ve seen a lot more public statements from Al Qaeda .
There are a lot of reasons to speculate about that but one reason that occurs to me is that they ’re feeling more comfortable and raising expectations .
In the last August , and in prior summers , we ’ve had attacks against the West , which suggests that summer seems to be appealing to them .
I think we do see increased activity in South Asia , so we do worry about whether they are rebuilding their capabilities .
We ’ve struck at them and degraded them , but they rebuild .
All these things have given me kind of a gut feeling that we are in a period of increased vulnerability .
• July 12 : Rice hastily cancels her trip to Israel and the OPT ( Occupied Palestinian Territories , as the U.N. and many others refer to it ) .
Spokesman Sean McCormack downplays it at his daily briefing for reporters as merely a postponement :
I want to update you on the Secretary ’s travel schedule .
At this point , we are going to postpone the stop — the planned stops in Jerusalem and Ramallah until the end of the month .
The Secretary and — Secretary Rice is going to be traveling to the region , as the President announced , in part with Secretary Gates .
So she decided that it was appropriate to postpone these two stops and combine it with that trip .
So we ’ll have more information on that trip , the dates , and the stops as we get closer to it , but I would expect that we would leave towards the end of the month and then there would be some joint travel with Secretary Gates at the very beginning of August .
At least some reporters are skeptical .
One follows up with this :
Why was it appropriate to postpone those stops if she still plans to travel next week and she ’s going to be in Africa not that far away ?
Why not just go ahead and do the important work with the Israeli and the Palestinians ?
McCormack ’s reply does n’t pass the smell test :
Well , if you look at where she is going , there is actually quite a distance from where she still plans to go to travel in the Middle East .
And also , given the time in which we find ourselves , there ’s a lot of discussion going on concerning Iraq , there ’s certainly a lot of discussion , policy - wise , about the Middle East .
And she thought it was appropriate to be back in Washington during this time and plus , from a logistical standpoint , it just made sense .
• July 12 : U.S. intelligence chiefs meet at the White House to discuss a report that Al Qaeda is stronger now than at any time since 9/11 .
From this morning ’s Times ( U.K. ) :
Michael Chertoff , the Homeland Security Secretary , has spent days trying to play down comments that his “ gut feeling ” was that the US faced a heightened risk of attack this summer .
. . .
Mr Chertoff emphasised yesterday that “ we do n’t have any specific information about an imminent or near - term attack on the homeland ” .
However , the Times has been told that US and British intelligence services monitoring al - Qaeda networks have picked up “ an increased level of chatter ” in recent weeks .
Maybe so , but Chertoff could have been ratcheting up fear so that an attack on Iran would be more palatable to the masses as yet another “ front ” in the War of Terror .
Or perhaps he was just unconsciously channeling the more ominous “ chatter ” from our own warhawks about an Israeli attack on Iran ’s nukes .
Think about the poisonous cloud of radioactivity and even more terrorists that would produce .

Other than being musicians from Houston , what do Big Pokey , Mickey Newbury and Lightnin ' Hopkins have in common ?
Or how about Fever Tree , the Hollisters , Ganksta Nip and Los Skarnales ?
The answer is that SoundExchange is looking for them in hopes of giving them royalties it has collected on their behalf .
And if these people do n't contact SoundExchange by June 30 , SoundExchange gets to keep their money .
Okay , let 's back up a bit .
First , this SoundExchange is not the trippy little record store on the corner of Hazard and Richmond .
This is the U.S. Copyright Office - approved quasi - official body that collects money for performances of recordings on digital cable and satellite TV , Webcasts , and satellite radio and then disburses a portion to artists .
Originally a wing of the widely reviled Recording Industry Association of America , it became independent in 2003 , although there are still members of the RIAA on the SoundExchange board .
Info Internet radio
Over the past seven years , SoundExchange has found and paid thousands of artists , but they have admitted they can't find about 25 percent of the people they have been looking for .
Today , that number stands at more than 8,300 artists .
I looked over the list and found a few names we can probably help them with :
In addition to the names above , local and regional acts such as Barbara Lynn , Big Moe , Big Mike , Clay Blaker , Blind Willie Johnson , Fito Olivares , Clarence Hollimon , Goudie , Amos Milburn , Mark David Manders , Ted Daffan and His Texans , Mark May , Rigo Tovar , Roy Gaines , Sprawl and Trudy Lynn are also owed money .
Obviously , some of these people are deceased ; in that case , SoundExchange is looking for their heirs .
And please note that the list is very long  all I had time to do was skim it , so I probably missed some .
( Check yourself at http://63.236.111.137/jsp/unpaid ArtistList.jsp . )
Latin bands are especially numerous  any of you with expertise in that area should go over the list carefully , because I do n't know how strong SoundExchange 's Spanish outreach program is .
If you are one of the people I already mentioned , go to www.soundexchange.com/members/become_member.html for a step - by - step on how to collect .
Now , there 's no small potential for mischief here .
When an agency gets to keep the money it is supposed to be doling out to people it is responsible for finding , it is easy to detect at least a possible conflict of interest .
And yeah , finding just about every working musician in America , or their heirs , is a daunting task , but it must be said that one wonders how hard SoundExchange has truly sought some of these people .
For example , in less than five minutes of Googling , I found the official Web sites and / or MySpace pages of Fito Olivares , Goudie , Mark May , the Hollisters and Los Skarnales .
What 's more , highly visible people like Cam'ron ( fresh off a highly - publicized appearance on 60 Minutes ) , Fat Joe and Danzig are on the “ lost ” list too .
SoundExchange has said that they have actually found many of the 8,000 - plus artists on the lost list , but that many of them have simply failed to send in their paperwork .
And indeed that seems to be the case with Los Skarnales  Nick Gaitan , the band 's former bassist , told me that he had neglected to mail in the forms .
Gaitan was not aware , though , that if he did n't get on the ball , the band would lose that money forever .
I suspect that he is not alone .
In a lifetime of hanging around musicians , it has not often been my experience that many of them turn up their noses at free money .
Meanwhile , SoundExhange is also one of the principal forces behind the drive to multiply the royalty rate that Internet radio stations must pay .
Late last March , the panel of three Washington , D.C. , judges called the Copyright Review Board that is empowered to set royalty rates for copyrighted materials simply rubberstamped the exorbitant rate increase proposed by SoundExchange .
And what an increase it is .
In fact , if enacted , it would likely drive every Webcaster in America out of business almost immediately , if not sooner .
Local terrestrial radio veteran and Net radio newbie Dave E. Crockett felt forced to take the most drastic of steps .
“ We were running a station called DXSRadio.com and I pulled it off the air about a week and a half ago because of the proposed plans , ” he says .
“ They were going to make these fees retroactive back to 2006 .
And the way they wanted to do this was charge every Webcaster per listener , per song .
So if you have a thousand people listening and you 're playing ‘ Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain , ' you have to pay for that song a thousand times .
“ Listen , this is Internet radio , and we are charging about three or four dollars to advertise , ” he continues .
“ You can understand that if you are paying for a song a thousand times , and you 're playing 12 songs an hour , and you have a thousand listeners in that hour , three dollars is n't gonna cover it . ”
Here 's how the math broke down for the now - defunct DXSRadio .
The proposed retroactive rate for 2006 looks infinitesimal  just $ .0008 for each song per listener .
But multiply that by 1000 listeners , and you get 80 cents .
Still looks cheap , right ?
But multiply that by 12 songs per hour and you get $ 9.60 .
Crockett 's cheap rates would mean a deficit of six or seven bucks per hour , which adds up to more than $ 50,000 for 2006 , which would come due on July 15 of this year .
And because of the retroactivity of this proposal , that 's just what he would have in his past - due column .
Meanwhile , the rate going forward would gradually increase to $ .0019 by 2010 .
Under those terms , three years from now , Crockett would n't be able to pay for the music he was broadcasting until he sold at least $ 200,000 in ads .
And Crockett is small potatoes .
“ I was talking to this one guy the other day , and he told me he would owe $ 2.5 million , ” he says .
SoundExchange 's executive director John Simson has said revenue generation should n't be a problem .
In an interview with Royalty Week magazine , he put it this way : “ Webcasters have a number of opportunities to maximize revenue with ... banner ads , pop-ups , video pre-rolls , audio commercials . ”
“ SoundExchange are a bunch of idiots , ” Crockett says .
Or are they ?
To boldly mangle a metaphor here , maybe they are just idiotic like a fox .
Sure , butchering Internet radio might seem foolish .
After all , SoundExchange claims to represent the financial interests of thousands of labels and artists , and it would seem to be in the best interests of all parties if that music was played as widely as possible .
Silencing it would seem to be a case of killing the golden goose .
But like the rappers say , big bank take little bank .
SoundExchange might have bands like Los Skarnales and tiny little labels on their rolls , but as their past affiliation with the RIAA would lead you to believe , they are most interested in the collective well - being of the Big Four record labels .
And if there 's anything the Big Four hates , it 's the decentralized , diffused music market that Net radio has helped create and is continuing to foster .
They pine for the Good Ol ' Days , when white males 18 – 24 all listened to corporate rock radio and “ urban ” females 25 – 37 all tuned into homogenized R&B and so on .
They love it when people cease being people and transform themselves into demographics , and the bigger the demo the better .
Squiring your mistress down to St. Barts for a dirty weekend is n't getting any cheaper , even if the price of music has cratered .
And now they think they can get it back .
They can smell that money , and now they are as crazed as a rutting elk with a snootful of pheromones .
It 's probably no coincidence that the attempted murder of Internet radio follows quickly on the heels of Big Radio 's rollout of HD radio , their own corporate - controlled , sanitized - for - your - protection answer to the wild Web .
If they can somehow force - feed us HD , they can start calling the shots again .
And in the meantime , they may even think they can drag all 52 million American Internet radio listeners back kicking and screaming to the wonders of the traditional radio dial .
Crockett is convinced that the National Association of Broadcasters is behind the lobbying on the price increase .
“ The N.A.B. represents terrestrial radio stations , and the last thing they need is anything to draw people away , because listenership to terrestrial radio has declined 22 percent since deregulation in 1996 , ” he says .
“ So they want to make Webcasting so unbelievably expensive that there is no way that anyone would ever do it . ”
“ This type of legislation really smacks the free - enterprise system in the face , simply because it discourages Webcasters from growing their business , ” Crockett continues .
“ If I am going to be charged per listener , what 's my incentive to grow my listener base ? ”
And if SoundExchange loses money every time it finds an artist it is supposed to pay , what is its incentive to actually do its job ?
Are we really supposed to trust an organization that claims it can't find Max Stalling ( www.maxstalling.com), Vicente Fernandez ( hint : Try Mexico ) or freaking Mother Maybelle Carter ?
Thankfully , the SoundExchange / Copyright Review Board proposal is still just that .
A much more sensible proposal has been put forth .
It is federal legislation , it is called H.R. 2060 and it would supersede the C.R.B 's ruling .
It calls for a royalty rate of 7.5 percent of total revenue or .33 cents per listener - hour , as decided by the provider , so the artists would get paid and the Webcasters could survive .
Shakespeare used they with singular antecedents so there
Not happy that I cite Sean Lennon as a source of evidence concerning the way they can be used in modern English ?
Feeling that only something 400 years older would really convince you that it 's OK .
Has Coby Lubliner got news for you !
Coby writes from Berkeley to point out the following lines from Shakespeare 's A Comedy of Errors , Act IV , Scene 3 :
There 's not a man I meet but doth salute me
As if I were their well - acquainted friend
It 's not just a case of they with singular antecedent ; like Lennon 's example , it uses they despite the fact that the sex of the antecedent 's referent ( male ) is known !
And there 's more .
Marilyn Martin writes from Cornell to say that she 's O.K. with normally , but this example was a bit more than she could take ( " somehow bothers me " , she wrote ) :
UK scientists have identified the part of the brain that determines whether a person perceives themselves as fat .
( BBC News , Tuesday , 29 November 2005 , 11:52 GMT )
What she does n't like , I 'm quite sure , is that the reflexive form themselves is morphologically marked as plural ( self / selves ) , yet still it is used with singular antecedent .
Do n't flinch , Marilyn !
Look at this example of Shakespeare 's ( from the poem The Rape of Lucrece ) :
Now leaden slumber with life 's strength doth fight ;
And every one to rest themselves betake ,
Save thieves , and cares , and troubled minds , that wake .
So even the reflexive form of the pronoun lexeme they is used in Shakespeare with a singular antecedent ( every one , spelled everyone in modern English ) .
[ Added later : I would have to agree with you if you said that the above example is quite difficult to parse .
It is indeed .
Having direct objects before subjects is never helpful for those of us speaking SVO languages , but that 's what Tudor English poetry is like .
After some discussion with Marilyn Martin and Mark Liberman , I think I am satisfied that leaden slumber is understood as the subject of betake , and every one is its object .
The reason betake does n't have a final -s is not that it 's agreeing with a plural subject ( its subject is leaden slumber , singular ) , but rather that it is understood as doth betake with the doth omitted : it is not a present - tense verb , finite ; it 's in what The Cambridge Grammar calls the " plain form " , as required by doth .
So , in other words , the sense of the passage is roughly as follows ( I change " doth fight " to " fights " in accord with contemporary English syntax , and simply murder the poeticality ) : " Now leaden slumber fights with life 's strength ; and takes everyone off to rest themselves , except for thieves , and worries , and troubled minds , which remain awake . "
The relevant point is unchanged by this clarification : the antecedent of themselves is the singular noun phrase every one .
That 's the current thinking in the halls of 1 Language Log Plaza , anyway .
I did warn you that it was difficult . ]
By all means , avoid using they with singular antecedents in your own writing and speaking if you feel you cannot bear it .
Language Log is not here to tell you how to write or speak .
But do n't try to tell us that it 's grammatically incorrect .
Because when a construction is clearly present several times in Shakespeare 's rightly admired plays and poems , and occurs in the carefully prepared published work of just about all major writers down the centuries , and is systematically present in the unreflecting conversational usage of just about everyone including Sean Lennon , then the claim that it is ungrammatical begins to look utterly unsustainable to us here at Language Log Plaza .
This use of they is n't ungrammatical , it is n't a mistake , it 's a feature of ordinary English syntax that for some reason attracts the ire of particularly puristic pusillanimous pontificators , and we do n't buy what they 're selling .

( Nicole : Steve Benen weighed in a post of his own , which I 've copied below the fold )
Last week , I had an item detailing the bizarre interest in some media circles with the presidential candidates ' ( and their spouses ' ) appearance .
Apparently , the craziest example had n't come yet .
Consider this exchange on MSNBC this morning , between Joe Scarborough and CQ's Craig Crawford .
SCARBOROUGH : Have you seen Fred Thompson 's wife ?
CRAWFORD : Oh , yeah .
SCARBOROUGH :
You think she thinks she works the pole ?
CRAWFORD : That 's what a Hollywood career will do for you , I guess .
SCARBOROUGH : What do you mean ?
CRAWFORD : You get wives like that .
I 'm not even sure where to start with something like this .
This level of misogyny is uncommon among major national media figures , especially on the air .
I can vaguely understand joking about Thompson marrying a much - younger woman .
This seems like standard fare for those looking for a cheap laugh related to the presidential race .
At the time of their marriage , Thompson was 60 ; his wife was 35 .
It 's entirely irrelevant , but if someone 's looking for something to tease him about , this is going to get some attention .
But even this joke is not about the candidate , but his spouse , who has nothing to do with politics at all .

Reviewing code can suck
The open source world has given developers great tools to make their lives easier .
We have editors , bug trackers , source code management tools , repository viewers .
Bugzilla , for example , is a very popular bug tracker used by many open source projects and companies alike .
While the life of a developer has in many ways been improved by these tools , there ’s one key area of software development that people still do the hard way : Code reviews .
You ’re probably familiar with this .
A contributor puts a patch up on Bugzilla , Trac , or your project ’s listserv .
It ’s large and spans several files .
Eventually you get around to it ( if you have n’t lost it in your inbox yet ) .
You open an e-mail or the Bugzilla page to respond , put the diff where you can see it , and start going through the changes , line by line , making comments as you go .
It ’s tedious .
You have to make it clear what function you ’re talking about , make references to the general area in the diff .
It ’s a pain for the contributor too , because they have to figure out what you ’re referring to .
This leaves room for error .
We ’ve been working this way for years in open source projects and at VMware .
Code reviews are important to us , and help to keep our code clean and our products stable .
It keeps us honest prevents us from cutting corners unnecessarily .
However , the process is a bit time - consuming and not at all optimal .
Generate an htmldiff showing the old code and the new code side - by - side , highlighting the changes .
Write an e-mail to the target reviewers / listservs explaining what changes we made , the testing that was done , links to screenshots we put up on a file server , a link to the diff , and whatever else .
Wait for someone to go through the htmldiff and comment on the changes in a new e-mail .
Go through the comments , try to find the lines they referred to in the diff , and fix them up .
Make another diff if necessary , repeat .
David Trowbridge and I finally got tired of it .
We spent too long preparing review requests and we lost too many of them in our e-mail .
As our personal projects and our team grew in size , it became harder to keep track of all the open review request e-mails on the listservs .
So we fixed that .
Review Board
We built a code review system called Review Board .
Like most projects , it started out simple , but grew to be pretty powerful and useful quickly .
It was designed to automate and simplify the process of creating review requests and actually reviewing code .
Management at VMware was excited about this from the beginning .
We were n’t being asked to write it , and it was a personal project and all , but when they found out we were doing this , they fully supported us .
It did n’t take long for the excitement to spread across many teams , and we had 40 people signed up and playing before we were even ready to announce our phase 1 beta .
One of the things we decided from the beginning is that this must be open source and it must work with other version control systems .
For example , we use Perforce internally , but there ’s no reason not to include Subversion or anything else .
So we worked and worked in our spare time .
After weeks of trial runs and lots of dogfooding , we decided it was time to announce what we had so far .
Enough yapping , details already !
Details ?
Alright .
Review Board is an open source program licensed under the MIT license .
It was designed using Python and Django .
It ’s compatible with Subversion and Perforce , and can be extended to support other version control systems .
Review Board has a lot of useful features …
Multiple Repositories and Projects
Review Board can generate and display diffs against multiple repositories on multiple servers , each with their own version control system .
At VMware , we have a repository for each Perforce server we use , and will soon be adding a Subversion repository for our libview project .
This would be particularly useful for umbrella projects where some parts are available in one repository and others in other repositories .
Writing version control system backends is easy .
They ’re simple Python modules that can be referenced in the Review Board database entry for the particular backend .
We currently ship Subversion and Perforce backends , as well as a subclass of the Perforce backend making use of special extensions we use at VMware .
Review Requests
Posting review requests is fairly easy .
If you use Perforce , it ’s especially easy .
A post - review tool is provided that allows you to post a review request with nothing other than a change number as a parameter .
If you use Subversion , a little more work is required , though we ’re working on a tool to automate this as well .
You ’ll need to generate a unified diff .
Click “ New Review Request , ” select the repository , enter the base path ( the path relative to the root of your Subversion repository where you generated the diff ) , and then select the diff .
Click “ Create Review Request . ”
You ’ll be taken to your review request page where you can fill in description and other information .
Click “ Publish ” when you ’re done .
Powerful Diff Viewer
Inline commenting : Instead of jumping to your bug tracker or e-mail client and describing where you ’re commenting on , just comment directly on the line !
Click the line number or click and drag to select multiple line numbers and a comment dialog will pop up allowing you to type .
When you finally publish your review , the lines in the diff you commented on will be shown inline with the rest of your review .

When you finally publish your review , the lines in the diff you commented on will be shown inline with the rest of your review .
Inter - line diffs : Sometimes a small change is made to a line and it ’s not readily apparent what the change was .
In these cases , we highlight the regions between two lines that have changed .

Revisioned Diffs : Each revision of the diff is saved and can be accessed .
In the future , we will make it possible to show differences between two revisions , to ease review of incremental patches .

Whitespace highlighting : Trailing whitespace is automatically highlighted .
Trailing whitespace is a pet peeve of many developers and this helps to catch it early .

Collapsing / expanding of files :
By default , only the changed chunks and some lines of context around them are displayed .
This can be quickly changed to show the entire file , in case there ’s something you want to look at or comment on elsewhere .

Keyboard shortcuts : Convenient shortcut keys allow quick navigation around the diff .
For example , pressing “ n ” will jump to the next changed chunk , and pressing “ p ” will jump to the previous chunk .
This will be further improved and documented soon .
Interactive Screenshots
Screenshots can be easily added to the review request page , and will show up as thumbnails .
Screenshots can be commented on by clicking and dragging an area on the image .
A comment box will pop up , like in the diff viewer .
While the clipped part of the screenshot does not yet appear on the review , it will soon .
Contextual Discussions
Commented lines in the diff are displayed with their comments on the review page .
Commented areas of a screenshot will be displayed with their comments on the review page .
Discussion of reviews take place on the reviews themselves , making it possible to read the whole discussion of a change from top to bottom .
E-mail Support
All discussions and updates get sent automatically to the individual reviewers and listservs .
This makes it easy for people to see any and all changes .
This is configurable and can be disabled if it does n’t fit in with your setup .
NIS Support
Review Board can use an NIS server as an authentication backend , making it easy to integrate into companies that use NIS .
Everyone ’s accounts will Just Work in Review Board without any registration required .
User Dashboard
All incoming and outgoing reviews can be seen on the Dashboard page .
You can look at incoming reviews sent directly to you , sent to a group , or to either ( all incoming reviews ) .
In the future , this will show more information on what ’s going on with the review requests in your list .
Recent discussions and updates will be shown , making it easier to keep track of things .
JSON API
Review Board has a JSON - based API for accessing nearly every aspect of the system .
This makes it easy to build tools around Review Board .
Our post - review tool uses this , as does much of the web UI .
Hopefully in time , developers will make use of this to better integrate with existing systems such as Eclipse , vim , emacs , or other IDEs .
Looking Forward
There ’s a lot we have planned .
Review Board is still just an early beta and a lot will happen .
Improved tools :
We ’ll soon be working on a single tool that understands how to post review requests to both Perforce and Subversion .
It will also be able to integrate with multiple projects .
For example , if three projects you ’re contributing to all use Review Board , post - review will ask once for the Review Board servers and use them from then on when run in the project directories .

Status Reports :
This is perhaps more useful inside companies .
At VMware , we ’re supposed to submit weekly status reports discussing what we ’ve done .
Often this consists mostly of review requests made and bugs fixed .
Review Board will be offering a page showing this information in several forms so that it can be easily copied and pasted into a weekly status report .

“ Effective Lines ” Display
Many diffs are easier to review than they seem , as there could be hundreds of lines with nothing more than a function or variable name change .
We would like to make this clear before even opening the diff by showing the number of effective lines changed , factoring out the simple redundant changes .
Wrapping Up , and Contributing
This was a bit long , but I hope it gave a good overview of what we ’re putting together here .
You can see it in action or visit the project page .
If you decide to use it in your project , please let us know !
Check the Wiki for install instructions .
Hopefully this will become useful to others as well .
We ’ll post periodic updates as this project progresses .
Bachelors might have sex on their minds more than their single female counterparts , but once in a committed relationship , men and women have similar attitudes toward the act , a new study finds .
The results , published in the April issue of the journal Sex Roles , reveal how sexual stereotypes , in which guys want to go for it and gals tend to resist , do n’t hold when romantic feelings come into play .
“ Men experience a lot of pressure in our society to have sex with a number of different partners , ” said one of the study ’s researchers , Paul Perrin , a graduate student in psychology at the University of Florida , “ the opposite of what women experience as kind of the gatekeepers of sexuality . ”
Past studies , the scientists point out , have shown that compared with women , men are more sexually permissive , endorse casual sex at higher rates and masturbate more often .
And even in dreamland , men are from Mars and women from Venus .
A recent study showed men were more than twice as likely as women to report dreams about multiple sex partners .
Sex spin factor
Tom Tiegs of UF and Perrin , along with their colleagues , surveyed 208 women and 131 men in an introductory psychology course there .
The students rated 160 statements on a scale ranging from “ strongly disagree ” to “ strongly agree ” regarding their sexual behaviors and attitudes .
The statements fell into four categories .
In category 1 , “ sex as personally and physically pleasurable , ” statements included :
I should get drunk to enhance my sexual experience .
If I want to be close to someone , I should have sex .
I should have sex with my partner so he / she will not leave me .
I should have sex with as many people as possible .
In category 2 , “ sex as beneficial in creating positive feelings about oneself , ” statements included :
Sex makes my partner love me .
I feel attractive after sex .
I trust my partner more after sex .
In category 3 , “ sex as personally costly in terms of having negative emotional , psychological or physical consequences , ” statements included :
Sex makes me feel guilty for violating my morals .
God will punish me for having sex .
Having a one - night stand makes me feel cheap .
I will get an STD by having sex .
In category 4 , “ sex as a violation of social injunctions , " statements included :
I should engage in premarital sex .
I should be with my partner a long time before I have sex .
I should not have sex because I ’m too attached to someone I ’m having sex with .
Sexual feelings
While women placed more emphasis on the emotional aspects of sex , men focused more on the physical side of sex .
Men were much more likely to find sex personally and physically pleasurable , while women were more likely to think sex violates social taboos .
Thoughts often turn into actions .
“ Sexually restrictive gender roles too often become self - fulfilling prophecies because women know that they are expected to be less sexual than men , ” the scientists write , “ and men know that they are expected to be more sexual than women . ”
Men gave much higher ratings for risky sexual behaviors , such as “ I should have sex with as many people as possible , ” than women .
And women were more apt to endorse waiting longer and not engaging in premarital sex .
When Mr. Right shows up , however , women ditch society - imposed gender roles , warming up to sexual pleasures , the researchers found .
In the context of an intimate relationship , both genders expressed that sex was important as a way to bring couples closer , to help maintain healthy relationships and to increase one ’s self confidence .
“ People in romantic relationships give more importance to their own feelings and their partners ’ than they do to social expectations about sexual behavior , ” Perrin said .
Officials say the advert should not cause alarm
The adverts urged members of the public to inform officials if they found any " lost or stolen " radioactive material .
They were published in major Urdu- language newspapers in Pakistan .
A spokesman for the nuclear authority said that there was a " very remote chance " that nuclear materials imported 40 - 50 years ago were unaccounted for .
International concern over the safety of Pakistan 's nuclear programme was expressed in 2004 , when the country 's top nuclear scientist , AQ Khan , confessed to leaking secrets to Iran , North Korea and Libya .
Dr Khan was subsequently placed under virtual house arrest , and is now suffering from pancreatic cancer .
' Cradle to the grave '
Officials on Wednesday were keen to reassure the outside world that the latest incident in no way has the makings of another nuclear scandal , and that no radioactive material had been stolen , lost or gone missing .
Pakistan says its nuclear materials are in safe hands
But officials say they need to heighten public awareness of nuclear issues to ensure that decades - old nuclear material is fully accounted for .
" This could have been before the creation of Pakistan , and may relate to nuclear material that could not be taken under our charge , " Zaheer Ayub Baig , information services director of Pakistan 's Nuclear Regulatory Authority , said in a letter to the BBC .
Mr Baig said that the adverts were merely a public awareness campaign to make people aware of the dangers of radiation from material that might have been used in hospitals and industrial plants .
He said the advertising campaign was being expanded .
" There is nothing to worry about , " Mr Baig said .
" We have a record of all the radioactive sources imported in to the country , those that are being used and also those that have been disposed of .
" This is according to a cradle to the grave concept where records are kept of any radioactive source entering into the country until its final disposal . "
He said similar adverts would soon appear in Pakistan 's English - language press .
Scientists return this week to the world 's deepest known sinkhole , Cenote Zacatón in Mexico , to resume tests of a NASA - funded robot called DEPTHX , designed to survey and explore for life in one of Earth 's most extreme regions and potentially in outer space .
If all goes well with this second round of testing and exploration , the team will return in May for a full - scale exploration of the Zacatón system .
Sinking more than 1,000 feet , Zacatón has only been partially mapped and its true depth remains unknown .
During eight years of research , doctoral student Marcus Gary and hydrogeology professor Jack Sharp from The University of Texas at Austin 's Jackson School of Geosciences , discovered the system 's unusual hydrothermal nature is analogous to liquid oceans under the icy surface of Jupiter 's moon Europa .
Technology developed to explore the sinkholes could be applied to future space probes of Europa , where scientists believe that deep cracks and holes in the ice offer a chance of finding extraterrestrial life .
The technology could also be used to explore Earth 's ice - bound polar lakes , which hold clues to the origins of life on Earth .
advertisement
Microbes which appear to be new to science have been discovered floating in deep water and lining rocks in Zacatón .
Far below sunlight 's ability to penetrate , they may get their energy from nutrients welling up from hot springs .
Gary and others speculate that previously undocumented life may await discovery in the murky depths .
William Stone of Stone Aerospace in Del Valle , Texas , heads the exploration project , named DEPTHX after the robot , a deep phreatic thermal explorer that NASA funded with $ 5 million .
In addition to the geoscientists from The University of Texas at Austin , collaborators include robotics experts , engineers , geobiologists and geochemists from Carnegie Mellon University , Colorado School of Mines and Southwest Research Institute .
The probe is designed to map underwater caves , measure geochemical properties of the water , search for microbes and other life forms , and bring back samples for subsequent analysis .
The team conducted initial tests of the probe 's navigation capabilities in February , successfully mapping La Pilita , the second deepest sinkhole in the Zacatón system .
Operations during this first mission showed that DEPTHX could find its way through underwater space , collect samples in unexplored areas and navigate back to the surface .
Unique in the world of robotic explorers , DEPTHX is autonomous .
The probe does not rely on instructions from humans to decide where to go or what to do .
It creates 3 - D maps of previously unexplored areas as it swims along and then uses those same maps to navigate back to the surface .
Cenote Zacatón first achieved notoriety when two divers attempted to reach the bottom in 1994 .
One of them , Sheck Exley , died in the attempt .
The other , Jim Bowden , survived , descending to a record depth of 925 feet .
The outcome caused scientists to rethink ways that Zacatón could be explored safely .
Gary first began visiting Cenote Zacatón in 1993 as a commercial diving guide .
He was inspired by the unique environment to pursue a doctorate in geology .
He has continued investigating the system of underwater caves to understand how they formed and evolved over time , working with a network of explorers and scientists to increase awareness of the system 's scientific value .
" We brought this place into international recognition with the cave community and now with the scientific community , " said Gary .
" People in cave diving knew it was there because Sheck died there .
He was a pioneer in cave diving and legendary for 30 years , holding previous world depth records .
That 's all it was known for .
Now it has potential for a lot of future research . "

How to crack Microsoft Windows Vista / XP - workstations and Windows 200x servers in a minute ?
Update - 21st June
Some free encryption programs :
There are some freeware encryption software available :
http://www.truecrypt.org/
- Free open - source disk encryption software for Windows Vista / XP/2000 and Linux
http://www.ce-infosys.com/english/downloads/free_compusec/index.html
- so far no Vista- version available
Before you start using any encryption software , make sure you have fresh backups of your computer .
Read release notes and installation guides / requirements carefully .
I 've managed once to encrypt my laptop so that I had to wait 8 days before I was able to try my next password guess , I gave up after about 2 weeks and lost couple of files ...
================================================================
Update - 17th June
There are many valuable links , which I 'd like to recommend for further reading :

Update 12th June
Making IT easier ...
Instead of pressing once " any key " and clicking four mouse clicks to be able to start copying files to usb - disk , you can download Vista WAIK - tools and make a WinPE - boot disk to make the cracking process easier .
If you have WinPE boot media , just press " any key " to boot it , wait a couple of minutes and you have full access to your computer - no need for mouse clicks at all .
There are few things I 'd like to point out :
- Yes , this is not a new method , I 've been using L0 phtcrack etc since 90's
- BUT this trick needs no special software nor technical knowledge .
Anyone can use this method at any computer , if physical access is available .
You don�t have to be able to speak C++ or to� compile kernel .
- Yes , as mentioned later in this page , BIOS - settings can be removed / cracked , the computer 's hard disk can be stolen and put to another machine to be copied .
Unfortunately there are some ( older ) bios-versions , which allows user to choose between different boot devices even bios - passwords enabled :-(
- Summary :
If you really want to secure your files and systems , I highly recommend you to keep physical access to your computer as tight as possible and ENCRYPT your hard disks .
================================================================
11th June
My website http://www.ict-tuki.fi and this document reveal and explain how anyone can crack almost any computer , which uses Microsoft Windows operating system and which doesn�t include any special security components ( for example hard disk encryption ) .
This security feature was found 8th February 2007 during Windows Vista training session and reported immediately to Microsoft Finland Oyj .
Further investigations revealed that it is possible to crack other Windows OS versions , too .
Also this information was distributed to local Microsoft office .
These findings were confirmed 10th February 2007 by Microsoft Finland .
Four months have passed and Microsoft hasn�t given any information nor warned its customers concerning this dangerous feature .
Therefore I have decided to inform about this feature via my web pages .
So , learn more about this phenomenon and please secure your workstations and servers !
What �s the problem ?
This problematic security feature exists because Windows Vista Repair Computer / System Recovery program enables the use of command prompt without any user authentication with highest possible - system - level � priviledges .
Cracking Windows operating systems has been possible by using cracking software found from various web pages .
This is the first time when cracking Windows operating systems is really easy and needs no deeper technical knowledge .
This is the reason , why everyone using Windows should understand the cracking method and start preparing safety systems , if needed .
1. Requirements :
a) Physical access to workstation / server
b ) Windows Vista Installation - DVD - media�
- It �s easy to create a bootable USB flash memory that works in a similar way
- Windows Home Basic , Premium , Business and Ultimate tested
c ) For example USB - memory to transfer files
Special note : no user names or passwords are needed
2. Phase 1 � Booting
Start Windows Vista installation from the installation - DVD ( you may have to �press any key� in order to boot from DVD , this depends on the BIOS )
- The only realistic solution to keep OS secure , is to make it impossible to boot from any other media than local hard disk .
- Remember to set up BIOS - password .
After that it�s not easy to change the booting order .
- As all security experts know , resetting BIOS is possible if there�s free physical access to the computer .
If a cracker can open the cover of the computer , he can use the motherboard�s BIOS reset functions to clear all existing passwords .
������������������
- Another highly recommended solution to protect the computer is hard disk encryption , which unfortunately isn�t available for most Windows Vista users ( only in Enterprise or Ultimate versions ) .
For Windows XP and older systems encrypting is possible only by using 3rd party commercial software .
- Encrypting File System ( EFS ) could be a solution , too , but it�s not included in Windows Home versions .
Many corporate administrators have dropped EFS because of other problems related to folder / file level encryption .
- You can also use a startup password , which can be enabled from BIOS - settings .
In corporate environment , managing a large number of startup passwords in a secure way is a very complicated task .
3. Phase 2 � Language / Time & currency / Keyboard selections
Select Vista installation language and press Next
4. Phase 3 � Installation choices
From the main installation menu choose Repair your computer ( do not choose Install now ) .
If installation - DVD / System Recovery doesn�t recognize the local hard disk because of a missing driver , a new driver can be loaded from the usb - disk or cd .
In most cases ( even in my 2003 server crack test ) it�s not needed , thanks to Plug & Play , so choose Next
5. Phase 4 � Command prompt
Choose Command Prompt from the System Recovery Options menu .
Voil� !
Here you have full access to this computer , not only as an administrator but also as a system account user .
After this you can insert usb - memory and copy any non-encrypted file from this computer to usb - memory and steal information without leaving any marks to the system or event viewer logs .
Also , you could for example copy SAM - file ( contains names and passwords of local users ) from c:\windows\system32 \config to usb -memory and start cracking computer�s user password at� remote computer .
A cracker can :
1. � copy files from hard disk to USB , floppy or network server
2. � create / modify / delete files and folders
3. � use most of the MS - DOS like commands
4. � use this method in Vista , XP , 200x
6 . What does this mean ?
Most computers which use Microsoft Windows OS are vulnerable to local penetration , if a cracker has full access to computer�s hard disk and knows how to use Vista Installation - DVD System Recovery functions .
As a security expert , I believe this is a major security risk found in Microsoft OS .
Even before Vista , different methods were available for attacking Windows OS security , t.ex. using programs which could be downloaded from the internet .
However , these methods have been either difficult to use or too demanding for normal users .
Vista Installation - DVD enables anyone to crack Windows OS easily in minutes .
7 . How is this possible ?
It �s possible , that the recovery command prompt has been intentionally included in Windows Vista with system level user rights and without any authentication , for example to ease problem solving etc .
But � .
� by default , there should always be some kind of user authentication , so that only authenticated local administrators are entitled to use command prompt .
There is no reasonable explanation why it�s possible to run this command prompt not only in Vista but also in older Windows OS versions .
- Quality assurance error ?
- Not enough testing ?
8. Could Microsoft patch this problem ?
Is it possible to modify the Repair Computer function in order to make it use authentification ( in every OS - versions ) ?�
Is it possible to block the use of Repair Computer function in other Windows OS�es ?
There are no instant solutions available , because millions of customers have already purchased Vista .
However , Microsoft could / should inform about this security risk and give instructions how to protect oneself against it :
� How to setup startup and BIOS passwords and change boot order
� Recommendations for disk encryption
I wish there was an easy to use BitLocker - type disk encryption software free of charge for all existing Windows OS�es including 2000 - XP - Vista .
Perhaps it�s now understandable , that every version of Windows Server 2008 includes BitLocker Hard Disk Encryption - technology .
9. Proof - of - concept
The following picture demonstrates how to use this feature to crack and examine files in a computer running Windows Vista .
You can follow these instructions to other computers running other versions of Windows operating systems .
This P - O - C is done using Windows Vista Business but you can expect similar results with other Windows operating systems .
My computer includes two folders in the root of c:- drive which I�d like to open using Vista Recovery Options .
These folders are Data1_nonEFS and Data2_EFS .
First folder is not encrypted , the other one is encrypted with EFS .
Both folders have three files named File1.txt , File2.txt and File3.txt .
Their content is similar , but they have different access control list - rights .
� This was supposed to be a secret file ! � is in each file .
Files in Data2_EFS - folder are encrypted using build in Encrypting Files System ( EFS ) .
File1 has default security ACL - rights , which consist of four users or groups with slightly different permissions .
Practically everyone who uses this computer can have access to this file , because Authenticated Users group have Read & Execute - rights .
File2.txt doesn�t include any typical user rights , instead there are rights only for System to access this file .
This is not a common permission , but it demonstrates , how you can access even files like this in command prompt without any problems .
As you can see , even local administrator users don�t have access to this file while running Vista .
File3.txt � there�s no permission to this file at all .
As you will later notice , this is not a problem while operating in command prompt if you know how to use two new Windows Vista command line commands .
Data2_EFS - folder contains three similarly named files .
Their ACL - rights are the same as in Data1_nonEFS - folder .
Start your computer and insert Vista installation disk immediately to the dvd -drive .
In case of this notice , press quickly �any key� .
If you see this text and bar , you �ve been quick enough .
Otherwise , let Vista or other operating system start normally , reboot system and try to be a little quicker next time .
In this case I choose Finnish time¤cy format and Finnish keyboard .
Choose your own settings and click Next .
Normally you�d click Install now .
This time , click Repair your computer to enter System Recovery options .
In some systems , Vista installation media doesn�t include necessary hard disk drivers .
In such case , click Load Drivers and supply drivers needed to get access to hard disk .
You can try to use older Windows version drivers , if Vista drivers are not available .
If you see the operating system you�d like to enter , click Next to continue .
Unless there are no problems with hard disk drivers , you�ll enter the System Recovery Options menu .
There are five options you can choose from , but in this case Command Prompt is what we are looking for .
As you can see , you�ll enter a typical cmd-prompt .
X : \Sources is your default folder .
Actually , you have entered WindowsPE recovery mode .
Here you have many ms - dos - like commands available ; use Help to see a list of commands available .
The most stunning thing is that there is no kind of a user authentification when entering this command prompt !
For security reasons , even basic local administrator authentification would be enough as used in older Windows versions � recovery consoles .
�
By using only four commands , you can find out what File1.txt - file contains !
As you can remember , this file was intentionally left unchanged so that any authenticated user could have access to it .
Next mission is to open File2.txt .
Instead of type - command , I�ll to open it into notepad using start File2. txt command .
Notepad opens and shows File2.txt contents !
And the only acl - right in this file was given to System :
What about File3.txt , which has no permissions at all ?
Fortunately , Windows Vista has a a league of new command line utilities , which are in this case very handy .
Takeown - command makes it possible to take ownership in command line .
After you have become the owner of File3.txt , you can set ACL - rights by using a new icacls - command , which replaces the old cacls - command .
Now you have full access to File3.txt .
After opening all three files in C : \Data2_nonEFS - folders , let�s have a look at C : \Data2_EFS - folder .
Because this folder is encrypted using EFS , there is no simple method in my knowledge to open these encrypted files in the command prompt .
Summary :
To protect you computer or workstation , try to :
- setup bios boot order so that booting from other media than hard disk is not possible
- setup startup password from your bios ( mainly in home computers )
- use hard disk encryption software , if possible
- encrypt files and folders using EFS , if mechanisms above are not possible

Cuong Do of YouTube / Google recently gave a Google Tech Talk on scalability .
I found it interesting in light of my own comments on YouTube ’s 45 TB a while back .
Here are my notes from his talk , a mix of what he said and my commentary :
In the summer of 2006 , they grew from 30 million pages per day to 100 million pages per day , in a 4 month period .
( Wow !
In most organizations , it takes nearly 4 months to pick out , order , install , and set up a few servers . )
YouTube uses Apache for FastCGI serving .
( I wonder if things would have been easier for them had they chosen nginx , which is apparently wonderful for FastCGI and less problematic than Lighttpd )
YouTube is coded mostly in Python .
Why ?
“ Development speed critical ” .
They use psyco , Python ->
C compiler , and also C extensions , for performance critical work .
They use Lighttpd for serving the video itself , for a big improvement over Apache .
Each video hosted by a “ mini cluster ” , which is a set of machine with the same content .
This is a simple way to provide headroom ( slack ) , so that a machine can be taken down for maintenance ( or can fail ) without affecting users .
It also provides a form of backup .
The most popular videos are on a CDN ( Content Distribution Network ) – they use external CDNs and well as Google ’s CDN .
Requests to their own machines are therefore tail - heavy ( in the “ Long Tail ” sense ) , because the head codes to the CDN instead .
Because of the tail - heavy load , random disks seeks are especially important ( perhaps more important than caching ? ) .
YouTube uses simple , cheap , commodity Hardware .
The more expensive the hardware , the more expensive everything else gets ( support , etc. ) .
Maintenance is mostly done with rsync , SSH , other simple , common tools .
The fun is not over : Cuong showed a recent email titled “ 3 days of video storage left ” .
There is constant work to keep up with the growth .
Thumbnails turn out to be surprisingly hard to serve efficiently .
Because there , on average , 4 thumbnails per video and many thumbnails per pages , the overall number of thumbnails per second is enormous .
They use a separate group of machines to serve thumbnails , with extensive caching and OS tuning specific to this load .
YouTube was bit by a “ too many files in one dir ” limit : at one point they could accept no more uploads (!! ) because of this .
The first fix was the usual one : split the files across many directories , and switch to another file system better suited for many small files .
Cuong joked about “ The Windows approach of scaling : restart everything ”
Lighttpd turned out to be poor for serving the thumbnails , because its main loop is a bottleneck to load files from disk ; they addressed this by modifying Lighttpd to add worker threads to read from disk .
This was good but still not good enough , with one thumbnail per file , because the enormous number of files was terribly slow to work with ( imagine tarring up many million files ) .
Their new solution for thumbnails is to use Google ’s BigTable , which provides high performance for a large number of rows , fault tolerance , caching , etc .
This is a nice ( and rare ? ) example of actual synergy in an acquisition .
YouTube uses MySQL to store metadata .
Early on they hit a Linux kernel issue which prioritized the page cache higher than app data , it swapped out the app data , totally overwhelming the system .
They recovered from this by removing the swap partition ( while live ! ) .
This worked .
YouTube uses Memcached .
To scale out the database , they first used MySQL replication .
Like everyone else that goes down this path , they eventually reach a point where replicating the writes to all the DBs , uses up all the capacity of the slaves .
They also hit a issue with threading and replication , which they worked around with a very clever “ cache primer thread ” working a second or so ahead of the replication thread , prefetching the data it would need .
As the replicate - one - DB approach faltered , they resorted to various desperate measures , such as splitting the video watching in to a separate set of replicas , intentionally allowing the non-video - serving parts of YouTube to perform badly so as to focus on serving videos .
Their initial MySQL DB server configuration had 10 disks in a RAID10 .
This does not work very well , because the DB / OS ca n’t take advantage of the multiple disks in parallel .
They moved to a set of RAID1s , appended together .
In my experience , this is better , but still not great .
An approach that usually works even better is to intentionally split different data on to different RAIDs : for example , a RAID for the OS / application , a RAID for the DB logs , one or more RAIDs for the DB table ( uses “ tablespaces ” to get your # 1 busiest table on separate spindles from your # 2 busiest table ) , one or more RAID for index , etc. Big-iron Oracle installation sometimes take this approach to extremes ; the same thing can be done with free DBs on free OSs also .
In spite of all these effort , they reached a point where replication of one large DB was no longer able to keep up .
Like everyone else , they figured out that the solution database partitioning in to “ shards ” .
This spread reads and writes in to many different databases ( on different servers ) that are not all running each other ’s writes .
The result is a large performance boost , better cache locality , etc .
YouTube reduced their total DB hardware by 30 % in the process .
It is important to divide users across shards by a controllable lookup mechanism , not only by a hash of the username / ID / whatever , so that you can rebalance shards incrementally .
An interesting DMCA issue : YouTube complies with takedown requests ; but sometimes the videos are cached way out on the “ edge ” of the network ( their caches , and other people ’s caches ) , so its hard to get a video to disappear globally right away .
This sometimes angers content owners .
Early on , YouTube leased their hardware .

Alex Halderman and I have confirmed that Sony ’s Web - based XCP uninstallation utility exposes users to serious security risk .
Under at least some circumstances , running Sony ’s Web - based uninstaller opens a huge security hole on your computer .
We have a working demonstration exploit .
We are working furiously to nail down the details and will report our results here as soon as we can .
[ UPDATE ( Nov. 15 ) : We have now posted more details . ]
In the meantime , we recommend strongly against downloading or running Sony ’s Web - based XCP uninstaller .
Kudos to Muzzy for first suggesting that such a hole might exist .
UPDATE : If you ’re technically sophisticated , and you have run the XCP uninstaller on your computer , you may be able to help us in our investigations .
It wo n’t take long .
Please contact Alex to volunteer .
Thanks .

DIGG THIS
The Iowa Christian Alliance and Iowans for Tax Relief are co-sponsoring a Republican candidates ’ forum for June 30 .
The event will feature Mitt Romney , Tommy Thompson , Sam Brownback , Jim Gilmore , Mike Huckabee , and Tom Tancredo .
Ron Paul , however , is to be excluded .
In fact , that ’s what Paul ’s campaign was expressly told when they inquired .
Campaign manager Kent Snyder tells the story :
We heard about this forum from numerous supporters in Iowa who asked why Dr. Paul was not going to participate .
Those supporters assumed that Dr. Paul was invited .
The campaign office had not received an invitation so we called this morning ; thinking we might have misplaced the invitation or simply overlooked it .
Lew Moore , our campaign manager , called Mr. Edward Failor , an officer of Iowans for Tax Relief , to ask about it .
To our shock , Mr. Failor told us Dr. Paul was not invited ; he was not going to be invited ; and he would not be allowed to participate .
And when asked why , Mr. Failor refused to explain .
The call ended .
Lew then called Mr. Steve Scheffler , president of the Iowa Christian Alliance , to talk with him .
Mr. Scheffler did not answer so Lew left a message .
He has yet to respond .
After reading this , I called Edward Failor myself .
I said I was calling about the exclusion of Ron Paul from his candidates ’ forum , particularly in light of Paul ’s extraordinary record on taxes .
" Is there a question in there you want me to answer ? " came the annoyed reply .
" Well , yes .
Are you excluding Ron Paul , and if so , why ? "
Failor explained that the event had been scheduled months ago , and that at that time they had made a decision about who the most " credible " candidates would be .
I did n’t quite understand his answer , though it was apparently more than he ’d bothered to provide the Paul campaign .
" You thought Tommy Thompson was a more credible candidate than Ron Paul ? " I asked .
( Can you imagine people gleefully sharing YouTube clips of Thompson with their friends , or holding up " Tommy Thompson Revolution " signs ? )
Failor refused to answer that or any other question I posed to him , and closed with , " That is the only statement I am willing to make . "
I assume I do n’t need to point out that this explanation is not believable at all .
We ’ll leave aside his organization ’s , um , mixed record when it comes to picking out the " credible " candidates .
Had this really been a mere logistical question , why would Failor not simply have said so to the Paul campaign when they initially inquired ?
( Not that that would have been a good explanation , but it would have been something . )
A non-hostile person with good manners might have said something like , " We ’re very sorry about the way things turned out ; we arranged this event a long time ago , and of course we ’d have been delighted to have your campaign participate if we ’d been able to feature more people on the stage . "
The answer I got was pretty obviously one Failor had devised on the fly , not having expected anyone to call him on his decision to exclude Paul .
But the answer I got is also an obvious lie .
Here is the schedule of the event as of a June 8 press release .
Here , on the other hand , is the schedule just the other day .
The second one replaces Jim Gilmore with Duncan Hunter .
I wonder why Hunter had n’t been told that the arrangements had been made months in advance , that he ’d been determined not to be credible — the whole story .
Failor , you ’re busted .
After our call , I got to thinking about this Failor character : what kind of person running a " tax relief " organization would exclude the presidential candidate with — and this is no exaggeration — possibly the best record on taxation in all of American history , someone who favors the abolition of the income tax and the drastic reduction or elimination of nearly all other federal taxes ?
Should this be the Iowans For a Little Tax Relief , But Not Too Much ?
I did a little poking around , and it turns out that our Edward Failor was initially a supporter of …George Pataki !
George Pataki .
And here I was thinking Failor had a hard time pinpointing credible candidates .
I remember seeing Pataki and Rudy Giuliani opening a Saturday Night Live episode years ago in which they both spoke about New York .
Pataki was reading off his cue card so badly and awkwardly you just had to change the channel .
Slightly less intelligent than George W. Bush : who will dispute this description of Mr. Failor ’s credible candidate ?
The New York Sun , writing about Pataki ’s record , observed in 2006 : " Mr. Pataki could be a hard sell to small - government conservatives , given that state spending in New York has grown to a projected $ 75 billion in the coming fiscal year from $ 43 billion in 1995 . "
No problem for Edward Failor .
According to the Sun , " Mr. Failor said the increases were the necessary result of growth brought on by aggressive tax cuts . "
Oh .
Maybe this is Iowans Who Are Only Marginally Unhappy With the Status Quo , or Iowans for Shell Games That Look Like Tax Cuts .
Maybe it ’s Iowans Who Want Guarantees that Absolutely Nothing Will Change .
Or perhaps it ’s Iowans for McCain : check out Mr. Failor ’s recent campaign donations .
The Iowa GOP at large , on the other hand , is not hostile to Ron Paul , and in fact made sure Paul would be included in the Iowa straw poll .
Iowa Republican leaders want it known that they , at least , have no bias against Paul .
Excluding Ron Paul from a " tax relief " candidates ’ forum is like excluding Batman from an Anti-Riddler Convention .
Even funnier is that these two organizations , in blacklisting Paul , reveal themselves to be even worse than the mainstream media they always criticize : the very day the Paul campaign discovered it had been barred from this Iowa event , they got a call from ABC News confirming Ron Paul ’s participation in the August 5 debate in Des Moines , Iowa .
Now I do n’t mean to leave the Iowa Christian Alliance out of the spotlight , but attempts to reach them resulted in busy signals or endless rings .
They probably figured it ’d be one day of angry calls , and that would be it .
So I found a second contact number for them , which I reproduce below .
We should n’t be surprised at all this ; such treatment is exactly what a truly anti-establishment candidate can expect in a world of phonies and hacks .
But Ron Paul ’s supporters are legion , and growing all the time .
I rather suspect they will have something to say about their candidate ’s exclusion .
Thanks to Michael Kenny for his input on this piece .

Your microwave is n’t just good for cooking frozen dinners , you can also make plasma or destroy a Furby .
Though we do n’t recommend trying any of these experiments at home , they ’re very interesting to watch nonetheless .
Microwave
Hacked Gadgets shows us what happens when you put a 250 watt 220 Volt commercial grade light bulb into the microwave .
The results are quite explosive to say the least .
I guarantee you this is the biggest bulb ever microwaved measuring in at over 10 ″ long by 6 ″ in diameter that glowed as bright as the sun with an explosive blast 10 times as loud as a normal explosive bulb .
The room smelled so electronic afterwards it would make any Robot drool
[ Source ]
Make Plasma in Your Microwave Using a Grape
This followup to the how to make plasma in your microwave tutorial , provides us with an easier way to create the effect by using just a single grape — rum and coke optional .
Plasma typically takes the form of neutral gas - like clouds or charged ion beams , but may also include dust and grains ( called dusty plasmas ) .
They are typically formed by heating and ionizing a gas , stripping electrons away from atoms , thereby enabling the positive and negative charges to move freely
Furby
Tired of hearing Furby ?
Then why not stick it in the microwave , complete with sound effects .
If you 're into reading legal proceedings verbatim , here 's a doozy for you .
It gets even better if you like to see RIAA lawyers dragging themselves , rather than their chosen targets , through the dirt .
Let 's get a feel for what 's going on here :
In Motown v. Nelson , pending in federal court in Port Huron , Michigan ( Eastern District of Michigan , Southern Division ) , the defendants -- Mr. and Mrs. Nelson -- have made a motion for attorneys fees against the RIAA attorneys , pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1927 for unreasonable and vexatious litigation and improperly interfering and / or obtaining false testimony from a prospective witness .
Got all that ?
Good .
For the rest of us , here 's what it means .
The RIAA sued the Nelsons , who in turn are basically asking for the case to be dismissed and their legal fees reimbursed , because the RIAA lawyers got the testimonies they wanted from some witnesses through coercion and / or extortion .
The transcript of the deposition that followed this motion gives us a glimpse into exactly how far the recording industry is willing to go to justify their crusade against file sharing .
It 's also very long , so I 'll just give you a taste here :
Q . What other areas do you feel that Mr. Krichbaum put words in your mouth ?
A. I do n't remember any specifically .
Just trying to get me to say that Angie and Jim or I had ripped the music off . [...]
Q. It was n't true .
And you felt that Mr. Krichbaum was trying to get you to say something that was n't true ?
A. Yes .
Q. And did he get you to say something that was n't true ?
A . From the statement I read , yes .
Ms. Granado went on to testify that Mr. Krichbaum had urged her to provide false and inaccurate testimony with regard to the entire portion of her original testimony implicating the Nelsons .
Q. Did he tell you why he needed you to stick with your original false story ?
A. Because he said he did n't have a case unless I did .
Q . So , he told you that he did n't have a case unless you stuck with the original false story ?
A. Yes .
This is a 15 - year - old girl , telling the story of how lawyers of a major industry group told her she had to commit perjury , just so they could win their case .
Some might call that racketeering , and it 's most certainly a highly illegal way to win a court case .
The deposition strongly suggests that the RIAA knew they did n't have a leg to stand on , and that they were perfectly happy to do anything in their power to win anyway .
Funny how rather than open their own wallets to settle , they prefer breaking the law themselves .
( Cue Radiohead 's Karma Police .
On second thought , do n't .
I 'll get sued for not paying license fees . )
In response , counsel for Mr. Nelson then asked Plaintiffs ' representative to provide a factual and legal basis for its position .
Plaintiffs ' representative responded that ' It did n't matter , someone is going to be responsible and someone is going to have to pay . '
Plaintiffs ' representative further threatened that unless Mr. Nelson paid $ 4,000.00 immediately , his client authorized him to conduct extensive discovery which would only increase the amount that he would eventually owe .
Nice .
We 've known all along that it 's all thud and blunder , a wave of scare tactics meant to force the small folks to settle in the face of bigwig lawyers dropping of intimidating subpoenas .
Sometimes they 're obviously just guessing , and all they 're doing is forcing the actual file sharers further underground where they 're harder to find , which leads to the next round of lawsuits hitting an even lower ratio of bad guys to innocent people .
They 're way out of feet in which to shoot themselves , and if albums sales drop a little , maybe it 's because they 're scaring away their own customers .
Or , more likely , they 're simply proving time and time again at this is an industry that does n't deserve our business .
Sex can be many things .
It can be an expression of love or of desire .
Of devotion and commitment .
It can be a way of knowing and a way of communicating .
It can be a selfish act or a sacrifice .
It can be given , taken , bought or sold .
It can be an act of violence .
And it can be a source of healing .
An old friend has been suffering .
He ’s not from New York but once in a while we get to sit down together , face to face , and have time to catch up on our lives .
His health is fine , but much of the rest of his life is very difficult .
The suffering has been long - standing .
The difficulties are complex and solving some leads to others .
I listen , and sometimes I have something helpful to offer by way of insight .
More often I just listen .
And quite often , while I ’m listening , a part of me is thinking , “ let me take you to bed . ” I want to have sex with him .
Not out of lust , and not out of pity .
Not because suffering is a turn - on .
Not out of a need to “ fix ” something .
Not apologetically .
Not to take advantage .
The desire to take this man somewhere quiet and slowly undress him and lay hands on his body is intrinsically linked to the outpouring of compassion that I feel when we are sitting across from one another .
This is not a “ poor thing ” kind of compassion , but a “ let me show you how good you can feel ” compassion thing .
A “ relax and enjoy this ” kind of compassion thing .
I think sometimes people can become so used to feeling bad that the bad feelings come to seem neutral and they forget how good they can feel .
Sex can be a way of healing , of remembering how to feel good and being reminded that people care about us .
This is not a new idea .
Sex is a way of connecting back to the pleasure of the body , the pleasure of touch , the excitement of eye contact and deep communication of desire .
The indulgence of warm smooth hands on cool skin .
The opening of the self .
The feeling of being engulfed , consumed , penetrated , filled .
The becoming .
The release of orgasm and the feeling of being fully seen – recognized – acknowledged – known – cared for by another human being .
This is not a self - sacrifice kind of healing .
There is real pleasure – physical and emotional pleasure – in bringing compassion and connection and restoration to another person .
There is a sense of power , perhaps , but not “ power over . ”
There is pleasure in being trusted .
There is a sense of self - indulgence as well .
A taking of pleasure in one ’s one body while bringing pleasure to someone else .
There are the simple pleasures of sex .
If only it could be left at that .
And I suppose it can , but so often it is n’t .
Often sex often becomes complicated .
Linked to anxiety .
Fraught with unintended meanings .
The having of it can threaten our pre-existing relationships .
Somehow something irrevocably changes and those changes are unpredictable and not always pleasant .
And then there are all of the cultural prohibitions against promiscuity and the messages about what it means to be “ faithful . ”
And these things can keep us from getting close to one another , or even feeling safe with one another .
They can make us afraid of admitting the depth or the reality of our caring for other people .
It does n’t need to be so , but it is difficult to challenge so directly the dominant cultural attachment of sex to romance and then to marriage , or to longtime commitment to something “ more ” than simple compassion and human connection .
If I were braver , I would do what I have not done – I would reach out to this man .
I would say “ I want to take you away , just for a few hours . ”
I would say , “ Trust me .
Relax .
Enjoy . ”
But I have not done this .
I am not brave enough in the face of my fears .
And it is not just the fear that our relationship would change that needs facing .
It is not just the fear of disapproval that might come from others if they knew .
It is partly a fear of entanglement .
A fear that what I want to offer might not be enough .
A fear that sometimes there can never be enough .
And these fears keep many of us from acting compassionately in non-sexual ways as well .
They keep us from offering money , from offering time , from caring too deeply or too consciously .
There are so many barriers keep us from compassionate action .
What does it take to make us feel safe really connecting with one another and caring for one another ?
What kind of trust ?
What kind of faith in ourselves and in each other ?
And how should we decide when it is right to compassionately offer sexual connection ?
I would like an answer to that question before the next time I see my friend .
France 's total immigration population is about five million
New Immigration Minister Brice Hortefeux said a family with two children would be paid 6,000 euros ( £ 4,068 ) to return to their country .
In 2005 - 2006 , a similar scheme was taken up by some 3,000 families .
France is home to about two million immigrants from north and sub-Saharan Africa , according to a 2004 census .
" We must increase this measure to help voluntarily return .
I am very clearly committed to doing that , " Mr Hortefeux told France 's RFI radio .
Mr Hortefeux last week was named immigration minister by newly - elected President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Mr Sarkozy has warned that France " is exasperated by uncontrolled immigration " .
France was hit by a series of riots in the immigrant - heavy suburbs in 2005 .
Britain is rapidly backpedaling on the " war on terror . "
Not the global effort to subdue jihadists , but the three - word phrase , much used by President Bush , which in the British establishiment now fear is ill - defined , oversimplistic , and excessively martial and Manichaean .
Government ministers were quietly instructed several weeks ago to avoid using the term , but matters were brought into the open Monday when a senior cabinet minister rejected the phrase during a speech in America .
Hilary Benn , the Blair government 's international development secretary , told a New York think tank that the concept of a war on terror sends out the wrong message on two levels :
It encourages terrorists by dignifying their cause , and it suggests that only military measures could be a useful response .
" In [ Britain ] , we do not use the phrase ' war on terror ' because we can't win by military means alone and because this is n't us against one organized enemy with a clear identity and a coherent set of objectives , " Mr. Benn told a meeting in New York organized by the Center on International Cooperation .
His remarks may hint at a subtle political shift in Britain as it prepares for Prime Minister Tony Blair to hand over the baton some time this summer .
Mr. Blair 's close alliance with Mr. Bush has been deeply unpopular in the Labour Party , much of which is appalled at the Iraq campaign .
When Blair leaves office , Finance minister Gordon Brown is likely to be crowned his successor , but a lively race for party deputy is shaping up .
Benn is one of the leading candidates .
" The more dovish people in the cabinet have probably always been uncomfortable with this " phrase , says Michael Moore , a Liberal Democrat MP , who dislikes the " war on terror " tag .
" The ' war on terror ' signals to the center - left in Britain an American construct which is in danger of becoming a self - fulfilling prophecy , as though the more we say it the more we will create these kind of enemies . "
He says the phrase does not address the complexities of terrorism .
" We need to recognize a broad set of destabilizing factors , mostly driven by extreme poverty and an inequitable share of the world 's resources , " says Mr. Moore .
" For us it 's a more complex feature of globalization , but to call it a ' war on terror ' is a mistake . "
Paul Wilkinson , a terrorism expert and author of " Terrorism versus Democracy : the Liberal State Response , " says the catchphrase raises public expectations that there is " a kind of battlefield solution to the problem of terrorism . "
The term gives terrorists a boost by making them feel " they are genuinely involved in a war , as they claim , and that they are soldiers , warriors , engaged in some kind of noble cause , " Prof .
Wilkinson adds .
Terrorists can , and indeed have , exploited such linguistic grandstanding .
But some terrorism experts are exasperated at the semantic debate , fretting that officials are fiddling while Rome burns .
" It 's OK for Mr. Benn to say it 's not a war , but that 's not how the enemy sees it , " says M.J. Gohel , a terrorism expert and director of the international Asia - Pacific Foundation think tank .
" The 9/11 attack was a declaration of war on the Western world and on secular democracies , and repeated statements by Al Qaeda and the global jihad movement have indicated clearly that they are at war . "
Bob Ayers , a security analyst at London 's Chatham House think tank , says Britain should n't get hung up on America 's proclivity for the word " war . "
" The US used the term ' war on ' in many things – war on poverty , war on terror , war on drugs , " he says .
" When you use the word war , it 's the term to describe mobilizing the assets of the nation state , " Mr. Ayers adds .
" It includes military forces , but is not exclusively military .
In the Second World War , Britain waged a war against axis powers , but it was n't just military .
It was economic , political , psychological warfare – hearts and minds . "
And in any case , he says , what 's the alternative ?
Nothing quite as snappy is the answer .
The European Union , notes Wilkinson , prefers to talk in terms of the " struggle against Al Qaeda , " which he says avoids ambiguity by pinpointing the most dangerous network and by indicating that it is not just about war in its traditional sense .
Moore says he would prefer to talk about " confronting international terrorism " and recognizing " the different roots that give rise to that . "
Otherwise , he says , he prefers " the so - called war on terror . "

Satellite tracking software freely available on the Internet and some textbook physics could be used by any organization that can get hold of an intermediate range rocket to mount an unsophisticated attack on military or civilian satellites .
Such an attack would require modest engineering capability and only a limited budget .
That is according to researchers writing in Inderscience Publishers ' International Journal of Critical Infrastructures .
A terrorist organization or rogue state could threaten essential satellite systems , according to Adrian Gheorghe of Old Dominion University Norfolk , in Virginia , USA and Dan Vamanu of " Horia Hulubei " National Institute of Physics and Nuclear Engineering , in Bucharest , Romania .
Military satellites , global positioning systems , weather satellites and even satellite TV systems could all become victims of such an attack .
Gheorghe and Vamanu have carried out an analysis of just how easy it could be to knock out strategic satellites , their findings suggest that dozens of systems on which military and civilian activities depend make near - space a vulnerable environment .
The team used a so - called " mathematical game " and textbook physics equations for ballistics to help them build a computer model to demonstrate that anti-satellite weaponry is a real possibility .
Accuracy and elegance are not issues in carrying out a satellite attack , the researchers say , as long as the projectile hits the satellite .
In fact , all it would take to succeed with an amateurish , yet effective anti-satellite attack would be the control of an intermediate range missile , which is well within the reach of many nations and organizations with sufficient funds , and a college - level team dedicated to the cause .
" Any country in possession of intermediate range rockets may mount a grotesquely unsophisticated attack on another 's satellites given the political short - sightedness that would be blind to a potentially devastating retaliation , " the researchers say .
On January 11 , 2007 , China deliberately destroyed one of its own weather satellites in a test , which some analysts suggested as having the potential to revive a techno - political race believed to be defunct since the 1980s .
According to Gheorghe and Vamanu that was the cool analytical view , but some hot diplomats are quoted as saying this demonstration is " inconsistent with international efforts to avert an arms race in outer space and undermining the security in outer space " .
" While it may be true that , when it comes to nuts and bolts , things may not be quite as simple as they sound here , the bare fact remains - it can be done . "
Their conclusions suggest that the risk of deliberate satellite sabotage should be placed higher on the security agenda .

A lot of folks did n't notice that Hillary gave an interview last week about Iraq that read like George Bush at his worst .
Not only did she lecture Democratic voters about how Iraq is tied to September 11 - which it most certainly is not - but she then one upped herself by chastising the other Democratic candidates , and we presume their supporters , over the fact that SHE was alive on September 11 , and apparently we were n't :
Attention focused on Iraq and her vote to authorize the use of force ahead of the U.S. - led invasion in March 2003 .
Presidential rivals such as former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards now say the vote in support was a mistake .
" There are no do - overs in life , " Clinton said .
She says Congress received bad information going into the vote and that she would have voted differently given what she knows now .
" As a senator from New York , I lived through 9/11 and I am still dealing with the aftereffects , " Clinton said .
" I may have a slightly different take on this from some of the other people who will be coming through here . "
Clinton said her view is that the nation is engaged in a deadly fight against terrorism , a battle that she contends Bush has botched .
" I do think we are engaged in a war against heartless , ruthless enemies , " she said .
" If they could come after us again tomorrow they would do so . "
With all due respect , that 's a load of crap .
As a resident of Washington , DC I too lived through September 11 and have been dealing with the aftereffects .
I watched the Pentagon burn outside my window the entire day , so spare me the " you lived through September 11 and I did n't " crap .
Secondly , I suspect every American alive on that day was scared to death and worried about their lives and their loved ones and their country .
It is beyond hubris to suggest that somehow Mrs. Clinton suffered more than the rest of us , and even worse , she implies that we did n't suffer at all .
We do n't have a problem with Hillary , here at AMERICAblog .
Other than John Kerry , who has now left the presidential race , we do n't have firm views about any of the candidates ( though Biden gives us the willies ) .
Sure , we have concerns about all of candidates , to varying degrees , and we have things we like about each of them - but we have written off no one , and we most certainly are not Hillary - haters .
But .
Invoking September 11 when asked about Iraq is unconscionable .
It is pure Dick Cheney , and an outright lie .
It is not what a Democrat says , and hell , it is n't even what a sane moderate Republican says .
I have no idea what Senator Clinton was trying to telegraph in her speech - who exactly does n't think that we 're engaged in a war against heartless enemies ?
- but speaking as a blog that has a pretty damn good record of treating her fairly , she really crossed the line on this one .
Do n't question our patriotism , and do n't talk like George Bush , or this is going to be a very problematic race .
Should the popularity , political expediency or profit potential of a medicine determine our support of it ?
That ’s how a surprising number of our public health guidelines , regulations , health benefits , and even curriculums in medical and nursing schools are decided .
Do we want to go to a healthcare provider whose advise and prescriptions for us are based on their popularity and ability to make extra money for them ?
Or do we want to trust that our provider is giving us honest advice and therapies with proven efficacy ?
And as medical professionals , is it ethical to endorse and put credentials behind modalities that lack reproducible , clinical and scientific evidence — or even plausible , rational explanations in proven biophysical science — simply because patients may want them or offering them can bring in extra revenue ?
Or would that be taking advantage of people and betraying their trust ?
These are dicey questions and confront all of us daily in mainstream medicine and public health .
But complementary alternative medicines may most challenge us to think about them .
A recent story from Switzerland highlighted how we ’re often led by popular beliefs rather than science when it comes to making health decisions .
Homeopathy has been a hot button issue there , as supporters of alternative preparations try to force officials to pay for them under their country ’s compulsory health insurance .
Last year , after investigating the evidence , the interior ministry found homeopathy therapies “ failed to meet the criteria on efficacy , suitability and cost - effectiveness ” under their law .
But the science proved no deterrent and supporters gathered signatures and petitions to force it to a popular vote giving , as SwissInfo reported , “ rational voters a headache . ”
Health agencies around the world , from Ontario to Scotland are considering including homeopathy and other alternative modalities among recognized medical professional services .
Homeopathic products have become popular here in America , too , as sales have reached $ 400 million a year , according to Grant Ferrier , editor of Nutrition Business Journal .
But a surprising number of people , both professionals and consumers , do n’t understand what they are and only know what they ’ve heard from friends or advertisements .
The most common situation I encounter is that many people think they ’re natural , holistic medications , and confuse them with herbs and supplements that may have some active ingredient .
Even if you think you understand homeopathic preparations , the following information may come as a surprise .

Readable s-expressions and sweet - expressions : Getting the infix fix and fewer parentheses in Lisp - like languages
Lisp - based programming languages normally represent programs as s-expressions , where an operation and its parameters are surrounded by parentheses .
The operation to be performed is identified first , and each parameter afterwards is separated by whitespace .
So the traditional “ 2+3 ” is written as “ (+ 2 3 ) ” instead .
This is regular , but most people find this hard to read .
Here ’s a longer example of an s-expression - notice the many parentheses and the lack of infix operations :
( defun factorial ( n ) ( if ( <= n 1 ) 1 (* n ( factorial (- n 1 ) ) ) ) )
I think there ’s a small resurging interest in Lisp - based systems , because Lisp is still very good at “ programs that manipulate programs ” .
The major branches of Lisp ( Common Lisp , Scheme , and Emacs Lisp ) have not disappeared , after all .
And I recently encountered a very cool and very new language in development , BitC .
This language was created to write low - level programs ( e.g. , operating system kernels and real - time programs ) that are easy to mathematically prove correct .
I learned about this very cool idea while writing my paper High Assurance ( for Security or Safety ) and Free - Libre / Open Source Software ( FLOSS ) … with Lots on Formal Methods .
BitC combines ideas from Scheme , ML , and C , but it ’s represented using s-expressions because it ’s easy to manipulate program fragments that way .
I do n’t know how well it ’ll succeed , but it has a good chance ; if nothing else , I do n’t know of anyone who ’s tried this particular approach .
The program - prover ACL2 uses Common Lisp as a basis , for the same reason : program - manipulating programs are easy .
The FSF backs guile ( a Scheme dialect ) as their recommended tool for scripting ; guile gives lots of power in a small package .
But many software developers avoid Lisp - based languages , even in cases where they would be a good tool to use , because most software developers find s-expressions really hard to read .
S - expressions are very regular … but so is a Turing machine .
They do n’t call it ‘ Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses ’ for nothing .
Even if you can read it , most developers have to work with others .
Some people like s-expressions as they are - and if so , fine !
But many others are not satisfied with the status quo .
Lots of people have tried to create easier - to - read versions , but they generally tend to lose the advantages of s-expressions ( such as powerful macro and quoting capabilities ) .
Can something be done to make it easy to create easier - to - read code for Lisp - like languages - without spoiling their advantages ?
I think something can be done , and I hope to spur a discussion about various options .
To get that started , I ’ve developed my own approach , “ sweet - expressions ” , which I think is actually a plausible solution .
A sweet - expression reader will accept the traditional s-expressions ( except for some pathological cases ) , but it also supports various extensions that make it easier to read .
Sweet - expressions are automatically translated into s-expressions , so they lose no power .
Here ’s how that same program above could be written using sweet - expressions :
defun factorial ( n ) ; Parameters can be indented , but need not be if ( n <= 1 ) ; Supports infix , prefix , & function < =(n 1 ) 1 ; This has no parameters , so it 's an atom .
n * factorial(n - 1 ) ; Function ( ... ) notation supported
Sweet - expressions add the following abilities :
Indentation .
Indentation may be used instead of parentheses to start and end expressions : any indented line is a parameter of its parent , later terms on a line are parameters of the first term , lists of lists are marked with GROUP , and a function call with 0 parameters is surrounded or followed by a pair of parentheses [ e.g. , ( pi ) and pi ( ) ] .
A “ ( ” disables indentation until its matching “ ) ” .
Blank lines at the beginning of a new expression are ignored .
A term that begins at the left edge and is immediately followed by newline is immediately executed , to make interactive use pleasant .
Name - ending .
Terms of the form ‘ NAME ( x y… ) ’ , with no whitespace before ‘(’ , are interpreted as ‘ ( NAME x y… ) ’ ;.
Parameters are space - separated inside .
If its content is an infix expression , it ’s considered one parameter instead ( so f( 2 + 3 ) passes the its parameter , 5 , to f ) .
Infix .
Optionally , expressions are automatically interpreted as infix if their second parameter is an infix operator ( by matching an “ infix operator ” pattern of symbols ) , the first parameter is not an infix operator , and it has at least three parameters .
Otherwise , expressions are interpreted as normal “ function first ” prefix notation .
To disable infix interpretation , surround the second parameter with as ( … ) .
Infix expressions must have an odd number of parameters with the even ones being binary infix operators .
You must separate each infix operator with whitespace on both sides ; precedence is supported .
Use the “ name - ending ” form for unary operations , e.g. , -( x ) for “ negate x ” .
Thus “ 2 + y * -( x ) ” is a valid expression , equivalent to (+ 2 (* y (- x ) ) ) .
Infix operators must match this pattern ( and in Scheme cannot be => ) : [+-\*/<>=&\|\p{Sm}]{1-4}|\:
I call this combination “ sweet - expressions ” , because by adding syntactic sugar ( which are essentially abbreviations ) , I hope to create a sweeter result .
For more information on sweet - expressions or on making s-expressions more readable in general , see my website page at http://www.dwheeler.com/readable.
For example , I provide a sweet - expression reader in Scheme ( under the MIT license ) , as well as an indenting pretty - printer in Common Lisp .
In particular , you can see my lengthy paper about why sweet - expressions do what they do , and some plausible alternatives .
You can also download some other implementation code .
I ’ve set up a SourceForge project named “ readable ” to discuss options in making s-expressions more readable , and to distribute open source software to implement them ( unimplemented ideas do n’t go far ! ) .
I will probably need to work on other things for a while , but since I had this idea , I thought it ’d be a good idea to write the idea and a quick sample demo of it , so that others could build on top of it .
There has n’t a single place for people to discuss how to make s-expressions more readable .. so now there is one .
There are a lot of smart people out there ; giving like - minded parties a place to discuss them is likely to produce something good .

Learning from the Masters
If you want to learn something , study what the masters do .
To me that seems obvious , and yet many do n’t do it .
Perhaps we simply forget .
So let me inspire you with a few examples …
I just got an advance copy of David Shenk ’s “ The Immortal Game : A history of chess ” - and I ’m referenced in it !
Which is an odd thing ; I do n’t normally think of myself as a chess commentator .
But I do like the game of chess , and one of my key approaches to getting better is simple : Study the games of good players .
I ’ve even posted a few of the games with my comments on my web site , including The Game of the Century ( PGN / Text ) , The Immortal Game ( PGN / Text ) , The Evergreen Game ( PGN / Text ) , and Deep Blue - Kasparov , 1996 , Game 1 ( PGN / Text ) .
It ’s my Byrne / Fischer writeup that was referenced in Shenk ’s book .
But I did n’t create that stuff for a book , originally .
I ca n’t play like these great players can , but I get better by studying what they do .
In short , I ’ve found that I must study the work of the masters .
There are many children ’s educational philosophies that have , at least in part , the notion of studying good examples as part of education .
Ruth Beechick ’s “ natural method ” for teaching writing emphasizes starting by copying and studying examples of great writing .
She even notes Jack London and Benjamin Franklin started by studying works they admired .
Learning begins by studying the work of the masters .
I often write about free - libre / open source software ( FLOSS ) .
In part , I do because it ’s one amazingly interesting development .
But there are other reasons , too .
Some developers of FLOSS programs are the best in the business - you can learn a lot by seeing what they do .
In short , one important advantage of FLOSS is that it is now possible for software developers to study the work of the masters .
I recently wrote the article High Assurance ( for Security or Safety ) and Free - Libre / Open Source Software ( FLOSS ) … with Lots on Formal Methods ( aka high confidence or high integrity ) ( I gave it the long title to help people find it ) .
Here , I note the many tools to create high assurance software - but there are precious few FLOSS examples of high assurance software .
True , there are very few examples of high assurance software , period , but where are the high assurance software components that people can study and modify without legal encumberances ?
( If you know of more , contact me . )
That worries me ; how are we supposed to educate people how to create high assurance software , if students never see it ?
People do not wake up one morning and discover that they are an expert .
They must learn , and books about a topic are not enough .
They must study the work of the masters .

The university says it will not retract its campaign
Lakehead University in northern Ontario set up www.yaleshmale.com in a bid to attract potential new students .
It shows a picture of Yale graduate Mr Bush with the caption : " Graduating from an Ivy League university does n't necessarily mean you 're smart . "
The president of Lakehead 's student union called the campaign " repugnant " .
The university has issued posters bearing the black and white image of Mr Bush , who graduated from Yale in 1968 , encouraging people to visit its campaign website .
It was literally a tongue - in - cheek way of getting attention
Frederick Gilbert ,
Lakehead University president and vice - chancellor
Once there , users are invited to click on a link if they agree with the caption , and are taken through to a page promoting Lakehead , which is based in Thunder Bay and has 7,600 students .
" There are universities and then there are universities .
So let 's not beat around the bush , " it says .
" Lakehead is different .
We believe the person you become after you graduate is even more important than the person you were when you enrolled . "
There is then a further link to take users through to Lakehead 's official site for potential students .
' Inappropriate '
The university has defended its campaign , which also includes prizes of a car lease and handheld computer games consoles , saying it has had a positive effect .
" It was literally a tongue - in - cheek way of getting attention , " university president and vice - chancellor Frederick Gilbert told Reuters news agency .
The website had received more than 7,000 hits , he said on Monday , and online comments had been 95 % positive .
But he acknowledged the university had received e-mails which were " running in the opposite direction " , which was a concern .
" Older generations " and some of Lakehead 's students considered the campaign inappropriate , he said .
The university would not retract its campaign , however , although it would try to respond to individual concerns , he said .
Student union president Isabelle Poniatowski told Reuters the campaign was low - brow and lacked class .
" It still strikes me as being very repugnant , " she said .
" Lakehead has so many positive attributes that you could really sell to people that live down south . "
Wind power could supply all the energy needs of much of the East Coast and then some , if a phalanx of wind turbines running from Massachusetts to North Carolina were installed offshore , a new study concludes .
Though local residents often object to wind farms intruding on their landscape and views , wind power has become an increasingly attractive option for generating clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions for several countries .
Offshore wind farms in Denmark and the United Kingdom are now used to generate electricity , with Denmark drawing 20 percent of its energy from wind power .
But determining just how much ocean area is available and how much energy a wind farm can actually produce is tricky and had yet to be done for this area of the Atlantic .
" In doing our surveys and watching the public debate , we saw that no one had solid empirical data on the actual size of the offshore wind resource , and we felt this was important for policy decisions , " said study author Willett Kempton of the University of Delaware .
An ideal location
Oceans make ideal locations for wind turbines because they " are particularly windy all over , " Kempton said .
The ocean 's surface is n't littered with hills , trees and houses like the land is , so winds over the water are faster because there is less friction to slow them down .
The wind turns the three blades of the turbine , and their rotation is converted into electricity by a generator .
The Middle Atlantic Bight , a region of the Atlantic Ocean that runs from Cape Cod , Massachusetts to Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , turns out to be an ideal setting for wind turbines because it is a large area of shallow water , Kempton said
Locating a large body of shallow water is important because with current technology , turbines can only be built out to a depth of 20 to 30 meters ( close to 20 or 30 yards ) .
Otherwise , it is too difficult to erect the metal pole that the turbine sits atop .
However , experimental turbines have been built out to a depth of 50 meters off the coast of Scotland .
These types of turbines may be in commercial use soon , Kempton said , and with reasonable additional costs , he forsees building them out to a depth of 100 meters .
" Anything deeper than that , and you 're talking science fiction , " Kempton told LiveScience .
Surpassing energy needs
To estimate how much area would actually be available to place wind farms on in the Middle Atlantic Bight , the researchers had to exclude areas used for bird flyways , toxic waste sites and shipping lanes .
" We do n't want to compete with that use , " Kempton said .
The researchers also had to consider that wind turbines must be spaced half a mile apart , otherwise they create turbulence that interferes with other turbines .
Even with all those allowances , the energy needs of most of the East Coast could be met , or even surpassed , with the installation of over 160,000 turbines , according to Kempton 's findings .
But to achieve that energy , the turbines would have to be built out to a depth of 100 meters , according to the research published in the Jan. 24 issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
The reduced use of fossil fuels would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the area by 57 percent , even in New England , one of the world 's most highly polluting areas , according to the study .
" The fact that we could get such huge reductions there gives me hope for other places , " Kempton said .
Mixed opinions
Proposals for offshore wind farms have met with mixed opinions : residents of Cape Cod are vocal in their opposition to such a project , but those in nearby Delaware support building the turbines .
Common complaints against wind turbines are their unsightliness , their potential to destroy habitats and their potential effect on local weather patterns .
There would be " a realistic set of pluses and minuses -- there would be some bird kills , " Kempton said .
But he pointed out that the pylons actually create habitat for fish , the turbines would not be visible from shore and local weather effects would be negligible .
Even with local opposition , Kempton thinks it is likely that one of these projects will be built .
" I think it 's a 100 percent probability , " Kempton said .
And the whole area does n't have to be built at once .
He said : " It definitely could be done on a state - by - state basis . "
EVERY summer , the world has its temperature taken twice — once by climate scientists , literally ; a second time by opinion pollsters , metaphorically .
This year two new surveys have thrown up a lot of fresh data on how the world really feels .
And they have , so the pollsters say , cast some unexpected light on the link between wealth and happiness .
Ever since social scientists at the University of Pennsylvania found that mansion - dwelling American millionaires are barely happier than Masai warriors in huts , some economists have been downplaying the link between cash and contentment .
In a 2005 book , Richard Layard , a British scholar , said family circumstances , employment and health all mattered more to a sense of well - being than income .
Rich countries might be happier than poor ones , but beyond a threshold , the connection weakens , and more cash would not buy more happiness — so the theory goes .
The new polls cast some doubt on that school of thought .
They add weight to the contention that growth and income play a big part in boosting people 's satisfaction with life and their attitude to the future .
One of these surveys claims to be the first genuinely global opinion poll .
Called World Poll , and conducted by the Gallup organisation , it spans 130 countries , many of which are being polled for the first time .
Other surveys are smaller .
The respected Global Attitudes Survey of the Pew Research Centre , an offshoot of an American charity , operates annually in just over 50 countries .
The World Values Survey run from the University of Michigan is more comprehensive ( over 80 countries ) , but updated only once in five years .
Gallup 's pollsters asked a standard question : how satisfied are you with your life , on a scale of nought to ten ?
In all the rich places ( America , Europe , Japan , Saudi Arabia ) , most people say they are happy .
In all the poor ones ( mainly in Africa ) , people say they are not .
As Angus Deaton of Princeton University puts it , a map of the results looks like an income plot of the world ( see map ) .
There are some exceptions : Georgia and Armenia , though not among the world 's poorest states , are among the 20 most miserable .
Costa Rica and Venezuela , though middle - income countries , are among the 20 happiest .
The Brazilians , pictured above , seem a bit more cheerful than their income level justifies .
But in general , declared levels of happiness are correlated with wealth .
The pattern also seems to hold true within countries , as well as between them .
Rich Americans are happier than poor ones ; rich Brazilians happier than poorer ones .
The other new survey , by Ipsos , confirms the picture .
Top of its list of 20 countries ranged by happiness is the rich Netherlands ( with Gallup , it is Finland ) ; China is bottom .
The survey also asked questions about confidence in the future , whether your children will be better off than you are , and so on .
Regardless of countries ' current income , there was a close correlation between GDP growth and optimism , with China , India and Russia most optimistic ; France , Germany and Italy were the least .
If both polls are right , the Chinese are pretty miserable now but they expect a dramatic turn for the better .
The Ipsos poll is not strictly comparable to Gallup 's because ( for the first time ) it asks questions of what Ipsos calls “ leaders and shapers of public opinion ” , mostly business people and politicians .
This group has distinctive views — it takes a loftier view than the general population ( see table ) .
The gap between elite and popular perceptions is especially sharp in Russia , India and China .
In those countries , top people 's attitudes are far more upbeat than those of the general population .
In Europe and America , the attitudes of the elite are roughly in line with — or slightly more pessimistic than — society as a whole .
In fairness , the “ new happiness ” economists , such as Mr Layard , never claimed there was no connection at all between money and feeling good .
What they have said is that once people climb out of poverty , the link is weak , and may not work at all above a certain point ( as one British pundit put it , extra money “ is now proved beyond doubt not to deliver greater happiness , nationally or individually ” ) .
The evidence for this comes from surveys in most rich countries ( such as America 's general social survey ) , which show that happiness has been flat for decades , even though incomes have risen sharply .
On the face of it , the new findings are a counter - point to the earlier data .
If the richest countries report greater “ happiness ” than moderately rich ones , that would suggest there is no quantifiable level of income at which extra cash fails to deliver extra contentment .
Still , the latest findings do n't invalidate the historic experience of particular countries — like the United States — which have surged to greater levels of wealth without experiencing any rise in general levels of reported happiness .
But if you treat history as bunk and concentrate on the levels of satisfaction that countries feel right now , the results are — in Mr Deaton 's view — quite striking .
He has compared Gallup 's satisfaction score with national income based on purchasing - power parities , and got a close fit .
So what should one make of the contradiction between these surveys and previous evidence ?
Definitional problems may provide part of the explanation .
These are self - reported polls and people mean different things by “ happiness ” .
Cultural problems are likely to be much greater when 130 states are involved .
Another possibility is that “ happiness ” is really a proxy for something else , such as health .
Perhaps the main point is that money mitigates poor health , so the rich are happier than the poor mainly because they feel healthier .
But that can not be the whole story .
More than half the 20 countries with the lowest level of satisfaction with health are in the ex-Soviet Union or eastern Europe though in statistical terms they seem relatively well off .
In contrast , much poorer African countries ( with a far higher incidence of HIV / AIDS and other diseases ) express higher levels of health satisfaction .
Expectations , or memories , may be at work : medical woes in an ex-communist state feel worse because people recall , albeit through rose - tinted spectacles , an era of full health coverage .
Lastly , as the Ipsos poll clearly shows , happiness and optimism are not just different , they can be contradictory .
The Chinese are dissatisfied but upbeat ; Europeans are happy now but dread tomorrow .
Many links between happiness , income and optimism have yet to be teased out .
This new data — though not the last word on the subject — should help .
Ca n't make an Xbox laptop without some parts , so let 's see what we 'll need .

Westinghouse LCM - 17x1 17 - inch widescreen monitor - Same as on the first Xbox laptop we did in 2006 .
However , by the time we started construction on the second laptop , these have all but disappeared from the stores .
Thankfully there were some still available online , namely from places like eBay .
Alternatively , most 17 - inch widescreen LCD monitors should work .
They 're plummeting in price since the 19 - inch LCDs are dirt cheap these days .
This monitor also gives us a sound amplifier and built - in speakers we can use .
The resolution of this screen is 1280 x 768 so it fits the high def resolution of the 360 nicely .

Ha ha , we kid , we kid .
But when you 're making a " portable " unit , the less wires the better .
I 've seen these adapters sell used for as low as the " bargain " price of $ 75 .
I 've heard certain model " thumb " USB WiFi adapters work , but we have n't tested any as of yet .

Ribbon cable -
As usual I 'd suggest the type from old floppy drives and IDE disks .
However , for rewiring SATA connections it 's best to have thin ( as in Ultra ATA 33 and up ) solid - strand wire .
You can tell if it 's solid or stranded by bending the cable -- solid wire cable holds its shape much better than stranded .

Stripping down an Xbox 360 motherboard
Removing parts from the motherboard
It is important to note that the Xbox 360 is RoHS compliant , meaning it uses unleaded solder .
In general it's tougher to desolder parts in the RoHS world , so for best results apply some new solder onto a pin , then heat it with the desoldering iron for longer than you normally would ( so about 4 seconds ) before sucking up the solder .
Be especially careful with pins that connect to inner ground or power planes , they 're also difficult to remove .
This is also true of the ground connections on a jack that connect to the main surface of the board , such as a USB jack .
Use a clean , brand new desoldering iron tip for best results .
Heat up a pin for a little longer than normal to ensure all the solder in the through - hole is melted before you try and suck it up .
Capacitor Flattening
Decide in which direction you 'd like to flatten the cap .
Keep in mind that if you 're flattening many caps you 'll need to make sure there 's going to be room to lay them all down .
Heat up the leads on the cap at the bottom of the motherboard ( also called the solder side ) .
Once they 're hot , you can bend over the cap .
You can heat one lead , bend the cap a bit , heat the other lead , bend it , wash rinse repeat until the cap is tiled over on its side .
In some cases you may need to move the cap and not just bend it over .
Desolder the cap and then use small bits of wire to attach the leads to the original spot .

Hacking up the WiFi module
Using a multimeter , test the each pin inside the big USB jack while it 's connected to this PCB to see which pins on the back of the board are which .
To identify them , first find which pin on the big USB port is ground .
This should connect to all ground points / shielding on the WiFi PCB , including the shielding of the mini-USB jack itself .
Once you 've found ground , the next 3 pins over are Data + , Data - and then +5 volts .
Solder a piece of ribbon cable to the pins on the mini-USB port and mark the opposite end of the cable for future reference .
Typically we suggest black magic marker for the ground wire and red for +5 volts .
Cut the wire at the middle section .
This wire contains an outer shield ( ground ) and an inner coated wire which is the signal itself .
This is very much like the WiFi we hacked back during the Wii laptop tour de force .
Strip a small bit of plastic off the inner wire and dab some solder onto the wire .
Twist the stranded shielding wire together and solder it into a single piece as well .
This is the kind of work where you 'll be glad you used a low wattage iron and not something that melts everything within a two foot radius into mush .
Solder a length of wire to each of these connections .
For best results cover each connection with a bit of thin heat shrink tubing ( available in the electric aisle of your friendly neighborhood hardware store ) .
Modding / reattaching the DVD and hard drives
Extending SATA cables for the DVD and hard drive
The stubby SATA cable from the 360 .
The stubby SATA cable from the 360 .
Start by cutting the SATA cable in half length - wise .
Note that the cable is in 2 halves side - by - by , one half is the A + A- signals , the other is B+ B - .
You can peel these halves apart like string cheese , which is fairly tasty unless it 's sat in your lunch pail too long .
Using an X - Acto knife , carefully slice away about 1/2 - inch of the plastic covering .
This will reveal a tin foil like material .
DVD drive power connector
The cable cut in half .
Doubles as a modern art spider .
The cable cut in half .
Doubles as a modern art spider .
Cut ( 2 ) lengths of ribbon cable with 5 strands each .
About 5 - inches long should be good .
Solder each of the ribbon cables to the 5 wires on both sides of the plug , as shown above .
Insulate the wires with electric tape or small bits of heat shrink tubing .
Of course you 'll need to remember to slide the tubing on before you make the connection .
Regardless , heat shrink tubing gives it a nice clean look when done .
We usually do ours with a lighter , the tubing shrinks before the wires burn .
Connect each of the plug ends to each other with the ribbon cable .
In this photo the tabs are placed as such to have their tabs both on the right , to ensure the connections are made correctly .
Note that the plugs are the same shape and have the same pinouts .
Thus , the 5 wires on the " Left " side of the first plug connect to the 5 wires of the " Left " side of the second plug .
This is what causes the wires themselves to " flip " or criss - cross between the cables .
The finished extended DVD drive power connector
Hard Drive Connector
Cut the wires off close to the Xbox plug end .
We 'll be reattaching them by color code and pin testing , so no need to check how they connect on the Xbox plug .
Twist and solder together the white , blue and yellow wires - these are all +5 .
Likewise , connect black , green and orange together , these are all ground .
As with the DVD drive 's SATA cable , peel back the foil on the other wires to reveal the data lines and their ground wires .
Unlike the DVD cable it's not very clear how to rewire the data lines , we 'll cover that shortly .
You can take apart the Xbox 360 Hard Drive enclosure with the same type of tools required for the main case itself .
Inside you 'll find a 2.5 - inch SATA laptop - style drive , a power / data plug going into it ( item above on the left ) some short wiring and then the plug which goes into the top of the Xbox ( right ) .
As with the DVD drive , solder a piece of 4 - strand ribbon cable to each data strand .
2 of the wires will be ground , 2 data .
We 'll determine which signals they are in the next step .
Here 's what the extended hard drive SATA plug / cable should look like .
We 've used a bit of electric tape to insulate the data connections , thin heat shrinking tubing would have also worked if we would have had some around .
For this project we 've added about 5 - inches of length , and without the aid of prescription drugs .
Pinout of a SATA plug .
We need to discover what the pinout is of the wires on the other side , but it 's kind of hard to fit the probes of a multimeter into a jack like this .
Use a small bit of stiff wire ( such as that clipped off a resistor ) to insert into each pin of the jack for easy testing .
Use the multimeter to test which wires at the end of the newly extended cable are A+ , A- , B - and B +.
You may find it handy to label them using different colored magic markers , or by putting a bit of Scotch tape on the end of the wire and making it with a pen .
Solder the cables to the motherboard using the pinouts shown at the beginning of this section , as well as making the +5 and ground connections .
Conclusion
I 'm not going to cover how to take apart the somewhat Pandora 's Xbox - esque 360 case since it 's covered elsewhere on the 'net .
We 'll start by assuming you have it disassembled and down to the motherboard and drives .
We do n't need to get into how to desolder in this article since we 've covered it before .
Some tips on removing these parts from the motherboard :
Side RoHS conspiracy theory -
While we were doing the Wii Laptop hack we noticed it was very easy to desolder parts off the motherboard , unlike most other modern electronics .
Could the Wii have been non-RoHS compliant , thus explaining the shortages ?
The front USB ports .
It connects with two rows of pins ( for the USB signals ) and metal tabs off the shielding on the side .
The best way to get this sucker loose is to rock it back and forth slightly while heating the large metal mounting tabs .
It also helps to chop off any plastic posts from the plug that are going through the board .
The photo above shows the pinout for future reference .
The left column of pads is port 1 , the right column is port 2 .
Here 's one of the memory card connectors .
It uses a pinout much like USB , but uses +3.3 volts instead of 5 .
Since these take up a decent amount of space it 's best to remove them , but use the pinout above should you desire to reattach them remotely .
Next comes the top - mounted hard drive connector .
Be sure to desolder all of the pins before you try and pry it off , you do n't want to damage any of the thin traces on the motherboard for the data signals .
We 'll cover how to wire directly from here to the hard drive a little later on in this article .
One one the trickest parts to remove is the remove Ethernet / USB port .
Shown above is the pinout for the USB portion of it .
To the left of this is the big audio / video port .
Since this port is fairly thin it wo n't get in the way , and since it has so many pins it would be quite difficult to remove if you tried .
Connections to it can be made via a hacked A/V cable ( as with our Xbox 360 VGA hack ) or by soldering to the points on the bottom of the board .
More on this , as well as removing and rewiring the big power input jack , in Part 2 .
Even in this high - tech age of supersonic jets and microwave ovens many electronic devices still employ large electrolytic capacitors ( " caps " for short ) .
These are the can - shaped objects on a circuit board , usually colored blue or dark brown , and are usually the largest components as well .
While we can't remove them we can " flatten " them over to save some vertical space .
Flattening caps :
Be sure to check polarity when working with caps .
On the motherboard one of the leads will be marked with a " + " , this is positive .
The other lead may have a white stripe as shown above , this is negative .
On the cap they 'll be a strip on one side or end -- this indicates the negative terminal .
Check that you rewire caps correctly .
Doing them wrong can result in a 3 red lights of death scenario , though if you go in and fix the caps you 'll be ok .
( So the 3 red lights aren ' ta death knell . )
Next let 's hack up the worth - its - weight - in - gold WiFi module .
Like many electronics these days , it 's literally glued together ( which is why we do n't feel bad about our own hot glue fetish ) .
It does take a bit of work to crack it open , though .
Start by using an X - Acto knive to cut a groove along the seam of the module on one side .
Make several cuts until the groove is deep enough to fit a screwdriver inside .
Next , as you may have guessed , stick a flat headed screwdriver in there and twist .
This should pop open at least a portion of the shell .
Once you have a bit of purchase you can wedge the rest of the shell off .
Just do n't push the screwdriver in too far or you may damage some of the components .
Here 's the WiFi module with the shell opened .
Not much too it really .
Not let 's rewire the plugs to make it easy to use in a laptop portable .
Here 's the original USB port .
As you can see it plugs into the PCB via a mini-USB port , similar to a digital camera .
Desoldering this port would be a bit tricky , so we 're simply going to attach new wires for the USB connection on the other side of it .
Shown above is the solder side of the mini-USB jack .
Next let 's extend the WiFi antenna wire .
It starts out fairly short but with some careful modding we can change that .
Re-attach the snap connector to the other end of the wires in the same fasion .
Take care with this type of soldering since with the short existing wire there 's not much room for mistakes .
The hacked WiFi module .
Note on the right side I 've attached a 4 pin male header to the end of the USB wire .
This will allow me easy connections to the rest of the motherboard further along in this project .
Now let 's modify the DVD drive to fit in a smaller case , and prep the hard drive as well .
Start by using the Dremel cutoff wheel to remove the extra length of the 4 black plastic posts on the bottom of the DVD drive .
Cut them off so they 'll flush with the base of the drive .
The holes remain inside the post , allowing us a way to secure the drive to the final case .
A size 8 screw will fit tightly into it .
In the original Xbox 360 the DVD drive sits atop the GPU heatsink and has a stubby SATA cable for its connection , along with a power cable very similar to the one for the DVD in the original Xbox .
To place the DVD drive beside the motherboard for a laptop we 're going to need a longer SATA cable .
One option is to simply buy one , but even a short cable might be too long and bulky for the confines of a case .
Here 's how to hack the existing cable into a longer one : Carefully peel this away to reveal 2 bare wires ( both are ground ) and 2 coated wires ( data signals ) .
Solder a piece of solid wire thin ribbon cable with 4 strands to the SATA wires .
This preserves both the ground signals and the data ( either A or B ) .
Use a minimal amount of solder for the connections .
Insulate the connections and repeat the procedure for the other half of the cable .
Reconnect the other end of the cable to the ribbon cable in the same way .
To place the DVD player as seen in this laptop you 'll need to extend this cable by about 4 to 5 inches .
The cable should now be ready to go !
The other cable going to the DVD drive is the power connector .
It also includes an " Eject " signal .
This consists of a group of black wires with a white plug on each end .
It 's longer than the DVD 's SATA cable but still , in stock form , not long enough to move the drive very far .
Note that the pinouts at both ends of the cable are the same , thus the wires " flip " , or cross each other from end to end .
You can tell which way the cable is meant to be inserted by the small tabs on the side of the plug .
More on this later .
Cut the power cable in half .
Do n't worry about keeping track of which wire goes to what , it 's pretty straightforward .
Strip a bit of plastic off the ends of the wiring and " tin " them with a bit of solder .
Now it 's time to extend the connector for the hard drive .
This is similar to the DVD method but we have to determine some of the pinouts manually .
Above you can see the pinouts for the 360's hard drive .
There 's really only 6 wires to make the connection since most of the pins are ground .
For this example we 'll use some standard size stranded ribbon cable for the ground and power , and thin , solid Ultra ATA ribbon cable for the data , like we did with the DVD drive .
Here 's how the extended SATA / power cables should look when soldered to the motherboard .
Notice how we 've " doubled up " the ground and power with 2 stranded ribbon cable wires each .
This ensure enough current gets through .
Sure it 's just a 500 mA laptop hard drive and not , say , an electic pizza oven , but it 's good to make sure anyway .
Alternatively you could use slightly thicker gauge wire but that 's not always as convienent , and tends to be a bit stiff and unwieldy .
Also note that the 2 ground connections per data cable had been soldered to ground ( lower connections on the left and rightmost sides ) .
You can never have enough grounds !
Once you 've had a chance to make sure that it 's working properly it's a good idea to " lock down " the wires with some hot glue .
You do n't need to cover the connections , just glue the wires down someplace nearby .
What this does is keep the wires from pulling or breaking free of the motherboard since the " hinge point " becomes where you 've glued them down , not at the connection point .
A good general - purpose tip for any kind of electronics hacking .
Here 's the final combo unit .
We have the DVD drive with the hard drive attached at the rear .
On top of this is the WiFi module we hacked earlier , and everything has convienent ports for connecting to the main motherboard .
This modular approach is a big help when assemblying and troubleshooting a unit .
The extra time it takes to add plugs and ports now will save time later when you do n't have to desolder or cut wires later .
We 're now well on our way with the Xbox 360 laptop mod .
In the next How - To we 'll cover designing and building the case plus hacking up the LCD monitor .
Stay tuned and we 'll see you then !
" As much as I love the concept , if I actually saw myself wearing one of these , I 'd have to kick my own ass . "
Agreed , alot of the watches I see on the internet look cool , but wearing them is like putting on a giant nerd sign .
Speech codes are rare in the industrialized , Western democracies .
In Germany and Austria , for instance , it is forbidden to proselytize Nazi ideology or trivialize the Holocaust .
Given those countries ' recent histories , that is a restraint on free expression we can live with .
More curious are our own taboos on the subject of global warming .
I sat in a roomful of journalists 10 years ago while Stanford climatologist Stephen Schneider lectured us on a big problem in our profession : soliciting opposing points of view .
In the debate over climate change , Schneider said , there simply was no legitimate opposing view to the scientific consensus that man - made carbon emissions drive global warming .
To suggest or report otherwise , he said , was irresponsible .
Indeed .
I attended a week 's worth of lectures on global warming at the Chautauqua Institution last month .
Al Gore delivered the kickoff lecture , and , 10 years later , he reiterated Schneider 's directive .
There is no science on the other side , Gore inveighed , more than once .
Again , the same message :
If you hear tales of doubt , ignore them .
They are simply untrue .
I ask you :
Are these convincing arguments ?
And directed at journalists , who are natural questioners and skeptics , of all people ?
What happens when you are told not to eat the apple , not to read that book , not to date that girl ?
Your interest is piqued , of course .
What am I not supposed to know ?
Here 's the kind of information the ``scientific consensus " types do n't want you to read .
MIT 's Alfred P. Sloan professor of meteorology Richard Lindzen recently complained about the ``shrill alarmism " of Gore 's movie ``An Inconvenient Truth . "
Lindzen acknowledges that global warming is real , and he acknowledges that increased carbon emissions might be causing the warming -- but they also might not .
`` We do not understand the natural internal variability of climate change " is one of Lindzen 's many heresies , along with such zingers as ``the Arctic was as warm or warmer in 1940 , " ``the evidence so far suggests that the Greenland ice sheet is actually growing on average , " and ``Alpine glaciers have been retreating since the early 19th century , and were advancing for several centuries before that .
Since about 1970 , many of the glaciers have stopped retreating and some are now advancing again .
And , frankly , we do n't know why . "
When Lindzen published similar views in The Wall Street Journal this spring , environmentalist Laurie David , the wife of comedian Larry David , immediately branded him a ``shill . "
She resurrected a shopworn slur first directed against Lindzen by former Globe writer Ross Gelbspan , who called Lindzen a ``hood ornament " for the fossil fuels industry in a 1995 article in Harper 's Magazine .
I decided to check out Lindzen for myself .
He was n't hard to find on the 16th floor of MIT's I.M. Pei-designed Building 54 , and he answered as many questions as I had time to ask .
He 's no big fan of Gore 's , having suffered through what he calls a ``Star Chamber " Congressional inquisition by the then senator .
He said he accepted $ 10,000 in expenses and expert witness fees from fossil - fuel types in the 1990s , and has taken none of their money since .
He 's smart .
He 's an effective debater .
No wonder the Steve Schneiders and Al Gores of the world do n't want you to hear from him .
It 's easier to call someone a shill and accuse him of corruption than to debate him on the merits .
While vacationing in Canada , I spotted a newspaper story that I had n't seen in the United States .
For no apparent reason , the state of California , Environmental Defense , and the Natural Resources Defense Council have dragged Lindzen and about 15 other global - warming skeptics into a lawsuit over auto- emissions standards .
California et al .
have asked the auto companies to cough up any and all communications they have had with Lindzen and his colleagues , whose research has been cited in court documents .
`` We know that General Motors has been paying for this fake science exactly as the tobacco companies did , " says ED attorney Jim Marston .
If Marston has a scintilla of evidence that Lindzen has been trafficking in fake science , he should present it to the MIT provost 's office .
Otherwise , he should shut up .
`` This is the criminalization of opposition to global warming , " says Lindzen , who adds he has never communicated with the auto companies involved in the lawsuit .
Of course Lindzen is n't a fake scientist , he 's an inconvenient scientist .
No wonder you 're not supposed to listen to him .

China said some US chicken products had salmonella
Officials said they had found salmonella and growth - enhancers in several imported US chicken products .
Last year , 51 deaths in Panama were blamed on medicine tainted with Chinese chemicals and , this year , some US pets died from food with Chinese gluten .
China this week also executed a top official for approving unsafe drugs .
' Exceptional '
China 's General Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine said salmonella had been found in products from the largest US meat processor , Tyson Foods .
CHINESE PRODUCT SCARES
Pet food - tainted with chemical melamine Toothpaste - tainted with chemical diethylene glycol and bacteria Farmed fish - traces of banned drugs and pesticides found Tyres - fault may cause blow - outs Toys - contain lead or pose choking hazard Children 's jewellery - contains lead Ceramic heaters - pose fire safety risk
China 's tainted food crisis
Chicken feet supplied by Sanderson Farms had growth enhancers and anti-parasite drugs , it said .
Among the suspended US operators were Cargill Meat Solutions , AJC International and Triumph Foods .
Most of the firms have not yet commented , but a Cargill spokesman denied the claims .
Beijing has vowed to improve its quality control by streamlining its fractured monitoring system .
This week it also executed the former head of the State Food and Drug Administration , Zheng Xiaoyu , for taking bribes in approving unsafe drugs .
Quality control head Li Yuanping recently insisted tainted Chinese food exports were rare .
" All of them are exceptional cases .
There is no such thing as zero risk .
China - made products should not be labelled as substandard just because of a few bad producers . "
Apart from pet food and cough syrup , international concern has also been raised over Chinese toothpaste , tyres , jewellery , seafood and toys .
The virus is carried in blood cells
Around 99 % of patients successfully treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin had no detectable virus for up to seven years .
The treatments were known to work initially but it had been unclear whether the virus would come back .
Experts said it was good news for patients but that some still suffer from painful symptoms .
Over the past decade the number of people in the UK diagnosed with hepatitis C has increased because of higher rates of testing .
This data looks incredibly promising and it's extremely good news for patients as they are always concerned that the virus would come back
Charles Gore , Hepatitis C Trust
But many people are still unaware they are carrying the infection .
Hepatitis C , which is contracted through infected blood , can cause cirrhosis , liver failure or cancer .
Early treatment is usually effective .
Long - term cure
Professor Mitchell Shiffman , chief of hepatology at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical School , and colleagues carried out a long - term study in 1,000 patients to find out whether the virus would come back .
Participants were given a course of injections of pegylated interferon alone or in combination with ribavirin .
In those for whom treatment was successful ( no detectable virus after six months ) only eight patients tested positive for the virus in the following seven years .
The researchers pointed out it had not yet been determined if those patients had suffered a relapse or been reinfected .
Professor Shiffman said : " We are encouraged by this data because it is rare in the treatment of life - threatening viral diseases that we can tell patients they may be cured .
" In hepatitis C today , we are able to help some patients achieve an outcome that effectively enables them to put their disease behind them . "
It is believed that around 250,000 people in the UK have signs of hepatitis C infection , although some of these will clear it naturally and not become chronically infected .
However , the number could actually be as high as half a million and it is estimated that nine out of ten people do not know they are infected .
It can take years or even decades for symptoms to appear but a recent Department of Health campaign has been encouraging those at risk to get tested .
Anyone who ever shared equipment for injecting drugs - even if it was a long time ago , and even if they only did it once or twice - they could be at risk from hepatitis C .
Others could have become infected through a blood transfusion , if they received one before screening was introduced in 1991 - or through sharing banknotes or straws to snort cocaine .
Charles Gore , chief executive of the Hepatitis C trust said the results would be reassuring for patients who had to undergo six months to a year of weekly injections and daily tablets .
" This data looks incredibly promising and it's extremely good news for patients as they are always concerned that the virus would come back . "
" The only thing we would add is that we 're talking about a cure for liver disease , which is the thing that kills you , but not everyone feels fantastic at the end of treatment - some people have lingering symptoms such as aches in their joints and feeling tired . "
Prada Marfa Forum : Prada Marfa 2007 Update 
Subject : Prada Marfa
Dear TE , I recently went on a family vacation to Fort Davis , Texas .
My kids and I could not believe our eyes when we saw the Prada Marfa store !
It so surprised us that I slammed the brakes and turned around and took a picture .
I am happy to find out it was art .

Prada Marfa Missing ?
Dear TE , Is Prada Marfa even still there ?
I work in Big Bend National Park and made a special trip out on Hwy 90 all the way from Marfa to Valentine to shoot it , and could not find it anywhere .
( I did see the blimp base , however . )
Is it right by the side of the road , or is it off aways ?
Please advise .
By the way , I 'm a former free - lance photographer from Dallas and have accumulated a storehouse of West Texas images , and am still at it .
While visiting your wonderful site , I noticed there are more than a few towns in your Texas Towns A - Z that do n't have any images at all , some of which I have .
Just let me know if you would you like me to send you some - Sincerely , Doug Duncan , January 09 , 2007
Prada Marfa and the " Lost Blimp " of Valentine
[ Dear TE ] , I have had two wierd encounters on highway 90 from Marfa to Van Horn that caused me to stop , then laugh .
My first encounter was when I was driving Hwy 90 for the first time last December and I noticed the border patrol blimp from the back - end .
It looked like a propeller floating in mid-air - attached to nothing .
The road was so flat and had such little traffic that I was able to watch it and drive at the same time using my peripheral vision .
At one point I actually got out of the car to study it and try to figure out what it was .
It was not until I got [ directly ] under it that I could see the entire thing .
Then I wondered all the way to Van Horn who had lost their blimp .
I imagined the Texas winds placing [ it ] out in the middle of nowwhere .
Someone in Van Horn clued me in [ as to the blimp 's function and ownership ] .
This week I was making the same journey and noticed a small building out in the middle of nowhere that said something about Marfa .
I had an appointment and could n't stop at that time .
I had evidentally driven past it the time before but had n't noticed it as my eyes were directed up at the blimp .
On the way back I had more time so when I passed by the building again - I turned around to see what it was .
Boy was I surprised !
It almost makes you think you might be on Candid Camera .
I think [ someone ] should film the people that stop to see it .
Both incidents made me chuckle and were welcome distractions on that lonely drive .
I hope there is more to come .
Thanks for the entertainment !

As me and my mom were on our way to Eagle Pass we passed the shoestore [ Prada Marfa ] and we were not sure if it was what we had seen .
We wanted to make a U - turn and see if it was really there .
Well , on our way back it was there .
We stopped and took pictures of it .
To us it was a store in the middle of nowhere , but [ we ] enjoyed it as well .
I told my brother about it and he does n't belive it 's really there .

On " Countdown , " Keith Olbermann talked with David Shuster about brewing controversy over The White House 's refusal to comply with subpoenas issued by both the House and Senate requesting documents relating to the attorney purge scandal and the illegal NSA wiretapping program .
The Solicitor General sent a letter to Congress today claiming executive privilege for both the President and Vice President , but as Shuster points out , an attachment to that letter reveals what is , in essence , an admission that the White House is much more involved in the attorney purge scandal than they have previously admitted .

Abstract : The LMI K - machine was the last processor designed and built by Lisp Machine , Inc. Unlike other Lisp Machines , the K - machine is not descended from Tom Knight 's original CONS architecture ; the K - machine is an original design .
This paper provides an overview of the more interesting elements of the K - machine architecture .
Introduction
The LMI K - machine was the last processor designed and built by Lisp Machine , Inc .
The K - machine was designed in late 1985 - early 1986 and the first instructions were executed December 31 , 1986 .
The hardware was significantly debugged by April 1986 and an effort to port the legacy Lisp Machine code to the K - machine was underway .
Financial difficulties kept the K - machine from reaching the marketplace .
Lisp Machine 's successor , Gigamos , was beset by legal difficulties which again prevented marketing of the K - machine processor .
Nonetheless , several K - machine board sets were produced and debugged before the demise of Lisp Machine , Inc .
The K - machine processor is notable for several reasons : Unlike other Lisp Machines , the K - machine is not descended from Tom Knight 's original CONS architecture ; the K - machine is an original design .
The K - machine is designed to run Lisp , and Lisp only .
As a result , the performance of the K - machine on the Gabriel benchmarks is significantly higher than that of any of the several contemporary competing products of the mid-to - late 1980's , among them the TI Explorer chip , the Symbolics Ivory , and Lucid Common Lisp .
In fact , the K - machine was competitive with Lisp implementations on the Cray 1 and the IBM 3670 .
Since the project was kept relatively secret during its development , very few people know the details of its architecture .
The authors of this paper were the primary architects of the original K- machine as designed and built by Lisp Machine , Inc .
The hardware implementation of the architecture was primarily designed by Robert Powell , Bruce Deffenbaugh , and Kent Hoult .
Subsequent minor hardware changes were made by the staff of Gigamos .
Many people were involved in the project .
This paper provides an overview of the more interesting elements of the K - machine architecture .
The K - machine contained its share of mundane elements such as instruction caches , virtual memory hardware , etc .
Details about the mundane hardware is beyond the scope of this paper .
Architectural Principles
In any processor design there are fundamental " principles " from which the rest of the architecture derives .
For the LMI K - machine , these were as follows :
Optimistic instruction execution
The processor was designed with the assumption that certain operations , are common enough that no time should be wasted processing them .
For example , when two numbers are added it is assumed that they are both fixnums .
If this turns out not to be the case , the addition is aborted and the computation retried with the generic arithmetic code .
This is in contrast to the LMI LAMBDA which did a type dispatch on arithmetic operands before attempting to operate upon them .

Fully type - safe operation
All user - operations are fully type safe .
Speed and safety flags are ignored by the compiler and full safety is provided by the hardware .

Non-expert user assumption
A typical user of an LMI LAMBDA does not have the time necessary to learn how to squeeze high performance from that processor .
We therefore designed the machine to optimize the patters of usage found in code written by non-expert users .
This is not to say that inexperienced programmers can expect high performance from poorly written code , but a pedagogic and abstract style of code need not be abandoned when coding a high - performance application .

32 - bit objects
As in the CONS , CADR , and LMI LAMBDA , the K - machine supports 32 - bit objects .
In contrast , the Symbolics 3600 , had 36 - bit objects .
In both the 3600 and the LMI LAMBDA , the type tag is kept in the pointer , so the address space , as defined by the length of a pointer , is significantly smaller in the LMI machines .
A 32 - bit object admits a larger range of stock hardware upon which to base an implementation , and allows Lisp objects to be stored and manipulated on non-specialized hardware , for instance , the standard 32 - bit bus found in most modern computers .
Furthermore , the smaller address space simplifies the implementation of the virtual memory system and ephemeral GC by allowing a single level of page tables .
The drawbacks of using 32 - bit objects are an inability to use full IEEE floating point , integers are required to have less than 32 - bits precision , and the address space is quite a bit smaller .
Additionally it is much more difficult to ensure that all objects are tagged at all times ; generally , the tag bits must be stripped off objects before they are passed through the ALU , and the objects must be re-tagged before they are stored back in memory .
This increases the burden upon the system programmer to ensure that the garbage collector only sees valid pointers .

RISC - like architecture
Certain RISC principles were adhered to : Instructions are atomic ; there are no " instruction prefixes " or " string operations " .
There are no complicated addressing modes ( although that the low order bit can be forced to 1 during a read cycle to be able to take CDR 's without having to perform an add ) .
All instructions complete in a single fixed - time clock cycle .
Other RISC principles , such as a uniform instruction set , were discarded .
The K - machine has a way to fit an ALU operation into virtually any instruction .
There are even " short " conditional branches for tight loops that have enough bits in them to execute an arithmetic ( but not a shift / rotate ) instruction while branching .
Unlike some RISC machines , while the instruction set was " reduced " as above , complicated instructions that performed several operations in parallel were introduced so long as they could be completed in one clock cycle .
In retrospect , we inherited many of the advantages and disadvantages of RISC processors .
We had simpler and cheaper hardware , interrupt processing was easier , and the compiler was easy to target .
However , we also had very wide instructions ( 64 - bits ) , and often the compiler could not find useful work to be done while waiting for condition codes to become available .
This caused several NOP s to be inserted .
We also found that the performance of the machine can be limited by the rate at which the instruction cache is loaded .

50ns clock cycle
Our target was a 50ns clock cycle .
Each instruction was to complete within this time .
The actual machine came in at 80ns .
It turns out that the AMD 29332 computes a stable output some 20ns or so after the inputs become stable except for one crucial line : the integer overflow line can take up to 47ns to stabilize .
The critical timing loop is between the ALU receiving correct inputs to the ALU output stabilizing , a couple of gate delays to recognize an error condition , and the time necessary to abort the current instruction fetch and set the program counter to 0 .

3 - address machine
The CONS , CADR , LAMBDA , and Symbolics 3600 emulated a stack machine with the microcode .
While a stack machine is an easy architecture to compile to , there is a performance penalty to be paid .
For instance , in the evaluation of a simple addition , 3 instructions must be used :
push arg1
push arg2
add
Where a register machine may accomplish the same operation in one instruction .
A 3 address machine , however , requires a much wider instruction than a stack machine because the arguments to a stack machine operation are implicit .
The K - machine has a 64 - bit instruction word .
An instruction word of this size creates some instruction bandwidth difficulties , but there are compensatory advantages in that the instruction can specify a number of operations to be done in parallel .

No CDR codes
Analysis of the storage on existing Lisp Machines indicated that only about 20 percent of the storage was actually stored in lists ( the rest being vectors , structures , or classes ) , and that about 20 percent of the lists benefited from CDR codes .
CDR codes take their toll in increasing memory references ( the CAR must be examined before the CDR can be located ) , and reduced address space ( 2 - bits per pointer reserved for every object in the system ) .
One CDR - code bit was added to the address space , and the other to the tag .

" Level " implementation technology
The entire K- machine is implemented in standard CMOS and TTL .
No ECL or other high - performance parts were used .
The point of doing this is to be able to easily incorporate faster technology by simply replacing all the parts with their faster equivalent .
The final data layout is a 6 - bit tag at the most - significant end of the ( 4 - byte ) word , and a 26 - bit word pointer in the least significant end .
This makes a 226 word ( 64 MWord ) address space , or a 1/4 GB address space .
Again , this is smaller than Symbolics , but nothing to sneeze at .
The machine is correct - endian , i.e. little .
The Pipeline
The K machine has a 4 stage pipeline .
While this is transparent to the end user , and mostly transparent to the system programmer , there are occasions where the pipeline is exposed .
Notes about this will be interspersed below .
The clock cycle to the machine registers run at twice the speed of the main processor clock and alternate between read and write cycles .
This means that each instruction can both read from the registers and write back to them .
The four pipelines stages are as follows :
Fetch
The instruction is fetched from the instruction cache .
Read
The instruction source data are fetched from the register file , functional input bus , or instruction register ( for immediate values ) .
ALU
The data are passed through the ALU and latched at the output register .
Write
The value in the output register is written back to the register file or to a functional destination .
An instruction may be aborted at any time before the output register value is written .
A four - stage pipeline generally means that branch instructions are not taken immediately .
Usually , there are " branch delay instructions " that are unconditionally executed after the branch is specified .
The K - machine branch delay is unusual in that the condition codes are set in the instruction before the conditional branch instruction and the branch target is specified in the instruction after the conditional branch .
Thus , when the condition codes are generated by the ALU , the conditional branch is in the instruction register and the machine can then decide whether to follow the branch at this point .
This ameliorates the effect of branch delay by spreading the branch across several instructions .
Of course , the compiler hides the details of conditional branches .
The Primary Data Paths
Within the processor itself , the data paths are 33 bits wide .
The extra " boxed " bit allows us to manipulate 32 - bit non-pointer data ( such as floating point numbers ) directly .
The 33rd bit is constructed on the fly from context when a pointer is read into the machine , and appropriate action is taken to " box " non-pointer data when it is written to memory .
The register file
Unlike the CONS derivatives , but much like a RISC machine , the K - machine has a register file consisting of 4096 33 - bit words .
This register file is duplicated to allow 2 simultaneous reads from different registers .
Writes to the register file always update both copies .
The output of the register file is latched and presented only to the ALU .
In order to use the contents of a register as a virtual address or to write it to memory , it must be passed through the ALU .
This incurs a one - cycle delay .
The register file is both read and written during each machine instruction , and thus requires fast RAM .
Static RAM is used both for speed , and to allow single stepping of the K - machine hardware for debugging purposes .
The register file is addressed by the function calling hardware .
This will be described in detail below .
The ALU
Integer unit
The K - machine was designed to use the AMD 29332 ALU .
This is a 32 - bit ALU that has quite a bit of functionality including a barrel shifter ( for tag extraction ) , and 8 , 16 , 24 , and 32 - bit modes of operation .
The decision was made to make fixnums 24 - bits wide to take advantage of the natural ability of the ALU to handle this .
This was a step backward , as the LMI - lambda had 25 - bit fixnums , but the gain in performance was considered more important .
Floating point unit
In parallel with the integer ALU ( the AMD 29332 ) , is a floating point adder and a floating point multiplier .
The output register , which holds the value to written back to the registers , may receive its value from any of these sources .
Type checking unit
Neither the CADR or the LMI LAMBDA had hardware for checking the types of operands in parallel with the actual computation done by the ALU .
It is my understanding that the Symbolics 3600 has a type checking unit , but we are unfamiliar with it .
We invented a simple , but effective , type checking hardware module that operates in parallel with the arithmetic units .
This hardware consists of a 256 K bit x 1 bit RAM .
This RAM is addressed by 7 bits each from the left and right operands of the ALU ( the boxed and tag bits ) , two bits from the instruction to specify the type check operation ( for instance , operands must be boxed fixnums , or left operand is an aggregate data structure and the right operand is a fixnum ) , and two bits from a mode register ( this allowed the program to change type checking strategies when garbage collecting , for instance ) .
These 7+7+2+2 are concatenated to form a 218 address for the type check RAM .
This single bit output indicates whether the operation should succeed or cause a type check error .
This turns out to be an elegant , simple , and inexpensive mechanism for parallel type checking .
The type check RAM is loaded at boot time by presenting all possible combinations to the RAM ( by sending synthesized data through the ALU ) .
Traps are turned off during programming , and a special control register toggles the write line at the appropriate time as the data flies by .
It is tricky , but it avoids the necessity of adding special data paths in order to program the type checking hardware .
By implementing the checking in a RAM , we can experiment with which types are represented , and even add new hardware tags on the fly .
Boxed unit
A small piece of logic computes the boxed bit for the ALU result .
The instruction can specify that the result is forced to be boxed , forced to be unboxed , is to have the same boxedness as the left - hand operand , or is to have the opposite boxedness as the left - hand operand ( this last one has no discernible use , but it is what the hardware does ) .
Interconnection
As mentioned previously , the output of the register file is latched and presented to the inputs of the ALU .
The output of the ALU is similarly latched ( by the output register ) and written back to the register file in the next instruction .
Thus the primary data paths in the machine are composed of a two - stage pipeline .
A set of address comparators enable a pass - around path when the result of an ALU operation is needed immediately for the next computation .
This relieves the compiler from part of the instruction scheduling burden .
In general , the compiler can ignore the effect of the pipeline except when functional sources and destinations are involved .
There are additional points to inject and extract data from the main data paths .
Functional destinations can be written with the value of the output register .
These consist of various control registers , the memory maps , and the virtual memory address and data registers .
Functional sources may be injected into the right hand side of the ALU input registers .
Additionally , the virtual memory data may be injected directly into the output register ( see below for why ) .
Like the CADR , but unlike the LAMBDA , the functional busses ( called the MFI and MFO bus in the CADR ) , are not connected .
The MFI bus passes data destined for the processor , the MFO bus passes data sourced from the processor .
This admits the possibility that some inconsistency may arise in a read - write register ( for instance , the memory data register ) , but the difficulty in " turning around " the bus , quite evident in the LMI LAMBDA , is easily avoided in this manner .
Because the functional destinations are located beyond the output register , the effect of the pipeline is exposed to the compiler and care is taken to ensure that enough time is allowed for the data to arrive at its destination before an attempt is made to use it ; in particular , it is important to not attempt to use the virtual memory data register until two instructions after initiating the read .
Like the CADR and LAMBDA , the K - machine has interlocks to stall the pipeline while the processor awaits data from the memory system ; the two instruction rule is to make sure that the request to read from the memory system precedes the request for the value read .
As mentioned before , the virtual memory data can be injected into the pipeline at the output register rather than at the right hand input to the ALU .
The unusual placement of the injection point of the memory data saves time ; memory data is usually written to a register and this will bypass a pointless trip through the ALU .
Since the functional destinations are delayed by a clock tick , certain operations , such as loading the type checking RAM , can take advantage of this delay by specifying that the data is to be written , And providing said data in the next instruction in the stream .
The data will therefore be at the correct point in the pipeline when the write pulse is generated by the delayed functional destination .
This is a bit of a hack , but it allows us to use a baroque set of instructions to program the hardware without requiring any extra data paths .
( Of course this can only be done with interrupts off ) .
The instruction register can also be injected into the right hand side of the ALU .
This allows us to embed immediate constants into the instruction stream .
However , since the immediate constants had to be part of an instruction , there is no room for an ALU operation to be specified when this mechanism is used .
The hardware forces the ALU to perform a pass right instruction , so all immediate instructions must be loaded into a register before any operation can take place ( note that if the immediate was loaded to a functional destination it would simply pass through the ALU on its way to the functional output bus ) .
A special case is made for immediate fixnums .
These are represented in the instruction stream as untagged immediate values .
The hardware generates the fixnum tag on the fly as it is injected , and the 8 bits saved ( remember that fixnums are 24 bits ) , allow for an ALU operation to be specified .
The PC can be loaded from the output of the ALU .
This allows computed branches to be executed .
Function calling hardware
While the LMI Lambda was advertised as having special hardware to speed function calls , there is no particular piece of hardware devoted to rapid function calling .
No machine that I am aware of had function calling hardware like the K - machine .
Register addressing
The function calling mechanism is intimately tied to the register addressing scheme .
A register address consists of 6 bits .
Two bits select a " frame " and 4 bits provide an offset within that frame .
Each frame therefore has 16 general purpose registers .
There are 4 frames available to each instruction ( more below ) .
Analysis of the LMI LAMBDA showed that most functions have one or two arguments and one or two local parameters .
The unusual functions that overflow the register frame are handled in software .
The compiler generates the calls to the register spilling code .
The register frames are not overlapped as in other RISC machines .
This allows us to allocate and free register frames in a non-stack ( LIFO ) manner .
The advantages of this are discussed below .
Unlike the CADR , LAMBDA , and 3600 , registers do not have a virtual address .
In the LAMBDA , virtual memory accesses to the stack cause a load from the stack cache .
In the K - machine , it is not possible to address register values in this way .
Thus it is not possible to create a pointer into the stack .
The 4 frames available to each instruction are as follows :
Global
A set of 16 global frames is allocated for use by all functions .
Each instruction includes a 4 bit global frame selector , so only 16 of the 256 global registers are available within a single instruction .
Global registers contain data such as commonly used constants ( like 1 , 0 , NIL , - 1 , etc. ) to avoid using the costly load immediate instruction , pointers to wired memory ( like the page tables ) , etc .

This frame contains the arguments , locals , and temporaries of the currently executing function .
This frame contains the arguments , locals , and temporaries of the currently executing function .
Open
This frame is the one currently being prepared for the next function call .
This frame is the one currently being prepared for the next function call .
Return
This frame is the one that was used by the last function call .
Multiple values can be returned in this frame , but single values are returned via a different mechanism .
In retrospect , this frame causes more problems than expected as it needs to be saved and restored on each interrupt .
Call sequence
The K - machine uses a " 3 - point " calling sequence .
A new open frame is allocated , then it is filled with arguments , then control is transferred to the callee .
When the callee returns , the open frame that was allocated is discarded ( actually moved to the RETURN frame ) .
While it may not sound like it , this implements a callee saves convention .
When a function is called as a subproblem , a continuation must be created ( and pushed ) in order for the function to return a value .
Note , however , that the continuation does not need to be in a register .
In fact , it is rare for a continuation to be manipulated as a value , so a separate " hidden " stack is used to hold it .
This allows us to manipulate continuations in parallel with operations that use the register set .
The continuation has 4 parts : the caller 's active frame , the caller 's previous open frame , the return PC , and the return destination .
The actual control sequence is complicated , but I 'll make a stab at explaining it :
Open a frame
The open instruction saves the current values of the OPEN and ACTIVE register frame pointers on the hidden stack and loads the OPEN register with a new frame pointer .
Frame pointers are kept in a hardware freelist .
This freelist is popped when a frame is opened , and it is pushed when a function returns .
When the freelist is close to empty , an interrupt is generated to dump the stack to memory .
The oldest frame on the stack contains a trampoline that reloads the stack from memory .
The instruction saves the current values of the OPEN and ACTIVE register frame pointers on the hidden stack and loads the OPEN register with a new frame pointer .

This freelist is popped when a frame is opened , and it is pushed when a function returns .
When the freelist is close to empty , an interrupt is generated to dump the stack to memory .
The oldest frame on the stack contains a trampoline that reloads the stack from memory .
Multiple open statements are allowed .
Each one will push the previous value of the OPEN register on the hidden stack .
This means that temporaries necessary for building a stack frame need not be allocated from the currently active frame , or copied from temporary locations to the argument locations at call time .
Call a function
The call instruction saves the return PC on the hidden stack , loads the ACTIVE frame pointer from the OPEN frame pointer , and transfers control to the new function .
The instruction saves the return PC on the hidden stack , loads the ACTIVE frame pointer from the OPEN frame pointer , and transfers control to the new function .
Return from a function
The return instruction moves the current RETURN frame pointer to the frame freelist , moves the ACTIVE frame pointer to the RETURN register , restores the callers OPEN and ACTIVE registers , restores the PC and transfers control back to the callee .
Note : when a function is called , the callee is responsible for destroying its own frame , thus the value of the OPEN register in the caller is the value it had before the OPEN statement that created the callee 's frame .
Return destination
In addition to all the above activity , the call instruction specifies a " return destination " for the computed value .
Rather than return a value to a canonical location and then move the value to the desired register , a register address is specified in the call instruction , and the return value is loaded into that register when the function returns .
The open , call , and return instructions each can be executed in one clock cycle .
For the sake of illustration , here is how the compiler might generate some code :
LISP : ( defun xxx ( f0 f1 z0 b1 b2 f3 ) ( foo f0 f1 ( bar ( baz z0 ) b1 b2 ) f3 ) ) OPEN ; open a frame for call to foo , O0 <- A0 ; load open register 0 with contents of active ; register 0 ( f0 ) O1 <- A1 ; load open register 1 with contents of active ; register 1 ( f1 ) OPEN ; open a frame for call to bar , OPEN ; open a frame for call to baz , O0 <- A2 ; load open register 1 with contents of active ; register 2 ( z0 ) O0 <- CALL BAZ ; call function BAZ , result to appear in slot 0 ; in the frame for BAR .
O1 <- A3 ; BAZ 's open frame is gone , result of call is in ; open register 0 , load open register 1 ; with contents of active register 3 ( b1 ) 02 <- A4 ; load open register 2 with contents of active ; register 4 ( b2 ) O2 <- CALL BAR ; call function BAR , result to appear in slot 2 ; of frame for FOO O3 <- A5 ; BAR 's open frame is gone , result of call is in ; open register 2 , load open register 3 ; with contents of active register 5 ( f3 ) CALL FOO ; and away we go .
12 instructions .
Now , you might think that this is pretty good code , but we can do better .
The K - machine supports the following optimizations :
Call hardware operations in parallel with register operations .
The register fetches occur before the call hardware operation completes , and the register writeback occurs in the instruction after the call hardware operation completes .
After pondering this for a while , we convinced ourselves that this is the desired behavior .
open - call instructions can open a frame in parallel with calling the function .
This , in combination with the parallel moves allow one argument functions to be called in one instruction .
instructions can open a frame in parallel with calling the function .
This , in combination with the parallel moves allow one argument functions to be called in one instruction .
A special OPEN on RETURN destination opens a new frame when returning from a call .
This , in combination with the parallel moves , allows a lazy opening strategy ; the frame opening happens when the first argument to be placed in the frame is computed .
destination opens a new frame when returning from a call .
This , in combination with the parallel moves , allows a lazy opening strategy ; the frame opening happens when the first argument to be placed in the frame is computed .
Tail recursion is implemented in hardware .
The special TOPEN instruction opens a new frame without pushing the current OPEN and ACTIVE frame pointers on the hidden stack ( in essence , not creating a new continuation ) , and the special tail - call instruction transfers control to the callee ( like a jump ) , but because no RETURN is executed for the current frame , the current ACTIVE frame is immediately returned to the hardware freelist .
This is necessary in order not to leak frames .
Note that a tail recursive call done like this violates the LIFO order of the stack , thus the hardware freelist is truly a freelist and the frames may become arbitrarily shuffled .
Also note that it is not necessary to smash the arguments in the current frame to implement tail recursion .
In the worst case , this can add several move instructions to a tail - recursive procedure .
By using the hardware , it is often the case that tail recursive calls are faster than the equivalent loop that mutates the arguments .
Finally note that the return destination is stored in the hidden stack .
This means that not only does the callee not know where the returned data is going , but also that the caller does not know what function returned the value !
In other words , arbitrary tail recursion is supported by the hardware .
Here is what the code looks like with the above optimizations :
LISP : ( defun xxx ( f0 f1 z0 b1 b2 f3 ) ( foo f0 f1 ( bar ( baz z0 ) b1 b2 ) f3 ) ) TOPEN , 00 <- A0 ; open a frame for tail recursive call to foo , ; in parallel , load open register 0 with contents of active ; register 0 ( f0 ) O1 <- A1 ; load open register 1 with contents of active ; register 1 ( f1 ) NEW - OPEN0 <- OPEN CALL BAZ , O0 <- A2 ; open a frame for a call to baz , ; load open register 0 with the contents ; of active register 2 ( z0 ) , result to appear ; in slot 0 of open frame to be allocated upon ; return from BAZ .
O1 <- A3 ; load open register 1 with contents of ; active register 3 ( b1 ) O2 <- CALL BAR , O2 <- A4 ; call bar , returning value to slot 2 in FOO 's ; frame .
; in parallel , load open register 2 with contents ; of active register 4 ( b2 ) TCALL FOO , O3 <- A5 ; tail - recurse to foo , in parallel move ; contents of active register 5 ( f3 ) into ; open register 3
The K - machine function calling hardware is implemented as a maze of registered 2 - to - 1 multiplexers and RAM .
The only restriction that the implementation placed upon programmers is that two return operations cannot be performed in sequence .
In other words , when a function returns , it 's caller is not allowed to return in the next instruction .
This is not a problem because a return immediately followed by a return is a tail - recursive call and is handled differently .
The K - machine function calling hardware is easy to describe , but many hours were spent proving that it operated correctly even in the presence of interrupts .
The hardware implementation evolved through several versions .
Each had equivalent functionality , but quite different approaches to getting the data to the right place at the right time .
To compare the K - machine call hardware with the LMI LAMBDA we counted the number of microinstructions executed by a simple function call .
The LMI LAMBDA executes a minimum of 100 microinstructions to implement a function call .
These instructions execute at about 250 ns each .
The K machine executes a function call in a single 80ns instruction .
This results in a factor of 300 in performance .
The LMI LAMBDA takes 7 seconds to run the tak benchmark .
The K - machine executes the same code in .03 seconds .
This is faster than PCL on a Cray - 1 .
Multiple values
There are two mechanisms for returning arguments .
When a value is returned , the special return functional destination makes sure the return value ends up in the appropriate slot in the appropriate frame .
This implements the standard case of the caller expecting one return value and the callee providing one return value .
When a callee wishes to return multiple values , the first value is returned via a mechanism that differs from the single value return only in that it sets a flag indicating that additional values are present .
Callers expecting a single value never check this flag .
When a caller is prepared to accept multiple values , it checks the multiple value return flag .
If this flag is clear , the caller sets the remaining multiple values to NIL .
If this flag is set , the multiple values are specified by special info left in the stack frame of the callee .
This is available to the caller in the RETURN frame .
Some functions , such as unwind protect , handle multiple values in a pass - through mode .
There is a return path that leaves the multiple - value - flag unchanged .
Linking
As you may have noticed in the code above , functions are statically linked .
Functions are re-linked on the fly to simulate value cells .
Special hardware support is provided to enable " lazy linking " .
Each instruction had a link bit that was normally set to 0 .
When a function is re-defined , the old definition is " killed " by setting the link bit to 1 .
No other action is taken at this point .
The link bit is noticed by the hardware when an instruction is fetched .
Because of the pipeline , the processor will still be executing code within the caller .
If a function is linked to a dead function , the interrupt handler calls the linker .
It is important to interrupt at instruction fetch time because a call to a tail - recursive function leaves no trace of where it came from .
If a function is linked to dead function , that does not mean it should be unconditionally re-linked to the new definition .
Imagine this scenario :
( defun foo ( ) ' foo ) ( setf ( symbol - function bar ) foo ) ( defun test1 ( ) ( foo ) ) ( defun test2 ( ) ( bar ) )
test1
test2
Now suppose foo is re-defined as follows :
( defun foo ( ) ' new - foo )
Test1
test2
test1
test1
foo
test1
The situation is different for test2 however .
In this case , the linker determines that the code for bar needs to be unshared from that associated with foo .
The linker " resurrects " a copy of the dead code associated with foo and re-links bar to this new code .
Essentially , if a function is called via a function cell , the linker relinks to the new definition , however if the function is called via a function pointer , the linker relinks to a copy of the old definition .
I have been told that this is similar to UUO - LINKS used in ITS , but we developed this mechanism independently .
Interrupt handling
The CONS , CADR , and LAMBDA machines polled for interrupts at the microcode level .
The K - machine , not having microcode , does not poll for interrupts .
Interrupts are either synchronous , for instance integer overflow or page fault , or asynchronous , such as the 16 millisecond clock .
Interrupts are indicated by a bit vector stored in a functional source .
If multiple interrupts occur at the same time , the interrupt code can check this source to decide what order in which to process the interrupts .
The Interrupt Handler
When interrupts are enabled , an interrupt causes several things to happen :
Interrupts are disabled .
This prevents recursive interrupts and is " the right thing " .
It is under programmer control to re-enable interrupts should recursive interrupts be desired , but the race condition implicit in leaving the interrupts enabled are avoided .
The register writeback is aborted .
The condition codes are copied to a special location .
The PC is forced to 0 .
This effects an unconditional transfer to location 0 .
The address of the instruction that would have been executed is saved in a special location .
The pipeline registers are frozen ; the clock for the pipeline is temporarily disabled .
As the next few instructions proceed , various parts of pipeline are re-enabled .
If the right code is in place at location 0 , the pipeline state will be correctly saved in a global frame reserved for this purpose .
The interrupt sequence goes something like the following ( remember that the pipeline registers are not being clocked until further notice ) :
The output of the ALU is saved , then the output register clock is enabled .
The condition codes are read from a functional source .
This allows us to restart conditional branches should the processor be interrupted during one of the " branch delay " instructions .
The saved condition code clock is re-enabled .
The right hand side of the ALU is passed through the ALU to be saved in the global frame , then the right hand side clock is enabled .
The left hand side of the ALU is passed through the ALU to be saved in the global frame , then the left hand side clock is enabled .
The PC of the interrupted instruction is read and stored in the global frame .
At this point , the entire state of the pipeline has been saved and execution proceeds as normal .
The interrupt functional source contains the value of the interrupt , so the correct interrupt handler can be located .
Note that there is no other state to indicate that the processor has been interrupted .
Thus it is not necessary to balance every interrupt with an interrupt restore .
When the interrupt has been processed , there are three paths back into the interrupted code .
All of them reload the pipeline in a similar way , differing only in the last instruction .
As the pipeline is reloaded , the pipeline clocks are incrementally disabled in the same order that they were enabled for unloading the pipeline .
Pipeline reload happens something like this :
The saved ALU output is passed through and captured in the output register .
The output register is then disabled .
The saved left hand and right hand operands are read and latched into the ALU input registers .
At this point , the pipeline is reloaded .
All the pipeline clocks are enabled and control is transferred to the saved PC .
In addition , the saved condition codes are used to specify a conditional branch .
Should a pending branch be present when restarting , it will be taken as if the condition codes had been generated normally .
As mentioned before , there were different interrupt crawlout routines .
The standard one , described above , was used for asynchronous interrupts such as the clock .
In this case , the pipeline state after the interrupt crawlout is identical to that when the interrupt occurred , and the interrupted instruction is re-executed .
Another interrupt crawlout is used for synchronous interrupts .
These interrupts are caused by the program and generally indicate an error - like condition that can be fixed ( something like integer overflow ) .
For these interrupts , the ALU output register is not enabled until one instruction after the interrupted one .
To see why this is interesting , consider the case of integer overflow .
When integer overflow occurs , an interrupt is taken .
The interrupt handler conses a bignum result and proceeds to restart the instruction .
If the instruction were simply re-executed , the integer overflow would occur again .
Instead , the bignum value is loaded into the ALU output register during the crawlout .
When the instruction is re-executed , the overflow condition and the output of the ALU are ignored , and the bignum is used instead .
This presents the illusion that the addition of two fixnums resulted in a bignum pointer .
Thus we are able to abstract away the limitations of the ALU .
One more crawlout is provided .
This causes an immediate interrupt before the execution of a single instruction .
This seemingly useless ability allows the computer to read the contents of the instruction cache without actually executing instructions .
The critical positioning of the instructions in the interrupt crawlin and crawlout routines forced us to write them by hand .
Other than a few pieces of code that clearly benefited from hand tuning ( for instance , a mapcar would speculatively fetch the CDR while testing the CAR ) , there was no code in the system that was not written in Lisp .
Single Stepping
The interrupt logic could be programmed to re-interrupt after a single instruction .
This allows a process to single step another for debugging purposes .
Interrupt disabling
It is important to be able to disable interrupts , and the instruction to do so must be atomic .
A functional source is used to disable interrupts .
Reads from this source clear the interrupt enable and return the value that the interrupt enable flag had before the source was read .
This allows reliable control of interrupts , even if an asynchronous interrupt interrupts the disable interrupts instruction .
Synchronous interrupts are discarded when interrupts are disabled , but asynchronous interrupts are simply deferred .
When interrupts are re-enabled , any pending asynchronous interrupts are immediately taken .
Synchronous interrupts may be disabled independently .

Bandwidth in computer networking refers to the data rate supported by a network connection or interface .
One most commonly expresses bandwidth in terms of bits per second ( bps ) .
The term comes from the field of electrical engineering , where bandwidth represents the total distance or range between the highest and lowest signals on the communication channel ( band ) .
Bandwidth represents the capacity of the connection .
The greater the capacity , the more likely that greater performance will follow , though overall performance also depends on other factors , such as latency .

Cheney , others served with subpoenas by wiretapping investigators Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email This The Senate Judiciary Committee has served Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials in the White House and Justice Department with subpoenas over President George W. Bush 's warrantless wiretapping programs .
" Over the past 18 months , this Committee has made no fewer than nine formal requests to the Department of Justice and to the White House , seeking information and documents about the authorization of and legal justification for this program , " Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" All requests have been rebuffed .
Our attempts to obtain information through testimony of Administration witnesses have been met with a consistent pattern of evasion and misdirection . "
The subpoenas were authorized last week by the Judiciary Committee by a 13 - 3 vote , and target " documents related to authorization and reauthorization of the program or programs ; the legal analysis or opinions about the surveillance ; orders , decisions , or opinions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) concerning the surveillance ; agreements between the Executive Branch and telecommunications or other companies regarding liability for assisting with or participating in the surveillance ; and documents concerning the shutting down of an investigation of the Department of Justices Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) relating to the surveillance , " according to the release .
In the subpoena letters , Leahy made particular reference to the Bush administration 's attempts to roll back existing oversight of the domestic spying program conducted through the National Security Agency .
" This Committees inquiry into this warrantless electronic surveillance is essential to the performance of its constitutional legislative and oversight responsibilities , " he wrote .
" The Administration has asked Congress to make sweeping changes to FISA  a crucial national security authority over which the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction .
It is impossible to make informed legislative decisions without understanding fully the Administrations interpretation of FISA and the perceived flaws in that legislation that led the Administration to operate a program outside of its provisions for more than five years . "
The letters were sent to the Justice Department , the Office of the White House , the Office of the Vice President , and the National Security Council .
The recipients of the subpoenas are called on to comply with the subpoenas by July 18 .
Here are two excerpted quotations , cited by John Tierney in his sadly gated blog :
“ While we typically think of a smile as displaying our emotional state ( happiness ) , it also appears that smiles convey information about the signaler ’s status .
Specifically , lower status individuals appear to smile more than higher status individuals .
I suspect that this is due , in part , to the fact that there are several different types of smiles , including a true happiness smile and a true embarrassment smile .
The latter smile , the embarrassment display , is often seen as an appeasement display in primates .
Jimmy Carter smiled a lot , George Bush smiles much less .
Jimmy Carter is generally perceived to be warm and friendly , but not very dominant and strong .
George Bush is perceived be be somewhat less warm and friendly , but is seen as quite dominant and strong . ”
And :
The intent of this blog is to bring similarities between various advanced programming techniques to the surface , and to expose my weird view on things .
If I rant , please stop me !
A meta program operates on or yields one or more programs .
Is it not typical ?
Is it not compile - time ?
We start off by attacking a very common misconception .
No , actually two intertwined misconceptions .
Some programmers have come to be believed that meta programming is the art of using the compile - time features outside of the ( macro expanding ) preprocessor .
Some believe that meta programming is " dealing with types in a fancy way .
" Both groups are wrong , in my opinion .
Whereas meta programs can definitely be executed during compile - time and they quite often deal with types , the basic definition - which seems to have been lost in the translative adaptation from Academia to the IT field - is That simple .
The meta program can be implemented in the same language as the target programs .
It can also operate on itself , introspectively .
Certain languages , such as C++ , provide a quite generic type system , where one can use the same " templated " classes orto produce a set of customized types .
This ismeta programming .
Generic , yes , but meta level ?
Not really .
Not if one consider the genericity to be part of the object language .
It is probably the higher order of those parametric types that confuse most people in the C++ community , coming from a flat C world without differing levels of abstraction .
And , indeed , meta is a higher order notion and sounds abstract ...
Just as some developers confuse higher - order functions and meta programming .
The parametric types can be viewed as , though , since they denote a class of types , or , to use a more computer - scientific notion : .
So , the termis more adequate for what templates bring to the table , at least in the most common use .
One can use templates to create a proper meta level framework , such as the Boost .
MPL library ( http://www.boost.org ) , or some of Alexandrescu 's type generation ideas ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/loki-lib ) but such use is quite distinct from the " everyday " use of templates in C++ teams .
Some languages focus on runtime performance , in terms of speed and resource allocation , and keeping introspective elements in the runtime module is simply not very feasible .
C++ stretched it keep some rudimentary type information - basically being a thin wrapper around the necessary virtual function table for polymorphic types .
Thus , in those runtime - constrained languages , if one wants to manipulate code , including types , it has to be done before runtime , i.e. , during compilation and linkage .
In other languages , reflective means enable meta level programming in runtime .
These languages include Java and C# .
China launched its second manned spacecraft Shenzhou - 6 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China 's Gansu Province at 9:00 a.m. local time Wednesday , Oct. 12 , 2005 .
WASHINGTON - Some congressmen believe the United States and China are in an unacknowledgedspace race that this country could lose if it does n't spend more money on thecivilian space program .
Thecommunist nation 's military runs its mannedspace program , employs an estimated 200,000 workers and has set a goal ofputting an astronaut on the moon by 2017 .
Bycontrast , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is a civiliangovernment program with a limited budgetthat directly employs fewer than 20,000 civil servants and has lost thecommanding lead it once held over the rest of the world in human spaceexploration .
" Wehave a space race going on right now and the American people are totallyunaware of all this , " said Rep. Tom DeLay , the Texas Republican whosedistrict includes Johnson Space Center near Houston .
The theme , which is not new , emerged again Thursday at a Capitol Hill hearing wherelawmakers were quizzing NASA Administrator Mike Griffin about the Bushadministration 's budget request for the space program .
This time , though , lawmakers sounded as if they might be willing to do more than just talkabout the issue .
Griffin wasasked to produce in 30 days an unclassified report to Congress containing anassessment of the Chinese space program and its goals .
Rep. FrankWolf , R - Va. , chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with NASAoversight , said he would hold a hearing on the subject to coincide with thereport 's release .
Griffinacknowledged that China 's new Shenzou spaceships are capable of supporting acrew on a round - trip mission to the moon .
But their LongMarch rockets are not powerful enough to get them there , he said .
The UnitedStates has neither a crew vehicle nor a rocket capable of making a moon run .
The shuttleis designed for low Earth orbit only .
NASA hasbegun work on a lunar Crew Exploration Vehicle , but it wo n't be operationaluntil 2013 or 2014 because of budget constraints , Griffin said .
Its newheavy - lift rocket wo n't be ready until even later , he said .
NASA 'stimeline predicts the new rocket and crew vehicle will be ready for a missionto the moon in 2018 , a year later than the Chinese target .
The U.S.space agency is known for missing planned deadlines for major projects .
" Weneed to do more , " Rep . Dave Weldon , R - Indialantic , said .
Griffinsaid NASA 's new lunar vehicles and rockets could be delivered sooner if moremoney is made available , but he added that he 's not advocating such a change .
DeLayindicated he 's willing to push for more money because the stakes are so high .
" Wehad a 40 - year lead in space and we 're giving it up , " he said .
" TheU.S. is quibbling over $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion .
It 's amazing to me . "
The Chinaspace - race discussion was touched off by Rep. Mark Kirk , an Illinois Republicanwho in February participated in the first U.S. government delegation visit to China 's remote space launch facility .
" The American people have no idea how massive the China space program is , " Kirksaid .
The first - of - its - kind , behind - the - scenes tour revealed a modern high - tech facilitythat would be the envy of NASA employees , some of whom still work out ofbuildings more than 40 years old , Rep. Tom Feeney , R - Oviedo , told FLORIDA TODAYin February after participating in the China tour .

In Gödel , Escher , Bach , Hofstadter introduces the programming language Bloop .
Bloop is a little like BASIC except that it forces programmers to specify in advance how many times each loop will iterate .
As a result , Bloop programs have the handy property that they are guaranteed to terminate .
Unfortunately this property also makes it impossible to write something like an operating system in Bloop .
To write an OS we need open - ended loops that keep running until the user explicitly chooses to shut the OS down .
One solution to this is to write code in Floop .
Floop allows us to write unbounded loops , the equivalent of C's .
The problem with that , however , is that we can write runaway infinite loops that never terminate and never give us any output .
Is there some language that lies between Bloop and Floop that can give us unbounded looping when we need it , but which never allows us to hoist ourselves by our petards by writing runaway loops ?
Wishing no disrepsect to OS writers , at first blush it might seem that the distinction between a runaway loop and an idle OS is too fine - if we can write an infinite loop that does something useful , then surely we can write a useless one too .
But it turns out that there is a very elegant and well - principled way to distinguish between these kinds of loops , and this allows us to write open - ended interactive software in a programming language that nonetheless always produces a well - defined output , no matter what the input .
In order to do this we need to distinguish between two kinds of data : data and codata .
By ensuring that a function expecting codata never receives data , and vice versa , we can ensure that even programs with open - ended loops always produce a well defined output .
The concepts I want to talk about are very general and can apply to whatever programming language you use .
I 'm going to use some simple Haskell examples but most of these will translate to other languages .
So consider something like
This sums the elements of a list .
Note how it 's well behaved as long as we give it a finite list as input .
On the other hand , consider This is n't well behaved at all .
Except when you input empty lists , it never gives a result .
From a mathematical perspective it's not a good definition either , there are many functions that satisfy these two properties .
Is there some general principle at work here that allows us to tell immediately that one of these terminates and the other does n't ?
We know from Turing that there is no procedure that guarantees we can always tell such programs apart , but in this case there is something that we can easily point to .
In the first program , the right hand side of the second line uses thefunction recursively but we only apply it to a strict subpart of the input , its tail in fact .
In the second example we applyto something that contains the argument .
The former function is using what is known as structural recursion , and it's not hard to convince yourself that structural recursion , applied to finite datastructures , always terminates .
So if we limit ourselves to structural recursion we can guarantee our programs will always terminate .
But what about a definition like : That does n't appear to use structural recursion .
But we can view it as such like this .
Define the natural numbers as follows:0 is represented as , 1 is represented asand so on .
We can represent every natural this way .
Here 's the important thing : if n>0 then n- 1 is simply a subpart of n .
So we can view this kind of recursion as a type of structural recursion .
( In fact , by a curious quirk of the Haskell 98 standard we can rewrite our definition to look more like a structural recursion : I 'm guessing this feature is in Haskell precisely so that people can ' pretend ' they are using structural recursion with theinserving a role as a kind of pseudo - constructor .
)
So we have a nice rule for ensuring our code terminates .
Butfails when applied to infinite lists .
Should we simply rule out infinite datastructures ?
That seems a bit drastic .
The example that convinced me to look into Haskell wasWe really do n't want to rule out such a succinct definition of the Fibonacci numbers .
But how can we allow such structures when we have functions likesitting around .
Applyingtowill obviously cause non-termination .
Let 's consider another example :
Like , this fails to terminate for an infinite input .
But unlike , it 's possible to make sense of it .
If the inputs wereand the infinite listthen the result would be .
The program might not terminate , but from a mathematical perspective this is a completely well defined function .
What 's more , suppose the input list represented a stream of data being input at a keyboard , and that the output was displayed on a screen one element at a time , then we'd have a simple cash register .
This program might not terminate , but it 's completely well behaved .
Note that this could only work in a lazy language .
A strict language would want to evaluate the entire list before outputting anything .
But in a lazy language we can start outputting the beginning of the list before the rest of it is computed .
From the point of view of using infinite lists , it 'sthat 's badly behaved , and that 's well behaved .
Again , can we point to a simple distinction between these two programs that explains this ?
Turns out we can , and in some sense it 's dual to what we said above .is well behaved because when we recursively callon the right hand side we do so from inside a list constructor .
( Remember thatis the list constructor . )
This is known asand it guarantees that even though our programs do n't terminate , they still define a unique mathematical function and result in a well behaved program .
In the case of , each time we look at another element of the result , we trigger another lazy evaluation that terminates .
But the right hand side wo n't just run off and compute endlessly until we do that triggering because the recursion is ' guarded ' within a constructor .
( That , by the way , was the main point of this article , so you can probably relax now . )
Note the duality : in structural recursion we ' deconstruct ' the argument and then we 're allowed to recurse .
In guarded recursion we recurse first , and then we 're allowed to use the constructor .
So we 've almost achieved our goal of describing rules to allow open - ended loops because we 've managed to give a rule for writing functions that are guaranteed to be well - behaved even though they manipulate infinite data structures .
But we 're not quite home yet - we still can't have functions likecoexist with infinite lists .
How can we ensure that an infinite list is never handed toConsider the definition of Haskell lists .
It 's something like this : I.e. a list of 's is either the empty listor it 's made from anand a list of 's .
You can think of this as an equation in .
In Haskell we take this as uniquely defining whatis , but in reality there is more than one solution to this equation .
Consider the type consisting of only finite lists .
That satisfies this equation .
A finite list is either an empty list , or an element followed by a finite list .
Similarly a possibly infinite list is either an empty list , or an element followed by a possibly infinite list .
There is an ambiguity .
Finite lists form , what is in some sense , the smallest possible solution to this equation .
The possibly infinite lists form the largest possible solution .
Haskell takes the largest possible solution .
But suppose we were to distinguish between these two different solutions .
We could use the keywordto mean the smallest solution andto mean the largest solution .
The former represents data , and it 's always finite .
The latter represents what we call codata , and it 's possibly infinite .
And now we can refine our rules for well - behavedness .
Consider data and codata to be distinct types .
In a strongly typed language this immediately allows us to restrictto data , not codata .
The rule is : you 're only allowed to use structural recursion with data and guarded recursion with codata .
With that rule , we 're guaranteed that our recursions will always be safe , and yet that we can still have open - ended loops in our code .
Sometimes these are called recursion and corecursion respectively .
And now we can go a little crazy with language .
When we want to prove that a structurally recursive program terminates we use induction .
This does n't work straightforwardly for corecursion , so instead we use a principle called coinduction .
Recursive programs typically terminate .
Corecursive programs do n't necessarily terminate , but they 're still well - behaved as long as they keep on going whenever we give them input .
We can call this cotermination .
And so on ...
I 'm not going to say what coinduction is because I 'd have to talk about bisimulation , and this post would get way too long .
So now a mathematical aside .
The reason for all the " co"s is that data and codata have categorical descriptions and they turn out to be dual to each other .
But you do n't hear mathematicians talking about corecursion and coinduction much .
Why not ?
Well one of the axioms of set theory is the Axiom of Foundation .
One way of interpreting this is the statement that there is no infinite sequenceSo even though we can construct infinite lists in mathematics , we can't construct ' infinitely deep ' lists .
This means that in mathematics we can use a form of structural recursion .
In fact , the familiar principle of induction follows from this .
So for many of the things that mathematicians do , induction works fine .
But if we decide to use a non-standard variation of set theory where the axiom of foundation does n't hold we can no longer use recursion .
For example the Axiom of Extension says that two sets are equal if their elements are equal .
This is a recursive definition , but it 's useless in the presence of a set a such that a∈a .
At this point mathematicians need a principle of coinduction .
And for more on that , I refer you to Vicious Circles Oh ... time for a quick rant .
Over the years I 've seen a few people argue that there 's something fundamentally wrong with the notion of the algorithm because it does n't apply to the kind of open - ended loop we see in operating systems and interactive applications .
Some have even gone further to suggest that somehow mathematics and computer science are fundamentally different because mathematics can't seek to describe these kinds of open - ended phenomena .
As I 've tried to show above , not only are there nice ways to look at open - ended computations , but from a mathematical perspective they are precisely dual , in the category theoretical sense , to terminating computations .
It may be true that mathematicians sometimes spend more time with things , and computer scientists with cothings .
But this really is n't such a big difference and the same langiage can be used to talk about both .
I learnt all this from a variety of sources including Turner 's paper on Total Functional Programming .
My original motivation for trying to understand this stuff came from this post on Ars Mathematica .
Curiously , that post had a significant effect on me .
It made me realise there was this entire co-universe out there that I knew nothing about , and I was forced to make a real effort with learning Haskell because Haskell was the programming language closest to the mathematical notation used to talk about this co-universe .
( Thanks Walt , but sorry to everyone who wants to see less Haskell here ! ) I did n't really get why anyone would want to distinguish between data and codata until I saw some clues in some slides by Altenkirch and some comments by Conor McBride .
I 'm still not sure anyone says it quite as clearly as this : distinguishing between data and codata means we can allow the coexistence of infinite lists , structural recursion and open - ended loops , without risk of causing bad behaviour .
Labels : haskell , types
May 25 , 2007  --
It took nearly a week for Jessica Davis to get an explanation about why MySpace had labeled her a sex offender and pulled her profile from the social networking Web site .
And when her name was finally cleared , it was n't because of anything MySpace did .
" They have a corporate and a moral responsibility to me as far as coming up and saying , ' We messed up .
This is going on .
We 're doing what we can to fix it , ' " said the 29 - year - old , newly engaged University of Colorado senior , a woman who confessed to losing her driver 's license for careless driving a decade ago but insisted she 'd never committed a crime to earn the status of sex offender .
But so far , she has yet to hear from MySpace , the social networking Web site owned by media conglomerate News Corp. , which hosts more than 180 million profiles .
Nearly a week ago , administrators sent her an e-mail that began " It has come to MySpace 's attention that you are a registered sex offender in one or more jurisdictions . "
The note ended with an e-mail address saying Davis had 14 days to appeal .
She immediately rifled off a response under the subject line " You have the wrong person , " asking to rectify the mix - up as quickly as possible .
Wednesday , she heard back from MySpace , receiving a form e-mail that flatly informed her " We do not keep records of removed profiles or images .
If it was removed by MySpace it was because of a violation of our terms and conditions -- which can include a number of things ( underage , inappropriate images , cyber bullying , spam , etc ) .
Please review our terms for further assistance . "
Davis initially contacted ABC News Tuesday after reading a story on ABCNEWS.com about an agreement reached between MySpace and a group of state attorneys general to share information from a database MySpace had built to prevent sex offenders from keeping online profiles .
This was particularly troubling : First , she 'd been falsely labeled by MySpace as a sex offender ; now , the state of Colorado would have access to that designation .
MySpace hired Sentinel Tech Holding Corp. to gain access to the Miami - based security company 's specialized sex offender database late last year .
The goal was to weed out the profiles of registered sex offenders who may use an online profile to solicit targets -- including younger users who spend time on the social networking site .
Since the database was completed earlier this month , MySpace has already blocked at least 7,000 profiles after classifying the users as sex offenders .
But that list included Davis , who was dumbfounded .
" It 's so far out , it 's not even left field , " she said in an interview earlier this week .
" It 's beyond left field . "
Late Wednesday , MySpace issued the following statement to ABC News about Davis ' plea of innocence : " The safety of our community is a top priority and we are in the process of reviewing this matter . "
At the same time , ABC News began its own vetting process , searching publicly available sex offender databases , including those in Colorado and Florida , the two states where Davis had lived .
Davis is not listed anywhere in the Department of Justice 's Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Registry , a search engine that allows visitors to search sex offender information provided by states .
There was , however , a registered sex offender named Jessica Dawn Davis living in Utah .
By Thursday , Sentinel CEO John Cardillo had gotten involved , offering to " adjudicate " Davis ' appeal himself , something he did in minutes when Davis called him directly Friday .
" The Jessica Davis in question is absolutely not a sex offender , " Cardillo told ABCNEWS.com , explaining that beyond sharing a similar and common name , Jessica Davis the non-sex offender and Jessica Dawn Davis the sex offender also had birthdays two days off as well as two years off and had lived in Florida at roughly the same time .
Cardillo , who called the initial match an" unfortunate circumstance , " said that the database worked exactly as intended .
" It was so close , " Cardillo told ABCNEWS.com .
" It was one of those rare instances where there was nothing else we could have done but flag her .
If we get an offender and I 'm looking at a date of birth that 's two days off , we 're going to assume were dealing with the offender . "
Cardillo would not say exactly what pieces of information Davis had to provide to clear her name , citing trade secrets that could help sex offenders beat his database .
He added that the experience is likely isolated and may help prevent the same type of snafu from happening again .
" This is something that Sentinel will take a look at and , where appropriate , make recommendations to all of our customers , " he said .
" We 'll put this in our experience log . "
MySpace did not respond to phone calls Friday , so it 's unclear whether MySpace will take any formal action or if Davis will have her MySpace profile reinstated .
Earlier this week , a MySpace official would not say whether Davis ' appeal was an isolated incident .
Davis , who called the incident a " lesson in corporate politics , " said that Cardillo told her that MySpace was following the situation closely .
But it just did n't feel that way to her , she said , given the lack of any written notification clearing her name and the unresponsive appeal system MySpace has in place .
" I do want to hear from them , " Davis said .
" I want them to publicly admit that they messed up . "
“ That seems like a lot of money , ” my wife said .
We looked at each other : we ’re in the top .001 percent .
Why even discuss whether to give money to a noble cause ?
Still , there are 100 - something thousand people who have even more money .
Why have n’t they fixed the historic building ?
Lunch was at a reasonable place in my neighborhood .
At least , I think it was reasonable .
We talked about the historic building .
We talked about my childhood .
Yes , we talked about his daughter , and then for some reason we ended up talking about gay marriage , a noble cause to which I ’ve given about what we paid for lunch .
And then the guy asked me for five million dollars .
I had my checkbook with me , but I never brought it out .
I felt suddenly as if someone had proposed marriage and I ’d countered with an offer of a beer .
I stuttered something .
He explained that I would n’t have to give all of it at once .
I stuttered something else , and we talked about gay marriage a little more , and then I went home and lay down on the rug , which is what I do when things like this come up .
It ’s not the first time .
People know I have a lot of money — there ’s no way to hide it , and I ’m irritated by those people who have a lot of money but pretend they do n’t have a lot of money , not really , not when you compare them to some other people .
But still , I do n’t have all the money .
My cousin recently assumed out loud that I ’d been paid $ 100 million by a movie studio , even after he knew that the movie in question cost about $ 150 million to make .
I was once referred to , in passing and not sarcastically , as a trillionaire .
And a friend estimated that my home is worth $ 20 million , which it would be , if after lunch I lay down on a stack of gold bars instead of a rug .
Still , though , it ’s a nice rug .
If the rug cost your annual salary , and I were a noble cause , I would n’t ask you for money , because you would n’t have any to give .
Your income would , however , still be in the top 15 percent in the world .
This is why , maybe , there are so many noble causes and so few of them are well financed : we all want other people to write the checks — they ’re richer than we are .
I wrote the guy a check anyway , of course , and it was for a lot of money .
At least , I think it was a lot of money .
You ’d have to ask those other people , the hundred thousand who make more than I do and the 60 million who make more than I gave to restore the historic building : is n’t this a lot of money ?
Then why does it feel as if I bought him a beer ?
CIA Torture Flights European Complicity in Renditions ?
The question gripping Italy at the moment is whether the United States informed Rome of its plan to kidnap an Egyptian cleric on Italian soil .
Meanwhile , there are further reports that the CIA put pressure on Germany to help quell European criticism of human rights abuses by its " key allies " in the war on terror .
America 's thirst for environmentally friendly biofuels is driving up food prices around the world as farmers scramble to devote more land to corn , writes Heather Stewart .
With the oil price back above $ 70 a barrel , biofuel looks increasingly attractive , and as more corn is grown to fill fuel tanks , the prices of other food crops are also being pushed up .
' The biggest impetus right now is the fact that the oil price is very high , and ethanol is very viable , ' said Kona Haque , senior commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit .
' It 's a land issue : it 's a competition for acreage .
Countries are devoting an increasing amount of their land to fuel . '
Even meat prices have been affected , as there is less land available to grow soybeans to feed livestock .
Almost a quarter of this year 's US corn crop is expected to be turned into fuel .
Drought in Australia has added to the food prices spike , which is feeding through to world inflation .

Using plastics to harvest the energy of the sun just got a significant boost in efficiency thanks to a discovery made at the Center for Polymers and Organic Solids at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
Nobel laureate Alan Heeger , professor of physics at UC Santa Barbara , worked with Kwanghee Lee of Korea and a team of other scientists to create a new “ tandem ” organic solar cell with increased efficiency .
The discovery , explained in the July 13 issue of the journal Science , marks a step forward in materials science .
Tandem cells are comprised of two multilayered parts that work together to gather a wider range of the spectrum of solar radiation –– at both shorter and longer wavelengths .
“ The result is six and a half percent efficiency , ” said Heeger .
“ This is the highest level achieved for solar cells made from organic materials .
I am confident that we can make additional improvements that will yield efficiencies sufficiently high for commercial products . ”
He expects this technology to be on the market in about three years .
Heeger and Lee have collaborated for many years on developing solar cells .
The new tandem architecture that they discovered both improves light harvesting and promises to be less expensive to produce .
In their paper , the authors explain that the cells “… can be fabricated to extend over large areas by means of low - cost printing and coating technologies that can simultaneously pattern the active materials on lightweight flexible substrates . ”
The multilayered device is the equivalent of two cells in series , said Heeger .
The deposition of each layer of the multilayer structure by processing the materials from solution is what promises to make the solar cells less expensive to produce .
“ Tandem solar cells , in which two solar cells with different absorption characteristics are linked to use a wider range of the solar spectrum , were fabricated with each layer processed from solution with the use of bulk heterojunction materials comprising semiconducting polymers and fullerene derivatives , ” wrote the authors .
The cells are separated and connected by the material TiO x , a transparent titanium oxide .
This is the key to the multilayer system that allows for the higher - level efficiencies .
TiO x transports electrons and is a collecting layer for the first cell .
In addition , it acts as a stable foundation that allows the fabrication of the second cell , thus completing the tandem cell architecture .
Heeger shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in the year 2000 , with Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa , for the “ discovery and development of conducting polymers . ”
The tandem solar cells reported in the Science article utilize semiconducting polymers from the class of materials that were recognized by the award of the Nobel Prize .
With Howard Berke , Heeger in 2000 co-founded Konarka Technologies , based in Lowell , Mass. , to develop and market solar cells based on this technology .
Heeger recently was presented with the Italian Prize for Energy and the Environment ( Eni Italgas Prize ) for his discoveries and research accomplishments in the field of “ plastic ” solar cells .
The Italian agency cited Heeger “ for research that will begin to contribute to the energy needs of our planet in the near future . ”
An exciting aspect of the latest discovery is that it is expected to contribute to third world usage of technologies such as laptop computers in areas that are “ off the electricity grid . ”

The law of unintended consequences , often cited but rarely defined , is that actions of people — and especially of government — always have effects that are unanticipated or unintended .
Economists and other social scientists have heeded its power for centuries ; for just as long , politicians and popular opinion have largely ignored it .
The concept of unintended consequences is one of the building blocks of economics .
Adam Smith ’s “ invisible hand , ” the most famous metaphor in social science , is an example of a positive unintended consequence .
Smith maintained that each individual , seeking only his own gain , “ is led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention , ” that end being the public interest .
“ It is not from the benevolence of the butcher , or the baker , that we expect our dinner , ” Smith wrote , “ but from regard to their own self interest . ”
Most often , however , the law of unintended consequences illuminates the perverse unanticipated effects of legislation and regulation .
In 1692 the English philosopher John Locke , a forerunner of modern economists , urged the defeat of a parliamentary bill designed to cut the maximum permissible rate of interest from 6 percent to 4 percent .
Locke argued that instead of benefiting borrowers , as intended , it would hurt them .
People would find ways to circumvent the law , with the costs of circumvention borne by borrowers .
To the extent the law was obeyed , Locke concluded , the chief results would be less available credit and a redistribution of income away from “ widows , orphans and all those who have their estates in money . ”
In the first half of the nineteenth century , the famous French economic journalist Frédéric Bastiat often distinguished in his writing between the “ seen ” and the “ unseen . ”
The seen were the obvious visible consequences of an action or policy .
The unseen were the less obvious , and often unintended , consequences .
In his famous essay “ What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen , ” Bastiat wrote : Bastiat applied his analysis to a wide range of issues , including trade barriers , taxes , and government spending .
The first and most complete analysis of the concept of unintended consequences was done in 1936 by the American sociologist Robert K. Merton .
In an influential article titled “ The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action , ” Merton identified five sources of unanticipated consequences .
The first two — and the most pervasive — were “ ignorance ” and “ error . ”
Merton labeled the third source the “ imperious immediacy of interest . ”
By that he was referring to instances in which someone wants the intended consequence of an action so much that he purposefully chooses to ignore any unintended effects .
( That type of willful ignorance is very different from true ignorance . )
The Food and Drug Administration , for example , creates enormously destructive unintended consequences with its regulation of pharmaceutical drugs .
By requiring that drugs be not only safe but efficacious for a particular use , as it has done since 1962 , the FDA has slowed down by years the introduction of each drug .
An unintended consequence is that many people die or suffer who would have been able to live or thrive .
This consequence , however , has been so well documented that the regulators and legislators now foresee it but accept it .
“ Basic values ” was Merton ’s fourth source of unintended consequences .
The Protestant ethic of hard work and asceticism , he wrote , “ paradoxically leads to its own decline through the accumulation of wealth and possessions . ”
His final case was the “ self - defeating prediction . ”
Here he was referring to the instances when the public prediction of a social development proves false precisely because the prediction changes the course of history .
For example , the warnings earlier in this century that population growth would lead to mass starvation helped spur scientific breakthroughs in agricultural productivity that have since made it unlikely that the gloomy prophecy will come true .
Merton later developed the flip side of this idea , coining the phrase “ the self - fulfilling prophecy . ”
In a footnote to the 1936 article , he vowed to write a book devoted to the history and analysis of unanticipated consequences .
Although Merton worked on the book over the next sixty years , it remained uncompleted when he died in 2003 at age ninety - two .
The law of unintended consequences provides the basis for many criticisms of government programs .
As the critics see it , unintended consequences can add so much to the costs of some programs that they make the programs unwise even if they achieve their stated goals .
For instance , the U.S. government has imposed quotas on imports of steel in order to protect steel companies and steelworkers from lower - priced competition .
The quotas do help steel companies .
But they also make less of the cheap steel available to U.S. automakers .
As a result , the automakers have to pay more for steel than their foreign competitors do .
So a policy that protects one industry from foreign competition makes it harder for another industry to compete with imports .
Similarly , Social Security has helped alleviate poverty among senior citizens .
Many economists argue , however , that it has carried a cost that goes beyond the payroll taxes levied on workers and employers .
Martin Feldstein and others maintain that today ’s workers save less for their old age because they know they will receive Social Security checks when they retire .
If Feldstein and the others are correct , it means that less savings are available , less investment takes place , and the economy and wages grow more slowly than they would without Social Security .
The law of unintended consequences is at work always and everywhere .
People outraged about high prices of plywood in areas devastated by hurricanes , for example , may advocate price controls to keep the prices closer to usual levels .
An unintended consequence is that suppliers of plywood from outside the region , who would have been willing to supply plywood quickly at the higher market price , are less willing to do so at the government - controlled price .
Thus results a shortage of a good where it is badly needed .
Government licensing of electricians , to take another example , keeps the supply of electricians below what it would otherwise be , and thus keeps the price of electricians ’ services higher than otherwise .
One unintended consequence is that people sometimes do their own electrical work , and , occasionally , one of these amateurs is electrocuted .
One final sobering example is the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 .
Afterward , many coastal states enacted laws placing unlimited liability on tanker operators .
As a result , the Royal Dutch / Shell group , one of the world ’s biggest oil companies , began hiring independent ships to deliver oil to the United States instead of using its own forty - six - tanker fleet .
Oil specialists fretted that other reputable shippers would flee as well rather than face such unquantifiable risk , leaving the field to fly - by - night tanker operators with leaky ships and iffy insurance .
Thus , the probability of spills probably increased and the likelihood of collecting damages probably decreased as a consequence of the new laws .
