At times we all find it hard –if not impossible –to forgive those who ’ve hurt us most .
In the mid-70s , not long after I became a Christian , I heard about a woman who had spent time in Nazi concentration camps for hiding Jews in her home during the Holocaust .
52 and unmarried , she had lived at home with her elderly father and older sister Betsie .
All three of them had been sent to concentration camps when the Nazis discovered they had been hiding the Jewish refugees .
The woman ’s name was Corrie Ten Boom .
Corrie lost her freedom , her dignity , and her beloved sister and father in the span of a few months in those concentration camps .
In God ’s providence Corrie was released due to a clerical error , just one week before the other women in Ravensbruck her age were executed .
After the war Corrie was invited to speak all over the world , and she tirelessly traveled the globe , thankful for every opportunity she was given to tell people about Christ .
She always marveled at God ’s infinite mercy toward sinners like us .
She also knew that everyone who had received God ’s mercy had no choice but to show mercy to others ; and she knew from her own experience that was n’t always easy .
In her book The Hiding Place she tells the following story :
It was at a church service in Munich that I saw him , the former S.S. man who had stood guard at the shower room door in the processing center at Ravensbruck .
He was the first of our actual jailers that I had seen since that time .
And suddenly it was all there – the roomful of mocking men , the heaps of clothing , Betsie ’s pain - blanched face .
He came up to me as the church was emptying , beaming and bowing .
“ How grateful I am for your message , Fraulein . ” he said .
“ To think that , as you say , He has washed my sins away ! ”
His hand was thrust out to shake mine .
And I , who had preached so often to the people in Bloemendaal the need to forgive , kept my hand at my side .
Even as the angry , vengeful thoughts boiled through me , I saw the sin of them .
Jesus Christ had died for this man ; was I going to ask for more ?
Lord Jesus , I prayed , forgive me and help me to forgive him .
I tried to smile , I struggled to raise my hand .
I could not .
I felt nothing , not the slightest spark of warmth or charity .
And so again I breathed a silent prayer .
Jesus , I can not forgive him .
Give me Your forgiveness .
As I took his hand the most incredible thing happened .
From my shoulder along my arm and through my hand a current seemed to pass from me to him , while into my heart sprang a love for this stranger that almost overwhelmed me .
And so I discovered that it is not on our forgiveness any more than on our goodness that the world ’s healing hinges , but on His .
When
He tells us to love our enemies , He gives , along with the command , the love itself .
No one understood both the difficulty and the absolute necessity of forgiving others better than Corrie Ten Boom .
I will be forever grateful for the example this humble , tireless servant of Christ set for me when I was a new believer .
President Barack Obama yesterday addressed the paradox of accepting the Nobel peace prize in Oslo while escalating the conflict in Afghanistan , invoking the concept of " the just war " to defeat evil .
In what amounted to a personal testimony , he portrayed himself as a moral man doing his best in an imperfect world .
" We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth : we will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes .
There will be times when nations – acting individually or in concert – will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified , " he said .
He cited , as examples of the " just war " , the fight against Hitler , the confrontation with Saddam Hussein after the invasion of Kuwait and Nato involvement in the Balkans .
In an echo of Tony Blair in his Chicago speech in 1999 , Obama said there were often times when humanitarian intervention became essential .
He noted the ambivalence of the world towards US military actions , but argued that failed states such as Somalia and Afghanistan could not be left to fester .
" Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later .
That 's why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace . "
Obama , who was still rewriting his speech on his overnight flight from Washington , recognised critics who said it was too soon for him to receive such an award , given he had no accomplishments yet to justify it .
" I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated , " he said , to laughter .
The 108th recipient of the prize expressed humility , saying he could not be compared with giants of history such as Dr Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela who had received the prize .
He said too that he was only at the start of his labours on the world stage , not the end .
He then turned to the crux of the criticism .
" Perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the commander - in - chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars .
One of these wars is winding down .
The other is a conflict that America did not seek ; one in which we are joined by 42 other countries – including Norway – in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks , " he said .
He accepted the arguments of King and Gandhi for passive resistance .
" But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation , I can not be guided by their examples alone .
I face the world as it is and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people .
For make no mistake : evil does exist in the world .
" A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler 's armies .
Negotiations cannot convince al - Qaida 's leaders to lay down their arms .
To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism – it is a recognition of history ; the imperfections of man and the limits of reason , " he said .
While not referring to George Bush , he sought to differentiate himself from him , presenting himself as a reluctant war leader and one who would adhere to the norms of international law .
He was listened to in silence throughout most of the speech but applause came when he said : " Let us reach for the world that ought to be – that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls . "
The Nobel chairman , Thorbjorn Jagland , opening the ceremony , said of Obama : " Dr King 's dream has come true . "
Security was tight in Oslo .
A 74 km - wide no-fly zone for small planes and helicopters caused delays to air traffic to and from the capital .
" This is completely ridiculous , " said Christian Ingvardsen , a 38 - year - old businessman , as his plane to Norway was delayed at Copenhagen airport .
" I like Obama but this is getting completely out of hand .
Is it like that when he travels in the US ?
Do they really shut down Chicago like this ? "
Despite the restrictions and the military - like atmosphere , there was still much enthusiasm in town about Obama 's visit – the first by a US president in office since Bill Clinton in 1999 .
As Obama 's 23 - car convoy raced past Kristian IV 's street to the royal palace earlier yesterday , many passersby cheered with joy at seeing the world 's most powerful man travelling through their city .
Dropping tax revenue , rising unemployment and yawning budget gaps are wreaking havoc in states from Arizona to Wisconsin , a new report shows .
CNNMoney reports 10 states face financial peril .
The same economic pressures that pushed California to the brink of insolvency are wreaking havoc on other states , a new report has found .
The 10 most troubled states are : Arizona , California , Florida , Illinois , Michigan , Nevada , New Jersey , Oregon , Rhode Island and Wisconsin .
Other states -- including Colorado , Georgia , Kentucky , New York and Hawaii -- were not far behind .
The list is based on several factors , including the loss of state revenue , size of budget gaps , unemployment and foreclosure rates , poor money management practices , and state laws governing the passage of budgets .
In a separate study released Wednesday , the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that states will likely have to make steep cuts in their fiscal 2011 budgets , which start next July 1 in most states .
That 's because the critical federal stimulus dollars will run out by the end of 2010 .
These cuts could take nearly a percentage point off the national gross domestic product and cost the nation 900,000 jobs , the study found .
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a liberal research group , says the states need additional federal fiscal relief to avoid budget cuts that will hurt both the economy and people .
State and local spending accounts for about one - eighth of the GDP .
And in California , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Tuesday that his state is facing a budget gap of up to $ 7 billion .
The state will likely announce across - the - board spending cuts in January .
" So we just have to hang in there , tighten our belts and live within our means , " he said .
The center would like to see the federal government allocate another $ 50 billion , while economist Mark Zandi said about half of that would be needed .
Congress should pass the additional aid now since states are currently crafting their fiscal 2011 budgets .
Budget projections show that states could face deficits as large as $ 260 billion in 2011 and 2012 after stimulus funding is exhausted .
State economies usually take up to two years longer to recover after the nation 's fiscal health begins to improve .
New budget cuts and tax increases " will be a serious drag on the economy at just the wrong time , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody 's Economy.com .
Without assistance , the economy could slide back into a recession , he said

Keynesian Claptrap History Lesson
So we just have to hang in there , tighten our belts and live within our means
TORONTO — Successive scandals , a historic deficit and an unpopular new tax have taken a heavy toll on Ontario ’s Liberal government , according to a poll released Tuesday , which shows support plummeting .
The poll , conducted by Nanos Research , puts Dalton McGuinty ’s Liberals in a virtual tie with the Conservatives , led by Tim Hudak .
Support for the Liberals is at 36.6 per cent , while the Tories garner 35 per cent support .
Nanos ’s last poll , in May , had the Liberals at 47 per cent support , 16 points ahead of the Tories .
Since then , however , the second - term government has undergone a series of scandals , including embarrassing spending revelations at eHealth Ontario , which prompted the exit of the agency head , the board chair and ultimately the health minister himself , David Caplan .
Just weeks ago , Liberal finance minister Dwight Duncan announced the province will run a nearly $ 25 - billion deficit , the largest in Ontario ’s history and significantly higher than the $ 14.1 billion projected seven months earlier .
The Nanos poll also shows Premier Dalton McGuinty ’s leadership numbers in free fall , sliding to 26.9 per cent popularity from 42.1 per cent in May .
Undecided voters rose to 28.1 per cent from 20.4 over the same period .
“ The government is bruised over a series of issues such as eHealth and the deficit , ” said pollster Nick Nanos .
“ The only possible silver lining ( for the Liberals ) is that people have moved from thinking McGuinty is the best premier into the unsure column . ”
The poll , which sampled 503 adult Ontarians , was conducted between October 24 - 25 and is considered accurate to within 4.4 per centage points 19 times out of 20 .
Observers expect the government ’s rocky road to continue .
On Monday , the government introduced legislation that will create a new 13 per cent Harmonized Sales
Tax that will add tax on a number of previously exempt consumer items , like gasoline , gym memberships and home heating costs .
The HST is being praised by business advocates who will see their taxes fall , creating a more competitive playing field .
But consumer anger is strong and does n’t appear to be fading , according to Frank Hall , president of Holinshed Research Group Inc .
Hall released a poll Tuesday showing 76 per cent of respondents disagreed with the imposition of the blended tax .
“ This is a decisive number , ” he said , adding respondents believe they can stop the tax .
McGuinty , meanwhile , hinted to reporters he understood the challenges of selling the HST .
“ I think it will be the subject of some considerable conversation between now and election day , ” he said .
“ This is a good thing . ”
In the future , quantum computers will accomplish in seconds what would take years with our best computers today .
Physicists at NIST have made a significant leap towards this goal by demonstrating the first " universal " programmable quantum information processor .

In other words , this is the first time anyone has developed a processor that can handle any set of instructions for more than one quantum bit or " qubit . "
Rapid progress when you consider that the first single - task quantum processor arrived on the scene less than a year ago .
The NIST team performed 160 different processing routines on the two qubits .
Although there are an infinite number of possible two - qubit programs , this set of 160 is large and diverse enough to fairly represent them , Hanneke says , making the processor " universal . "
The researchers used a random number generator to select the particular routines that would be executed , so all possible programs had an equal chance of selection .
The random programs avoided the possibility of bias in testing the processor in the event that some programs ran better or produced more accurate outputs than others .
Each program operated accurately an average of 79 percent of the time across 900 runs , each run lasting about 37 milliseconds .
To evaluate the processor and the quality of its operation , NIST scientists compared the measured outputs of the programs to idealized , theoretical results .
The programs did not perform easily described mathematical calculations .
Rather , they involved various single - qubit " rotations " and two - qubit entanglements .
As an example of a rotation , if a qubit is envisioned as a dot on a sphere at the north pole for 0 , at the south pole for 1 , or on the equator for a balanced superposition of 0 and 1 , the dot might be rotated to a different point on the sphere , perhaps from the northern to the southern hemisphere , making it more of a 1 than a 0 .

Huh ?
Yeah , it 's a bit confusing , but you can get the basic idea by checking out our Giz Explains on the subject .
Just know that programing with multiple qubits is a major turning point in creating the truly " super " computers of tomorrow .

Yes , so the title of this post is a bit glib .
But believe it or not , the issue of robots - and - the - law ( or , more accurately , liability stemming from the use of robots ) is getting some serious attention in the halls of academia .
A SF Chronicle story out Monday lays out the issue :
Robots have been an increasingly familiar sight in recent years , ...
I just set up a friend 's PC .
I have n't done that in a while .
Wow .
Apparently , a computer is now not a computer , it 's an opportunity to upsell you .
First , the setup insisted ( for my own safety ) that I sign up for an eternal subscription to Norton .
Then it defaulted ( opt out ) to sending me promotional emails .
Then there were the dozens ( at least it felt like dozens ) of buttons and searches I had to endure to switch the search box from Bing to Google .
And the icons on the desktop that had been paid for by various partners and the this - comes - with - that of just about everything .
The digital world , even the high end brands , has become a sleazy carnival , complete with hawkers , barkers and a bearded lady .
By the time someone actually gets to your site , they 've been conned , popped up , popped under and upsold so many times they really have no choice but to be skeptical .
Basically , it 's a race to the bottom , with so many people spamming trackbacks , planning popups and scheming to trick the surfer with this or that that we 've bullied people into a corner of believing no one .
You can play along , or you can be so clean and so straightforward that people are stunned into loyalty .
You know , as in , " do it for the user , " and " offer stuff that just works " and " this is what you get and that 's all you get and you wo n't have to wonder about the fine print . "
Rare and refreshing .
An opportunity , in fact .
This just in , Mike Shanahan is the greatest coach to ever coach an NFL team .
Well , if you watched the NFL Network or ESPN or read Sports Illustrated that is what you would think .
I have n’t seen this much hype for an unemployed NFL head coach since Jimmy Johnson ’s free agent years between Dallas and Miami .
I just have to ask if we are all talking about the same Mike Shanahan here because quite honestly I just do n’t get it .
Since when did this guy turn into Vince Lombardi ?
The Shanahan hype machine has gotten so out of control , that reports had him in the mix for the Florida job not less than an hour after the ink was dry on Urban Meyer ’s resignation letter .
Not only has this gotten way out of control , it is beyond ridiculous at this point .
Is the NFL that hungry for a coaching story that its analysts and reporters in the media are willing to put facts aside to create a story ?
If we are talking about the same Mike Shanahan I have watched over the years than I can’t understand what everyone is getting all excited about .
Let ’s take an objective look at Coach Mike ’s NFL career , specifically in Denver .
Coach Mike won two Super Bowls …with John Elway !
Now I understand that it is still a heck of an accomplishment , but he had all of the tools in place when he came to Denver .
Any competent NFL head coach could have driven that team to the Super Bowl .
His first Super Bowl win was very impressive over the Green Bay Packers .
Yet his second Super Bowl win came over an overachieving Atlanta Falcons that barring a Gary Anderson missed field goal had no business being anywhere near the championship game .
Then there was life after John .
I am sorry , but I am not that impressed with Shanahan ’s record from 1999 - 2008 .
He had six seasons under 10 wins .
Over that entire period he only won the AFC West once .
Once !
It gets better .
His post - season record after Elway is another story in itself .
He lost all three of his AFC Wild - Card games .
The year he did win the AFC West , he lost in the AFC championship game to the Pittsburgh Steelers .
All in all in 10 seasons he won one playoff game .
Can someone please and I am begging you , explain to me why in the world this guy is in the mix for any NFL head coaching job right now ?
I think it is funny that lost in a great story are the facts .
Do you know how many head coaches have won a Super Bowl with more than one team ?
Zero !
The numbers do n’t lie .
In 43 Super Bowls , not one head coach has ever been able to win with one team and rebuild another program with another .
I do n’t think it is coincidence .
I think for a lot of these Super Bowl winners , it is time and place .
I think for others it is ego .
You have a guy who wins a Super Bowl in one city with a G.M. , who is given all of the responsibility somewhere else , and while he may be a good head coach , he is a terrible General Manager .
For others , I think it is a situation where you have a stubborn head coach who is unwilling to adapt to the changes of offenses and defenses in the NFL .
To think that all of the sudden the great Mike Shanahan is going to buck this trend is ridiculous .
Yet , nobody ever drops this nugget of information while hyping the great coaching hope .
The betting line is that the God of NFL coaching will be going to Washington .
So let me ask you this Washington Redskins fans , does this sound like Joe Gibbs all over again ?
I think Shanahan would do well in a situation similar like his first years in Denver , coming to a ready - made team with a proven veteran quarterback .
His record shows that he is no better than an average NFL head coach at best in any other situation .
NFL teams are better off giving a young coordinator or assistant coach a shot before committing millions of dollars and bad decisions to a guy that has n’t won a big game in over a decade .
Mike Shanahan has reportedly said he is not interested in the Buffalo , Houston , or Chicago jobs .
Merry Christmas Bills , Texans , and Bears fans .

The PM said Israel was acting in self - defence and must be allowed to continue Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged UN members to " come to their senses " and reject the Goldstone report into Israel 's military conduct in Gaza .
He said UN endorsement of the strong criticism of Israel would deal " a fatal blow " to peace efforts .
The Human Rights Council is nearing a vote on the report which accuses Israel and Hamas militants of war crimes .
Report author Richard Goldstone said a " culture of impunity " for war criminals wrecked hopes for peace in the region .
In remarks broadcast before a cabinet meeting , Mr Netanyahu said the Goldstone report would " deal a fatal blow to three major issues " .
Israel will not be able to take further measures , and will forbear taking further risks for the sake of peace , if Israel is denied its right for self - defence

Key excerpts : UN Gaza report UN seeks close Gaza scrutiny Firstly , he said , it would legitimise " terrorists who hide behind civilians " by laying the blame on victims of terror who act in self - defence .
He also said UN prestige would be adversely affected and the body would become irrelevant like " the darkest days where absurd decisions were passed " .
" The most pressing issue , " he said , " [ was that ] promoting the conclusions of the Goldstone report will devastate the peace process . "

Deliberate terror
The 574 - page UN Human Rights Council report was written by a four - judge commission led by South African judge Richard Goldstone .
The report accuses Israel of using " disproportionate force " in Gaza
It accused both the Israeli army and Palestinian militants of deliberately terrorising and killing civilians on the other side .
It urged the UN Security Council to refer allegations to the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) if either side failed to investigate and prosecute suspects .
The report has been widely praised by human rights groups , but Israeli allies like the US have criticised its conclusions .
Mr Goldstone has rejected Israeli protestations that it was Hamas which put Gazans in harm 's way during the three - week bombardment in December and January .
" Israel has said that given the density of the population in Gaza - they did the best they could to avoid civilians , " he said in an interview with the US network CNN .
" We certainly looked for proof ( that Hamas put their weapons near civilians ) but did n't find it . "
He added that some of the killing ... " was certainly intentional .
There was no mistake in bombing factories " .
Israeli military action destroyed thousands of homes , hundreds of factories and 80 official buildings .
Palestinians and human rights groups say more than 1,400 people were killed in the violence between 27 December and 16 January , more than half of them civilians .
Israel puts the figure at 1,166 , with fewer than 300 civilians .
Three Israeli civilians and 10 Israeli soldiers were also killed .

Ford workers oppose UAW demand for concessions
By Jerry White
21 October 2009
Ford 's Wayne Assembly plant in Wayne , Michigan
The concessions agreement reached last week between the United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Company has been met with widespread opposition from Ford workers , who are beginning to vote on the deal this week .
The UAW , which granted Ford $ 500 million in concessions last March , has returned to demand that 41,000 workers accept additional givebacks in line with those the UAW imposed on workers at General Motors and Chrysler .
Forty percent of Ford workers opposed the contract revisions in March , with several locals in Michigan and Ohio rejecting it outright .
This was particularly significant because of the non -stop threats by company officials , the White House and the media that rejection of the contract could lead to the collapse of Ford , resulting in tens of thousands of layoffs , and the sabotage of the government bailout of General Motors and Chrysler .
Fearing the defeat of the contract , the UAW has delayed ratification meetings , rather than attempting to quickly ram through the deal .
Meanwhile it has dispatched its functionaries around the country to lie to and intimidate workers in hopes of pushing through the sellout agreement .
This time the UAW cannot claim the company is near bankrupt .
Ford made $ 834 million in the first half of the year and has gained market share from GM and Chrysler , while expanding sales in Europe and China .
The corporate - controlled media has expressed concern over the ability of the UAW to “ sell ” the contract .
Last week , the Detroit Free Press headlined its article , “ Workers chilly to Ford contract : UAW members may oppose it . ”
The UAW has agreed to freeze the wages of so - called entry - level workers and hire as many of these low paid workers as possible .
This will enable Ford to accelerate its plans to get rid of higher - paid veteran workers and replace them with workers earning $ 14 an hour — half as much as current workers — with little or no benefits .
Older workers who remain will be subject to speedup and job overloading due to the further destruction of work rules and job classifications accepted by the UAW .
In addition , the UAW has agreed to binding arbitration over wages and benefits and to ban strikes over these issues when the current contract expires in 2011 , so that it can prepare to push through even greater concessions over the next six years .
In exchange , workers will receive a derisory $ 1,000 signing bonus along with supposed “ job security ” commitments .
These promises will have no more meaning than all the rest over the last three decades , during which time nearly three quarters of a million auto jobs were wiped out and hourly employment at Ford fell from 174,000 to 41,000 .
The Socialist Equality Party is calling on Ford workers to reject the contract and begin organizing rank - and - file committees , independently of the UAW , to launch a struggle in defense of jobs and living standards .
The SEP is calling for Ford workers to link up with GM and Chrysler workers in a nationwide strike to overturn the wage and benefit cuts imposed by the Obama administration .
The SEP has issued a statement raising the political issues in the Ford workers ’ struggle and advancing a socialist alternative to the demands by the corporations , government and UAW that workers pay for the crisis of American capitalism .
We encourage auto workers to download and distribute the statement .
( See “ Reject UAW - Ford concession demands ” )
On Tuesday , a team of SEP supporters distributed the statement at Ford ’s Wayne Assembly Plant in the western suburbs of Detroit .
The plant , which produced Ford ’s compact Focus car model , employs 2,700 workers .
During the afternoon shift change workers who took the SEP statement stopped and spoke to the World Socialist Web Site .
There was overwhelming opposition to the contract and deep disgust with the UAW .
Many workers agreed with the assessment that the UAW was a “ union ” in name only and functioned entirely on behalf of the corporations and the UAW apparatus .
Mike
Mike , a worker with 10 years at Ford , said , “ What ’s a contract if you keep opening it every few months ?
The last time they said we had to give concessions to save the company .
We gave them health care , our pay raises and bonuses .
I have n’t seen a pay increase in eight years .
“ I told them I ’d gladly give up the $ 1,000 signing bonuses if they restored the 4 percent wage increase they owe me .
Who is getting all this money they are taking from us ?
I know the UAW officials are still getting their bonuses .
Now the UAW has a stake in Ford and other companies .
When you own a company you ca n’t be a union .
The UAW has been a business for a long time and Local 900 is the largest and richest local .
“ I started at the Rouge factory in 1994 and I ’ve been in three plants at Ford .
The Michigan Truck Plant next door closed at the end of the last contract .
The workers were told they could keep their jobs if they moved their families to Louisville , Kentucky . ”
Just next door , the Michigan Truck Plant stands closed
Commenting on the growth of mass unemployment and poverty in Detroit , where the official jobless rate has reached the Depression level of 30 percent , he said , “ It ’s horrible how many people have lost their jobs and their homes .
My buddy said there were 27,000 houses about to be boarded up in Detroit .
At the same time , the rich keep milking the system and getting richer .
But people ca n’t get any help from the government .
That ’s capitalism 100 percent . ”
A younger worker said , “ The UAW is giving up the right to strike — the only thing the workers have to fight with .
It ’s already no better than Wal - Mart inside the factory .
We live in a global economy now .
There is global slavery , ” he said , but no global response by the unions .
Another worker commented , “ The UAW does n’t stand for ‘ United Auto Workers . ’
It stands for ‘ You Ain’t Working . ”
Dan
Dan , a skilled tradesman with 18 years , said , “ For the last 30 years we ’ve been giving up everything .
But the officials at [ UAW headquarters ]
Solidarity
House have remained solid — they have n’t given up a thing .
After we gave up our cost - of - living increases the UAW officials boosted their own pay rates .
“ I had someone tell me about what went on at one of these UAW conventions in Atlantic City , New Jersey .
He said the officials had $ 1,000 rooms and high - cost hookers .
Then they drove away with a trunk full of booze to replenish their bars at home .
“ We pay dues so they can keep up their living standards .
Why do we need this union for ?
The local is holding an ‘ information meeting ’ to discuss the contract changes .
I call it a ‘ misinformation meeting ’ because they wo n’t tell us what ’s really in it .
It ’s like 1984 where the Ministry of Truth is in charge of lying to the people . ”
Summing up the growing anger in the working class towards the Obama administration and its bailout of the banks , he concluded , “ While we are losing everything there is going to be $ 140 billion for bonuses on Wall Street .
The government has taken all the money out of the Treasury to bail out the executives at AIG and other firms who are giving out the bonuses . ”

Evening all Franco Baresi has termed this the " Derby of Europe " - and while it may not boast the mutual hatred , sectarian abuse or severed pigs heads of some other great derbies tonight 's game does give us an opportunity to see the two most successful sides in European Cup history going at it .
These two teams have won the tournament 16 times between them ( Real Madrid nine , Milan seven ) and despite the fact the Rossoneri have been some way below their usual standards of late , this is the sort of European fixture it 's hard not to get excited about .
Anyway , I shall be back shortly with some pre-match musings , but in the meantime I should probably let you know that you can follow Chelsea v Atletico Madrid with Rob Smyth 's minute - by - minute report here , and you can read Barry Glendenning 's take on today 's match between CSKA Moscow and Manchester United , that one you did n't realise was kicking off early , here .
Throughout the night you can keep up with all the latest goals on our rather spiffing live scoreboard .
On the other hand , if it 's a picture of a Komodo dragon perching on a rock wondering what to do next you want to see , you 'd probably be better off clicking on this link here .

Annoyingly ...
Uefa 's media centre has starting line - ups for every game tonight except this one .
I can only assume Leonardo has formulated a cunning ruse to start Alessandro Nesta in all 11 positions but wants to keep it under wraps until the last possible moment .
Team news Nope - the teams have just come across the wires .
My new baseless assumption is that the Uefa bod responsible is just polishing off his ninth and penultimate course of lunch before getting down to business .
Anyway , no huge surprises in the starting line - ups ; quite a few pundits had predicted Madrid would drop the out - of - sorts Karim Benzema , but he keeps his place while for Milan Pippo Inzaghi is back in the starting line - up after coming off the bench during their win over Roma .
Real Madrid : Casillas , Sergio Ramos , Pepe , Albiol , Marcelo , Kaka , Lassana Diarra , Alonso , Granero , Benzema , Raul .
Subs : Dudek , Arbeloa , Mahamadou Diarra , Drenthe , Garay , Van der Vaart .
AC Milan : Dida , Oddo , Nesta , Thiago Silva , Zambrotta , Ambrosini , Pirlo , Seedorf , Alexandre Pato , Inzaghi , Ronaldinho .
Subs : Roma , Kaladze , Huntelaar , Flamini , Jankulovski , Borriello ,
Antonini .
Referee : Frank De Bleeckere ( Belgium )
Email v1.0 " I was trying to think up a witty comment linking the komodo dragon and Milan 's lack of goalscoring ability when you mentioned Sandro Nesta , " writes Angharad .
" Poor man , he was obviously dragged in front of the press yesterday because he 's the only sane one left , now that Maldini 's buggered off .
What a disaster for which to come back from a year injured . "
" I predict an epic snooze - fest .
People falling over their own feet , their opponents ' feet , their teammates ' feet , and the ball on all parts of the pitch , no goals , and Raul pouting .
Oh , and Pippo Inzaghi being called offside .
Sixteen times . "
Some fair comment there but I actually could n't disagree with you more on the prediction of no goals .
I think Milan will get beaten tonight , because despite the win over Roma on Sunday , there are significant flaws right through the team .
On the other hand I think they will score , because on nights like this they - and Inzaghi in particular - have a knack of just somehow finding a way .
So I 'll say 3 - 1 full - time .
A further reason not to expect a 0 - 0 draw Nelson Dida is in goal for Milan .
Kaka has a massive grin on his face ...
As he gives his former team - mates each a pre-game hug .
He has promised not to celebrate if he scores tonight , but has also said he is keen to do what he can to knock Milan out - so that Madrid do n't have to play them again later .
1 min
One more piece of statistical trivia as we get underway - Milan have played away to Madrid five times in the European Cup and never won .
They drew once , back in 1989 .
As one Gazzetta dello Sport editorial remarked this morning , if they could n't beat Madrid at the Bernabeu when they were on top of their game , what shot do they have now ?
3 mins Inzaghi is flagged for offside .
Get used to hearing that .
4 mins " Here 's Pirlo , " yelps the Sky commentator as a red- and - black blur flies towards the Madrid area .
I am briefly shocked at the speed of movement , until I realise the man in possession is , in fact , Alexandre Pato .
He is dispossessed on the edge of the box .
6 mins Early doors but the pattern so far seems to be this : Madrid move the ball about neatly in midfield , but lose it when they get into the final third .
[ Insert Milan defender 's name here ] then lumps a hopeful ball up in the direction of Pato .
Madrid regain possession .
Repeat .
7 mins Madrid win the first corner of the game , but Granero 's inswinger from the left is headed clear by Seedorf .
8 mins Another Madrid corner , this time from the right , and this time it 's Nesta who rises unchallenged to nod it away .
10 mins Thiago Silva dawdles on the edge of his own box and nearly loses the ball to Benzema but wakes up just in time to jab the ball back to Dida .
Given that he gave away a goal in almost identical circumstances against Roma , you might have thought he would try and avoid that sort of thing tonight .
12 mins
One thing you may not know about Thiago Silva , incidentally , is that if you type his name into google , the first suggestion is actually for a UFC fighter by the same name .
Or at least I think it 's a different person by the same name .
Who knows , maybe he 's moonlighting ?
Granero has what I believe is tonight 's first shot on target - jabbing the ball tamely into Dida 's arms from 15 yards out after a cross from the right .
14 mins Huge appeal from the home crowd as Zambrotta brings down Benzema from behind in the area .
My initial reaction was that the defender had got a toe to the ball first , but after looking at the replays I 'm less certain - Benzema had him well beaten as he surged towards the right - hand corner of the six - yard box and Zambrotta might just have nicked the ball as he reached with his left leg , but his right knee went straight into the back of the striker 's heels .
Milan may have dodged a bullet there .
16 mins Another Madrid corner , this time an outswinger that does find Albiol , albeit way back on the far edge of the area and his header fails to clear the defender immediately in front of him .
GOAL !
Real Madrid 1 - 0 Milan ( Raul , 19 mins )
Dear , oh dear , oh dear .
What did I say about Nelson Dida ?
After some tidy build - up work from Madrid Granero scuffed a lame effort towards goal from the edge of the D .
It goes straight to Dida , who seems to have it under control but then drops the ball onto his own knee , from where it deflects to Raul , who jabs it home .
Farcical .
21 mins Gosh that goal was poor .
Milan have an absolute mountain to climb already , because they 've posed no threat up front so far whatsoever .
23 mins Returning to my pre-goal chain of thought , I have decided Silva is definitely too baby - faced to be a cage fighter .
His fellow Brazilian Serie A star Felipe Melo used to dabble in mixed martial arts , though .
Of everyone in this Milan team I 'd say Inzaghi probably has the most potential as a UFC contender .
Sure , he 's a bit weedy but he 's also got a feistiness to him .
Plus let 's face it , he 'd cheat .
25 mins Inzaghi .
Offside .
You know the drill .
Actually I have to say that was pretty much the best move Milan have strung together all night - Seedorf wriggling free of two men down the left to swing in a low cross that was maybe half - a- yard too far in front of Inzaghi , who stretched a toe out but could only jab the ball wide .
It 's a good thing he did , actually , because replays suggest he was n't offside at all .
27 mins " You were right , " sighs Angharad .
" I should have looked at the line - up before I predicted 0 - 0 .
Then I would have realized Nelson ' Mr. Fumble ' Dida was in goal .
6 - 0 to Real , maybe ?
I 'm still predicting Raul will end up pouting before the night is out , though . "
28 mins Massimo Oddo pumps an angled ball up from just inside the half towards Inzaghi in the area .
I 'd say that 's never going to work , what with Pippo being about 4ft 6ins , but to be honest it just might - Madrid 's defence do n't look entirely comfortable dealing with the high balls and if they do let one bounce he 's still the man you 'd want in there waiting for it .
30 mins OK , we 're half an hour in now , so I think it 's now fair to say I 've been deeply underwhelmed with Madrid .
They 've been the better side , but frankly that 's not saying a lot because Milan have been toilet .
These are the nights Florentino Perez wanted when he launched his latest galactico project - Champions League games against high - profile opponents - but so far the game itself has not lived up to biling .
33 mins Pato has a little sit down after an aerial collision with Alonso .
A couple of Milan players have a half - hearted grumble to the referee .
34 mins First contribution of note , ish , from Ronaldinho , who gives himself a glimpse of goal with a little body swerve on the left before hammering a shot into the nearest white shirt .
35 mins Another nervous moment for Dida as Benzema scoops out a chip from 25 yards that has the keeper back - pedalling frantically but lands on the roof of the net .
37 mins Another corner for Madrid .
Another simple clearance for Milan .
39 mins After Madrid win yet another corner on the left Granero decides to take a new tack - rolling a short pass to Raul , taking the return and then ... slicing a cross wildly off his right boot and away towards the far touchline .
That was rubbish .
41 mins " I 'm quite touched by this trend for not celebrating goals scored against former clubs which the scorer left on good terms , " writes Gary Naylor - in response to Kaka 's pre-game comments .
" But it seems only fair - and , if we 're honest , great fun - to allow players forced out by fan power / stupid managers / being benched regularly to do the opposite and give it the full Adebayor .
I think we can rely on Craig Bellamy to do the ( in ) decent thing in quite a few matches this season . "
43 mins Diarra becomes overwhelmed with boredom and thrashes a drive wide from 25 yards .
The crowd react as if it 's gone six inches wide but in reality it was closer to six feet .
45 mins Kaka drives into the Milan box and hooks the ball back across the six - yard area , but Nesta manages to half - clear before a team - mate puts the ball behind for , yup , another corner .
Which comes to nothing .
45 mins ( +1 ) Sharing Diarra 's weariness at the failure of Madrid 's strikers to do any , y'know , shooting , Marcelo lets fly with an absolute rocket from 30 yards out that Dida can only parry away to his left .
Thankfully for him Zambrotta , rather than Raul is on hand this time to collect the loose ball .
Peepety - Peeeep
That 's half - time at the Bernabeu .
Back in a tick with half - time thoughts .
Nikolaj Moller wanted me to share this with you , so I have .
So ... Madrid will obviously be the happier side , what with the 1 - 0 lead and all , but honestly I can't imagine this is what Perez had in mind when he put this team together over the summer .
Milan have showed very little ambition , but if they can come up with a plan better than ' let 's just wait until Madrid 's defenders make a mistake ' , they may find it 's far from impossible for them to get back into this game .
That said , my prediction at this stage is still that Madrid will win - and will probably score again at some stage .
Hopefully not just because Dida gifts it to them .
Incidentally I only realised about three minutes before half - time that I had failed to put my email address in the standfirst .
It 's there now though , so if you fancy sharing your thoughts on this game / Nelson Dida / footballers who would make better cage fighters than Thiago Silva then you know where to go with them .
Oh , and I 'm not sure whether to be impressed or troubled that several of you managed to email me anyway .
46 mins
We 're off again .
Seedorf just kicked Marcelo , just to get things going .
47 mins Granero finds himself in acres of space after Silva charges up to meet the Madrid player in midfield and somehow ends up going straight past him .
Granero then slips the ball to Raul , who cuts inside Oddo but skews his attempted shot across the face of Dida 's goal .
49 mins Inzaghi .
Offside .
By about 78 yards .
50 mins Kaka , who has been largely disappointing tonight , chances his arm from a central position about 25 yards out ( you may spot a pattern forming here ) , but his low , skiddy effort , goes wide of the Dida 's left - hand post .
51 mins
Far more impressive from Kaka , who uses a neat body swerve to get a yard on Oddo just to the left of the six - yard box before flicking the ball towards the far corner of Dida 's net .
The keeper is equal to the effort , though , palming it away before Milan rush down the other end and Inzaghi sees a relatively tame effort gathered by Casilias .
53 mins Milan win their first corner of the game after Inzaghi attempts to nutmeg Pepe down by the right touchline .
The same defender gets his head ot the ensuing delivery , however , and Madrid clear .
55 mins Raul catches Nesta napping and rushes onto a throughball inside the Milan area , but for reasons best known to himself attempts to chip Dida , who was very much still on his line .
I know it 's Dida , but still .
57 mins " After having mistakenly played professional football instead of rugby league until the age of 40 , surely it 's not too late for Dean Windass to make it in the cage , " muses Jimmy McManners as Pato crashes a shot into Raul Albiol 's thighs .
This game may finally be getting a little livelier .
58 mins I think I should clarify my last comment - the tempo of this game has definitely been raised , but the quality of passing is still woeful .
Twice Milan 's defenders win the ball deep in their own half , twice they give it straight back to Madrid and twice the home side return the favour .
Bleugh .
60 mins " Yeah , I did n't manage to search for your email before when it was n't up , " says Robin Hazlehurst .
" I was quite impressed when you first said Thiago Silva is a UFC fighter ( 12 mins ) because I had no idea what UFC meant and thought it might be like some Star Wars thing , and that a Thiago Silva was an interspace jet - fighter as flown by Hans Solo or something .
Which sounds pretty impressive , as I doubt my own name would ever be used as a cool sounding super space age ace fighter plane thingy .
( Yours neither ) . "
Milan have brought Marco Borriello on for Inzaghi .
Borriello's a genuine target man , so it might make sense from a ' we 're only going to pump balls at him anyway ' perspective , but he 's also not played in months .
GOAL !
Real Madrid 1 - 1 Milan ( Pirlo 62 mins )
Wow .
Seriously , wow .
I looked up from my emails just in time to see Pirlo let fly with a speculative but meticulously placed effort from 30 , maybe more , yards out that caught Casilias totally cold and snuck into the corner of the net .
Utterly stunning .
64 mins
That was absolutely breathtaking , though you have to think Casilias could have done better given how far out the shot came from .
Anyway , Pirlo 's given everyone an idea now , with Zambrotta fizzing an low effort of his own from about five yards closer in just wide of Casilias 's left - hand post .
GOAL !
Real Madrid 1 - 2 Milan ( Pato 66 mins ) Simply Unbelievable .
Ambrosini clips an angled ball from the half - way line into the path of Pato , Casilias - seemingly overanxious to make up for his lack of concentration a moment ago - charges forward to meet Pato outside his area , and the striker simply steps round him to stroke the ball into an empty net .
God knows what the two Madrid centre - backs were playing at letting him have that sort of space , but somehow Milan are ahead .
69 mins " You may also want to inform your readership that they need to reload the whole page to find your email address , the auto - updater wo n't do it , " says Greg Scully as Kaka Wings a shot into Pirlo 's midriff .
Madrid have just sent Royston Drenthe on for Granero .
72 mins Madrid win a free - kick right on the edge of the box after Raul is clumsily brought down .
Somehow when they come to take it Madrid are about five - yards further back , but I guess that suits them .
The ball is rolled to Alonso , whose drive is deflected behind for a corner ...
73 mins ... which is cleared only as far as Kaka , but his effort is charged down .
75 mins Madrid have finally started playing with some urgency - only took them an hour and a quarter - but some of the passing remains very poor .
" What are your views on Pirlo at this point , " asks Vincenzo Perrone in New York .
" Does he actually have much left in the tank ?
I feel like he plays 7 games where he looks like he has no interest then goes on to boss the next game or score a belter against Madrid !
What 's going on ? "
I would tend to agree with your assessment Vincenzo - I 've actually found him a massively frustrating player for more than a season now - one who dwells far too long in possession and often disapperas from games altogether , but then raises himself just when you 're about to write him off .
Sadly I think it 's just a case of age catching up with him - he 's still got the talent , but he just does n't have the energy levels required at the top of the game .
GOAL !
Real Madrid 2 - 2 Milan ( Drenthe 76 mins )
At last , a Madrid corner pays dividends .
This time Raul abandoned hopes of trying to put the ball into the middle and instead sent it directly to Drenthe as he lingered dep four or five yards outside the penalty area and the Dutchman took one touch to control the ball before cracking a low drive straight into the bottom left - hand corner .
78 mins Almost a very quick response from Milan , as Ronaldinho - another one who seems capable of raising himself only for the briefest of spells in any given match these days , drives insistently into the area on the left before cutting the ball back beautifully to Seedorf with a flick of his right boot , but the midfielder snatches at it and sends the ball some way over the bar .
81 mins " Casilias was asleep on the first , and tried to do too much on the second , " sniffs Don Evans .
" No way Madrid play at home in the Champions League final , with that kind of keeping . "
82 mins Pirlo seems to have injured himself while trying to move past Sergio Ramos , and has gone to the sideline for treatment .
84 mins
Well it looked for a moment as if we were in for another argument about goalline technology as Nesta hooked a Raul effort away from right on the line , but it turned out the flag was already up for offside .
The chance had fallen to Raul after Dida fumbled a shot by Kaka , incidentally .
86 mins Madrid are very , very lucky not to be behind again after what looked like an own goal from a Milan corner is chalked off for no apparent reason .
The ball was bundled in at the near post - I 'm not sure if it came off Thiago Silva or a Madrid defender last - and replays show no evidence of wrongdoing by Milan , but the referee made his decision and both teams will have to live with it .
Only after a heated set - to , mind , which sees Nesta and and Raul booked even though it appeared as though it was Ronaldinho who slapped someone in the melee .
GOAL !
Real Madrid 2 - 3 Milan ( Pato 88 mins )
Well , you would have to say that 's justice .
Seedorf received the ball inside the area , opened his body and curled a wonderful pass into the path of Pato , who strode forwards to volley it home with aplomb .
Not for the first time tonight the Madrid defence just seemed to lose track of him - they 've looked more than a little shoddy .
90 mins Dida is at full - stretch to turn an Alonso effort around the post and from the corner Sergio Ramos heads over for Madrid .
What an absurd game .
90 mins ( +1 ) Ronaldinho trots very slowly off to be replaced by Mathieu Flamini .
90 mins ( +2 ) Marcelo gives the ball away to Oddo and then clatters into the Milan defender as he canters forward in possession .
Marcelo gets a deserved booking .
Peep !
Peep !
Peeeeep !
There you have it , Milan - so , so poor in the first half - leave the Bernabeu with a win that ultimately feels deserved , especially in the context of the disallowed goal .
I 've said it a few times already tonight but both teams really were poor for large stretches - giving the ball away cheaply and playing with no sense of urgency , but once Pirlo had brought Milan back into the game both raised the tempo and while there were still a lot of mistakes it became a very enjoyable game .
On tonight 's evidence it's hard to see either side winning this tournament , but Madrid were without Ronaldo and besides , expectations formed in October are often defied in May .
Sorry for the mix - up with the email address and thanks for all those you did send in the second half .
Sorry I could n't use more .
First human stem cell trial using IVF embryos will treat patients facing blindness
Patients facing blindness with a rare and incurable eye disease are expected to become the first ever people to benefit from an embryonic stem - cell therapy .
Sufferers of Stargardt ’s disease , which causes sight loss in early adulthood , are set to undergo the first clinical trials of the controversial treatment .
American scientists want to carry out transplant operations using stem cells from spare human embryos left over from IVF treatment .
Hope : Eyes suffering macular degeneration ( above ) could have retinas regrown using stem cells
If the research is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the 12 patients could undergo the procedures early in the new year .
‘ The treatment for eye disease uses stem cells to re-create a type of cell in the retina that supports the photoreceptors needed for vision , ’ said Dr Robert Lanza of Massachusetts - based Advanced Cell Technology .
‘ These cells , called retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) , are often the first to die off in Stargardt ’s macular dystrophy . ’
Stem cells are the body ’s master cells .
Embryonic stem cells , taken from a days - old embryo , are the most pliable as each one has the power to morph into any of the body ’s cell types .
Scientists are trying to use them as the basis of a new field called regenerative medicine .
Embryonic stem cells are cultured in a lab to develop mature retinal pigment epithelium cells .
These will be injected into damaged RPE cells in the retinas of people with macular degeneration .
This should help them to focus their vision
Embryonic stem cells can be used for tailor - made treatments that a patient ’s body is less likely to reject .
The hope is that they could be used to repair the damaged organs and tissues of patients with a relatively simple transplant procedure .
U.S. President Barack Obama lifted some of the restrictions imposed on their use by his predecessor George W Bush soon after he took office .
Another American biotechnology firm Geron won approval in January to test human embryonic stem cells to treat paraplegic patients who can use their upper bodies but cannot walk .
However , that trial is on hold while the company and FDA check on some side - effects seen in animals .
Stem cells :
The body 's master cells , taken from embryos , can morph into any of the body 's cell types
But Dr Lanza is hopeful his trial will be able to start sooner – and make his patients the first in the world to receive any kind of treatment based on embryonic stem cells .
‘ It has been over a decade since human embryonic stem cells were first discovered .
The field desperately needs a big clinical success , ’ he said .
‘ After years of research and political debate , we ’re finally on the verge of showing the potential clinical value of embryonic stem cells .
‘ Our research clearly shows that stem cell - derived retinal cells can rescue visual function in animals that otherwise would have gone blind .
‘ We are hopeful that the cells will be similarly efficacious in patients . ’
The development is highly controversial because many pro-life groups are opposed to using human embryos in any kind of medical research .
But scientists believe that the benefits could revolutionise the treatment of many incurable disorders ranging from Parkinson ’s to heart disease .
And Dr Lanza is confident of its success .
‘ We 've seen absolutely no adverse effects whatsoever in any of the preclinical experiments and our cells are more than 99.9 per cent pure , ’ he told The Independent .
‘ We certainly expect the FDA to come back with comments and questions but our hope is that we will start sometime early next year .
The condition : Stargardt ’s disease causes macular degeneration so that sight is gradually lost over time
‘ We ’re optimistic and certainly confident in our own data .
We ”ve been in dialogue and we know what was on their mind and what they wanted us to do .
‘ We ’re hoping , assuming no hitches , to begin early next year , perhaps March . ’
The first to benefit will be sufferers of Stargardt ’s macular degeneration , which destroys the central part of the retina involved in recognising faces and reading words on a page .
ACT scientists also intend to follow this with an application to treat age - related macular degeneration , which affects more than 500,000 people in Britain and is the most common cause of blindness .
The treatment for eye disease uses stem cells to recreate a type of cell in the retina that supports the photoreceptors needed for vision .
These cells form the retinal pigment epithelium – which keep the light - sensing cells of the retina alive – which are often the first to die off in macular degeneration , which in turn leads to loss of vision , he said .
A single cell from a human embryo left over from IVF treatment was used in the creation of the stem cell ‘ line ’ that Dr Lanza and his colleagues cultivated in the laboratory .
By bathing the stem cells in a suite of chemical messengers , they were able to stimulate them to develop into fully mature retinal pigment epithelium cells .
Tests on animals found that transplants of the human cells into rats with macular degeneration resulted in a ‘ 100 per cent improvement ’ in vision with no side - effects , Dr Lanza said .
Transplants into the 12 human volunteers chosen as guinea pigs for the first clinical trial will involve giving them mild immuno - suppressant drugs to prevent tissue rejection .
AND A FREAKING T-REX !
He was wearing a t - shirt adorned with a picture of him wearing a t - shirt of the reddit alien wearing a t - shirt of a brontosaurus .
He looked quite angry with me after I stole his shirt , but I think he was just trying to get me to notice the lovely note in his mouth .
So , we were pretty chill after that - but that could have been because he finally got his shirt back .
Thanks fiepie !
I 'm going to need help choosing a name for him ...

A Chinese man has been living in the arrivals section of Tokyo's Narita Airport for more than a month .
Feng Zhenghu , described by Amnesty International as a prominent " human rights defender " , has been refused entry to China several times .
He has a Japanese visa but will not go through passport control , insisting he wants to go home .
Roland Buerk reports .
WASHINGTON — The United States has quietly opened a third , largely covert front against the Al - Qaeda terror network in Yemen , The New York Times reported .
Citing an unnamed former top CIA official , the newspaper said that a year ago the Central Intelligence Agency sent many field operatives with counterterrorism experience to the country .
At the same time , some of the most secretive special operations commandos have begun training Yemeni security forces in counterterrorism tactics , the report said .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Pentagon will be spending more than 70 million dollars over the next 18 months , and using teams of special forces , to train and equip Yemeni military , Interior Ministry and coast guard forces , more than doubling previous military aid levels , the paper noted .
The country has long been a refuge for jihadists , in part because Yemen ? s government welcomed returning Islamist fighters who had fought in Afghanistan during the 1980s , the report pointed out .
But Al - Qaeda militants have made much more focused efforts to build a base in Yemen in recent years , drawing recruits from throughout the region and mounting more frequent attacks on foreign embassies and other targets , according to The Times .
The White House is seeking to nurture enduring ties with the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and prod him to combat the local Al - Qaeda affiliate , Al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , the paper said .

Report : President Obama Has the Clear Legal Authority to Make a Binding Commitment for
Greenhouse Gas Reductions in Copenhagen Without Waiting for Congress COPENHAGEN —
The Center for Biological Diversity ’s Climate Law Institute released a report today demonstrating that President Obama has clear legal authority to commit the United States to reducing greenhouse gas pollution .
The report , titled Yes , He Can : President Obama ’s Power to Make an International Climate Commitment Without Waiting for Congress , concludes that the President need not wait for Congress to act before taking strong action to reduce U.S. emissions .
The report will be released in Copenhagen this evening at a side event hosted by Greenpeace .
Where : Niels Bohr
When : Tuesday , 8 December , 21:00 - 21:30 ( Copenhagen time ) “ President Obama ’s hands are not tied by Congress ’s lack of action or the grossly inadequate cap - and - trade bills currently under debate .
President Obama can lead , rather than follow , by using his power under the Clean Air Act and other laws to achieve deep and rapid greenhouse emissions reductions from major polluters , ” said Center attorney Kevin Bundy , the report ’s lead author .
“ Obama can use his authority to make a binding agreement in Copenhagen without additional action from Congress .
The Constitution and existing domestic environmental laws give President Obama all the power he needs to join with other nations in making a real commitment to solve the climate crisis . ”
The report cites prominent legal scholars and U.S. Supreme Court opinions recognizing the President ’s broad power to make binding international agreements that do not need to be ratified by a two - thirds majority vote in the Senate .
For example , the President could enter into either a “ congressional - executive ” agreement under authority already granted by Congress , or a “ sole executive ” agreement based on his own constitutional powers .
The report also details the President ’s broad authority to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions under existing environmental laws , including the Clean Air Act , Clean Water Act , Endangered Species Act , and National Environmental Policy Act .
The release of the report follows yesterday ’s important finding by the Environmental Protection Agency that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare .
That decision will facilitate comprehensive measures to curb greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act .
“ The President has the ultimate responsibility for enforcing domestic environmental laws , and those laws give him a wide variety of options for reducing greenhouse gas pollution , ” said Bundy .
“ All he has to do is promise the international community to use the authority he already has . ”
“ It simply is n’t true that President Obama can not make a commitment in Copenhagen .
Yes , he can , and if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , he must . ”

Crimes against wildlife , including badger baiting with dogs , hare coursing , poisoning of protected birds and even trapping them to sell as caged pets have soared to unprecedented heights .
New figures from the police show that the number of wildlife crimes more than doubled in the last year , from 2,177 to 5,854 .
Incidents are now being recorded at a rate of 120 a week .
They cover not only the slaughtering of badgers and rare birds of prey , but also egg thefts , bird trapping , deer poaching and habitat destruction .
Rural areas are where most incidents occur , with Northumbria a conspicuous target for wildlife criminals .
More than 500 incidents have been recorded there , with Grampian ( 244 ) , Humberside ( 195 ) , and North Wales ( 188 ) also wildlife crime hotspots .
What make the statistics even more remarkable is that they do not include crimes against domestic and farm animals .
In 2008 , the RSPCA investigated 140,000 cases of animal cruelty in England and Wales , a steep rise from the 2003 figure of 105,000 .
The charity has seen dog fighting rise tenfold since 2004 , with nearly 300 incidents last year .
Airgun attacks on animals and rustling of sheep and cattle also appear to be on the rise .

One of the sharpest rises has been in what police call " badger persecution " , a term that includes badgers being dug out of their setts , pitted against terrier dogs in fights , and being shot by farmers , landowners or their agents .
Between February and July this year , the National Wildlife Crime Unit ( NWCU ) recorded 241 incidents of badger persecution – a total that in just six months almost exceeded the 280 reported incidents in 2008 .
Criminals are travelling hundreds of miles to baiting " events " , according to Ian Hutchison , a species protection officer for Scottish Badgers .
" Badger baiting is taking place throughout the country .
It used to be an urban myth that badger baiters would travel all over the countryside .
Well , it 's not an urban myth any more – they are travelling far and wide to commit offences , " he said .
People are betting on the outcomes of fights , he added , and live badgers can fetch a high price .
" We have been told that in the Liverpool area , a live badger is worth £ 1,000 so that it can be fought with a dog . "
Mike Butcher , chief inspector of the RSPCA special operations unit , said : " Digging badgers out is very common , and there is a rise in the calls about badgers that we are getting . "
Police now plan a major crackdown , Operation Meles , against the resurgence in badger persecution that they say is being driven , in part , by the perceived threat to livestock from bovine tuberculosis .
Another police project , Operation Galileo , against hare coursing , was launched by police in Lincolnshire last month .
Between September 2008 and March 2009 there were more than 900 reports of hare coursing to the local force .
The rural crimewave is threatening the very survival of some species .
Crimes against bats have increased by 10 per cent a year since 2007 , and the loss of one roost can be a severe blow to populations that are already vulnerable , according to the Bat Conservation Trust .
Last year , the RSPB received 1,206 reports of shooting , poisoning , trapping and disturbance of birds and their eggs – the second highest they have ever recorded .
The theft of wild flowers is also taking its toll on Britain 's biodiversity .
In May this year , Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust had to issue a warning to visitors to its nature reserve near Sapperton after a spate of bluebell thefts .
Detective Inspector Brian Stuart , head of the NWCU , said : " There is an increase in wildlife crime in general .
We are seeking to use wider policing powers , such as the Proceeds of Crime Act , to target criminals where it hurts them most – in their pocket . "
Dr Mark Avery , the RSPB 's conservation director , said : " There is far too much wildlife crime going on in the countryside .
The scale of it is unacceptable in the modern age . "
He added : " The hen harrier is pretty close to being extinct in England , in large part down to wildlife crime . "
But conservationists , including the RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts , are calling for a radical shake - up of wildlife policing , and claim that an inconsistent response to crime by police means criminals are able to break the law with little fear of being caught .
The NWCU has seen its staff slashed from 14 to nine since it was set up three years ago , and there were just 51 convictions in 2008 - 09 – accounting for just 3 per cent of the cases dealt with .
Huw Irranca - Davies , a Defra minister , said that a government review into the way wildlife crime is being tackled is currently under way and will report in spring 2010 .
A breakdown of the latest figures from the NWCU shows that Northumbria is Britain 's wildlife crime capital , with 525 incidents , including the highest number of shootings of wildlife , according to the statistics from the latest tactical assessment for the period between February and July 2009 .
Humberside came top for poaching – with 119 incidents – and the Grampian region had the highest number of reports of wildlife being trapped or snared , as well as being a centre , along with Tayside and Lancashire , for crimes against birds of prey .
North Wales had the most cases of badger persecution and habitat destruction .
In terms of bats being killed or their roosts destroyed , Gwent had the highest number of incidents .
Hare coursing was greatest in Lincolnshire , and fox - hunting incidents were most commonly reported in Devon and Cornwall .
The greatest concentration of birds ' nests being destroyed was in Northern Ireland .
Please note : this page is now obsolete .
This semi - joke version has been replaced by a shiny , new , and entirely real version of Objective Lua , now hosted on SourceForge .
Objective Lua Go visit the real Objective Lua page for more information .
Everything following is kept for historical reasons and refers only to the toy version --- which you can still get , if you want .
So , what is this ?
Objective Lua is a new programming language that consists of the object - oriented system from Objective C welded onto Lua .
Are you serious ?
About 60 % .
Is n't Lua already object - oriented ?
Actually , no .
Instead , Lua provides all the low - level tools so that you can trivially create you own object - oriented system in only a few lines of code .
If I remember correctly , Objective C uses multipart keyworded method names , where a call looks something like [ object moveByX : 4 Y : 3 ] .
How have you adapted that to Lua syntax ?
I do n't .
You use all the traditional Objective C syntax , in Lua .
How does that work , then ?
Objective Lua programs are converted into standard Lua using a translator , which is currently a very small Leg plugin .
I 'm appalled , but ... intrigued .
How much Objective C syntax does this abomination support ?
Objective Lua supports @interface , @implementation , method calls with [ ] notation , superclass method calls with [ super ] , and both normal and class method types .
Here 's an example :
@interface Point : Object @end @implementation Point - init [ super init ] self .x = 0 self.y = 0 return self end - initX : x Y : y self .x = x self.y = y return self end - x return self .x end - y return self.y end - moveToX : x Y : y self .x = x self.y = y end - moveByX : x Y : y self .x = self .x + x self.y = self.y + y end @end local point = [ [ Point alloc ] init ] [ point moveToX : 4 Y : 9 ]
Wow .
That looks ... pretty clean , actually .
Yes .
To my total surprise , it was a really good fit .
Lua 's dynamism suits the Smalltalk - descended architecture of Objective C beautifully , while the formalised class structure of Objective C gives order and shape to Lua 's otherwise very free - form programs .
I notice you 're not declaring your methods or your properties in the @interface block .
Yes .
Predeclaring methods is n't really applicable to a dynamic language like Lua --- we can add methods on the fly at any point .
In fact , the only thing the @interface block is doing right now is specifying the superclass .
Future versions will probably change the syntax to make it more Lua - friendly , but right now I wanted to keep as traditional Objective C syntax as possible .
What 's the performance like ?
Under the hood it turns into normal Lua .
This :
local point = [ [ Point alloc ] init ]
... becomes :
local point = Point:alloc ( ) :init ( )
So the performance is identical to any other table - based object system .
In fact , one of the advantages of using Objective Lua over traditional Lua is that the object system becomes divorced from the actual code .
It would , for example , be possible to switch to using a closure - based object system for extra speed , without needing to change any application code .
Huh .
Yeah .
Does it bridge to Objective C ?
Not currently .
However , with projects like LuaObjC , it should be very easy .
Because Objective Lua just does standard Lua method calls behind the scenes , interoperability ought to be trivial .
Okay , I 'm sold .
I 'm going to write all my code in Objective Lua from now on .
I 'd hold off for a while yet .
The current Objective Lua compiler is a toy --- it 's only 200 lines long !
It 's intended to provide a working example and talking point only .
For example , there 's one nasty grammatical edge case if you follow a statement that might be an expression with a method call :
someFunction ( ) [ object someMethod ]
Leg right now gets confused because it things the [ is starting an array subscript .
In fact , this is not ambiguous , because a method send can always be distinguished from a subscript by the existence of the method selector , but you may need quite a lot of readahead to do it ( as this appears after the expression denoting the receiver ) .
So Objective Lua wo n't become truly useful until someone rewrites the compiler to get all this stuff right .
( This , by the way , is why the test program occasionally parenthesises method calls , or puts a ; after a statement --- to eliminate ambiguity to give Leg a leg up . )
Besides , right now it gets all the line numbers wrong , which makes programs a pig to debug .
So what use is it ?
It 's a toy .
Smalltalk was one of the earliest object oriented languages around , and still one of the best .
Objective C took a very pragmatic approach to extending C with an object - oriented system by simply stealing the Smalltalk syntax and semantics wholesale .
I was curious to see how well the same principle would apply to a different language .
So far , I 'm pleasantly suprised --- even writing the noddy test programs that I 've done so far seems to be a fundamentally cleaner experience than writing the same code in raw Lua .
I do n't imagine that anyone will ever want to turn this into a real product , but I 've been wrong before ( frequently ) .
At the very least , I 'm hoping that it 'll provoke discussion .
What made you do this ?
I recently had reason to take another look at Smalltalk and a very clever strongly - typed but compatible derivative , Strongtalk , and was reminded again of the sheer elegance of the language .
I wondered if it might be possible to build a Smalltalk to Lua translator , and then wondered about implementing the Smalltalk object system in Lua ... and then I thought of this .
What , really ?
Plus , I was bored .
I want to send you a detailed critique .
My email address is at the bottom of the page , under the comment form ( hint , hint ) .
I want to help .
Feel free to send me patches .
Feel even more free to send me a clean recursive - descent parser for Lua 5.1 that will generate an AST , and then serialise the AST back out to Lua source code ( getting all the line numbers right ) ...
I think you 're a genius and want to have your babies .
Thank - you .
Please email me proof of XX chromosomes and a photo .
I think you 're evil and will go to hell .
See previous question .
I think you 're mad .
Well , yes .
Where do I get it ?
Right here !

In what is being called an " appalling and astounding breach of security , " the Transportation and Security Administration inadvertently posted a 93 - page screening procedure manual on the Internet .
Secrets exposed include the percent of bags actually checked by security ( 20 % ) , the countries meriting extra scrutiny ( there are 12 of them ) , and rules for government officials ( many are exempt from special screening ) .
TSA officials insist the foul - up wo n't compromise national security , but many experts are questioning that .
Does the blunder make fliers less safe ?
This is a national disaster :
This screw - up could easily qualify as " inadvertent treason , " says Rick Moran at the American Thinker .
The release of this " blueprint " guide to our security puts American lives in grave jeopardy — in fact , " it has the potential to absolutely destroy domestic air travel . "
After this , will anyone feel comfortable enough to fly the friendly skies ?
" TSA leaves online love note for al Qaeda "
These " secrets " do n't seem terribly surprising :
Why would anyone be " amazed " to hear that the TSA only checks 20 % of bags ?
Frankly , " I 'm sort of surprised it's that many , " says Helen Anders in the Austin Statesman .
" If the TSA had to hand - inspect every bag , we 'd all have to show up at the airport 5 hours before our flights . "
Chances are the biggest consequence of this gaffe will be tighter security — just in time for the holiday travel crush .
" Uh-oh : TSA puts its security manual online "
The TSA has punked us : Average Americans are expected to jump through countless hoops in the name of " national security , " writes Jo -Ann Armao in The Washington Post 's PostPartisan blog .
Now those same officials have done something that " renders all those steps meaningless . "
Will we ever trust the TSA the same way again ?
" Not likely . "
" The intolerable TSA "
The decision of the State Persecutor to press charges against pupils occupying their school in Salonica has led to a snowball of occupations of high - schools in northern Greece .
In the last month , there has been a silent wave of high - school occupations across Greece .
Given the national elections and the the urban guerrilla saga in Athens , these have been grossly undereported and generally overlooked as an endemic start - of - the - school - season phenomenon .
This general public disregard of high - school pupils actions and demands is what has led the State Persecutor of Salonica , Mr Papageorgiou , to believe it was the right time to implement one of the most reactionary legislations of the last Socialist government ( 2000 - 2004 ) , which allowed the persecution of pupils for the occupation of their schools , a long established practice of struggle in relation to educational reform in the 1990s .
The penalty amounts to maximum 5 years imprisonment .
During the last two weeks more than 35 high - schools in Salonica alone , and an unidentified number in the cities of Volos , Pyrgos , Ptolemaida as well as smaller towns of the mainland and the islands have been occupied by pupils with various demands concerning the operation of their schools .
The media blackout on the subject has been quoted by the Nuclei of Fire urban guerrilla group as a reason for bombing the house of the ex-Minister of Education last week .
Moreover , several occupied schools in Salonica came under fascist attack by parastate elements last week , with no human injuries reported .
The legal persecution of the pupils has been oposed by OLME , the teachers national union , while even policemen ordered by the State Persecutor to arrest the accused pupils have publicly refused to do so , claiming that this " would only inflame the situation , leading to an automatic reaction on the part of pupils at the mere sight of policemen " .
As a result of the persecution warrant , a dozen more schools have been occupied in Salonica , as a warning by pupils that the implementation of persecutions will be faced by a mass pupil movement , the prospects of which trouble the State after the struggle experience gathered by 14 - 17 year old pupils during the December Uprising .
At the same time , at the 17th lyceum of Athens , pupils have staged a successful abstention from class in response of a pupil being disciplined for not standing at attention at the sound of the national anthem during a national holiday last week .
The pupils gathered in protest at the schools gates refusing to enter the premises and thus forcing the school director to reverse the disciplinary measures .
In the words of the pupils " The results of our mobilisation have encouraged us , as they proved that with collective action nobody can beat us " .
As much as we appreciate the Pilgrims ' contribution to our holiday calendar , they are far from the first to set aside a holiday to give thanks for a bountiful harvest .
Here are some other thanks - giving holidays from around the world .
Ch'usok
Held in September or October ( October 3rd in 2009 ) , Ch'usok is the Korean harvest and thanksgiving festival .
The holiday starts with pilgrimages to the graves of one 's ancestors , to give thanks and sacrifices of food .
Families feasts feature sweet rice cakes and other traditional foods .
These are followed by public celebrations with games and dancing .
The circle dance , or Ganggangsuwollae , is performed by women .
The legend behind the Ganggangsuwollae is the story of how , in 1592 , Korean women dressed as men and danced in a circle to confuse Japanese invaders into thinking the Korean force was much larger than it actually was .
Thai Pongal
Thai Pongal is a Tamil holiday celebrated in southern India , Sri Lanka , and among Tamil populations all over the world , no matter what religion they follow .
The harvest festival usually takes place from January 12th to the 15th , or a period at the end of the month of Maargazhi and the beginning of the month of Thai on the Tamil calendar .
It is a time to thank the sun and the rain for a bountiful harvest .
Farm animals are also honored .
The word pongal means " to boil over " .
During the second day of Thai Pongal , celebrants boil rice , milk , and sugar together in a new clay pot .
When the recipes boils out of the pot , everyone shouts " Ponggalo Ponggal ! " to usher in prosperity .
One the third day of Pongal , cows and bulls are decorated , paraded , and treated to special snacks .

Yam Festival
The Yam Festival is celebrated in Ghana and Nigeria to give thanks to the spirits of the earth and sky for the yam harvest .
Yams are the earliest crop ready for harvest , followed by corn , okra , beans , and cassava .
The holiday is held at the end of the rainy season when the yams are ripe , usually in August or September .
In Ghana , the holiday is also called Homowo ( To Hoot at Hunger ) .
Families prepare yams and other dishes for a community feast , and young people parade behind a boy chosen to carry the best yams .
In Nigeria , the celebration begins with prayers of thanks and sacrifices of food to one 's ancestors , and continues with public wrestling matches , as well as music , dancing , and feasting .

Thanksgiving in Canada
The first Thanksgiving holiday celebrated by Canadian settlers was in 1578 , when explorer Martin Frobisher held a ceremony and feast to give thanks to God for a successful journey to Newfoundland and Labrador .
This predated the Pilgrims ' Thanksgiving holiday by 43 years .
Thanksgiving holidays were held sporadically in Canada until 1879 , after which it became an annual event .
Thanksgiving in Canada is now held on the second Monday in October .
As it forms a three - day weekend , family feasts are held on any of the three days .

Succoth
Succoth , or Feast of the Tabernacles , is a seven - day Jewish harvest holiday which begins on the fifth day after Yom Kippur .
The word succoth , or succah , means booth or hut , which recalls the makeshift shelters used by the Hebrews as they fled Egypt .
A family or synagogue might build a succah to use during Succoth .
Othodox Jews spend the entire seven days in the succah .
Men also go into the temple to give thanks and pray for a bountiful harvest .

There are many other harvest holidays all around the world .
Some are religious and some are completely secular whether they involve gratitude or not .
But we all love to get together with friends and family to eat while there is plenty of food !
The Toronto Maple Leafs traded forward Jiri Tlusty to Carolina for prospect Philippe Paradis , the Hurricanes announced Thursday .
Tlusty has seen his time in a Leaf uniform dwindle since he broke into the lineup for 58 games back in 2007 - 08 .
The 21 - year - old only suited up for 14 contests in 2008 - 09 and two so far this season .
In 2007 - 08 , he scored 10 goals and added six assists .
He has n't scored an NHL goal since then .
With the AHL's Toronto Marlies , he has eight goals and seven assists in 19 games this season .
" This trade gives us an opportunity to pick up a young , skilled forward who is further along in his development , albeit still in the development phase , " Hurricanes general manager Jim Rutherford said in a release .
" We feel that Jiri has a chance to be with the Hurricanes sooner than Philippe , who is a good , but still very young , prospect . "
The Czech was selected in the first round , 13th overall , by Toronto in the 2006 NHL Draft .
He 'll be assigned to the Hurricanes ' AHL affiliate , the Albany River Rats .
Paradis , 18 , was picked by Carolina in the first round of the 2009 draft , 27th overall .
The six - foot - two , 205 - pounder who hails from Dolbeau , Que. , is with the Shawinigan Cataractes in the QMJHL , where he has eight goals and 11 assists in 26 games this season .
The questions still NOT being asked by the media ...

Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the corporate " mainstream " media make quite a pair .
We 're hearing a very " balanced " debate over whether KSM should be tried in New York City , and whether the most insane objections to that proposal are really insane or not .
But what are we not hearing ?
We 're not hearing that trying criminals for the crime of 9/11 ought to have been what we did years ago , rather than waging wars in response to a crime .
We 're not discussing the possibility that had alleged 9/11 criminals been tried years ago rather than being imprisoned and tortured together with hundreds of innocents depicted as subhuman monsters , the " war on terror " might have been replaced with simply the wars on Iraqis and Afghans and Pakistanis .
What effect might that have had on Americans ' willingness to surrender their Bill of Rights ?
We are n't hearing about that .
And that 's only the tip of the iceberg about what we 're not hearing ...
Aside from a column by my friend Ray McGovern , not of course published by the corporate media , what are we hearing or seeing about KSM 's motive ?
Is n't motive a traditionally important element in a criminal investigation ?
We 're told that putting KSM on trial would give him a platform for propaganda , but we 're not told what that propaganda might be .
If it were really so pernicious , why not expose it and refute it ?
Is n't that what societies that believe in free speech do with misguided speech ?
Do n't they defeat it with more and better speech ?
Or is that only when it can be done without using the word " Israel " ?
Outside of progressive blogs , we 're not hearing that giving a somewhat fair , if less than speedy , trial to those most likely to plead guilty or be convicted , and a less fair military trial to others , and no trial at all to others still , reveals this show of justice to be a sham .
If KSM were acquitted , President Obama would order him imprisoned outside the rule of law until he dies .
If he is found guilty , as everyone universally expects , he may be officially murdered by the United States , motivating others to take up arms against a nation that wages and funds illegal wars , imprisons people without charge , tortures , kidnaps , renditions , and executes .
If the justice system is bent to ensure that KSM is convicted or permitted little opportunity to speak , will that bending have any permanent repercussions for our justice system ?
Or , to move in the other direction , having determined that " military justice " is not good enough for alleged mass murders , must we continue to pretend that it is good enough for members of the military ?
Can we not admit everyone into a single and improved justice system ?
We 're not hearing that discussion .
An improved justice system would require the admission into court of videos of all confessions and interrogations .
This would not include admissions made to a journalist prior to imprisonment , as in the case of KSM and Al Jazeera , but would include all interrogations since that time .
And in KSM 's case it might include video of the " interrogation " of his children .
Years ago , allegations were made that the United States had tortured his children , including in little - heard - of manners , such as locking a child in a box with a supposedly deadly insect .
More recently , secret memos emerged showing the United States to have authorized just those techniques .
If this were a story about missing sex tapes , the media would be all over it .
A story about the possible torture of children is far less interesting .
It might open up difficult questions , such as whether someone who has been endlessly tortured , and whose children may have been tortured , can --- while still in the custody of the torturers --- give an un-coerced confession .
Questions might even have to be asked about leniency in sentencing for someone who has already served time and been horribly tortured .
If this were a story about a singer or actor or athlete , we 'd see investigations of the time KSM spent attending college in North Carolina .
Why did n't the Americans he lived among persuade him of how horrible it would be to murder people in this country ?
Our media pundits are completely incapable of asking such a question without either blaming KSM's American acquaintances for his crimes or declaring KSM to be an inscrutable monster whose thinking is of absolutely no interest .
Other questions might be asked as well , such as why Dick Cheney and his supporters never talk about the two memos anymore .
Remember the two memos that Cheney claimed would show that the torture of KSM and others revealed important information that saved lives ?
The memos are now public and show nothing of the sort .
Nor was torture needed in order to prosecute KSM himself .
In fact , as Marcy Wheeler has pointed out , the ability of the government to prosecute him without using evidence obtained through torture demonstrates that torture was not needed for that purpose .
But why are we not talking about the two purposes torture actually serves ?
We know it does not produce useful information , but we also know that it produces desired lies , such as agreement to false rationales for war .
And we know that it scares people , both people who fear they might be tortured and people who fear the wild beasts depicted as reachable only through torture .
As Glenn Greenwald has touched on , behaving as though terrorized , irrationally unable to believe an alleged terrorist can be held in a cell and tried in a court , is to give in to the terrorism .
Worse , it is to advance it .
More Americans are more terrorized following TV discussions of KSM 's possible prosecution than were beforehand , because the voices on the TV promote the terror rather than the prosecution .
We are hearing about the need to avoid evidence obtained through torture .
But at the same time we are hearing absolutely nothing about the need to prosecute the torturers and the creators of the torture program , at least one of whom , John Yoo , is given a platform as one of the disinterested media commentators in the MSM .
This failure is an ideal way to create more KSMs .
Why do n't we talk about it ?

When British Foreign Secretary David Miliband uttered a few words regarding the illegality of the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank , many wanted to believe that London was taking a sharp stance against Israel ’s continued violations of international law .
Alas , they were wrong .
The fact is Miliband ’s statement , made during a press conference that followed talks with Jordan ’s King Abdullah II , in Amman , was merely tactical , aimed at lessening the negative impact of the feeble position adopted by Washington regarding the same issue .
This is what Miliband had to say : " Settlements are illegal in our view and an obstacle to peace settlement in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
The settlements challenge the heart of ... a Palestinian state .
" But then , he added : " It 's so important for all those who care about security and social justice in this region that discussions about borders and territory are restarted in a serious way , because if you can progress on border and territory , you can resolve the settlements issue .
" This is classic Miliband .
While his clear and decisive statement regarding the illegality of the settlements and the fact that their construction is an obstacle is to be welcomed , one cannot decipher a politician ’s statement in increments ; to be truly appreciated , they must be understood as a whole .
The danger lies in Miliband ’s follow up statement , where he purposely changed the order of the proposed solution to the Middle East crisis to be " discussions about borders and territory are restarted in a serious way " , which means unconditional negotiations , because " progress " at that front would " resolve the settlements issue .
" But is n't this the exact type of dialogue that Israel wishes to take part in : peace talks with no conditions , no deadline and no specific end , while it persists in building its illegal settlements in flagrant violation of international law , unabated ?
More , is n’t this what Palestinians , all Palestinians , have vehemently rejected ?
The Palestinian leadership understands that unconditional negotiations will yield Palestinians , the weak party in any negotiations , nothing but further humiliation , while the strong party will determine a solution , any solution , it finds suitable to its interests .
Considering that Israel is under no serious pressure , but occasional lip service to the peace process , from Washington , and London , the rightwing government of Benjamin Netanyahu has no reason to stop , or even slow down its illegal settlements project and the subsequent ethnic cleansing of Palestinians .
Miliband is a clever politician .
Although his words reek with contradictions , they are stacked in such away to give the impression that a substantive policy change is in fact in the making .
Miliband ’s supposedly strong statement on the settlements came at a time that the Obama Administration ’s policy , a meager attempt at presenting itself as the antithesis to the hated George Bush legacy , is falling apart .
In May , following President Obama ’s first meeting with Netanyahu , US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton wanted to leave no doubt regarding the US new policy on settlements .
The US " wants to see a stop to settlements – not some settlements , not outposts , not natural growth exceptions .
" This sounds great , even better than Miliband ’s recent statement .
But since then , the Obama Administration has obviously discovered the limits of the " audacity of hope " : a strong , unified pro-Israel lobby , decisively rightwing Israeli government , a unified US Congress backing Israel ’s every move , a wishy - washy international community , fragmented Muslim and Arab countries , and all the rest .
Therefore , it was no surprise to see Mrs. Clinton , during her recent Middle East trip backtracking on every promise that her government had made .
She " claimed ( on November 1 ) that halting settlement building had never been a pre-condition to resuming talks , " reported The Times .
Worse , not only did she fail to convince Netanyahu of the US position , which was more or less consistent with international law , she commended him for failing to meet what was once considered a strong US demand .
The switch happened during her recent tour ’s one - day visit to Jerusalem .
" What the Prime Minister ( of Israel ) has offered in specifics of restraint on the policy of settlements ... is unprecedented , " she said of Netanyahu ’s dismal promise to slow down settlement activities in the West Bank .
There are over 500,000 Jewish settlers in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank , living in many settlements that are all considered illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention and numerous UN resolutions .
To add insult to injury , Mrs. Clinton , continued , at every stop , to demand Arabs and Muslim to reach out to Israel .
What has the latter done to deserve any Arab or Muslim normalization , open markets and establishment of diplomatic ties ?
Why should Israel be rewarded for its massacres in Gaza , entrenching of its military occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem , the consistent attacks on al - Aqsa Mosque and more ?
Concurrently , the Palestinian Authority is , perhaps , realizing its error of trusting that the Obama Administration ’s resolve would prevail over Israel ’s obstinacy .
Top PA official Nablil Abu Rudeinah said that the " negotiations are in a state of paralysis , " blaming both " Israeli intransigence and America ’s back - pedaling .
"
“ There is no hope of negotiations on the horizon , " Abu Rudienah added .
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat ’s words , during a press conference in Ramallah , in the West Bank , on November 4 , were gloomier , however .
It maybe time for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to “ tell his people the truth that with the continuation of settlement activities , the two - state solution is no longer an option , ” he said .
He said what many do n’t want to hear , including Miliband himself , who insists on breathing life into an outdated ‘ solution ’ , while doing nothing to turn it into reality .
“ It 's important we do n't lose sight of the importance of a two - state solution for all peoples of the region .
I think the alternatives are dark and unwelcome for all sides , ” Miliband said .
He failed , however , to enlighten us on how his ‘ bright and welcomed ’ solution is to be realized , as Israel continues to seize Jerusalem and the West Bank , inch by inch and house by house , in front of international media and with the knowledge and subtle agreement of ‘ back - pedaling ’ politicians , Mrs. Clinton and himself included .

Nothing in the images is Photoshopped , but someone watching Dr. Terren create the images would see something quite different than the image itself .
Rather than a fiery display of colorful plumage , a passerby would see two minutes of intense sparking at the coil while Dr. Terren scrambled about switching filters on the camera from green to yellow to red and so on while gradually raising the rod atop the Tesla coil .
But when the camera shutter finally snaps shut 120 seconds later , what 's captured is the bright white light , filtered into Christmas wavelengths .
DENVER 
A college student who bid on and won more than $ 1.8 million in federal oil and gas leases last year without the intent or ability to pay will not be allowed to argue in court that he acted out of necessity to protect the environment , a federal judge ruled on Monday .
The student , Tim DeChristopher , 27 , an economics major at the University of Utah , faces up to five years in prison and huge fines on each of two felony charges  making false statements and interfering with an auction  arising from the sale last December in Utah .
He has said he believed the looming dangers of climate change and environmental impact from drilling were so great and urgent that he had no choice but to take whatever action he could to stop the drilling program .
His lawyer , Ronald J. Yengich , recently asked that the jury be allowed to consider a defense of necessity , or “ choice of evils , ” when the trial begins , perhaps early next year .
But Judge Dee Benson said in his ruling that Mr. DeChristopher had not met the threshold requirements under federal law .
On 21 September 2004 , Michelle Weinberger woke up on the 79ft powerboat that she and her husband , Mark , owned as it rocked gently in the waters of a marina on the Greek island of Mykonos .
" I put my hand on his side of the bed , and I remember feeling it empty , " she later told the US television channel NBC .
Weinberger leapt from bed in alarm to find that her husband had vanished , taking with him his passport and money he had stashed secretly on board .
It was the beginning of a five - year flight from justice that ended this week even more strangely than it began , almost 6,000 feet up in the Italian Alps .
Two officers of the paramilitary Carabinieri , led by a mountain guide , trudged up to the southern slopes of Mont Blanc to find one of America 's most wanted fugitives living in a tent .
He was surviving in temperatures as low as - 18C on dried and tinned food and snow he melted on a portable stove .
Dr Mark Weinberger , a 46 - year - old ear , nose and throat specialist , was tonight in a secure ward at the Molinette hospital in Turin recovering from a wound he sustained when he tried to take his own life at the Carabinieri station in Courmayeur , below Mont Blanc .
The US authorities have 40 days in which to apply for his extradition .
He faces trial on 22 counts of healthcare fraud , having previously been indicted by a grand jury .
Brought up in a prosperous New York suburb , Weinberger was educated at the University of Pennsylvania and the UCLA medical school .
He later worked with one of Chicago 's most renowned plastic surgeons before opening his own practice , the Weinberger Sinus Clinic , in Merrillville , Indiana .
The " nose doctor " , as he came to be known , met his future wife , 12 years his junior , in 2000 .
" He just swept me off my feet , " she said .
" He was the kindest , most gentle man I had ever met . "
Weinberger proposed to her eight months later in a Rome piazza while on holiday , and they were married in characteristically ostentatious style in three separate ceremonies in the US and Italy in 2001 .
Michelle Weinberger later said she reckoned her husband was earning $ 200,000 ( £ 124,000 ) a week , performing between seven and 15 operations .
They owned a house in a wealthy lakeside neighbourhood of Chicago .
Mark Weinberger travelled to and from his surgery in a chauffeur - driven limousine .
He employed maids , cooks , a personal trainer and a skipper for his boat .
Every month , his wife recalled , he would take 10 days off to enjoy his seemingly abundant income , often jetting off to Europe to indulge a passion for idling in the Mediterranean .
The first hint of trouble emerged in October 2002 when a lawyer acting for the estate of a woman who had died of throat cancer filed a complaint with the Indiana department of insurance .
The complaint claimed Weinberger failed to diagnose her cancer and instead carried out an unnecessary operation on her sinuses that was paid for by her insurance company .
The lawyer said he was subsequently contacted by dozens of the doctor 's former patients who alleged that they too had had surgery they suspected was unnecessary .
A similar complaint was filed by a second attorney on behalf of 25 former patients .
As the malpractice suits piled up , Weinberger arranged what he said would be a very special 30th birthday party for his wife .
He flew her , her mother and three friends out to the Greek islands and promised her a present that would be " something that only the movie stars have " .
Before disappearing , he bought her two expensive diamonds .
It was small recompense , though , for what she was about to discover .
The unpaid berthing fees on Mykonos alone came to $ 40,000 .
Their boat was seized by the Greek authorities .
Weinberger 's practice owed $ 5.7 m and was eventually auctioned to meet his debts .
But the oddest discovery , and one that perhaps holds the key to his life on the run , was that the doctor had a room at his clinic which his employees dubbed " the scary room " .
It was crammed with survival gear .
And the equipment , including even a water filtration system , had been shipped to Europe before he left .
The fugitive surgeon was sought by the FBI .
He featured more than once on the Fox television show America 's Most Wanted , and was supposedly sighted as far away as China .
His wife continued to defend him after he vanished .
" I hope he 's safe , and I still love him , " she told the Chicago Tribune in October 2004 , adding : " We can relocate .
We can live on an island in a hut . "
The Carabinieri who lifted the flap of Weinberger 's tent on Tuesday morning had been alerted to his presence by a mountain guide , an Italian police official said .
They did not immediately reveal that they suspected his identity .
They said they had used an excuse to convince him to accompany them to Courmayeur and that Weinberger tried to persuade them he just " wanted to live a life in the wild " .
After it became clear that they knew who he was , the runaway doctor asked to go to the lavatory .
There , he whipped out a tiny knife he had secreted in his underwear and plunged it into his throat .
But despite being an expert surgeon , he missed the artery he appeared to be aiming for , and the Carabinieri hustled him away for first aid .
But when they heard what the caller had to say , they broke down in tears , hardly able to believe their ears .
He was a mysterious , high - rolling Las Vegas gambler who had been choosing needy families to give them his winnings .
" You have been chosen , " the voice told the Keglers .
" I 'm flying you to Vegas , and I 'm going to win your money for you . "
What followed seemed like a dream .
A stretch limousine to the airport , first - class flights and a Rolls Royce to their 8,000 square - foot suite in the Palazzo hotel .
There , Mr Kegler , 48 , and his wife , 29 , were met by their benefactor , who promptly staked huge amounts of his own money in a marathon card session .
Proposal Circulates on New Civilian - Military Agency
Created : November 03 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Stuart Bowen , the U.S. special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction ( state.gov )
As the United States ’ special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction , Stuart Bowen has blown the whistle on millions of dollars worth of waste , fraud and abuse .
But one of his final acts in the job will be to address something more fundamental : the way U.S. civilian officials interact with their military counterparts during the complex wars of the future .
Bowen , acting with the institutional power of his government office , SIGIR , is circulating a draft proposal to create a new civilian office for wars like Afghanistan and Iraq that would report jointly to the Departments of State and Defense .
In a dramatic departure from the current ad hoc arrangement , where diplomats and aid workers come up with on - the - spot arrangements to liaise with the U.S. military in war zones , Bowen believes that a single agency , which he analogizes to an “ international FEMA , ” ought to be the single civilian point - of - contact with the military if the United States is to avoid future wartime coordination fiascoes .
He calls it , in typical Washington acronym-ese , USOCO – the U.S. Office for Contingency Operations .
[ Security 1 ] Bowen explains that the proposal grew out of seeing millions wasted in Iraq , and tracing the problems back to fundamental weaknesses of coordination and operational management .
“ As the U.S. reconstruction effort in Iraq demonstrated , when everyone is in charge , no one is in charge , ” Bowen writes in a 27 - page paper he has passed to the Obama administration about the USOCO proposal that The Washington Independent obtained .
The proposal was subject on Monday to a so - called “ murderboard ” of criticism at the Center for Complex Operations — one of the many ad hoc government institutions that have sprung up since the Afghanistan and Iraq wars to try to compel civilian officials to interact more closely with the military .
Experts and practitioners have lamented that in both Afghanistan and Iraq , no single individual or institution has the power to direct civilian efforts in reconstruction , economic development and political stabilization , even though the military says that its efforts will not be successful unless those tasks are met .
The result has been impromptu arrangements with different federal agencies , unclear mechanisms for accountability — and years of deterioration in both wars .
“ With an ad hoc structure , you lack the formalized approach that you need to be able integrate those [ civilian ] capabilities with military power , ” said Lt. Col .
Steve Leonard , who wrote the Army ’s field manual on stability operations , in an interview .
“ It ’s the lack of that bureaucratic structure we ’re all used to that makes it so difficult to point a finger , say ‘ I need this , ’ and get a response . ”
Bowen believes the USOCO could play that bureaucratic role .
It would “ solve the unity of command problems encountered in Iraq and Afghanistan with respect to relief and reconstruction operations , ” his paper reads , by creating a “ permanent , fully accountable , empowered interagency management office . ”
It would take “ full responsibility for managing the relief and reconstruction component ” of a future war and would report jointly to both State and the Pentagon .
With “ total accountability for ” the relief and reconstruction budget , it would manage all personnel used for such an operation “ except for any uniformed personnel normally answerable to the combatant commander and Foreign Service personnel answerable to the Chief of Mission , ” the deputy to the ambassador in a U.S. embassy .
Working on the proposal for months with his deputy , Ginger Cruz , Bowen keyed in several Obama administration officials to the USOCO idea .
His idea has made its way to the State Department ’s Policy Planning office , where it is being considered by staffers working on a major review of U.S. diplomacy and development policies .
At the Pentagon , the proposal has been briefed to aides to Michele Flournoy , the undersecretary of defense for policy , who worked on issues surrounding the integration of civilian and military efforts in warfare for years while out of government .
And at the White House , it has been given to Gayle Smith , the senior staffer in charge of development policy at the National Security Council .
Representatives for those agencies either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment on the record .
SIGIR , the office of the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction , is nearing the end of its life as the U.S. winds down its military presence in Iraq .
In an interview Monday , Bowen said that he did n’t want the USOCO proposal to be seen as SIGIR ’s legacy .
“ It ’s not so much what we want , ” he said .
“ We ’re just offering our observations for how overseas contingency operations are managed . ”
Cruz said the “ easy part ” of SIGIR ’s job was to call out waste , fraud and abuse on specific Iraq contracts .
“ It ’s making recommendations on solutions that ’s difficult , ” she said , saying that it was natural for SIGIR to move from specific criticisms of poor program management to a broader critique of the poor civilian - military coordination that led to wasted taxpayer money .
“ The important role for SIGIR to play is the objective oversight partner that doesnt have a dog in the fight , and does not have to align its views with the State Department and DOD . ”
The informal civilian - military coordination system criticized by Bowen is being applied for Afghanistan by Richard Holbrooke , the Obama administration ’s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , who has assembled a staff from across the government that works on Afghanistan / Pakistan issues .
Yet Holbrooke has no direct authority to deploy diplomats , development experts , legal advisers or other civilians into Afghanistan , nor to direct them when they ’re on the ground .
Nor does Gen. StanleyMcChrystal , who wrote in his famous assessment that his efforts leading the U.S. war in Afghanistan “ cannot succeed without a corresponding cadre of civilian experts , ” have a civilian counterpart whom he can directly ask to provide those civilian experts .
In a briefing last week , Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew said that the State Department was moving aggressively to fill nearly 1000 civilian positions for Afghanistan by the end of the year , but it ’s unclear if the deadline will be met .
Bowen said bluntly that he wants the USOCO structure ” to be used in Afghanistan , ” or at least for the government to address several points raised in his paper about joint civilian - military coordination , budgeting and accountability .
While his office ’s mandate has never extended beyond Iraq , Bowen said he was “ continuing to carry out our oversight mandate , as defined by the Hill , as to how the U.S. is structured to carry out ” its role in stability operations like those in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The position is not without problems , some of which Bowen acknowledges in his proposal .
The State Department “ regards decisions affecting a host nation to be squarely within its traditional area of responsibility , ” the proposal states , and the Defense Department “ might resist a new entity that would exert decision making power ” over reconstruction money spent by on - the - ground military commanders .
And “ the creation of a new governmental agency is always controversial and subject to resistance . ”
Some of those criticisms arose at Monday ’s murderboard session , according to participants , which was attended by about 50 representatives of the Defense Department , Joint Staff , USAID employees , Hill aides and retired diplomats .
Jeremy Pam , a former Treasury Department attache in Baghdad , attended the session and said Bowen ’s USOCO proposal received a “ respectful hearing , ” but not a full endorsement .
“ Some people expressed skepticism about how much appetite there was for creating a new organization , ” said Pam , who left the Treasury Department in 2007 and now works for the U.S. Institute of Peace .
Cruz said that USOCO — which , as outlined in the paper , will command “ a small permanent staff ” — does not represent the sort of bureaucratic entity that could spur a turf battle from wary agencies .
“ The proposal SIGIR is making is not infringing on anyone ’s turf , ” she said .
“ It ’s an inter - agency solution that ’s subordinate to and organic of State and Defense .
That ’s integral . ”
Bowen said the “ very helpful comments ” at the murderboard session will help “ evolve ” the proposal in advance of circulating a new draft of his paper to State , USAID and the Pentagon later this month before formally submitting it in December to the House and Senate committees for government oversight , foreign affairs , armed services and appropriations .
“ It provided us exactly what we wanted : a good , solid critique , ” he said .
Leonard , who has pushed the Army to embrace working with civilian diplomats and development professionals from his position as chief of initiatives at the Combined Arms Center at Ft. Leavenworth , saw promise in Bowen ’s idea .
“ With respect to the civilian expertise that ’s so critical to this , this is how you realize the comprehensive approach , ” Leonard said .
“ There ’s great capability in the military side .
But the real keys to sustainable development over the long term is resident in the civilian component .
On the surface of it , it looks like this is the vehicle to do that . ”
Pam is n’t as convinced .
“ The advantage of it is , in theory , it gets at the coordination problem , which is one of the fundamental issues , ” he said .
“ But you have to stipulate an awful lot : the existing players who are involved in this , not only in foreign affairs [ agencies ] but domestic as well , have to be ready to give up authorities , budgetary and otherwise .
Two , you have to assume that the political leadership will use a new entity like USOCO , which is a kind of technocratic solution that makes sense on paper , but it will not necessarily involve people who political officials trust to do the right thing . ”
Even if Bowen and Cruz do n’t wish USOCO to been seen as SIGIR ’s legacy , Cruz tied the proposal back to SIGIR ’s fundamental mandate .
“ It ’s about economy , efficiency and effectiveness , ” she said .
“ Every day we sit here , millions of dollars continue to go in these operations , and the outcomes become more critical .
Are doing this most effectve way ?
The body of work SIGIR produced clearly says we ’re not doing it in the best , most efficient way . ”

Jupi - also named in local media as Jupi Angootealuk - had been on a polar bear hunting trip with his 67 - year - old uncle , Jimmy Nakoolak , since last Friday .
They had left their snowmobile and stepped onto the sea ice when it cracked and floated off , Canada 's newspaper reported .
The ice cracked again the next day , separating the uncle and his nephew .
They were reported missing on Saturday , prompting a search operation .
Rescuers found the uncle on Sunday morning close to shore , Mr Zebedee said .
" He was all soaked and wet and started crawling at least two miles on his knees because he was so tired and it was hard for his legs , " Jerry Panniuq , the local mayor who spoke to Mr Nakoolak in hospital , told .
By Sunday , the sheet of ice Jupi was on had drifted four kilometres from the shore when he spotted three polar bears , an adult and two older cubs .
" Polar bears are the only animal that will definitely stalk a human and eat them .
Nobody goes out on the land here without a gun , " Mr Zebedee told the .
Jupi had a gun and , in self - defence , authorities say he was forced to shoot the adult bear .
On Sunday , pilot Phil Amos spotted the teen on the ice patch and circled him for about 40 minutes , but Jupi did not wave at all , perhaps fearing it might provoke the two cubs .
" I do n't think he really wanted to move because the bears were so close , " Mr Amos told local media .
" I kind of flew down to see if I could get the bears to move away , but they were very adamant about sticking around their mum . "
While the air crews were able to drop Jupi some chocolate and an emergency kit containing torches , darkness set in before they could rescue him and the teen was consigned to another freezing night on the ice sheet .
The need to suspend the search because of darkness has now prompted calls for infrared sensors to be installed aboard Canadian search aircraft .
At daybreak on Monday , an aerial search team spotted Jupi again and parachuted down to rescue him .
Authorities were amazed at his condition .
" Even after spending hours alone , huddling in temperatures that dipped below - 15 degrees , the teen appeared to be in decent shape .
He was conscious , slightly hypothermic and appeared to have some frostbite , " Canadian rescue official Jean - Pierre Sharp told the .
Rob Hedley , senior administrative officer at Coral Harbour , told Canadian TV : " It 's quite incredible that he 's in such good shape .
As much as the polar bear is a bit of a dramatic aspect of it , he had his weapon with him , thank goodness .
" But also it 's basically surviving three days out on the land with little food or water .
I was expecting this not to end as happily as it did . "
There was a similar happy ending in the the same region about a year ago , when Australian Oliver Edwards - Neil survived 18 hours floating on a sheet of ice after his plane crashed .
The 25 - year - old survived without food or water in - 20 degree temperatures , and was aware of the threat of attack by polar bears but , unlike Jupi , did not confront any .
" We saw a couple of seals in the morning ... apparently there are polar bears but thank God we did n't see them , " Mr Edwards - Neil said last year .
Mr Edwards - Neil , and his flying partner who was stranded with him , ended up hopping from one ice - sheet to another in a bid to reach land before they were rescued by a fishing vessel .
Jupi's amazing survival was described as " bittersweet " by Joan Griffin , general manager of the aviation company that first spotted him , as two cubs had been left orphaned while a young man had been found alive .
" That 's the glory of the Arctic , " she told .
" A 17 - year - old young man and he 's seasoned enough that he was able to save his own life - so very resilient .
" It is amazing . "

Who has n't dreamed of having a mystery - story - style secret passageway ?
While a trick bookshelf is pretty awesome in itself , this secret passage hides a home office with clever style .

Lifehacker reader agmk and his girlfriend hated the look of their cluttered home office and computer den .
It seemed like even when the rest of their place was clean , their home office was always a little bit too messy .
In an effort to make it easier to hide the nook that served as their home office they turned some Ikea bookshelves they scored off Craigslist into a pretty awesome office - concealing secret doorway .
Here 's some photos of a bookcase - door I built with my girlfriend .
It hides the computer area from the rest of the living area , and makes our place feel much classier ( when closed ) .
Its built with Ikea bookshelves and common hardware - store components .
We used two Ikea Billy Bookshelves , and built a ' skateboard ' out of casters and some pressed board for the moving shelf to sit on .
Then hinged them together , laid out some hardwood for it to roll on , and there you have it .
The bar we also built , and it 's angled so as to make the door flush when closed without any collisions while opening

On top of solving their problem creatively , they did it cheaply and without having to make any lease - violating modifications to their apartment .

Andy McCarthy ;
One week ago , President Obama quietly signed an executive order that makes [ INTERPOL ] immune from the restraints of American law .
[...]
Interpol 's property and assets are no longer subject to search and confiscation , and its archives are now considered inviolable .
This international police force ( whose U.S. headquarters is in the Justice Department in Washington ) will be unrestrained by the U.S. Constitution and American law while it operates in the United States and affects both Americans and American interests outside the United States .
Interpol works closely with international tribunals ( such as the International Criminal Court — which the United States has refused to join because of its sovereignty surrendering provisions , though top Obama officials want us in it ) .
It also works closely with foreign courts and law - enforcement authorities ( such as those in Europe that are investigating former Bush administration officials for purported war crimes — i.e. , for actions taken in America 's defense ) .
Why would we elevate an international police force above American law ?
Why would we immunize an international police force from the limitations that constrain the FBI and other American law - enforcement agencies ?
Why is it suddenly necessary to have , within the Justice Department , a repository for stashing government files which , therefore , will be beyond the ability of Congress , American law - enforcement , the media , and the American people to scrutinize ?

Goldman always wins
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein
P.T. Barnum , the great American circus showman , may or may not have actually said of his customers , “ there ’s a sucker born every minute , ” but it ’s a maxim that could just as well have applied to the recent financial crisis .
I ’m reminded of the apocryphal quote after reading Gretchen Morgenson and Louise Story ’s somewhat convoluted , but nonetheless interesting report in today ’s New York Times on how the investment bank Goldman Sachs allegedly played both sides of the market for mortgage - backed securities and is now being scrutinized by various regulators looking to determine whether any laws or industry rules were broken :
While the investigations are in the early phases , authorities appear to be looking at whether securities laws or rules of fair dealing were violated by firms that created and sold these mortgage - linked debt instruments and then bet against the clients who purchased them , people briefed on the matter say .
One focus of the inquiry is whether the firms creating the securities purposely helped to select especially risky mortgage - linked assets that would be most likely to crater , setting their clients up to lose billions of dollars if the housing market imploded .
Some securities packaged by Goldman and Tricadia ended up being so vulnerable that they soured within months of being created .
I ’m no lawyer , but my take is that it ’s not Goldman ’s fault if its customers were suckers ; the bank correctly saw that the U.S. housing sector was headed south and adjusted accordingly , while less prudent financial institutions were still making big bucks on complex securities tied to mortgages and could n’t wean themselves away in time to save themselves from disaster .
As the firm ’s spokesman says in the story , it ’s not like these customers , pension funds and insurance companies , were rubes who did n’t know what they were getting into .
They were sophisticated financial players looking for high returns and willing to take risks .
Still , Goldman stands accused of some breathtakingly cyncial behavior here : selling products it did n’t believe were worthy investments and then betting against them .
It ’s as if McDonald ’s were caught investing in defibrillators and plus - size clothing companies .
Nobody can deny , however , that Goldman made very smart moves and has come out far ahead of its competitors .
One thing I ’m struck by in recent accounts of the financial crisis is the extent of “ Goldman envy ” among other Wall Street firms .
Executives at J.P. Morgan , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , Bear Stearns , Morgan Stanley , and other big banks were obsessed with emulating Goldman ’s huge profits and resented its employees ’ reputation for being the smartest , boldest players on Wall Street .
In some cases , the interfirm jealously was kind of like that of the character Jan on The Brady Bunch ; just replace “ Marsha , Marsha , Marsha ! ” with “ Goldman , Goldman , Goldman ! ”
Yet somehow , with the possible exception of J.P. Morgan , which avoided the worst of the mortgage junk thanks to smart risk management by CEO Jamie Dimon , the other banks did n’t follow Goldman ’s lead when in December 2006 the firm turned bearish on the mortgage sector .
Why did n’t they catch on ?
UPDATE : Be sure to read Felix Salmon ’s informed analysis .
Money quote :
The real lesson here is n’t that Goldman did anything scandalous .
It ’s just that if you ’re making a bet and Goldman is your bookmaker , do n’t be surprised if you end up losing .

SKIP WESTCOTT
Real Name : Steven " Skip " Westcott
Identity / Class : Human pedophile
Occupation : High School student ( as of over a decade ago )
Enemies : Young Peter Parker and any other child
Known Relatives : Unnamed parents ( divorced )
Aliases : " Wescott " ( mispronunciation by May Parker )
Base of Operations : New York City , probably in the general vicinity of Spider - Man 's childhood home in Forest Hills
First Appearance : Spider - Man/ Power Pack #1/1
( 1984 ; Co-published by Marvel Comics and the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse )
Powers / Abilities : None , although Skip was intelligent enough to engage honor student Peter Parker in hours of discussion about " all of life 's important problems . "
History : ( Spider - Man / Power Pack # 1/1 [ fb ] )
When he was around twelve or so ( at least old enough to walk home from school by himself ) , Peter Parker met an older student named Skip Westcott in the public library ; Skip seemed impressed by Peter 's studiousness , nicknaming him " Einstein , " and the two boys became friends , which pleased Peter 's Aunt May , who'd been concerned that her nephew spent too much time alone .
Peter and Skip were frequently alone at Skip 's housewhile Skip 's mother was at work , and one evening Skip showed Peter some pornography , then suggested that they " conduct a little experiment " and " touch each other like the people in that magazine . "
Peter was appalled but " too frightened to leave . "
Following this , Peter stopped spending time with Skip , and when his Aunt May and Uncle Ben questioned him about it , he told them what happened .
( Spider - Man / Power Pack # 1/1 )
Years later , in his Chelsea apartment , Peter overhears his young next - door neighbor Tony Lewis resisting the " advances " from his babysitter Judy .
As Spider - Man , he knocks at the Lewis window , causing Judy to flee , and he persuades Tony to tell him what happened .
When Tony admits that Judy was touching him in wrong ways , Spidey assures
Tony that he's not to blame for the situation and tells the boy his own story ( without giving his real name , of course ) .
Spider - Man then swings
Tony across town to the party that his parents are attending , where he tells them what happened and is comforted by them .
Spidey swings back home , satisfied that he has helped the boy and successfully confronted one of his own personal demons .
Comments : Created by Jim Salicrup , Jim Mooney , and Mike Esposito .
The flashback in this story is a far cry from any other tale of Peter Parker 's childhood , such as those seen in the Minus - One issues or Fred Hembeck 's " Petey " humor features ; since Spidey admits that he was too scared to leave when Skip made his advances , the implication is that the older boy actually did molest Peter , making him one of the earliest villains that Peter ever encountered , and an all too realistic one .
Although Spider - Man admits ( to the readers ) that his unwarranted shame over this part of his past has haunted him for years , this is apparently the only Spider - Man story in which Skip has ever been mentioned or where it has ever been stated or even implied that Spider - Man was molested as a child .
Spidey also notes that it was only when he helped Tony that he realized that he was n't to blame for Skip 's actions , which is not inconsistent with the hero 's notorious tendency toward taking unwarranted responsibility upon himself .
Some readers may care to theorize further on how this incident might have shaped the character of Marvel 's star super - hero .
Skip is carefully portrayed as being several years older than the pre-teen Peter , perhaps to prevent any implication that Skip was a gay youth attracted to Peter as an equal ; evidently Jim Salicrup felt that Aunt May and Uncle Ben would 've been concerned from the outset about an adult man befriending their nephew .
However , bizarrely enough , Skip 's white hair and kindly demeanor make him come across as sort of a young Uncle Ben , which must have made the experience even more traumatic ; in more recent years , there were rumors that the Spider - Man writers were going to reveal that young Peter had been molested by Uncle Ben himself , but this appalling notion was fortunately never explored .
Skip 's fate following Peter 's revelation is not revealed ( Similarly , Judy vanishes from the main story . ) ; one would presume that the Parkers at least spoke to Skip 's mother about her son's crime , but the story rightly chooses to focus on not the perpetrators but the victims of child molestation and how they should react .
Spider - Man / Power Pack # 1 also includes a Power Pack story by Louise Simonson in which Jane , a friend of Julie ( Lightspeed ) Power , admits to being molested by her father .
Both stories involve no comic - book elements other than the heroes themselves , presumably out of concern that any use of super - villains , supernatural beings , or the like would detract from the very real evil of child molestation .
Spider - Man and the members of Power Pack do not themselves interact in the issue , although they are seen together in a " Tips on Ways to Prevent Sexual Abuse " ad that appears on the issue 's back cover and throughout several Marvel issues of the 1980s .
I found another child abuse special where Skip was mentioned and confirmed that he went all the way .
However , this special is of dubious canonicity , since Spider - Man breaks the fourth wall .
( Is a battle with the Hobgoblin the time to talk to the camera about child abuse ?
Would the Hobgoblin ever talk that way ? )

Mary M. of Cooking with the Junior League sent me a link to amalah.com , where you will find images from a 1962 textbook titled When You Marry ( you can find the full text of the 1953 edition without photos here , and Larry found a full pdf of the 1962 edition here ) :
The book covers many aspects of dating and marriage and provides some fascinating insights into gender roles and social assumptions of the time .
Here are some useful facts about social classes and families that you might like to know :
Working class people go to work sooner ?
Wow .
Weird .
But at least they have fewer troubles than the middle class .
There are so many irritations you have to face when you are n’t poor , but at least you “ weather ” them well .
I may use this as an example of pointless graphs :
Here we have a list of some factors that are favorable , unfavorable , or unimportant for marital success ; I ’ve circled some of the more noteworthy items in red :
Text I highlighted :
[ favorable ] Happiness of parents ’ marriage — both ( Not true for Negro couples ) [ unfavorable ]
Combinations where man feels inferior and woman does not Prone to argue points –wife Determination to get own way –wife Wife ’s cultural background higher than husband ’s Residence in the city during childhood
So you ’re sure to have marital problems if the wife wo n’t give in on things and instead keeps being all argumentative and wanting her own way .
I ’m not sure what defines a cultural background as “ higher ” than others , but we see here the same pattern as we do with social class ( which I presume is related to cultural background ) : it ’s ok for men to “ marry down , ” but women are n’t supposed to .
The textbook provides a pretty grim depiction of sex for a newly - married couple :
I found this little gem in on a page from the section on how ideals of marital life often do n’t fit with reality :
It ’s so widespread to think of marketing and advertising as manipulative today ( even among those who like at least some ads or do n’t see a real problem with them ) that it ’s striking to see such a sincerely positive portrayal of it as a helpful , even “ kind ” industry .
It is noteworthy that the textbook , used during the height of the “ Leave it to Beaver ” “ traditional ” family era , depicts the male - breadwinner / female - homemaker family form as a recent creation , as wives became “ expensive luxuries ” :
This section describing which women should work does n’t seem to speak highly of women overall , since just a “ few ” of us have “ special talents and skills . ”
However , it does make the point ( in # 5 ) that “ a woman is not unemployed because she is not paid for her work , ” an effort to bring attention to the value of women ’s unpaid labor ( in this instance , community / volunteer work ) :
And then there is a helpful discussion of eugenics and good breeding :
There ’s a lot to ponder there .
I think it ’s fascinating the way that it illustrates some of our stereotypes about the 1950s / 60s ( women are supposed to be mothers , sex outside of marriage is bad , etc. ) but contradicts others ( the male - breadwinner family is n’t a long - standing “ traditional ” family but rather one they can clearly trace to the recent past , and which even then seemed like it might not last ) .
UDPATE : Larry looked through the pdf version of the whole book and found this nice cartoon :
On the very day that the Senate passed its watered - down Health Care Reform Bill , Vic Chesnutt decided to end it all , taking an overdose of muscle relaxants and leaving behind a note .
For anyone who has enjoyed his music , this is a very sad Christmas .
I wish I could say that Vic Chesnutt is the final victim of the current American health care " system " , but the battle ahead of us is far from over .
If you ever want to check out his music , his catalogue of albums is beautiful and impressive .
For Leonard Cohen fans in particular , I recommend his album arranged by Van Dyke Parks , " Ghetto Bells " as a starting point .
R.I.P. Vic .
I never met you , but it saddens me greatly that our great nation did not have a program in place to help you through your darkest hours .
To his friends and family , I ( and I hope others here also ) offer heartfelt condolences .
We have unfinished business here , folks .
Let 's get the current HC bill fixed and passed .
Do it for Vic .
And Ted .
As well as for everyone else you know who needs medical help and cannot receive any because of the current system .
Peace be with you .
ClimateGate as Rorschach Test
In the 10 days since we first blogged about “ ClimateGate ” — the unauthorized release of e-mails and other material from the Climate Research Unit ( C.R.U. ) at East Anglia University in Norwich , England — it ’s become strikingly clear that one ’s view of the issue is deeply colored by his or her incoming biases .
No surprise there , but still , the demarcation is stark .
One of the best indicators : when you stumble onto a blog post about the topic , you can tell which way the wind is blowing simply by looking at the banner ad at the top of the site : if it ’s for an M.B.A. in Sustainable Business , you ’re going to hear one thing about ClimateGate ; if the ad shows Al Gore with a Pinocchio nose , meanwhile — well , you get the idea .
Those who feel that global warming is the most pressing issue of our era , a potential catastrophe that needs to be addressed by governments around the world as soon as possible , generally argue that ClimateGate is a tempest in a teapot — little more than the sort of academic infighting and nasty language you ’d find by raiding any academic ’s hard drive ; that if the aggrieved climate scientists seemed to be stonewalling , it was out of aggravation with the disruptive tactics used by some global - warming skeptics who are probably funded by the oil industry ; that the scientists who wrote potentially incriminating e-mails represent just a few of the thousands of scientists who have contributed to the global - warming literature ; and that , if anything , climatologists need more support in the future to fight off skeptics ’ attacks .
This camp wonders why there has n’t been more outrage about the fact that the C.R.U. material was illegally obtained .
The other side , meanwhile , cries “ Remember the Pentagon Papers ! ” while also positing that the C.R.U. “ hack ” may have in fact been the work of an internal whistleblower who was distraught that scientific fraud was being perpetrated .
This second camp feels that the C.R.U. material proves what they ’ve been arguing all along : that the threat of global warming lies somewhere between exaggeration and hoax ; that it is a conventional wisdom produced by an alarmist cabal of climate scientists whose research has set the agenda of the U.N. ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( I.P.C.C. ) ; that the e-mails prove the scientists have been manipulating climate data , bullying anyone with dissenting views , and encouraging one another to delete incriminating evidence that might be gained under a Freedom of Information Act request ; and , most ominously , that a long document called HARRY_READ_Me , which at this point appears to be the four - year work log of one Ian ( Harry ) Harris , a C.R.U. research staffer , seems to suggest that the C.R.U. ’s underlying global - temperature data were an absolute mess .
This camp also feels that the mainstream media has underplayed ClimateGate — although this view is probably now fading .
In just the past few days , there has been a ton of coverage .
Still , they complain that the major American TV networks are ignoring the story , leaving it to Jon Stewart to break the news .
I wo n’t steal Stewart ’s thunder except to say that he now apparently believes that rising sea levels are caused by “ God ’s tears ” :
But if you want a really good example of how deeply polarized the issue is , take a look at these TV exchanges .
In the first , George Will says the C.R.U. material shows the scientists “ suppressing criticism , gaming the peer - review process , and all the rest , ” while Paul Krugman states “ There ’s nothing in there ” :
And in this conversation between Stuart Varney and Ed Begley Jr. — well , hold on to your hat :
Many blogs covering the topic are just as bombastic .
The most prominent blogs in the arena , however , tend to be less so .
That said , emotions still run high — particularly in the comments sections .
If you feel like wading into the conversation , you might wish to sample Dot Earth , Watts Up With That , and RealClimate , which presents “ climate science from climate scientists . ”
The discussions at RealClimate are intense , for at least two reasons : they are more about the science itself than the conversations at other blogs ; and several of its contributors are the very scientists whose e-mails were among the C.R.U. leak , including Michael E. Mann , director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State and one of the scientists responsible for the now - famous “ hockey stick ” graph , which has been widely used as evidence of a dangerous global - warming trend .
Mann has not blogged at RealClimate since the C.R.U. data were released .
His most recent post , strangely enough , was headlined “ Climate Cover - Up : A ( Brief ) Review , ” but he was referring to global - warming skeptics ’ “ disinformation campaigns ” against legitimate climate science .
He has , however , given a few interviews ( see here , for instance ) .
Meanwhile , Penn State ’s college paper , the Daily Collegian , reports that Mann is the subject of a university inquiry into whether he “ fabricated or manipulated data on global warming . ”
And Mann seems to be distancing himself from Phil Jones , the director of the C.R.U. and the scientist who is at the very center of the scandal .
Jones , it should be noted , has temporarily stepped down from that position while his actions are being investigated .
So how will ClimateGate affect future climate research and , importantly , climate legislation ?
I think the best answer is that it ’s far too early to say .
Despite the rather dramatic early response to ClimateGate , one senses that there are many other shoes to still be dropped .
Many parties will be poring over those documents in the weeks and months to come .
Already , however , the scandal has entered the political arena .
Just yesterday , at a Congressional hearing on “ The State of Climate Science , ” Rep. James Sensenbrenner ( R - WI ) “ called for an investigation of the e-mails , ” according to NPR , saying that “ at worst , it ’s junk science and it ’s part of a massive international scientific fraud . ”
In Australia , meanwhile , the government ’s anticipated plan to set up a cap - and - trade system — seen as a strong down payment toward further such legislation at the U.N. ’s upcoming climate - change conference in Copenhagen — was unexpectedly shot down .
If you concur with the Telegraph‘s James Delingpole — whose first article on Climategate began “ If you own any shares in alternative energy companies I should start dumping them NOW ” — this was but the first political defeat the scandal will produce .
As for the central scientific issue here — that the most prominent climate scientists ’ computerized models may be neither as robust nor as predictive as many people think — that is something we write about in some detail in SuperFreakonomics .
Passages like the following have won us a few detractors in certain quadrants of the climate - research community :
The current generation of climate - prediction models are , as Lowell Wood puts it , “ enormously crude . ” …
“ The climate models are crude in space and they ’re crude in time , ” he continues .
“ So there ’s an enormous amount of natural phenomena they ca n’t model .
They ca n’t do even giant storms like hurricanes . ”
There are several reasons for this , [ Nathan ] Myhrvold explains .
Today ’s models use a grid of cells to map the earth , and those grids are too large to allow for the modeling of actual weather .
Smaller and more accurate grids would require better modeling software , which would require more computing power .
“ We ’re trying to predict climate change 20 to 30 years from now , ” he says , “ but it will take us almost the same amount of time for the computer industry to give us fast enough computers to do the job . ”
That said , most current climate models tend to produce similar predictions .
This might lead one to reasonably conclude that climate scientists have a pretty good handle on the future .
Not so , says Wood .
“ Everybody turns their knobs ” — that is , adjusts the control parameters and coefficients of their models — “ so they are n’t the outlier , because the outlying model is going to have difficulty getting funded . ”
In other words , the economic reality of research funding , rather than a disinterested and uncoordinated scientific consensus , leads the models to approximately match one another .
It is n’t that current climate models should be ignored , Wood says — but , when considering the fate of the planet , one should properly appreciate their limited nature .
So if what we ’re all really after here is “ a disinterested and uncoordinated scientific consensus , ” what is the current route to that goal ?
It is hard to think that the I.P.C.C. wo n’t think twice about every research paper it considers in the future .
If the entire enterprise has been tainted — a big “ if ” — who will , or should , be leading the charge toward producing scientific research wherein every cloud formation does n’t look like just another Rorschach blot ?
Dec 13 , 2009
Giorgio Gilestro takes issue with Willis Eschenbach 's attack on the credibility of the adjustments at Darwin .
One should , he says , look at the big picture , and proceeds to an analysis of the adjustments showing that they are normally distributed and average to zero ( i.e. there are as many upward adjustments as downwards ones ) .
Hooray !
says RealClimate author Eric Steig in the comments :
This is a very nice analysis , and is really the last word on this entire fabricated scandal .
The last word ?
Not so , says Climate Audit regular , retired statistician Roman M , who produces this rather amazing graph of how the adjustments pan out over time .
WASHINGTON–Long - awaited talks are underway .
Weapons inspectors are waiting in the wings , poised to return .
Failing that , the probability of biting international economic sanctions against Iran 's nuclear ambitions now is higher than ever .
But very quietly last week , even as U.S. President Barack Obama unexpectedly won the Nobel Peace Prize , the Pentagon won approval to speed up development of a sobering Plan C – a behemoth bunker - busting bomb designed to punch deeper and blow bigger than anything previously available in America 's daunting military arsenal .
The so - called Massive Ordnance Penetrator ( MOP ) will weigh in at a whopping 13,600 kilograms , a nearly threefold increase over its predecessor and so heavy it will require a B - 2 for delivery .
The Pentagon did not name Iran in citing an " urgent operational need " for the weapon .
But military analysts see Tehran 's nuclear facilities , including the newly disclosed and deeply buried installation near the city of Qom , as the prime impetus for a laser - guided bomb with a capacity to penetrate and plunder targets 60 metres underground .
U.S. Congress approved an additional $ 64 million for the procurement of four such MOPs , which , if dropped sequentially on the same co-ordinates , could alter a military equation that has long vexed U.S. and Israeli planners .
But the issue remains fraught with questions that even a bomb as big as this is unlikely to answer , experts on the Iranian file agree .
And most categorize the new bomb as a remote , and thus far unproven , fallback plan that simply fills out the suite of options for a global effort to secure a peaceful compromise .
" The possibility of a military attack is not high , but anyone who thinks it is zero would be mistaken , " said political analyst and author Meir Javedanfar , a Tel Aviv - based scholar born and raised in Iran .
" The best hope remains that the Iranian leadership will see the peaceful deal that Obama is presenting : Iran can have nuclear energy and excellent relations with the West , " said Javedanfar , director of www.middleeastanalyst.com.
" If they go the other way and decide to hunker down in the face of sanctions and continue to strive for a nuclear weapon , it will be terrible for the Iranian people .
A few years from now the regime could resemble Pakistan – poor , unstable , isolated but having the bomb .
And as we see in Pakistan , having a nuclear weapon does nothing for the people .
This is not the legacy that the Iranian leaders want . "
A ground war over the issue has never been more than an extremely remote possibility , not least because the U.S. has neither the blood nor the treasure to expend after nearly a decade of mobilization on the dual fronts of Iraq and Afghanistan .
And military analysts are quick to point out that the new MOP bomb , even if it could reach its assigned target , would almost certainly destabilize the region in risky and unpredictable ways , with a more deeply isolated Iran in a position to retaliate by proxy , possibly by feeding insurgencies in the wars that flank its eastern and western borders .
Israel , which continues to cling to a strategy of nuclear ambiguity , neither confirming nor denying the existence of what is understood to be a fully developed nuclear weapons program , has lately tamped down talk of a pre-emptive strike against Iran .
Analysts there say the latest developments , including an emerging international consensus for hard sanctions if soft diplomacy fails , has all but assured Israel will not act militarily on its own .
" It is now almost impossible for Israel to carry out military strikes against Iran without American consent , " said Ephraim Kam , deputy head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University .
" Even in light of this new American bomb , which remains unproven and still under development , we are in a delicate moment where there is a growing international consensus toward the threat of harsh sanctions to persuade Iran the price of building a bomb is just too high , " Kam told the Star .
" We should know by the end of the year how Iran intends to play this .
But the bottom line ( is ) that the military option moves farther back as the chances of strong sanctions grow . "
But in a conflict where big overtures and big threats go hand in hand , the development of bigger bombs are seen by many as inevitable , if only as a measure of additional deterrence .

" All of these pieces are interconnected , from the building of international consensus for sanctions to the gathering of better intelligence on the ground to the development of new military options , " said Javedanfar .
" The Bush era is behind us , and clearly the Americans no longer feel the only solution lies in threats and military force .
But just as clearly , the Obama era will not be one where the Iranians can delay and delay indefinitely .
There is a compromise on the table that I really hope comes together .
In the next few months we should know . "
Durham police last week put the final nail in the coffin of the Home Office mantra " nothing to hide , nothing to fear " , with a clear announcement that DNA and fingerprinting could harm an individual ’s career prospects – even if they are otherwise totally innocent .
The warning came in a press release relating to mephedrone , which began by establishing that the substance remains legal to possess – until the government determines otherwise – but illegal to sell for medicinal purposes .
The release observes that " its chemical formula is one molecule different to ecstasy and as such dealers are claiming is not a controlled substance . "
This would in fact make mephedrone a different chemical substance from ecstacy – in much the same way that carbon monoxide is not the same as carbon dioxide - and therefore clearly not a controlled substance , irrespective of claims made by dealers .
However , it is in police remarks relating to the consequence of possessing mephedrone that the greatest concerns are to be found .
Barnard Castle - based Inspector Kevin
Tuck is reported as saying : " In Durham police have taken a stance and anyone found with it will be arrested on suspicion of possession of a banned substance . "
He adds : " They will be taken to a police cell , their DNA and fingerprints taken and that arrest , depending upon enquiries , could have serious implications for example on future job applications " ( our italics ) .
We asked Durham police for clarification of what possible serious implications there could be for an individual found in possession of a legal substance who had their fingerprints or DNA taken .
It was speculated that perhaps some employers would ask prospective job candidates about details not merely of convictions , but of all contact with police – and therefore having DNA taken could adversely affect job prospects for that reason .
However , we have had no official response to our inquiry and remain as baffled as the Home Office , who are still sticking to their line that DNA testing in and of itself can have no consequence for an individual .
A Home Office spokesman said : " Employment checks are not linked to the DNA database and employers cannot check if a potential employee is on the DNA database .
" As we announced last month in our proposals for DNA retention , the police would be required to remove DNA profiles from the database after six years if the person was not subsequently convicted .
" Under the exceptional case procedure , an individual can apply to their police force to have their DNA removed .
This will be decided by the chief constable , and the criteria for that application are for the first time set out in statute in our proposals . "
Therefore , the official line continues to be that DNA testing is an innocuous process and , as ever , " if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear " .
Whether the police should have any role at all to play in the regulation of a legal substance is an interesting question : defendants of the police role ( pdf ) in this would point to the fact that as well as upholding law and order , local police forces are tasked with " keeping the Queen ’s peace " , as well as " protecting , helping and reassuring the community " .
Pending explanation from Durham , however , it would seem to be the case that the belief exists amongst some middle - ranking officers that a DNA test does have consequences ; or , if it does not , that there is sufficient uncertainty amongst the general public for the threat of a test to have some weight in enforcing a " stance " taken against a currently legal substance . ®
If anyone needs indirect evidence of a " mysterious force " that has been forcing the market away from normal behavior for the seventh month in a row now , one simply needs to look at the dramatic continuing underperformance of quant factors , which in turn force quant models to generate false signals and result in major pain for these traditional allocators of capital and market buffers .
Quant models , which rely on a statistically " normal " market , are terminally broken , best visualized by YTD drubbing of traditional market natural and L/S indices .
But do n't take our word for it .
For the latest on this ongoing phenomenon , and for what is probably a good representation by proxy of the mysterious permabid phenomenon ( call it however you will ) , we present excerpts from the latest institutional letter by Matt Rothman , head of U.S. Equity Quantitative Strategies at Barclays .
This month ’s performance for quantitative factors was unsettling .
All three of our Quantitative Themes markedly underperformed .
Market Sentiment was down - 2.1 % .
Quality was down - 3.1 % .
And Valuation was down - 3.6 % .
While we have seen bigger monthly moves in these themes in recent years , the fact that all three of these themes underperformed significantly at the same time is noteworthy .
Indeed , this simultaneous underperformance of all our themes suggests to us that a disruption may have been ( or still is ) occurring in this space .
This sobering thought has me searching for the appropriate words and so I find it necessary to turn to my truest and most reliable muse but I am still struggling to find the most appropriate reference .
Is it best to paraphrase the opening of Side 1 of Darkness on The Edge of Town – that is the song , Badlands ?
Or is better to allude to the eerily appropriate last song of the vastly underrated and misunderstood Nebraska album – that is , Reason to Believe ?
Or still yet , is it the newest Springsteen song which world - premièred Wednesday night at the Meadowlands , where yours truly was privileged enough to be among the lucky people standing inches from the stage as The Boss belted out , for the first time , Wrecking Ball ?
But to be clear , we do not want to belittle the seriousness of the situation .
This month marks the 5th out of 7 months that our long / short strategy has underperformed .
Our trailing 12 month performance number is sobering even if driven primarily by our performance in April 2009 .
And that a potential disruption in the space could still be so pernicious with quant aum down as much as we estimate it to be over the past 2 + years , well , that is not comforting either .
And while the current situation is very reminiscent of August 2007 in that it generated major underperformance for quants , at least that period managed to rectify in a very short period of time , granted accompanied by a violent swing in the market .
The fact that we are now in month 7 of ongoing quant underperformance , without any notable public implosions should raise red flags .
One explanation , the one that Zero Hedge has been promoting , is that as traditional L/S and M/N quants have been redeemed and otherwise slighted , other new players have muscled in and taken their spot : most notably incipient market structure monopolists such as Goldman Sachs .
We have searched for prior occasions where we have seen rolling monthly simultaneous underperformance of a similar magnitude .
There were few instances of analogous behavior : August 1958 ; October / November 1974 ; May / June 1993 ; May 2001 ; October , November and December 2001 ; November 2002 ; and May / June 2003 .
Notably , August 2007 was not a comparable period as the model misbehavior was short - lived and self - corrected quickly .
In a number of these periods , there was no active quantitative money management community – computers , while invented , were rare and quite expensive in the early periods – and so it is important to recognize that these disruptions can clearly have a variety of sources .
Or one major one ...
And probably the most relevant observation from Rothman , highlighting that even as the status quo presumably persists , the likelihood of major shifts behind the scenes becomes greater and greater .
Then again , as BGI is in the process of being transferred to BlackRock , the last thing the financial community needs is awareness of major unwinds occurring under everyone 's noses .
Equally importantly , we have still not been able to find any direct evidence of an unwind .
Based on our conversations with the Barclays Capital trading desks and with numerous clients , we have no direct evidence to support that an unwind has been happening .
Like others , we have seen the press reports that a major pension manager was significantly restructuring their allocations to outside managers , particuliarly portable alpha ( quantitative ? ) managers .
We would only be speculating to think this was the cause of quantitative model misbehavior into the quarter end .
Yet , this hypothesis does not strike us as entirely unreasonable either .
We just do n’t know .
But we sure can observe our model ’s behavior which is certainly abnormal .
As Evidence A of " abnormal behavior " and what are likely major ongoing redemptions , be it in portable alpha or otherwise , please see the YTD performance of the HFRX Equity Market Neutral Index : down - 6.3 % through 9/30 .
But at least all other pro cyclical indices are performing well , alas not well enough for them to pass their high water mark yet .
Just ask New York headhunters how many hedge funds are actually hiring .
One of the City 's leading financiers last night predicted a looming collapse of financial confidence in Britain as Gordon Brown received the twin blow of a fresh warning from a ratings agency over the budget deficit and figures revealing that the slump of the past 18 months is now officially the deepest since the second world war .
Terry Smith , chief executive of money brokers Tullett Prebon , said : " We will have a crisis of confidence in the credit worth of the UK .
People wo n't be willing to buy gilts at anything like the current interest rate , or even possibly in this currency and we 'll have an interest rate hike and / or a good , old - fashioned sterling crisis .
Possibly both . "
Smith 's comments on Sky News came just hours after ratings agency Fitch said that the UK – along with France and Spain – needed to " articulate more credible and stronger fiscal consolidation during the course of 2010 to underpin confidence in the sustainability of public finances " .
Failure to do so , the ratings agency added , would greatly increase the chances of a debt downgrade , which would increase the cost of servicing the national debt .
Earlier , the Office for National Statistics released data showing that Labour 's attempts to boost growth had taken the edge off the recession in the third quarter but were not enough to prevent the slump extending into a record - breaking sixth quarter .
Confirmation that the UK is the only G20 nation still in recession sent the pound tumbling to a two - month low against the dollar , with sterling dipping below the $ 1.60 level after the ONS announcement .
Ministers will now have to wait until the next set of growth figures are published in late January before receiving evidence that their attempts to boost activity have worked .
Public investment in buildings helped provide the biggest boost to construction output for more than six years , while the " cash for clunkers " scheme led to a pick - up in demand for cars .
Downing Street was last night taking comfort from evidence that the recession during 2009 has not been as deep as was feared at the turn of the year .
One source said cuts in borrowing costs and active use of tax and spending policies had helped underpin the economy .
When accompanied by individual measures such as an expansion to the programme to find work for the unemployed , tax credits to top up incomes where people needed to reduce hours , limit the scale of repossessions .
He said : " Labour and housing markets behaved much better than expected , and significantly better than in the 1980s and 1990s recessions , and confidence has not hit the lows one might have feared . "
The City had been hopeful that encouraging news from the construction sector and for investment would result in the ONS revising away its estimate of a 0.3 % drop in gross domestic product in the three months to September , but gloomier news from manufacturing and services resulted in only a limited reassessment .
Officials said they now estimated that the economy contracted by 0.2 % in the third quarter after a drop of 0.7 % in the three months to June .
The ONS said that new data showed that the UK had performed worse than originally believed , leaving the economy 5.1 % smaller at the end of the third quarter of 2009 than it had been a year earlier .
Since the start of the downturn in early 2008 , GDP has dropped by 6.03 % , marginally worse than the 6 % fall during the manufacturing slump of 1979 - 81 .
Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury , Philip Hammond , said : " Gordon Brown 's claim to be leading the world out of recession rings hollow as the evidence mounts that his policies have failed .
We need a change of direction to deal with mounting debts , and provide the confidence that the British economy is lacking . "
Jonathan Loynes , chief European economist at Capital Economics , said : today 's GDP figures were " a touch disappointing " in the light of figures last week showing a sharp upward adjustment to investment in the third quarter prompted by a 10 % jump in government capital expenditure .
" The figure has gone up from an original estimate of a - 0.4 % drop , and may yet go up further in future releases .
But this will make little difference and will leave the UK still looking weak compared to its major competitors . "
Figures for American GDP were revised down for a second time today .
Originally , Washington said the world 's biggest economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5 % in the third quarter but last month cut the estimate to 2.8 % .
Today , officials announced that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 % .

When looking at a foreign country 's gross domestic product , it 's worth asking how the figure is calculated , since not everyone plays by American rules .
Consider oil - rich Venezuela .
Its central bank reported Tuesday that the country 's economy shrank 4.5 % in the third quarter , according to a blog by Daniel Molinski in The Wall Street Journal .
It continues :
" ' We simply can't permit that they continue calculating GDP with the old capitalist method , ' President [ Hugo ] Chavez said in a televised speech before members of his socialist party .
' It 's harmful . ' ... " ... [ Chavez ] said the weak economic growth numbers are mostly the result of ' capitalist calculations ' that do n't give proper credit to economic activity in a socialist setting . "
Chavez also acknowledged oil 's role .
If you 're thinking of investing in Venezuela or already own shares in energy companies that do business there -- like Total ( NYSE : TOT ) , Chevron ( NYSE : CVX ) , Statoil ( NYSE : STO ) , or BP ( NYSE : BP ) -- you have to ask yourself what the president 's comments mean .
Scroll down and sound off in the comments box about whether there 's likely to be a refiguring of GDP that takes better account of socialist programs , and what that might mean for the economy and foreign companies .
DALLAS -- Dallas Cowboys officials are still interested in bringing the Floyd Mayweather - Manny Pacquiao fight to Cowboys Stadium , multiple sources close to the football team and fight officials told ESPNDallas.com on Saturday night .
Promoter Bob Arum expects to settle on a site by next week .
While Las Vegas is the front - runner , Arum claims it still might be Dallas .
The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones offered to pay $ 25 million as a site fee .
" I 'm working really hard to bring the fight down to Dallas , " Arum told ESPNDallas.com .
The Top Rank boss spoke glowingly of Jones and his willingness to outbid Vegas for what might be the richest fight in boxing history .
" I know Texas people , and I know that a first proposal does n't mean it's the final proposal , " Arum to the Associated Press .
" I 'm saying that Dallas is a real live possibility , and I have a fiduciary responsibility to Manny Pacquiao to get him the most money . "
Arum also expressed frustration Saturday night with Golden Boy 's Richard Schaefer , who assists Mayweather Promotions , for canceling a trip to Dallas because he does n't want the fight in Jones ' opulent stadium .
The Dallas bid was thought to be nearly dead after Schaefer skipped the trip on Wednesday to scout for Mayweather .
But Arum , speaking after Top Rank fighter Lamont Peterson lost his 140 - pound title shot against Timothy Bradley , insists Schaefer must consider Jones ' offer .
" I think everybody involved has an obligation to see , " said Arum , who has turned over the nuts - and - bolts negotiations to Top Rank president Todd duBoef because Arum gets too emotional .
Sources told ESPNDallas.com that Cowboys officials are prepared to seat approximately 9,000 fans on the football field and lower the video board , which is 90 feet above the ground , to close to 25 feet above the ring .
The fight could have a capacity of close to 100,000 fans .
" I know we can get the greatest offer in history from the Texas stadium , " Arum said .
" My position is whoever has the best deal for those two fighters , that 's where I want the deal . "
Cowboys spokesperson Brett Daniels said Saturday night the organization would n't have a comment .
However , Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said he 's interested in having the fight in Cowboys Stadium .
" I 'm willing to help in any way that I can , " Cuban said in an e-mail to ESPNDallas.com .
" I think it would be great for North Texas and Cowboys Stadium to host the fight .
I have a call in to Floyd and have offered my assistance .
We will see what happens . "
Arum might want this historic fight to happen in decidedly unhistoric Cowboys Stadium , or he might simply be attempting to leverage Jones ' bid against the MGM Grand to get a better offer from the best fight site in boxing 's capital city .
The MGM Grand likely could craft a bigger offer than $ 25 million based on closed - circuit tickets and the ancillary benefits of being in the gambling mecca , but the casino likely can't match the possible Dallas gate -- and Arum wants a guarantee .
" I 'm guaranteeing my fighter $ 25 million , " Arum said .
" I ain't going for pie in the sky on this . "
Calvin Watkins , who covers the Dallas Cowboys for ESPNDallas.com , and The Associated Press contributed to this story .
The blood brain barrier is generally considered an obstacle to delivering therapies from the bloodstream to the brain .
However , University of Iowa researchers have discovered a way to turn the blood vessels surrounding brain cells into a production and delivery system for getting therapeutic molecules directly into brain cells .
Working with animal models of a group of fatal neurological disorders called lysosomal storage diseases , the UI team found that these diseases cause unique and disease - specific alterations to the blood vessels of the blood brain barrier .
The scientists used these distinct alterations to target the brain with gene therapy , which reversed the neurological damage caused by the diseases .
The findings , which were published Sept. 13 in Nature Medicine 's Advance Online Publication ( AOP ) , could lead to a new non-invasive approach for treating neurological damage caused by lysosomal storage diseases .
" This is the first time an enzyme delivered through the bloodstream has corrected deficiencies in the brain , " said lead investigator Beverly Davidson , Ph.D. , UI professor of internal medicine , neurology , and molecular physiology and biophysics .
" This provides a real opportunity to deliver enzyme therapy without surgically entering the brain to treat lysosomal storage diseases .
" In addition , we have discovered that these neurological diseases affect not just the brain cells that we often focus on , but also the blood vessels throughout the brain .
We have taken advantage of that finding to delivery gene therapy , but we also can use this knowledge to better understand how the diseases impact other cell types such as neurons , " she added .
Lysosomal storage diseases are individually quite rare , but as a group they affect approximately 1 in 8,000 live births .
The diseases are caused by deficiencies in enzymes that break down larger molecules .
Without these enzymes , the large molecules accumulate inside cells and cause cell damage and destruction .

Enzyme replacement therapy has been successful in treating one form of lysosomal storage disease called Gaucher disease .
However , storage diseases that affect the central nervous system remain untreatable because it has not been possible , to this point , to get the missing enzymes past the blood - brain - barrier and into the brain .
" Our discovery allowed us to test the idea that the brain cells might be able to make use of the reintroduced enzyme to stop or reverse the damage caused by the accumulated materials , " said Davidson , who also is the Roy J. Carver Professor in Internal Medicine .
" In the treated mice , the affected brain cells go back to looking normal , the brain inflammation goes away and the impaired behaviors that these mice have is corrected . "
To develop their gene therapy targeting system , Davidson and colleagues used a technique called phage panning to identify peptides that hone in on the blood vessels surrounding the brain .
Surprisingly , they found that peptides that targeted the brain blood vessels in mice with lysosomal storage diseases were distinct from the peptides that targeted brain blood vessels in healthy mice .
Moreover , the peptides that targeted blood vessels in different diseases were distinct from each other , suggesting that each disease causes specific alterations to the blood vessels .
The team modified a deactivated virus used for gene therapy so that the virus expressed copies of the unique brain - targeting peptide on its outer coat , and also carried the genetic blueprint for the missing enzyme .
The study showed that the modified virus targeted the blood vessels in the brain and caused the blood vessel cells to produce the enzyme .
Most importantly , the researchers found that the enzyme was secreted into the brain tissue in sufficient quantities to correct the disease symptoms and problems .
The team was able to use this approach to treat two types of lysosomal storage disease in mice , suggesting that the approach could be used for other types of lysosomal storage disease and possibly other neurological disorders .
In addition to Davidson , the research team included UI postdoctoral researcher Yong Hong Chen , Ph.D. , and Michael Chang , M.D. , Ph.D. , who was a student in the UI Medical Scientist Training Program when the study was conducted .
The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health and from the Batten Disease Support and Research Association .

A CNN Special Investigation drills down on the causes and the impact of the Fort Hood shootings , at 8 p.m. ET Saturday on CNN TV .
FORT HOOD , Texas ( CNN ) --
The bumper sticker reading " Allah is Love " was torn off and the car was keyed .
A police report was filed in the August 16 incident involving Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan 's Honda , and a neighbor was charged with criminal mischief .
But what kind of impact that incident , and possibly others , had on Hasan remains a mystery .
While few official details have been released about Hasan , his family and others have given some insight into the man accused of killing 13 people and wounded 38 others in Thursday 's massacre at Fort Hood Army Post in Texas .
Relatives say Hasan , a U.S. - born citizen of Palestinian descent , was a " calm " individual who had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Others describe him as a vocal opponent to the war on terror whose rhetoric concerned colleagues .
The bumper sticker incident at Hasan 's apartment complex in Killeen , Texas , is the first known example of harassment that has surfaced since the shooting .
Apartment manager John Thompson said Friday that he reported the situation to police after the girlfriend of then - resident John van de Walker told him that he did it .
Thompson said he saw van de Walker apologize to Hasan and that a police report was filed .
He added that the bumper sticker said " Allah is Love " in Arabic , but that van de Walker knew that Hasan was Muslim before seeing it .
Thompson said the last time he asked Hasan about the incident , Hasan said he was still waiting for reparations for damage to his 2006 Honda Civic .
Efforts to reach van de Walker on Friday were unsuccessful .
Hasan 's cousin , Mohammad Munif Abdallah Hasan , said the Army major had wanted to leave the military because he felt disrespected over his religion .
" There was racism towards him because he 's a Muslim , because he's an Arab , because he prays , " the cousin said in a CNN interview in the Palestinian city of Ramallah .
" They used to see him dress in traditional Muslim clothing , so he was a bit irritated because of this .
Also , the fact that they wanted to send him to Iraq .
He decided to leave the Army for good and hire a lawyer because of this matter . "
" They would n't treat him as if he is one of them .
He was a major in the Army and other majors would n't treat him equally as a major should be treated , " the cousin said .
" ' Yes , you are a major in the U.S. Army , but you are still an Arab , a Muslim , you have your own traditions and values and we have ours . '
He was bothered by that a lot .
He was n't respected as he should have been . "
The cousin added that he wanted to leave the Army , especially after getting deployment orders .
Army officials have indicated that Hasan was to deploy to Afghanistan to work with a unit already there as part of behavioral health support .
It was n't clear when Hasan was scheduled to go overseas for what would have been his first deployment .
Dr. Val Finnell , a former medical school classmate of Hasan's , described him as " a very outspoken opponent of the war " in the classroom and in public settings .
" He equated the war against terror with a war against Islam , " Finnell said .
He added that he was shocked by Thursday 's shooting .
" However , that said , given the things that Maj .
Hasan has said to me in the past and to other people , I am not surprised . "
There are about 3,500 Muslims in the U.S. Army , less than 1 percent of the total number of soldiers .
The investigation into the shootings is ongoing , and Army officials have not indicated any evidence of Hasan being harassed among the ranks .
Hasan 's cousin said that despite the concerns over discrimination , a motive behind the shootings still was incomprehensible .
" If he had killed one or two , I could say that he was defending himself .
I could say that there could have been a problem between two sides which led to the use of weapons .
But for one to kill 13 people and injure more than 30 , I personally do n't think that it was because someone was bothering him .
There is a bigger reason that this happened and no ones knows it besides Nidal . "
Mohammad Hasan remembered his cousin's trip to Jerusalem , 6 miles from Ramallah , 15 years ago to learn about his roots .
" He acted normal . "
More recently , Nidal Hasan may have attended a lecture in January at George Washington University involving the Israeli ambassador to the United States and other officials discussing Israel 's offensive into Gaza last winter .
Video from the lecture shows a person who appears to be Hasan dressed in military fatigues seated in the audience taking notes .
In a statement Friday , Hasan 's family in the United States said , " We are mortified with what has unfolded and there is no justification , whatsoever , for what happened .
We are all asking why this happened -- and the answer is that we simply do not know .
" We cannot explain , nor do we excuse what happened yesterday .
Yesterday 's violence in no way reflects the feelings , beliefs , or principles of our family , " the statement continued , adding that the family is cooperating with authorities .
Hasan 's neighbors on Friday said he cleaned out his apartment the morning of the shootings and gave copies of the Quran to several residents .
His next - door neighbor , Patricia Villa , said he gave her his furniture and paid her $ 60 to clean his apartment hours before the shooting .
" He told me he was leaving for Iraq or somewhere , " Villa said .
" I did n't think much of it . "
Another neighbor , Willie Bell , said Hasan had helped him set up his laptop and regularly tapped into Bell 's wireless service .
Bell , a maintenance man at Fort Hood who did n't show up for work Thursday , said he was interviewed by the FBI for four hours that day and the laptop was seized .
He said he received two calls from Hasan early Thursday , one at 2:37 a.m. asking Bell to turn on the wireless service and again at 5 a .m. to say he was moving .
An owner of a 7 - Eleven convenience store at Fort Hood said Hasan , whom he knew as " Maj. Nidal , " came in for coffee and hash browns most mornings , including the morning of the shootings .
Surveillance video from the store obtained by CNN shows a man who the store owner said is Hasan at the cashier 's counter about 6:20 a.m. Thursday -- about seven hours before the shooting -- carrying a beverage and dressed in traditional Arab garb .
While the owner said he was too busy to chat with Hasan on Thursday , he said that through his brief talks with Hasan he learned the officer did n't speak Arabic well .
He added that Hasan did n't wear a wedding ring and joked several times about whether the owner knew a bride for him .
Hasan would also ask the owner whether he planned to attend Friday prayers , a mainstay of Islam , to which the owner would say that he was too busy .
Hasan was known to attend Friday prayers in Bethesda , Maryland , before he arrived at Fort Hood this year , said Imam Yahya Hendi , the Muslim chaplain at the National Naval Medical Center .
" I met him a few times and I saw him at services ... he appeared to be a very loyal American , " Hendi told CNN 's " Situation Room . "
" I know he told me once that he joined the military because he wanted to do something for America in the aftermath of September 11 .
" He also told me once that he believed that Muslims who speak a language of exclusivity should not have room in the Muslim community -- that we must reject them , " the chaplain continued .
" And that 's why for me , when I saw the footage yesterday about him , I said , ' Wait a minute -- is this the same guy I met a few years ago ? ' "
Movement ’s plans for 2010 put Republicans in a bind
In an effort to scuttle health reform legislation , the Tea Party movement is planning to storm Senate offices next week and launch a sit - in where protesters will pretend to be patients waiting for treatment at a government - run hospital .
“ The intention is to go inside the Senate offices and hallways , and play out the role of patients waiting for treatment in government controlled medical facilities , ” states an announcement on the Tax Day Tea Party Web site .
“ As the day goes on some of us will pretend to die from our untreated illnesses and collapse on the floor .
Many of us plan to stay there until they force us to leave . ”

Organizers made it clear the point of the protest is to demonstrate that the will of health care reform opponents is n’t weakening as the Senate inches forward on a compromise on health care .
“ Some [ senators ] are under the false impression that we ’ve given up and gone away just because they have n’t heard much from us in the past few days , ” the rally announcement reads .
“ And those senators who have not made a final decision on how to vote are in danger of leaning in the wrong direction .
We must remind them that our steadfast opposition to a government takeover of health care is as strong now as it has been all along . ”
The Washington Post on Thursday reported on an “ energized ” Tea Party movement ’s plans to challenge both Democratic and Republican candidates in the 2010 mid-term elections .
Buoyed by their success in capsizing a moderate Republican candidate this fall in Upstate New York , tea party activists and affiliated groups are unveiling new political action committees and tactics aimed at capitalizing on conservative opposition to health - care reform , financial bailouts and other Obama administration policies .
The goal is to harness the anger that led to hundreds of protests around the country from spring to fall , including a gathering of tens of thousands of protesters on the Mall in September .
Political observers have noted that the Tea Party movement could spell bad news for Republicans .
If the Tea Party movement succeeds in getting conservative Republicans elected in the primaries , the Republicans may have a harder time picking up the support of independent voters .
Or , as was the case in the special election for New York ’s 23rd congressional district this fall , Republicans could see the conservative voting base split between two candidates .

A Rasmussen poll released Monday shows a potential Tea Party beating the Republicans , with 23 percent support to the Republicans ’ 18 percent .
The Democratic Party was far ahead , with 36 percent support in the theoretical match - up .
The Post notes that Tea Party organizers are hoping to model their success on Barack Obama ’s online - based model of raising small donations from large numbers of supporters .
“ We ’re looking at the potential of raising small checks from a vast number of donors , just as Obama did , ” FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe told the Post .
“ We ’ve been studying everything about the Obama primary strategy , and I happen to think the Tea Party movement could make even the Obama grass - roots machine look obsolete . ”

But before the Tea Party can coalesce into a single political entity , it will likely have to pare down the number of independent groups behind it , and those groups will have to stop fighting amongst themselves .
The Post reports :
The tea party movement is splintered into hundreds of local and state - level groups that have differing rules and goals and for the most part have not participated in big - money politics .
Many of the groups have been torn apart by personal feuds in recent months ; one major umbrella organization , the Tea Party Patriots , has filed a lawsuit against a founding board member who signed on with a rival , the Tea Party Express .
In April , 29th , 1961 a doctor of the 6th Soviet Antarctic expedition Leonid Rogozov aged 27 felt pain in a right lower belly and fever .
The next day brought only exasperation .
Having no chance to call a plane and being the only doctor at the station “ Novolazarevskaya ” , at night , in April , 30th the surgeon made an appendix removal operation on himself using local anesthesia .
He was assisted by an engineer and the station ’s meteorologist .
In 1959 Leonid Rogozov graduated from the Institute and was immediately accepted to the surgery clinical residency .
However , his studies at the residency were broken off for some time due to Leonid ’s trip to Antarctica in September , 1960 as a doctor of the 6th Soviet Antarctic expedition to Novolazarevskaya station .
During this expedition there happened an event that made a 27 - year old surgeon world - famous .
In the 4th month of the wintering , in April , 29th , 1961 , Leonid showed disturbing symptoms : weakness , nausea , fever and pain in a right iliac region .
The following day his temperature got even higher .
Being the only doctor in the expedition consisting of 13 people , Leonid diagnosed himself : acute appendicitis .
There were no planes at any of the nearest stations , besides , adverse weather conditions would not allow to fly to Novolazarevskaya anyway .
In order to save the sick member of a polar expedition there was needed an urgent operation on site .
And the only way out was to operate on himself .
At night , on the 30th of April , 1961 , the surgeon was being helped by a mechanical engineer and a meteorologist who were giving him the medical instruments and holding a small mirror at his belly .
Lying half bent on the left side , the doctor made a local anesthesia with novocaine solution and made a 12 cm incision in the right iliac region with a scalpel .
Either watching in the mirror or by touch he removed an inflamed appendix and injected antibiotic in the abdominal cavity .
In 30 or 40 minutes from the beginning of the operation there developed a faint and giddiness and the surgeon had to make pauses for some rest .
Nevertheless , by midnight the operation lasting 1 hour and 45 minutes was over .
In five days the temperature normalized , in two days more – the stitches were taken out .
In the St. Petersburg Museum of the Arctic and the Antarctic there is an exposure of surgical instruments that Leonid Rogozov applied for this uneasy operation .
An astronaut - pilot of the USSR , a Hero of the Soviet Union , German Titov wrote in his book “ My blue planet ” :
“ In our country an exploit is life itself .
… We admire the Soviet doctor Boris Pastukhov , who injected himself with plague vaccine before applying it on the sick people : we envy the courage of the Soviet doctor Leonid Rogozov who made an appendix removal operation on himself in the hard conditions of the Antarctic expedition .
Sometimes I reflect upon this in solitude and ask myself if I could do the same and only one answer comes to my mind : “ I would do my best … ”
OVER THE TOP : SUPERTERMINATORS
J ames Cameron is known for his extremely realistic portrayal of the sci- fi characters and elements .
Just like he does with all of his creations , James Cameron carefully thought up the technical data and details for the Terminators to inject as much plausible reality into them as possible .
He was recently described as someone who does n't create science - fiction , but science facts .
His designs for the latest movie Avatar are so well thought up that some of the machines can actually work in real life .
T erminators were n't some kind of super strong robots .
That 's one of the reasons why the character did n't join other 80's cliché characters which nowadays seem ludicrous .
It was n't a big bad robot who could lift a car and would be immune to everything .
It was n't a comic book character .
It was n't The Incredible HULK .
It had thought and realism behind it .
Just like a machine of that kind would be , the Terminator does n't have any super strength .
It has a strength of a extremely strong man , but not something truly unnatural .
It can be hurt by the same things people can , but has an extra invulnerability .
It 's far from being over the top - it gets knocked down and hurt by large caliber guns and by car crashes .
Once the franchise had been bought and continued by other , unrelated to the franchise people , in addition to many other franchise related errors and inconsistencies , Terminators became something of an over the top cartoons .
Their strength not only contradicted the original movies but even contradicted what has been presented on screen by the same writers .
Everything is now over the top , with Terminators having Marvel superhero - like strength and ridiculous invulnerability , even making loud thumps when walking .
The first non-Cameron Terminator movie already took out all the realism possible associated with the franchise .
It placed Terminator movies in a fictional world .
Before , they were set in a real world - it could 've all really happen ( the events presented in the first two movies ) .
It was extremely clever for Cameron to " UN - date " the movies that would be dated in 1997 or 2029 .
It did happen , but it was prevented , that 's why you cant make the joke like " Ha , I do n't see any robots walking round annihilating human race " .
But when the bombs fell in T3 , the Terminator universe was n't set in real environment anymore , but in a fictional sci- fi world and became a pure fantasy with no link or reference point with the real world .
And that was the case with everything .
But here , we want to focus just on the inconsistency and over the top portrayal of the Terminators by John Brancato and Michael Ferris .
Some may say the differences in T3 is the upgrade in the T - 850 model , but is n't it a large stretch to just have an upgrade on a model and have it 10 times stronger and more powerful than the model of the same series ?
Or have it being stronger than more advanced models ?
Even if the difference in power could be explained with the slight model upgrade , the fact remains that the portrayal of the Terminators remains over the top and cartoonish , and there 's no explaining why the T - 800 in Terminator Salvation is even stronger than T - 850 .
PHYSICAL STRENGTH
In T2 , when Miles Dyson could n't open the small safe that held the key to the vault , the T - 800 could n't open it either .
The time was extremely valuable because the alarm has been triggered .
He was standing right next to them and did n't even try because he could n't .
Terminators were like humans , with just a small boost of strength and damage resistance that was given naturally by having skeleton built of metal instead of calcium .
In T3 , the T - 850 rips the small safe with one hand without even flinching .
Judgment : over the top
_____________________________________________________________
Like mentioned above , the Terminators in James Cameron movies were very strong but their strength was n't comic book like or over the top .
They were as strong as an extremely strong human being .
In the first movie , Matt puts on a fight against the T - 800 and holds up well for some time .
He pushes him , moves him and fights with him for a while , yet he 's a college bodybuilder .
In T2 , T - 800 is shown as putting a lot of effort to remove the metal plate covering the weapons pit .
It also took two hands for him to hold the Minigun
According to what is shown in T3 , there would be no human match for the T - 850 , not even for a split second .
He holds the Minigun with one hand and turns the car into harmonica with his punches .
Such strength would kill a man with one punch .
Not to even mention T - 850 kicking the ambulance like a toy .
If it was a big ambulance truck that gave in and not Terminator 's body , human being would stand no chance in pushing or moving the Terminator because it would be even harder than charging at the ambulance truck .

The Terminator could not get through the worn out , beaten up , old iron doors in the factory , held together with a pry bar .
It took him quite a while to just punch a hole in them so he can slip his hand in and open them from the outside .
Same in T2 .
The Terminator does n't even think about trying to take the steel doors .
He destroys them with the grenade launcher .
Terminator Salvation 's T - 800 is strong enough to punch a 4 " + thick door 5 meters away with one hand without putting any effort in it .
Judgment : over the top
_____________________________________________________________
In the first movie , the T - 800 is crushed by hydraulic press which had a pressure of 40 tons .
Novelization : hydraulic press slammed down with forty tons of pressure
The T - 850 holds heavier blast doors with one shoulder !
Not only that , but he also manages to hold , crush and defeat the T - X with the other free hand .
That 's a hell of an upgrade !
Most large blast doors work the same way , they 're pressed by hydraulic systems .
Smaller blast doors are more powerful than hydraulic press because their weight and mass is much bigger , so more powerful pumps are required to operate and control them .
Those huge hangar doors alone certainly weight much more than 40 tons since blast doors are filled with concrete and steel .
In addition to that , the weight has to be multiplied because of the hydraulic system pushing it down .
Blast doors with the size of the regular house doors can withstand 8000 pounds per square foot .
And we 're talking small , thin , house sized doors here .
Now look at those MASSIVE , thick hangar - like doors .
Since they 're blast doors , they 're filled with concrete and steel AND like mentioned before , in addition to that they 're pressed down by at least two hydraulic mechanisms .
The weight pressure is incredible .
Plus , we 're talking about doors that can withstand nuclear destruction , not some small factory pressing machine .
So the T - 850 can hold the blast doors with one elbow and then shoulder and easily overcome and defeat T - X with just one hand , which is puzzling .
T - X was not only suppose to be a newer and much stronger model , but she was also suppose to be an anti-terminator .
Yet , T - 850 was too strong for her and she could n't break free from his grip , she got her hand squashed like a bug by his hand and could n't even pull off his one hand with her two when he was pressing and holding the power cell in her mouth .
Judgment : way over the top
_____________________________________________________________
In T2 , T - 800 had to use a crowbar to break his arm to get free .
He knew his grip was n't nearly strong enough to just break or rip his superalloy arm .
In T3 , the T - 850 easily breaks T - X's hand , squashing it like a bug .
Not only he does that with no effort , but he's also crushing hand that was suppose to be made from even more advanced and stronger alloy !
Judgment : over the top
In Terminator Salvation the T - 800 snaps T - 600 in half with his bare hands .
INVULNERABILITY
The original T - 800 was knocked over by several blasts from a shotgun , and was even stunned and seriously hurt by it ( hand damage ) .
Same goes for the much much more advanced model T - 1000 who was composed of even more advanced alloys .
It was stunned by multiple shotgun hits from Winchester 1887 and by Series 70 slide Colt Commando CAR - 15 .
Also , in the first movie the T - 800 was blown in half by a home made pipe bomb .
In Terminator Salvation , T - 800 's resistance is brought to a completely ridiculous levels .
T - 800 took two direct hits from a grenade launcher , with no problems other than losing its flesh concealment .
He did n't even fall or lose balance , just leaned and instantly straightened up .
Judgment : way over the top
Another interesting thing is how both T3 and TS contradict each other as well .
Putting aside the fact that the T - 800 in Salvation is even more powerful than the T - 850 in T3 , it took multiple grenade hits in his torso yet the power cell was unaffected .
It 's also interesting that F&B Terminators can withstand a direct hit from a weapon DESIGNED to kill Terminators ( T - X's Plasma Weapon ) and be just knocked out by them for a minute , whereas JC Terminators can receive mild damage from small arms .
_____________________________________________________________
In T2 , the T - 800 completely melts under molten steel in seconds .
After just a secon , when his head goes under , he cease to function .
And the CPU is almost in the center of his skull and is the most guarded and safest part in Terminator 's body .
But the enormous temperature of the molten steel melts the entire skull instantly and gets to the processor within seconds .
Even the far more advanced and resistant T - 1000 blows into pieces when exposed to extreme temperatures .
In Terminator Salvation , The T - 800 is mostly unaffected by both molten steel and freezing .
When it comes to heat treating , one interesting problem with water cooling is that the water can end up turning to steam , producing pockets of gas that make it difficult to get a proper quench , since the air bubbles act as insulators preventing the heat from bleeding from the part fast enough .
There are limits to heat transfer in metals , too .
The larger the metal object , the longer it takes to heat up and the longer it takes to cool down .
Increasing surface area can help , which is how heat sinks do their job , but a stream of metal pouring out of an opening wo n't get that benefit .
Most of the mass of the liquid metal is not in contact with the air , meaning the heat has to disperse throughout the part as it cools .
Also , the air is going to rapidly heat up around the part .
As the air heats up , the rate of transfer drops .
And regardless of anything else , that metal was still glowing and it was still liquid when it hit the Terminator .
That means the stuff was still thousands of degrees in temperature .
And unless Skynet does n't believe in plastics , rubber , lubricants , hydraulic fluid , copper wiring , or other non-titanium materials in the construction of a Terminator , there are a lot of parts that could fail even if the chassis does n't .
The problem is n't so much with the Terminator not melting .
But warping or other moderate damage to the surface is expected , even though rightfully , thin parts with lots of surface area should have had problems .
And T - 800 broke its way out of solidified metal !
People can argue heat resistance all day long , but having the Terminator get trapped in the stuff while it was still solidifying , yet be able to break out after it cooled to maximum hardness is ....
If Terminators are really that tough , The Terminators on the assembly line could probably just crawl out of the wreckage of the base .
The " real " terminators from the original movies would have been twisted into an obelisk had it not just exploded in that situation .

_____________________________________________________________
In the first movie , the car crash seriously affects and knocks out the Terminator .
Novelization : Terminator 's vision dropped out first .
Then all the systems in its microprocessor went off like due to the horrific impact to its hardened chassis .
The impact was so strong that Reese even thought The Terminator might be destroyed :
He wondered if Terminator was dead - he could n't see the wreck from where he was .
The accident on the bike seriously damages the Terminator as well .
Any sane person knows the force of the impact during the accident .
The fall damaged Terminator 's leg and he was now walking with a limp .
Also , when the truck exploded , the Terminator took serious damage to his system so much that he shut down temporarily .
In T2 , the T - 800 jumps of the rolling semi and hits the pavement with big impact .
Such impact would total any human leg , and it damaged Terminator 's leg as well .
He was now walking with a limp .
In T3 , The T - 850 survived a massive helicopter crash and explosion with only cosmetic damage to the flesh , getting out of the wreckage instantly and even sporting a smile - " I'm Back " .
He was running like a healthy rabbit and could later hold the blast doors with one elbow and defeat the villain with the other hand , something of a novelty too - it was the first time the protector actually defeated the villain in the Terminator series .
Before it was only the circumstances of being in the right place at the right time , never a direct battle ... No damage at all .

_____________________________________________________________
In T2 when the Terminators fight they affect the walls but do n't break through the concrete ones .
The T - 800 only damaged a cinderblock wall by slamming the T - 1000 into it .
Even the drywall that they broke through offered some resistance .
Once the T - 800 is used to take down a wall and then goes through the glass , it knocks him out for a while .
In T3 , the superhero Terminators go through much harder obstacles and multiple concrete walls completely unaffected .
The scene resembles videogame or Superman type of a fight .
Judgment : over the top
Same with Terminator Salvation where Marcus fights the T - 800 and they fly around smashing into steel blocks .
Marcus gets hit multiple times by a cinder block which affects him as much as fist punches .
WEIGHT
According to the 1984's Making of The Terminator , T - 800 weights 220 pounds .
In fact , there 's really no reason to believe a Terminator would be particularly hugely heavy .
With the advancement of alloys surely they 'd get lighter and stronger .
Titanium for example , is much much lighter and stronger than steel .
It would make sense for a Terminator to be ' light ' too , to be agile and covertly infiltrate places .
It 's servos and hydraulics are n't that big , so having a lot of weight would be very detrimental to overall performance .
When T - 800 jumps on the hood of Reese 's car , he does n't even bend it or anything like that .
Another example is that the Terminator had to quietly climb up to Sarah 's apartment .
There was a scene in T3 that indicated that the T - 850 was very heavy for its volume .
The EMT 's could not even budge him .
Same when he jumped on the Toyota - the roof bended over his weight .
In T3 Terminators were apparently so heavy they could shatter asphalt and tile floors .

PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
If you look at the close - up of a T - 850 in T3 during the future war snippet , you 'll see that the incisors are quite a bit shorter than they are on a T - 800 .
He has baby teeth .
In the original Terminator movies , the endoskull had the mold of the actual Arnold Schwarzenegger 's teeth .
In T:S , the entire skeleton was redesign , from subtle redesigns and shape changes of the skull , to completely different body proportions and redesigns of the body
They did get it right in Terminator Genisys

BEIJING  The Obama administration will proceed with arms sales to Taiwan despite recent protests by China , an American official said Tuesday .
The official , Raymond Burghardt , is chairman of the American Institute in Taipei , the de facto United States Embassy in Taiwan .
Speaking from Hawaii , where he lives , he said that sales of arms to Taiwan were consistent with what White House officials have been saying was President Obama ’s policy .
“ No one should be surprised when we move forward with them , ” he said .
Mr. Burghardt declined to say exactly when Mr. Obama would notify Congress of an arms sale .
The American relationship with Taiwan , which China considers a renegade province , is one of the most delicate diplomatic issues between Beijing and Washington .
The United States takes no position on the sovereignty of Taiwan , but acknowledges that Beijing claims that there is only one China .

Sixty - fourth General Assembly
Second Committee
29th & 30th Meetings ( AM & PM )
One out of every three people residing in cities around the globe lived in a slum , and unless the problem was dealt with , another 400 million people would join their ranks by 2020 , Anna Tibaijuka , Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN - Habitat ) told the Second Committee ( Economic and Financial ) today , as it continued its consideration of sustainable development .
Despite those dispiriting statistics , she expressed optimism , quoting President Barack Obama of the United States , who said that World Habitat Day gave the world an opportunity to raise awareness and offer ideas on how to make the planet a better place " for ourselves and our children " .
President Obama had also expressed commitment to work with the United Nations and international partners to help more families find safe and secure places in which to live , she said .
It was encouraging that after many years in obscurity , the Habitat Agenda now received recognition from such high places , Ms. Tibaijuka said .
She made the remarks during an introductory statement on human settlement issues as she introduced a number of related reports for the Committee 's consideration .
She said that climate change , compounded by the global economic crisis , had accelerated the rate of urbanization and presented further challenges .
A representative of the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) agreed that climate change might cause mass displacement of people and that , consequently , there was a need to create comprehensive policies in that area .
Member States must figure out additional funding in terms of migration and climate change , and close legal and operational gaps .
In negotiating a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol , she said , it was to be hoped that the negotiators would take into account the humanitarian consequences of climate change , including provisions for protecting and assisting those who may move as a result .
Addressing the interwoven challenges of climate change , environment and migration required a holistic approach covering all types of environmentally induced population movements .
With respect to sustainable development in Africa , Ethiopia 's representative said the continent had the world 's most fragile ecosystems and was extremely vulnerable to catastrophic events brought about by small changes in global temperatures .
" Africa will be hit first and will be hit the hardest , " he said , noting that intense and frequent droughts and flooding already caused havoc on the continent , threatening to reverse development gains .
Worsening hunger , water shortages , desertification and diminishing agricultural yields were likely , he said , conjuring up a future characterized by massive migration and conflict over scarce resources .
To mitigate those problems , a meaningful outcome at the upcoming Copenhagen Climate Conference was crucial .
" The fate of our planet is indeed in our hands , " he said .
The representative of Côte d'Ivoire emphasized that " climate change is not a point of view - – it 's a reality " , adding that it was ironic that the developing world faced the gravest threat while it had contributed next to nothing in creating the problem .
The impact of climate change would be felt most keenly in Africa , where it threatened to undermine attainment of the Millennium Development Goals .
He said his country had begun several research projects to attenuate the effects of climate change , including investment in environmental research and a rigorous reforestation programme titled " Forest for Everyone " .
Bolivia 's delegate warned that global greenhouse gas emissions would increase by 45 per cent by the year 2030 compared with 1990 levels .
Deserts already comprised 40 per cent of the Earth 's surface and meteorological data showed that glaciers from Ecuador to Tierra del Fuego were shrinking rapidly .
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) they would totally disappear in 20 to 30 years .
The representative of Barbados said that sustainable development was one of the most important priorities on the United Nations agenda .
" The prospect of a world in which global temperatures rise by 2° Celsius is frightening , " he said , pointing out that at current levels , his country was already experiencing intense hurricanes , rising sea levels , coastal erosion , water stress , coral bleaching and many other threats .
Ahmed Djoghlaf , Executive Secretary of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity , said the current rate of extinction was estimated at 1,000 times higher than the natural rate .
" We may be on the brink of the sixth mass global extinction of species in the history of the world , and the first to be generated by human beings alone , " he warned .
Citing estimates , he noted that if that rate of loss was unchecked , 1.3 billion hectares across the world - – about 1.5 times the size of the United States –- would completely lose its original biodiversity levels by 2050 .
To meet that challenge , countries must work together .
He concluded by quoting an African proverb : " If you want to go quickly , go alone ; if you want to go far , go together . "
Mr. Djoghlaf also introduced the Secretary - General 's note on implementation of the environmental conventions , transmitting the reports of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and / or Desertification , Particularly in Africa , and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity .
Also taking part in today 's discussion were representatives of Switzerland , Congo , Cuba , Austria , Venezuela , Syria , Israel , Cameroon , Japan , Sri Lanka , Iran , Malawi , Niger , Costa Rica , Russian Federation , Republic of Korea , Pakistan , Norway , Monaco , Bahrain , Sudan , Kazakhstan , Belarus , Myanmar , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Ukraine , Zambia , Brazil , United Arab Emirates , Australia and Malta .
A representative of the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See also made a statement .
Representatives of the Inter - Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) , International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( IFRC ) , International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) and the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) also addressed delegates .
Introducing a number of draft resolutions for later action by the Committee were the representatives of Egypt , Azerbaijan , Sudan and the United States .
The Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. tomorrow , Wednesday 4 November , to conclude its debate on sustainable development .
Background
The Second Committee ( Economic and Financial ) met today to conclude its general discussion on sustainable development and take up its agenda item on implementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) and strengthening of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN - Habitat ) .
Before the Committee was the report of the United Nations Secretary - General on implementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) and strengthening of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN - Habitat ) , which describes the Programme 's progress over the last year towards institutional strengthening and activities to implement the Habitat II outcome .
It identifies achievements and challenges , charts the way towards achieving sustainable urban development in an increasingly urbanized world , and provides an overview of the outcome of the twenty - second session of UN - Habitat 's Governing Council , including the recommendations emanating from its dialogue on affordable housing finance and the proposal that the General Assembly convene a third United Nations conference on housing and sustainable urban development in 2016 .
The report ( document A/64/260 ) discusses partnerships to attract investment in low - income housing ; land and property rights of women as well as their access to finance ; improving land and property administration ; innovative housing finance mechanisms ; and urban safety and the prevention of urban crime .
In addition , it reviews progress on national , regional and global implementation of the Habitat Agenda and its 2008 - 2013 medium - term and strategic and institutional plan ; the World Urban Forum ; and the recently - created ministerial meetings on housing and urban development in Africa , Asia and the Pacific , and Latin America and the Caribbean .
It also presents observations on United Nations financial and budgetary matters .
Also before the Committee was the Report of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) ( document A/64/8 ) on the Council 's twenty - second special session , held from 30 March to 3 April and a note by the United Nations Secretary - General ( document A/64/317 ) transmitting his report on Coordinated implementation of the Habitat Agenda ( document E/2009/80 ) .
The latter report presents an overview of major developments in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda during 2008 and the first half of 2009 , and notes that increasing awareness on the part of the international community has led to a growing responsiveness to the relevant issues .
The report also reviews the contributions of the strategic and institutional plan to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda within the context of system - wide reform .
It concludes that in order to effectively follow up on these advances , the Economic and Social Council should make a " robust " decision to adopt and promote sustainable urbanization .
The report calls for a third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development in 2016 .
Introduction of Reports
AHMED DJOGHLAF , Executive Secretary , United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity , introduced the United Nations Secretary - General 's note on implementation of the environmental conventions ( document A/64/202 ) , which transmits the reports of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCC ) , the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and / or Desertification , Particularly in Africa ( UNCCD ) , and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity .
Speaking about the upcoming International Year of Biodiversity , 2010 , he said that if climate change was a problem , biodiversity formed part of the solution .
Unprecedented biodiversity loss threatened the health of the planet with the current rate of extinction estimated at 1,000 times higher than the natural rate .
" We may be on the brink of the sixth mass global extinction of species in the history of the world , and the first to be generated by human beings alone , " he warned .
Citing estimates , he said that if that rate of loss continued unimpeded , 1.3 billion hectares across the world - – about 1.5 times the size of the United States –- would completely lose its original biodiversity levels by 2050 .
To meet the challenge of biodiversity loss , countries must work together .
He concluded by quoting an African proverb : " If you want to go quickly , go alone ; if you want to go far , go together . "
The Committee then continued its general discussion of sustainable development .
Statements
SÉGOLÈNE ADAM ( Switzerland ) said a new high - level event on sustainable development could be an opportunity to give new impetus to common approaches and solutions for addressing pressing ecological , economic and social challenges .
A clear , shared vision of the scope and expected outcome of the event were needed to ensure its success .
A solid , constructive preparatory process must be put in place , she said .
The high - level event could assess implementation of the outcomes of previous major conferences on sustainable development , identify and address existing gaps in the international regime concerning environmental , economic and social challenges , critically assess the existing structures governing environment and sustainable development , and make proposals to improve efficiency in each of the three pillars of sustainable development .
The preparatory process would be decisive for the potential success of a 2012 high - level event .
It must be adequately fine - tuned to make the event transparent and inclusive .
The Commission on Sustainable Development was not the appropriate preparatory body for the high - level event , she said , noting that the Commission already had an established multi- year work programme .
The importance of combating climate change and successfully concluding the ongoing negotiation process under the auspices of the UNFCC could not be overemphasized .
Tangible progress in disaster risk reduction was needed as was implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action .
The coming year would be important for combating biodiversity loss .
EMILE ANGE MILO MBOU - MYLONDO ( Congo ) said climate change had been a subject of considerable reflection over the past few years but beyond talk , it was important not to dither .
The upcoming Climate Conference in Copenhagen had the potential to fulfil expectations and become a milestone on the path towards sustainable development .
Congo was particularly concerned about the preservation of forests and had joined the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ( REDD ) because the Government realized that desertification could become a great problem .
REDD represented the " cornerstone " of the partnership between Africa and developed countries .
Climate change compounded the problem of deforestation and could lead to catastrophe in Africa , he said , emphasizing that there was a growing awareness of the problem among African leaders .
Countries must come together and work to develop a global policy response .
They must also strengthen capacity - building through partnerships and increase the use of clean energy .
Furthermore , the developed countries should lend their support to African agriculture , especially in light of the Millennium Development Goals .
The international community in general should provide appropriate resources to aid sustainable development and protect the common heritage of humankind .
NADIESKA NAVARRO BARRO ( Cuba ) said the Artic ice was melting at such a speed that the region would experience its first completely ice - free summer by the year 2040 .
Huge masses of ice in Greenland and the South American glaciers were melting daily and carbon dioxide was concentrating in the atmosphere at 380 parts per million , a level higher than the natural concentration of carbon dioxide over the last 650 years .
The Institute for Spatial Studies of the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) calculated that the planet 's average temperature had grown 0.8 ˚ Celsius since 1980 .
The consumer society of the industrialized world was threatening the survival of humankind , she said .
Phenomena such as global warming , sea - level rise , indiscriminate cutting of forests , attempts to use food as fuel for automobiles in rich countries , and the irrational use of water , were gravely threatening the planet .
The worst was that if everything continued unchanged , the situation would become increasingly grave .
Production and consumption patterns in developed countries were speeding up climate change , and those patterns must change .
Developing countries could not achieve the objectives of Agenda 21 when the developed world lacked the political will to transfer technology and resources for capacity - building , she continued .
A greater focus was needed on genuine international cooperation , based on the principles of solidarity and mutual benefit , to implement Agenda 21 , the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the 2005 World Summit Outcome .
International space for action must be established and the Copenhagen Summit could be an appropriate venue for that .
Cuba also supported Brazil 's proposal to hold a conference in 2012 to commemorate 20 years since the Rio Summit .
TILAHUN WOLDEAREGAY ( Ethiopia ) said there was no doubt that the entire world was impacted by climate change , adding that " Africa will be hit first and will be hit the hardest " .
With the most fragile ecosystems in the world , the continent was extremely vulnerable to catastrophic events brought on by only small changes in global temperatures .
Intense and frequent droughts and floods already caused havoc in Africa , threatening to reverse development gains .
Falling agricultural production , in addition to worsening hunger , water scarcity , desertification , massive migration and conflict over scarce resources , were among the anticipated problems .
He said his country was highly dependent on agriculture for its survival , adding that the sector was dominated by small farmers using rain - fed and traditional practices , which made them extremely vulnerable to climate change and shifting rainfall patterns .
Consequently , Ethiopia had experienced cycles of drought that brought poverty to many households each year and worsened hardship .
To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change , the international community must act collectively , he stressed , noting , however , that African countries would need both financial and technical help .
Developed countries , which had created the crisis in the first place , should pay compensation to help the continent adapt .
However , it was incumbent on all countries to ensure success at the upcoming Climate Conference in Copenhagen .
" The fate of our planet is indeed in our hands , " he said in conclusion .
KURIAKOSE BHARANIKULANGARA , Observer for the Holy See , said the question of energy , both renewable and non-renewable , had become a key issue facing the international community .
A durable and comprehensive energy strategy must be developed to meet the world 's needs in the short and long term , ensure energy security , protect health and environment , and establish concrete commitments to address the problems of climate change .
The promotion of new and renewable sources of energy , besides being central to such a strategy , was of great importance in guaranteeing long - term comprehensive development , capable of extending to different areas of the planet .
Progress in the field of renewable energy was extremely important for poverty eradication , he said , adding that cooperation in that field should ultimately be oriented towards poverty alleviation and be adjusted to economic and fiscal instruments , as well as to regional and international cooperation , information sharing , transfer of technology and best practice in the field .
While developing countries had more than 40 per cent of installed renewable power capacity , more than 70 per cent of existing solar hot water capacity and 45 per cent of biofuel - production capacity , low - carbon technologies often incurred very high initial expenses .
Availability of and access to such technologies for poorer people was essential for development , he said .
Improving access to energy required better infrastructure , which could be ensured by appropriate legal and institutional frameworks , requiring the involvement of local institutions , he said .
Additionally , identifying appropriate resources should take into account the long‑term human and environmental costs .
Common renewable - energy initiatives should also be based on " intergenerational justice " since today 's energy consumption patterns impacted future generations .
ALESSANDRO MOTTER , Liaison Officer , Inter - Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) , noted that people were still divided on the matter of climate change .
There were those who appreciated its dangers and wished to do something about it regardless of the cost , and those who worried about the bottom line and the short - term cost of action .
How quickly they had forgotten the lessons of the Stern Report -- that the long - term cost of inaction would far outweigh the cost of action today .
The fact that several parliaments had been supportive of strong carbon dioxide ‑reduction commitments , often with interim targets , was laudable , but such agreement remained very contentious in several legislatures .
To help transcend political differences and mobilize parliaments worldwide on the issue , IPU had organized a major debate during its 120th Assembly in Addis Ababa , he said .
During that debate , a resolution on " climate change , sustainable development , models and renewable energies " had emerged .
It showed considerable consensus on several policy approaches .
The resolution showed that much could be done to mitigate climate change simply by going for the so - called " low - hanging fruit " first -- cost - effective targets for which there was already considerable public support .
He said such targets included the achievement of greater efficiencies and conservation by re-thinking the urban landscape to facilitate public transit , home building codes to induce retrofitting , school curricula to educate people about the environment from a young age , and agricultural methods to apply universally methods like organic farming , among others .
The resolution also recognized that a shift towards renewable energies and away from fossil fuels was essential to stemming climate change .
That shift would require active Government participation and more investment in research on and development of new technologies .
ANKE STRAUSS , International Organization for Migration , said rising sea levels , deforestation and natural disasters had impacts on where people lived , on food production and health .
There was a risk that climate change would prompt mass displacement of people , both internally and internationally .
Consequently , there was a need to address existing gaps in policy in that area , and it was necessary to build policy coherence on the national and international levels .
She said there was a need for dialogue among countries on how to close existing and future legal , operational and capacity gaps in terms of climate change and migration .
It was also crucial to figure out how to allocate additional funding .
The International Organization for Migration encouraged the development of a comprehensive and proactive approach to the problem , which should be considered in the context of human security .
It was critically important to understand that environmental migration was a challenge with many dimensions and therefore required an interdisciplinary approach .
In negotiating a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol , she said , it was to be hoped that the negotiators would take into account the humanitarian consequences of climate change , including provisions for protecting and assisting those who may move as a result .
Addressing the interwoven challenges of climate change , environment , and migration required a holistic approach covering all types of environmentally - induced population movements .
Regional and global cooperation was needed , not just to reach across countries , but also across disciplines , incorporating climate science , geography , migration , development studies and health .
For its part the International Organization for Migration would continue working to develop a comprehensive and proactive approach to addressing the migration - related consequences of climate change from a human - security perspective .
MAUDE FROBERG , Communications Manager , International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( IFRC ) , said mainstreaming disaster risk reduction into development work remained a top priority .
A recent mapping project showed that 113 national societies had improved safety and resilience for 13 million in 2009 alone .
Community - level action worked , she said , adding that because community members were the first to respond to disasters , they must have the power to make the right choices .
She said the need for climate - change adaptation was urgent , and the forthcoming Copenhagen Conference presented an opportunity to minimize human suffering .
Governments must capitalize on the occasion and approach the negotiating table with forward - looking solutions .
Disaster - response systems must be strengthened and climate - change adaptation must include risk reduction , preparedness and response .
It should be fully integrated into longer - term risk reduction , sustainable development and poverty - reduction strategies .
Vulnerable communities could only survive if they received timely and clear ‑weather information , she emphasized .
The second session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction called for strengthening community - level action , and IFRC had taken that forward within its global network .
She stressed the importance of strong partnerships with all stakeholders and the need for a significant increase in investments .
Investing more today could reduce adaptation costs , which were estimated to have reached $ 250 billion per annum by 2020 .
AMBER BARTH , Programme Officer , International Labour Organization ( ILO ) New York Office , said that against a backdrop of rising unemployment , poverty and inequality , as well as the collapse of enterprises and the retraction of global economic output , it might be tempting to forego investing in the economy until it rebounded .
However , investing only in good times was a false dilemma and it was now time to redress that imbalance and recognize that investing in a green recovery was the beginning of a longer - term programme of structural change .
She said Governments and organizations representing employers and workers from ILO 's 183 member countries had adopted the Global Jobs Pact last June , urging a shift to a low - carbon , environmentally - friendly economy that would help to accelerate a job - rich recovery .
ILO 's Programme on Green Jobs , which countries including China , India and Brazil had joined , recognized that action on climate change mitigation and adaptation would help in creating a high - employment economy that would reduce energy consumption , greenhouse gas emissions and pollution .
The promotion of green jobs held the promise of a triple dividend : sustainable enterprises , poverty reduction and a job - centred economic recovery .
The myth that action on the environment was bad for jobs must be dispelled , she stressed , adding that well - designed , environment - related investments were beneficial for employment overall .
The so - called " green sectors " could be expected to create more jobs than those lost in other sectors .
Shifts in the labour - market structure leading to job losses would require coherent policies and direct investment to assist those losing jobs due to climate - change adaptation and those whose jobs might be lost in the transformation to a low - carbon economy .
The concept of the social - protection floor would be a useful policy construct in the time of transition , and should be considered in Copenhagen .
Where coherent sustainable policies had been established , hundreds of thousands of green jobs had been created , outweighing job losses in emission - intensive sectors .
ILO encouraged broader and continuous efforts to put the world on track for a lasting recovery from crisis .
RICHARD KENNEDY , United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , said renewable energy was becoming a global success story .
A significant milestone had been reached in 2008 when added power capacity from renewable sources of energy in both the United States and the European Union had exceeded added power capacity from conventional power , including gas , coal , oil and nuclear .
Renewables represented more than 50 per cent of total added capacity .
That had been done by providing policy support to developing countries , by helping build the capacity of national institutions and personnel in the field of renewable energy for rural electrification and productive uses .
Those activities had been informed by renewable - energy projects throughout the developing world .
The United Nations system had an important role to play in promoting energy access in developing countries , he said .
UNIDO and United Nations Energy had recently been working with the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) Secretariat , West African countries and United Nations agencies to develop a large energy component for the GEF Strategic Programme for West Africa .
The Vienna Energy Conference had highlighted the need for a comprehensive approach to energy , given the varying needs of countries and the importance of energy in addressing global climate change .
A second conference , the Global Renewable Energy Forum , had been convened in Leon by the Government of Mexico and UNIDO , bringing together 2,500 policymakers , civil servants , scientists , non-governmental organization representatives and experts from more than 70 countries .
ANDREAS BRANDSTÄTTER ( Austria ) said that the June International Energy Conference titled " Towards an Integrated Energy Agenda Beyond 2020 " , held in Vienna and organized by UNIDO , the Austrian Development Corporation and the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis , had brought together some 800 participants from 93 countries .
Representing policymakers , civil servants , scientists , energy experts , United Nations Organizations and non-governmental organizations , they had discussed energy issues and related development challenges in the context of the global financial and economic crisis .
The Conference had explored mechanisms for greater international cooperation and the role of the United Nations in energy .
He said the Conference had adopted several key recommendations .
It had called for the creation of energy - development goals for energy access and set 2030 as the target year for achieving them .
It had also developed a detailed implementation road map , with interim targets and milestones , and created mechanisms for the rapid dissemination of best practice and capacity - building .
The Conference had called for the creation of energy - efficiency targets and mechanisms for identifying and disseminating best practices and capacity - building ; identification of technologies needed to address climate change , energy access and other technologies to monitor developments ; strengthening " UN - Energy " , chaired by UNIDO , and providing it with a support structure that could be based on the recently - launched Global Energy Assessment , among other things .
JORGE VALERO ( Venezuela ) said his country had begun to develop a new economic development model based on sustainability , and its environmental dimension was based on protection and restoration , taking into account the specific characteristics of each region .
The plan included a broad range of activities that were all in harmony with nature .
Although Venezuela was an oil - producing country , it had a very ambitious environmental agenda .
He said the global crises had been created by the effects of an irrational economic model , noting that not much was mentioned in the United Nations Secretary - General 's report about the true reason for the increase in oil prices , such as the speculative practices of the developed world .
All countries had suffered the impact of climate change and although the developed world was mostly responsible for that calamity threatening humankind , those countries bearing the greatest responsibility still refused to take the necessary steps to mitigate the effects of climate change .
OSAMA ALI ( Syria ) said paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 63/211 on the oil slick on Lebanese shores called on Israel to assume responsibility for the damage to countries directly affected , cover the costs of environmental restoration and return the coastline to its original state .
The United Nations Secretary - General 's report on the matter stated that Israel had yet to assume its responsibility and pay adequate compensation .
However , it did not even mention that Israel musts assume its responsibility to pay prompt and efficient compensation to Syria .
The report did not fully reflect the mandate entrusted to it under paragraph 4 of Assembly resolution 63/211 , which had been endorsed by the majority of Member States during the Assembly 's sixty - third session , he said .
The report , issued pursuant to that Assembly resolution , was intended to closely consider mandates embodied in the resolution , which had been adopted after exhaustive and delicate negotiations , he said .
Syria 's view on the report was included in document A / C.2/64/10 , which stated that the Assembly should send a stern message to Israel that the Assembly rejected and condemned its irresponsible conduct .
It should also state the Assembly 's request that Israel assume its responsibility for the environmental degradation caused by the spread of the oil slick .
URI RESNICK ( Israel ) stressed the need for an effective and comprehensive strategy to address the challenge of sustainable development , adding that his country had learned from its own experience the crucial role that agro-industrial innovation could play .
Providing modern agricultural techniques to the hardest hit areas played a key part in any strategy to help developing countries achieve self - sustenance .
Because of its arid climate conditions , Israel had gained much experience with agricultural research and development , especially with regard to the management of water and soil resources .
Noting that his country had devised novel methods which had enabled it to develop advanced agriculture in arid regions , he called for increased investment in continued research and development , and for the development of mechanisms to transfer and share knowledge .
In Israel , scientists , Government institutions and the private sector worked side by side in a mutually - reinforcing cooperation that accounted for the country 's agro-technological advances .
Israel remained firmly committed to sharing its knowledge and experience in the global effort to attain sustainable development .
ALAIN WILFRIED BIYA ( Cameroon ) , aligning himself with the " Group of 77 " developing countries and China as well as the Africa Group , said that a recent Conference of Parties to the anti-desertification Convention would be decisive in getting a legal instrument on that subject off the ground .
It could also form part of the conclusions to emanate from the forthcoming Copenhagen Climate Conference .
Legal instruments were inextricably linked to long - lasting development .
He said that , over the years , the Sahel zone had been deteriorating due to drought and growing farmland , although its soil was increasingly less fertile , all of which had caused a persistent decline in agricultural production over the past 20 years .
Meanwhile , Lake Chad was rapidly drying up , which was becoming a cause for concern throughout the region .
A huge forest in the south of Cameroon was also posing further conservation and resource - extraction challenges , he said , adding that his country had initiated a national environmental - and forest - development plan to kick - start a regional reforestation campaign , encourage long - lasting and environmentally - friendly forest management , and monitor access to natural resources .
Cameroon had joined a sub-regional commission on Lake Chad and on Central African forests to launch a plan of action that would combat deforestation and desertification .
Hailing regional and international efforts to combat desertification and include sustainable - development strategies in national policy , he urged more international support on curbing water shortages .
As for climate - change debate , he said it would only be fair for the international community to compensate developing countries that had made conservation efforts in that regard .
NORIHIRO OKUDA ( Japan ) said that solving the problem of climate change would entail vast financial resources , in particular to support adaptation efforts by vulnerable developing countries and small island States .
In that respect , Japan was prepared to provide more financial and technical assistance than in the past , in accordance with the progress of international negotiations .
While public financial assistance and technology transfer were critically important , a mechanism must be created that would not only ensure the effective use of public funds , but also facilitate the flow of private investments to meet the financial needs of developing countries .
With respect to biodiversity he recalled that the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) predicted that 30 per cent of the planet 's species would be at increasing risk of extinction if the current global warming continued .
The International Year of Biodiversity in 2010 was a good opportunity to re-ignite efforts to reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss .
Japan was set to host the tenth Conference of Parties to the biodiversity Convention , and was committed to contributing fully to the establishment of ambitious , realistic and action - oriented post - 2010 biodiversity targets .
Turning to disaster risk reduction , he said the subject constituted an important pillar of adaptation to climate change .
The intensifying scale and frequency of hurricanes , floods and other water - related catastrophes were causing a serious threat to human security , in particular for the most vulnerable communities .
The Hyogo Framework for Action must be further promoted and implemented as a useful guideline to increase the resilience of communities to natural disasters in general .
Special consideration should also be given to the development of small island States , and least developed countries , in light of the negative effects of climate change .
CARLA ESPOSITO GUEVARA ( Bolivia ) said that in the 20 years since the adoption of Agenda 21 , very little had been achieved from the point of view of the South .
Hunger was increasing in developing countries and the number of people living in extreme poverty would rise from 915 million to 1.2 billion in 2009 , which was 55 million to 90 million more than the number anticipated before the economic crisis .
Global greenhouse gas emissions would increase 45 per cent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels .
Deserts already comprised 40 per cent of the Earth 's surface , and there were 869 species on the list of endangered species .
Meteorological data showed that glaciers from Ecuador to Tierra del Fuego were shrinking fast , she continued , adding that they would totally disappear in 20 to 30 years , according to the IPCC .
The current socio-economic model encouraged exploitative practices and the depredation of natural resources , and was destroying Mother Earth .
There was no accounting that recognized that loss .
Even greenhouse gas production was being turned into a lucrative market for speculation .
The climate change crisis showed the importance of the indigenous principles that human beings were part of an interdependent system of plants , animals and water requiring respect and care , she said .
The 1982 World Charter on Nature and the 1992 Rio Declaration recognized that human beings were part of Mother Nature .
Without the environmental pillar of sustainable development , the social and economic pillars could not exist .
Nature had value in and of itself , independent of human beings .
It placed life at the centre of development .
Unbridled growth would eventually lead to disaster .
PALITHA KOHONA ( Sri Lanka ) said climate change impacted everyone , especially developing countries , and a paradigm shift towards green development was needed .
Although big industrialized countries were primarily responsible for carbon - dioxide emissions , it was the small developing countries which were most vulnerable to changing weather patterns .
Consequently , developed countries should off - set their carbon debt by financing adaptation costs in the developed world .
The developed countries should also make bold cuts in emissions levels , based on per-capita emission criteria .
With regard to deforestation , he said appropriate incentives must be provided to help countries maintain their forests .
Sri Lanka maintained a 20 per cent forest cover –- a resource that was open to exploitation -- and practical measures should be provided to preserve them .
Sri Lanka called for a carbon value to be assigned to forests so that they could be traded in the global carbon market .
As for disaster management , the country had made significant progress in developing a systemic and scientific approach after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , which had devastated Sri Lanka .
AHMAD RAJABI ( Iran ) said energy played a significant role in achieving sustainable development and was important for economic development .
Clean , renewable energies could play an effective role in partially fulfilling demand for energy , rural development , job creation and environmental protection .
According to the International Energy Agency 's World Energy Outlook , emissions and oil demand would continue to grow rapidly over the next decades even when taking into account the technological progress expected under existing policies , the diversification of energy resources and a shift to cleaner energy resources .
Global warming , climate change and huge droughts were serious threats to human life , he said , adding that renewable energy and rational use of fossil fuels were important options for tackling those challenges .
Enormous investment was needed to bring new production capacity online and to build new , upgraded infrastructure in energy exploration , production , transportation , distribution and compensation .
That would be particularly required to transport energy supplies to market , especially in the case of natural gas .
He said his country had taken steps to optimize energy consumption and promote hydropower as well as renewable - energy production and consumption .
Iran encouraged the private sector to invest in new and renewable energies , provided subsidies , and supported manufacturers of technology development as well as university research on the subject .
There was a need to diversify energy sources , to develop and transfer advanced and clean - energy technology , to deploy affordable and efficient technologies , to increase efficiency in energy infrastructure , and to ensure affordable technologies for oil - producing and exporting countries .
JENNIFER MJUWENI ( Malawi ) said sustainable development was a central component of her country 's national development agenda , which was linked to internationally - agreed development targets , including the Millennium Goals .
Within Malawi , however , poverty , population growth , urbanization , the spread of HIV / AIDS and serious environmental threats undermined sustainable development .
To combat poverty , she said , the international community must take into account the specific needs of each of the least developed countries , many of which - – like her own –- depended on a rural - based , rain - fed agriculture sector .
Given that traditional form of agriculture , Malawi was particularly vulnerable to climate change , and the Government had sought to help small farmers develop sustainable agricultural practices .
Since climate change was inherently a global issue , it should be tackled in the context of the international sustainable development agenda , she said .
Malawi hoped for success at the upcoming Climate Conference in Copenhagen as a global binding consensus was needed to confront the challenges ahead .
In conclusion , she called for the developed countries to fulfil their official development assistance ( ODA ) commitments towards the least developed countries in terms of financial resources , technical expertise and environmentally - sound resources .
IBRAHIM SIDI OUMAR ( Niger ) said desertification , climate change and biodiversity loss were real threats that spared no one and no nation .
They were major obstacles to efforts by developing countries to achieve the Millennium Goals .
Despite some progress since the Rio Summit , there was still a long way to go in that regard .
Underscoring his country 's commitment to sustainable development , he said that because Niger was located in the heart of the Sahel , where desertification was spreading and soil quality poor , most of the population depended on natural resources for survival .
Conservation of those resources was of crucial importance .
He said his country had signed and ratified all the Rio Conventions and the Government would make every effort to give them full effect .
It had set up a National Environmental Council for Sustainable Development , which was responsible for coordinating and monitoring national policy .
An Executive Secretariat had been established to prepare and implement the Council 's decisions .
The Government has also created committees to address climate change , biodiversity loss and desertification .
The Government was taking vulnerability to climate change and adaptation very seriously , he said .
It had set up a databank on greenhouse gas emissions and conducted a full report on socio-economic measures to adapt to climate change .
It had also published articles on greenhouse gas emissions , and completed a study regarding the need to build capacity for mining , agriculture , water resources , sanitation , environmental conservation and combating desertification .
It also had launched agricultural , forestry and land - grazing projects .
CHRISTOPHER HACKETT ( Barbados ) described sustainable development as one of the most important priorities on the United Nations agenda .
As a small island developing State , it was an imperative for his country given its small size and economic dependence on the environment .
From the perspective of a country already affected by climate change , a rapid and coordinated response to the global economic crisis provided a good model for climate - change intervention , especially since climate change had already devastated millions of lives .
Additionally , adaptation costs -– estimated by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) at $ 86 billion -– were a mere fraction of the military expenditures of developed countries , he said .
The money was available and it was just a question of establishing the right priorities .
The upcoming Climate Conference in Copenhagen presented an opportunity to agree on an ambitious and comprehensive outcome that would protect the most vulnerable States .
" The prospect of a world in which global temperatures rise by 2 ˚ C is frightening , " he said , noting that , at current levels , his country was already facing intense hurricanes , rising sea levels , coastal erosion , water stress , coral bleaching and many other threats .
JAIRO HERNANDEZ -MILIAN
( Costa Rica ) said that one of the Committee 's goals was to achieve balanced and sustainable economic development , a difficult undertaking given the numerous challenges facing the world , including global warming and scarce resources .
It was important to remember that it was the developing countries that were most at risk and crucial to introduce a new international order to transfer knowledge , resources and technology .
With regard to the upcoming Copenhagen Climate Conference , he said a successful outcome depended on the courage of each country .
Costa Rica for one had sought to mitigate the effects of climate change by establishing ambitious goals and planned to be carbon - neutral by 2021 .
That goal had been made possible by the elimination of military spending , and already almost 100 per cent of Costa Rican energy consumption was drawn from " green " sources such as the sun , water and wind .
It was important to confront present and future difficulties head - on because the world owed that to future generations .
MIKHAIL SAVOSTIANOV ( Russian Federation ) said the May session of the Commission on Sustainable Development had developed and adopted a set of important decisions aimed at ensuring sustainable agriculture as well as strategic decisions aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals , eliminating poverty and countering environmental deterioration .
He lauded the key role played by UNEP in addressing global environmental challenges as well as the results of the twenty - fifth session of its Governing Council .
However , its capacity was far from being exhausted .
The United Nations Forum on Forests had contributed to the development of a sustainable forestry process , he said .
The outcome of its eighth and ninth special meetings focused on key forestry - management issues that were useful in combating climate change .
The Russian Federation supported the work of the Open- ended Intergovernmental Expert Panel on seeking mutually - accepted solutions for long - term sustainable forestry management .
The Russian Federation would continue to take steps to strengthen the ability of its forests to absorb carbon dioxide .
Stressing the importance of continuing to seek solutions to the global problem of maintaining biodiversity and combating desertification , he also underscored the importance of international cooperation in that regard .
A global platform for reducing natural disasters was the most appropriate forum .
While lauding the results of the second session of the Global Platform for Disaster Reduction , he warned against having climate change replace and marginalize other elements of the Hyogo Framework for Action .
The Russian Federation supported balanced funding for the various Hyogo priorities , he said .
Introduction of Draft Resolutions
The representative of Egypt then introduced a draft resolution on permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory , including East Jerusalem , and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources ( document A/C.2/64/L.12 ) .
Under the Committee 's agenda item on information and communication technologies for development , the representative of Azerbaijan introduced a draft titled " Building connectivity through the Trans - Eurasian Information Superhighway " ( document A/C.2/64/L.11 ) .
The representative of Sudan , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 , introduced a text titled " Development cooperation with middle - income countries " ( document A/C.2/64/L.13 ) under the agenda item on globalization and interdependence , while the representative of the United States introduced a draft titled " Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and taking stock of national efforts to protect critical information infrastructure " ( document A/C.2/64/L.8 ) .
Statement by Executive Director of UN - Habitat
ANNA KAJUMULO TIBAIJUKA , Under - Secretary - General and Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN - Habitat ) , introduced the United Nations Secretary - General 's reports on implementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) and strengthening of UN - Habitat ( document A/64/260 ) ; and on coordinated implementation of the Habitat Agenda ( document E/2009/80 ) ; and the report on the twenty - second session of UNEP 's Governing Council ( document A/64/8 ) .
She said that while considerable progress had been made on the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , climate change , compounded by the economic crisis , had accelerated the rate of urbanization , presenting further challenges .
About 1 billion people were currently living in slums and squatter settlements around the world , and the problem was most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa .
Globally , one out of every three people residing in cities lived in slums , and unless the problem was dealt with , another 400 million people would join their ranks by 2020 .
Despite those dispiriting statistics , she expressed optimism and hope , quoting a message from President Barack Obama of the United States to the effect that World Habitat Day gave the world an opportunity to raise awareness and offer ideas about how to make the planet a better place " for ourselves and our children " .
President Obama had also expressed commitment to working with the United Nations and international partners to help more families find a safe and secure place in which to live .
It was encouraging that after many years in obscurity , the Habitat Agenda now received recognition from such high places .
With respect to the UNEP Governing Council 's twenty - second session , she said participants had taken some landmark decisions , including the resolutions on Cities and Climate Change , Guidelines for access to basic services for all , and a request that the General Assembly convene a third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development ( Habitat III ) .
A resolution on affordable housing finance was also another key decision .
With regard to the World Urban Forum , she said the most recent one had been held in Nanjing , China , in 2008 , attracting 8,000 participants from 155 countries .
And in a clear message to policymakers everywhere , the World Urban Forum had stressed the need to ensure that the urban poor did not get left behind .
Also at the Nanjing event , UN - Habitat had launched State of the World 's Cities , a flagship biennial report which reviewed the direst problems facing cities and towns across the globe and identified viable approaches to urban planning .
Looking forward , she outlined three areas linked to rapid and chaotic urbanization : poverty and the Millennium Development Goals ; price volatility of food , energy and water ; and climate change .
" These are the red warning lights , so to speak –- the battleground for sustainable development , " she said in conclusion .
Statements
SHIN BOO - NAM ( Republic of Korea ) said the international community must significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to ensure that global temperatures did not rise by more than 2° C.
Every opportunity should be taken to build the political will to send the message that States were seeking solutions .
To move climate negotiations forward , the Government of the Republic of Korea proposed the creation of a registry of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions for developing countries .
It also planned to announce its mid-term emissions reduction goals for 2020 , hoping that , as a non-Annex I country , it would set an example for developing nations to make meaningful contributions to emission reductions .
Emphasizing that low - carbon growth should complement sustainable development , he said that in implementing its vision for " low carbon , green growth " , his country was enacting the framework law on green growth and , under its five - year plan for green growth , would spend 2 per cent of annual gross domestic product ( GDP ) on green growth programmes .
In the long - term , it would be imperative that States reduce their dependency on fossil - fuel energy sources .
Regarding water issues , drought and desertification , he said his country would host the Tenth Conference of Parties to the anti-desertification Convention in 2011 .
Effective water - resource management was critical to climate change adaptation and the United Nations should take a special interest .
It was important to explore options for a specialized , unified water - management cooperation initiative , and to convene a high - level event on sustainable development in 2012 , whose agenda should feature water issues .
ASAD M. KHAN ( Pakistan ) said the urgent and immediate challenge for the international community was the successful conclusion of climate negotiations in Copenhagen by agreeing to a common vision for combating the threats posed by climate change .
Such a globally - shared vision should be built around three principles , the first of which was the necessity for industrialized countries to first and foremost implement their emission - reductions commitments and agree to deeper mid-term and long - term targets to avoid a climate tipping point .
He said the second principle was the need to switch to low emissions and high - growth pathways in order to meet development and climate - change challenges in an integrated manner ; and an agreement on the scale of financial resources needed to meet that challenge well as recognition of the critical role that public - sector contributions could play in that regard .
The challenges of sustainable development had clearly become too large and acute for any one country to tackle on its own , he said , adding that the United Nations had a central role to play in that regard , particularly by advancing the global sustainable - development agenda to meet those and other emerging challenges in an increasingly - globalized world .
DANIEL HIRSCH ( Norway ) said that even with the preparations for the Copenhagen Climate Conference , he was concerned about the pace of the negotiating process .
Ambitious commitments on emission reductions and financing were crucial to the success of the Conference , yet there was a need for economy - wide reduction targets by all developed countries .
The more advanced developing countries should take further actions that could be measured and reported and verified .
Norway called for developed countries to take on a significant share towards additional financial resources for both adaptation and mitigation activities , and to that end , had proposed to extract resources from the carbon market by auctioning allowances .
In establishing a new world - wide climate regime with incentives , development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies would occur on a global scale .
With regard to deforestation , which accounted for more than 17 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions , a successful response to global warming would only happen if it was addressed on a large scale , as forests were core components of ecosystem functions , protecting biodiversity and water sources .
Norway would continue to fund the protection of forests as well as sustainable forest management in developing countries .
Further , biodiversity was essential to reducing poverty and tackling climate change as food security was based on biological diversity .
" Biodiversity is the wealth of the poor , " he stressed , noting that since 1993 his country had convened , with the United Nations , the Trondheim Conference on Biological Diversity .
The next Conference would be held in February .
Regarding Brazil 's proposal to convene a high - level event in 2012 to review implementation of the Rio conventions , he said it would need to include an agenda that was forward - looking and focused , and one that should not overlap or undermine the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development or any other intergovernmental body .
Norway called for the inclusion of two topics : green economy and water , which were not properly dealt with in existing international platforms .
VALERIE BRUELL -MELCHIOR
( Monaco ) said her country was determined to invest in sustainable development as part of a long - standing tradition of respect for and protection of the environment .
Prince Albert had fostered policies on national and international cooperation for environmental protection and Monaco was contributing to the sustainable management of natural resources .
It had proposed ethical solutions for working together towards the common goal of improving living conditions for the most vulnerable populations .
Its projects were focused on soil conservation , reforestation , biodiversity , energy efficiency , protection of tuna and coral reefs .
They were aimed at giving full support to implementation of United Nations conventions on environmental conservation .
It was important to allow developing States to adapt to the harmful impact of climate change and to achieve the climate commitments in Copenhagen in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol , she said .
There must be the same ambition in 2010 , which would be the International Year of Biological Diversity .
The General Assembly should give new impetus to the tenth meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Convention in Japan in 2010 .
As Prince Albert had pointed out during the Assembly , sufficient financial aid must be given to developing countries .
Agriculture , upon which women and local populations depended , must also be given the proper importance .
Economic renewal must be green , she stressed .
HAMAD FAREED AHMED ( Bahrain ) , describing 2008 as a disastrous year , recalled that thousands of people had died in disasters which had affected 2 billion people .
Disasters had caused untold damage , and it was necessary to find the resources to reduce their impact .
Such catastrophes were most prevalent in low - income developing countries , which needed technology transfer and early - warning systems to predict and forecast danger so they could deal appropriately with hazards .
Adaptation must be part of local programmes , he said , expressing particular concern about the plight of small island developing States .
Landlocked least developed countries also had particular challenges because they suffered from economic difficulties .
Countries must be able to deal with disasters appropriately , through proper mitigation and adaptation .
The international community must earmark the funds necessary to reduce the impact of disasters .
In May , Bahrain had held a meeting to consider the evaluation report on disaster reduction , which was published annually .
The report had been drafted as part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , and dealt with protecting lives and property from natural disasters .
There was no doubt that its 20 recommendations had not been given enough attention , he said , calling upon States to take note of it .
Bahrain had set up a centre for dealing with earthquakes and floods , and in June 2009 , the country had held a forum on disaster reduction to promote international action to reduce risk .
Bahrain 's Minister for Foreign Affairs had announced that a centre would be set up to combat disasters , with headquarters in Kuwait .
KAMAL BASHIR KHAIR ( Sudan ) said the financial crisis and global economic slowdown had placed additional constraints on the ability of developing countries , particularly the least developed and African countries , to achieve growth while posing serious threats to the progress in sustainable development .
Action to address the multidimensional challenges of sustainable development should be taken simultaneously with efforts targeting the three pillars of sustainable development -– economic development , social development and environmental protection .
Those goals should be promoted in a complementary and consistent manner on the national , regional , and global levels .
He said his country was suffering the negative impacts of climate change and its inherently fragile ecosystem , on which the vast majority of its population depended , suffered from recurrent drought and floods .
That had led to a pressing need to address the national priorities of food security , water supply and public health .
Discussions in the context of sustainable development and environmental protection should therefore be held in an integrated , coordinated and balanced manner .
The Climate Change Convention and its Kyoto Protocol remained the central multilateral framework for cooperative action to address climate change .
On the national level , he said , the overall goal of Sudan 's National Adaptation Plan of Action had been to identify urgent and immediate activities to address climate change and variability in the context of national development priorities .
The action plan focused on agriculture , water resources and public health in order to address challenges and the country 's rapid population growth , which had risen from 14 million in 1973 to 40 million in 2009 .
Natural disasters also had negative effects on economic growth , social development and environmental protection .
It also affected national production and productive assets , infrastructure , education , public health and natural resources , leading to unemployment , displacement , price hikes , environmental degradation and the spread of epidemic diseases .
BYRGANYM AITIMOVA ( Kazakhstan ) said that on the international level her country had agreed , under the Pozan decision , not to exceed its 1992 greenhouse gas emissions during the years 2008 to 2012 .
Furthermore , Kazakhstan was a low - carbon economy under Annex I to the Kyoto Protocol and was prepared to reduce emissions in the post - Kytoto framework .
However , the country should define its own assigned amount units and be included in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol .
In doing so , Kazakhstan would be able to create a system for generating national quotas and prepare for the post - Kyoto regime .
She requested support for Kazakhstan 's proposal regarding the inclusion of an amendment to Annex B on the provisional agenda for the Copenhagen Conference .
Referring to Copenhagen , she said her country shared " the common dream that the united world could use this opportunity to transform climate crisis into opportunity " .
Kazakhstan 's delegation to the Conference planned to engage fully on core issues aimed at establishing comprehensive systems that would create a low - carbon environment in the post - Kyoto period .
Kazakhstan offered to help develop an international adaptation system in which advanced countries with technological resources would participate in the implementation of the national adaptation strategies of developing countries .
On the national level , the Government was working to improve existing technologies while incorporating alternative sources of energy .
With great potential in renewable - energy sources such as the sun , wind and biomass , among others , Kazakhstan was preparing to establish regional centres for energy efficiency and renewable resources .
SERGEI SERGEEV ( Belarus ) said that one priority for discussion must be the energy supplies of Member States , a large - scale issue which should be considered within the United Nations system .
Belarus had made significant contributions to tackling climate change both domestically and globally , and had continually striven for a practical impact .
More attention was paid to the problem of climate change these days and he praised the constructive proposals advanced by fellow Committee members .
With respect to the upcoming Copenhagen Conference , he expressed hope that the outcome would facilitate an international - cooperation regime for the post - Kyoto period .
A main focus should be expanding the number of participants in the discussion on climate change to ensure that it had a truly international character .
Further research on new and renewable energies was also needed , and should be coordinated by the United Nations .
Developing countries and those with economies in transition should have equal access to high - tech solutions .
U MYINT LWIN ( Myanmar ) said that , like other developing countries , Myanmar had incorporated the principles of sustainable development into its development policies .
It had adopted the Myanmar Agenda 21 in 1995 , with the objective of achieving economic and social development while protecting the environment .
Half of the country was covered with forests and overall national environmental policy was focused on the forest sector .
A new forest policy had been adopted in 1995 to promote sustainable forest management .
To prevent deforestation , Myanmar was taking measures to counter adverse encroachment on forests for agriculture , housing and industry , he said .
To deter uncontrolled use of fuel wood , plantations of fuel wood had been established in communities surrounding forest areas .
Myanmar was focused on expanding agricultural production and rural development to reduce poverty and provide food security .
It had expanded the acreage under cultivation through reclamation of fallow land , wetlands and virgin land .
The country had also encouraged double and mixed cropping , and given farmers the necessary inputs , including high - yield seeds and strains , agriculture loans and know - how , he said .
Myanmar was implementing a Border Area Development Plan , 24 Special Development Zone Plans and an Integrated Rural Development Plan with a view to reducing poverty in remote - border areas that lagged behind other regions in development , in order to effectively address the disparity between urban and rural areas .
The Government had also taken steps to develop the energy sector .
IVAN BARBALIC ( Bosnia and Herzegovina ) called for an examination of how to enhance collaboration between developed and developing nations , and underlined the need for stronger support in capacity - building and technology transfer .
It would be hard , if not impossible , for developing nations to combat climate change without the long - term international cooperation , which was relevant to both clean fossil fuel and renewable - energy technologies .
It was also important to educate people on the " historic " push towards clean energy , and more resources should be committed to youth - education programmes .
Bosnia and Herzegovina had signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol , but was not a State party to Annex 1 of the Climate Change Convention , and thus was not obliged to cut emissions in the first - commitment period , 2008 to 2012 .
As was known , Bosnia and Herzegovina 's hydropower - energy potential was huge , and more than half of its land was covered with forests , an excellent source of biomass energy , he said .
According to 2007 research the country 's wind - energy potential was 900 to 2,000 megawatts .
As for solar irradiation , the country was among the more favourable locations in Europe .
Moreover , the Government had signed the Energy Community Treaty with nine other South - east European nations , its first post -1990s binding treaty , which would help foster the creation of a South - east European regional energy market , in line with the European Energy Market framework .
It was clear that Bosnia and Herzegovina had a high potential to produce energy and was committed to developing renewable - energy sources .
HANNA PROROK ( Ukraine ) said his country was particularly concerned about permanent environmental problems given its own history .
Ukraine still struggled with lasting environmental problems from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant , which undermined sustainable development throughout the entire country .
Climate change and its effects , such as extreme weather , had also affected Ukraine 's forestry and agriculture .
It was clear that climate change was the most pressing item on the international agenda , he said , praising the United Nations Secretary - General 's attention to the issue .
He reiterated a proposal by President Victor Yushchenko to create an international document describing common norms and obligations on the environment .
Ukraine itself had made substantial efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , which it planned to reduce by 20 per cent by 2020 and 50 per cent by 2050 , compared to 1990 levels .
But such reductions should be calculated differently for different countries , taking into account the relative prosperity or poverty of each .
WINNIE CHIBESAKUNDA ( Zambia ) said the global crises were a wake - up call for all to change the development paradigm and follow a sustainable path that balanced social , economic and environmental imperatives .
However , they should not be used as an excuse to divert attention from the sustainable - development agenda .
The fate of Agenda 21 and the outcome of the Johannesburg World Summit were similar to those of other internationally - agreed initiatives in that there was weak implementation due to a lack of adequate and predictable financial resources , capacity - building and technology transfer , but the sustainable agenda was too delicate to ignore .
Calling upon the development community to keep the sustainable - development agenda alive by meeting the financial commitments to implementing the Millennium Development Goals , she said her country would not likely meet the Millennium target on environmental sustainability due to its population 's dependence on biomass energy .
Zambia 's priority was therefore to mobilize international support to develop cleaner sources of energy , particularly since it had plentiful natural resources from which it could develop hydropower stations .
She said her country was committed to implementing the Hyogo Framework for Action , citing estimates that 75 per cent of all disasters in Zambia were attributable to weather conditions .
She also voiced support for the outcome of the Windhoek High - Level Ministerial Declaration which addressed the theme of African agriculture in the twenty - first century , saying that the Zambian Government 's focus was to build capacity to assess vulnerability , early warning and emergency , as well as the integration of disaster - risk reduction into national planning .
MARIA TERESA MESQUITA PESSÔA ( Brazil ) said the promotion of sustainable development was an overarching priority for attaining prosperity , social justice and environmental protection , thus guaranteeing peace and security .
That was especially true in times of crisis like the current one .
The integral concept of sustainable development continued to be the most relevant tool for setting priorities and devising policies to respond to the needs of human development .
Still , the thorough operationalization of sustainable development remained a challenge , she said , noting that while the process initiated less than three decades ago in Stockholm had led to an enhanced understanding of the development process , actual implementation had not followed .
Globalization had failed to provide adequate answers to the challenges of sustainable development .
The resources required to implement Agenda 21 had not materialized and the agenda for development as reflected in the Millennium Development Goals was threatened by the crises that the international community had by and large been unable to forestall .
She said efforts to implement the multilateral environmental agreements must be demonstrated with commitments in Copenhagen that were commensurate with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities as well as historic responsibilities for emissions .
Unless an international legally - binding regime for access and benefit sharing was finalized and the loss of biodiversity reversed , the seventh Millennium target , on attaining environmental sustainability , could not be attained .
To achieve green growth or a green economy , it was essential to have adequate means of implementation , access to technology , reform of the Bretton Woods institutions geared towards promoting sustainable development , and promotion of international governance for sustainable development .
THEODORE DAH ( Côte d'Ivoire ) , stressing that " climate change is not a point of view - – it 's a reality " , said it was ironic that the developing world faced the gravest threat while it had contributed next to nothing in creating the problem .
Most keenly the impact of climate change would be felt in Africa , where it threatened to undermine attainment of the Millennium Development Goals .
He said his country had begun several research projects to attenuate the effects of climate change , including investment in environmental research and a rigorous reforestation programme titled " Forest for Everyone " .
Climate change was a developmental problem and it was important to increase financial flows to the developed world to mitigate its challenges .
However , money for the fight against climate change should not replace ODA , but go hand in hand with that aid .
With respect to the upcoming Copenhagen Conference , it was crucial to build cohesive strategies , and Côte d'Ivoire called for the creation of a financial framework for emerging economies to prepare for the effects of climate change .
Every country had a different responsibility , but each also had a duty to act .
Together , the international community must rethink its development model and create one that would meet the needs of the current generations without taking away opportunities for future generations .
SALEM ALDHANHANI ( United Arab Emirates ) said that , in light of figures indicating that 1.6 billion people in developing countries lacked access to modern energy services , and the direct impact of that on the environment and economy in those countries and the lives of their citizens , urgent action was needed to augment international efforts to confront those challenges , invest in new energy sources and promote wider , more sustainable use of renewable energy resources .
Steps were also needed to ensure that the growing future demand for energy would not affect the development plans of many countries worldwide .
He said his country had depended primarily on oil as a main source of national income in promoting new and renewable sources of energy over the past decade .
It had started using oil revenue to invest in enhanced energy efficiency programmes and sustainable energy sources through the exploitation of available natural renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power , as well as water and geothermal sources .
The Government of the United Arab Emirates had made the development of a renewable energy industry , including sustainable and efficient energy use , a top economic and environmental priority .
The Government had also set up a national committee on climate change and enacted several laws , regulations and practices to reduce the economic , social , and health implications of climate change .
It was promoting awareness of the need for a clean environment and the concept of renewable energy in schools .
Recently it had allocated $ 150 million for the Energy and Environment Research Fund .
The Madar Initiative had emerged as the culmination of cooperation between the public and private sectors in promoting and investing in renewable energy sources , natural - resource conservation and application of pilot projects in clean technologies .
That initiative included the building of the world 's largest hydro- energy production power plant for developing renewable energy sources .
ANNETTE ELLIS ( Australia ) said durable development was linked to environmental sustainability and people in poverty were especially vulnerable to damaged environments .
Development and urbanization had moved at such a high pace that they had had created environmental pressures .
Among other things , water resources were growing scarce , land was degraded and some ecosystems were no longer able to support the demands of growing populations .
She said her country worked with its bilateral partners and the international community to address those challenges and had developed a strong national programme to reduce the detrimental impact on the environment .
With less than five weeks to go before the Copenhagen Conference , the risks associated with climate change required urgent action .
Member States should not compromise on their ambitions to restrain global warming to a maximum of 2° C or to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 450 parts per million or lower .
Bold decisions were needed and Australia encouraged other countries to work towards a meaningful outcome in December .
ADAM KUYMIZAKIS ( Malta ) , emphasizing that sustainable development could not be addressed in isolation , said the threats of climate change were real and must be recognized as among the major challenges of the century .
Like many small island States vulnerable to the negative impact of climate change , Malta was very conscious of the enormity of the challenges ahead .
It was one of the few European Union member States not currently included in Annex 1 of the Climate Change Convention and had no emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol .
As a symbol of its political commitment to that strategy , Malta had communicated in December 2008 its intention to join Annex 1 , and submitted a formal proposal to that effect for consideration at the Copenhagen Conference .
The Government aimed to achieve the goal of reducing by 20 per cent its carbon dioxide emissions by 2012 , eight years ahead of the 2020 target year .
Malta was highly vulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change , he said .
As a Mediterranean country , it was in a transition zone between warm climate in the summer and milder climate in the winter .
That had meant increasing temperatures , sea - level rise , changing precipitation patterns , water shortages , longer heat waves and an increase in intense weather .
All of that could have serious repercussions on peoples ' health .
Lower rainfall levels were expected to limit further the availability of water resources .
The Government sought to improve the carbon footprint for water production by reducing system - wide demand through heavy investment in improvements to the distribution network and in the latest technology to improve energy efficiency of desalination facilities .
New policies had been launched this year to reduce groundwater use to sustainable levels , and greater emphasis would be placed in the coming months on awareness - raising and education on water - saving measures .
MUNYARADZI CHENJE , United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , said the Executive Director welcomed the comprehensive report of the Joint Inspection Unit and the strategic nature of its contents and recommendations , which called on Member States to improve environmental governance and representation .
At its twenty - fifth session in February 2009 , the UNEP Governing Council had adopted a decision taking note of the report , as well as a complementary decision through which it had set up a regional representative group of ministers .
That group 's mandate had been determined by the decision to present a set of options at the special session next February .
He said the United Nations could look more closely at broader reforms to address multiple challenges , such as in the context of capacity - building and the Bali Strategic Plan .
The Executive Director supported the concept of a system - wide medium - term strategy for the environment .
UNEP 's 2010 - 2013 medium - term strategy had been prepared as a tool to implement the programme .
System - wide coherence was long overdue .
Institutional changes and broad reform were not mutually exclusive , and could be addressed in tandem .
For information media • not an official record
The Department of Revenue Services ( DRS ) mailed nearly 1,000 bills this week to Connecticut residents who owe state taxes for unstamped cigarettes purchased over the Internet .
The initiative is part of an effort by the agency to ensure taxpayer compliance with state cigarette and use tax laws .
The bills mailed to 928 individuals detail the tax and interest owed for online cigarette purchases made between 2007 and 2008 .
Consumers who purchase untaxed cigarettes are required to file Form AU - 75 , Tax Return for Persons in Possession of Unstamped Cigarettes , to pay both the cigarette and use taxes to the state .
Those that do not file and pay these taxes will receive a tax bill related to the purchase .
DRS was able to send the bills as a result of information the agency received from businesses that sold Connecticut residents untaxed cigarettes over the Internet .
A federal law , the Jenkins Act , requires out - of - state retailers to give state tax departments detailed information about purchases of cigarettes delivered to their state .
Online and mail order retailers must provide the tax departments with the names , addresses , brands , and quantity of cigarettes shipped into each state .
This information allows states to make certain the appropriate taxes are paid on the purchases .
“ Despite any advertisements smokers may have seen , there are no tax - free cigarettes , ” Commissioner Nicholson said .
DRS has conducted similar compliance programs in the past and regularly sends letters to newly discovered cigarette websites to advise them of Connecticut ’s law against the shipment of untaxed cigarettes to unlicensed individuals in the state , as well as the requirements of the Jenkins Act .
Individuals who receive a notice should contact the Excise Unit Audit Division with any questions or comments at ( 860 ) 541-3224 .

US : Hundreds of thousands of jobless to lose health insurance subsidy
By Andre Damon
3 December 2009
Large numbers of people in the US will lose federal medical insurance assistance with the expiration of a $ 25 billion program included in the 2009 stimulus package .
The benefit was eliminated for many families beginning December 1 , and hundreds of thousands are set to follow each month .
Families that received the subsidy will have their health insurance premiums triple on average , making it extremely difficult to maintain coverage .
The program provided assistance to some seven million adults and dependent children , according to a preliminary survey , allowing them to remain insured during unemployment .
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985 , known as COBRA , provides unemployed workers with a means to maintain their employer - sponsored family health insurance for up to 18 months after losing their jobs .
In order to maintain the coverage , workers must pay their original premiums , together with the portion previously paid by their employer and an additional fee , making the program prohibitively expensive for many unemployed workers .
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( Obama ’s stimulus bill ) , passed in February , included a subsidy that paid 65 percent of coverage for up to nine months , leaving jobless workers to take care of the remaining 35 percent .
On December 1 , the first people to apply for the program were dropped , and more will follow every succeeding month .
A report published Tuesday by Families USA , a non-profit health care advocacy group , revealed that the average recipient of assistance will not be able to pay for family health insurance together with other necessities out of his or her unemployment check .
The report found that COBRA premiums for the average family cost $ 1,111 per month , leaving only $ 222 out of $ 1,333 in average unemployment benefits that such a family receives for other expenses .
The report also found that the average COBRA premium exceeds the average unemployment benefit check in a number of states .
In Mississippi , for example , “ the average monthly COBRA premium is 22 percent higher than the average unemployment payment , ” said Kathleen Stoll , director of health policy at Families USA , in a telephone interview .
“ A worker who wanted to keep their family secure would have to spend an average of 83.4 percent of their unemployment check , and obviously that ’s not feasible , ” said Ms. Stoll .
“ When workers lose their jobs , they often lose their health coverage as well , ” said Ron Pollack , Executive Director of Families USA , in a statement .
“ For millions of laid - off workers and their families , the federal COBRA subsidies have been a health - coverage lifeline .
It is essential , therefore , that new jobs legislation extends those subsidies . ”
The program will also remain closed for people who become unemployed after January 1 , 2010 , potentially leaving millions more without any way to pay for health insurance .
The Families USA report notes that “ this group of people will receive no COBRA subsidy at all , and , without a subsidy , most will not be able to afford coverage for either themselves or their families . ”
Being without health care coverage for any period of time is dangerous ; for those who become seriously ill or pregnant while uninsured , the situation may prove catastrophic .
People who are uninsured for over nine weeks lose the legal guarantee that they will be subsequently covered for any “ pre-existing ” medical condition under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , passed in 1996 .
Over 8.5 million people have lost their jobs since the start of the recession , and in October 5.6 million had been out of work for more than half a year .
Sixteen percent of the US population , or about 47 million people , have no health insurance .
“ There is a big difference between paying 35 percent of coverage and the full price , ” said Ms. Stoll .
“ The difference between having the subsidy and not having the subsidy is the difference between having insurance and not having insurance , and that means the difference between seeing a doctor or not .
It means that the people who lose coverage will face physical and financial devastation . ”
While various Democrats , including President Obama , have made public calls for the benefit to be reinstated , there is little indication that anything will be done about it soon .
Families USA said that while the House of Representatives may move to reinstate coverage this month , the Senate will likely wait until at least January , potentially leaving millions of additional people uninsured for months .
Two weeks ago , I announced the Bad Code Offsets project .
It 's a way to undo the bad code you other people have written without actually replacing the bad code .
Much like carbon offsets , money used to buy Bad Code Offsets goes towards open - source projects which not only produce good code , but produce software that helps developers build good software .
And when I say the money goes towards these projects , I mean all of it .
100 % .
We pay for all expenses — PayPal fees , material costs , postage , etc. — out of pocket .
But speaking of money , I ’m happy to announce that we ’ve raised $ 3,630.50 and are mailing out checks to the appropriate projects today .
Why Inedo ?
We 're still in the process of starting an official not - for - profit .
TRWTF is how much work that takes to do !
There are currently five projects supported , two of which — Drupal and FreeBSD — were added as a result of your feedback .
The donations break down as follows , with Drupal and FreeBSD getting revenue from those who said " Let the Alliance decide " where their contribution goes .
Apache $ 803.00 jQuery $ 1,500.50 Postgres $ 288.50 Drupal $ 288.50 FreeBSD $ 500.00
Now if you do the math , you 'll notice that the sum of the checks is $ 250.00 less than the cash received .
There 's a good reason for that .
Announcing The $ 500 Good Code Grant
Obviously , we 're not expecting to change the world with $ 500 .
We 'd just like to start or help something that maybe — just maybe — could make the world of code a better place .
Here 's how the grant works .
Tell us how your free and open source project prevents bad code from being created and show us how $ 500 would make a real difference in your project
— or —
Propose a new , free and open source project and show us how $ 500 would help you get it started
Will it work ?
I think it could .
The folks like John Resig who dedicate their nights and weekends to creating projects like jQuery have it hard enough developing their project code .
Then they have to recruit other developers , write unit tests , create documentation , and so on .
And then they have to pay real money , out of their own pocket , for things like hosting , logos , and hardware .
Imagine that : all that meta - work and expense just to do work to build something that 'll be free ?!
I think the least we can do is help with the expenses , and that 's what we , The Alliance for Code Excellence , hope grants like this can achieve .
Join the Alliance for Code Excellence
When we chose the name the Alliance for Code Excellence , it was somewhat tongue - in - cheek , to fit with the satirically pompous copy on the Bad Code Offsets site .
Well that , and Jeff already called dibs on the superhero theme with the whole League of ( web ) Justice thing .
That said , we do n't want to come across as actually being pompous .
Because we 're not .
We 're simply a group of colleagues who want to improve the state of software development industry , whether it 's through Bad Code Offsets , Good Code Grants , or whatever .
And we 're not even exclusive ; in fact , we 'd love it for you to join us .
The Alliance for Code Excellence is a not - for - profit venture that 's 100 % volunteer driven .
But we do have some real costs , such as legal fees ( a 501 ( c ) 3 is not quite DIY ) , materials costs ( printing Bad Code Offset certificates ) , postage ( especially for the overseas orders ) , and so on .
The costs are paid by the Alliance , not through Bad Code Offsets .
So if you like what we do , feel free to become a member .
A one - year membership is $ 50 and , as a welcoming gift , you 'll receive a black T - shirt with our logo on it .
Become a Patron Member Cost : $ 50.00 Select T - Shirt Size : Small Medium Large X - Large XX - Large XXX - Large
Do n't get me wrong : $ 50 is n't chump change and , quite honestly , you can buy several cool T - shirts for that .
But it 's not about the shirt , it 's about joining the team and doing what we do : spending hard - earned money and precious time to build a better tomorrow , one line of code at a time .
If you purchased Bad Code Offsets , you should be receiving your certificate (s ) in the mail in the next few weeks .
We 're a bit behind , but will get them out as soon as possible .
New study finds shock - wave therapy for unhealed fractured bones
When fractured bones fail to heal , a serious complication referred to as " nonunion " can develop .
This occurs when the process of bone healing is interrupted or stalled .
According to a new study published in the November 2009 issue of The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery ( JBJS ) , certain cases involving nonunions respond very well to shock - wave therapy .
Researchers say this non-invasive treatment is equally effective as surgery when it comes to healing the bone .
" We found that extracorporeal ( external to body ) shock - wave therapy was just as effective as surgery in helping to heal and repair nonunions , " said lead author of the study Angelo Cacchio , MD , a physiatrist who conducted the study with colleagues from the Division of Orthopaedic Surgery and the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at San Salvatore Hospital in L'Aquila , Italy .
Study authors say sparse surrounding vascular tissue and limited blood supply can lead to a nonunion and can subsequently delay or prevent healing .
This complication -- a nonunion -- often is very difficult to treat .
Dr. Cacchio and his colleagues analyzed data from 126 patients who had nonunions of the femur ( thigh bone ) , tibia ( shinbone ) , ulna ( forearm ) or radius ( forearm ) .
Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups and all patient outcomes were evaluated from 2001 to 2004 .
The patients in the three groups had similar demographic characteristics and similarly timed and developed nonunions .
The first two groups of patients received surgery to help repair their fracture .
The third received four shock - wave therapy sessions at weekly intervals , with 4000 impulses per session .
The study found that shock - wave therapy :
Stimulated healing of the bone within six months ; and
Provided a comparable outcome to surgery even two years following the treatment .
" When we examined patients and compared their outcomes at three and six months , initially those who received the shock - wave therapy actually felt better than those who had surgery , " explains Dr. Cacchio .
" When we examined patients at 12 and 24 months there were no significant differences in terms of healing .
Scans of the bones proved non-invasive shock - wave therapy worked just as effectively as surgery . "
Results of the study showed that nonunions had completely healed for approximately 70 % of all patients within six months .
Shock - wave therapy helps reduce pain and appears to induce a regeneration of bone by activating and stimulating certain growth factors .
The study found that this appears to prompt a metabolic reaction similar to what occurs during the natural bone - healing process .
" These findings are important because we have found that this non-invasive therapy is a safe and simple alternative to surgery , " notes Dr. Cacchio .
" This means orthopaedic surgeons and their patients now have more options to help repair a fracture that does not respond to initial treatment . "
Forget that tired old image of the moon as a entirely dry locale , devoid of any moisture .
A recent set of discoveries have found that not only is there water on Earth 's sole satellite — but the water is everywhere .

Three papers appearing in the upcoming issue of Science Express outline the discovery of pervasive water found clinging to the surface of the moon .
Infrared spectroscope measurements from three different space probes have detected absorptions that indicate the presence of water or hydroxyl ( which is , itself , a strong indicator for the presence of water ) on the the lunar surface , with one model suggesting water makes up a few tenths of a percent by weight in the optical surface .
This water is apparently clinging to the moon 's surface , rather than being absorbed by dust .
It 's hardly a vast lake , and it wo n't yet support that lunar agricultural colony you 've been dreaming of , but it 's far more water than scientists ever expected to find on the moon , and it could prove a valuable resource to future lunar visitors .
The researchers have also found that the concentration of water is higher toward the poles , lending credence to the theory that larger deposits of water exist near the poles , and researchers note that it 's possible we 'll continue to find wetter lunar regions in the future .

So where did all this water come from ?
Although meteors or comets may have periodically brought water to the moon , the prevailing theory among the three papers is that solar winds have carried hydrogen to the moon 's surface , where it has bonded with the oxygen in the moon 's own dust and produced water .

LITCHFIELD , Conn . —
“ This guy ’s the champion , ” said Patricia Brennan , a behavioral ecologist , leaning over the nether regions of a duck — a Meller ’s duck from Madagascar , to be specific — and carefully coaxing out his phallus .
The duck was quietly resting upside - down against the stomach of Ian Gereg , an aviculturist here at the Livingston Ripley Waterfowl Sanctuary .
Dr. Brennan , a post - doctoral researcher at Yale University and the University of Sheffield , visits the sanctuary every two weeks to measure the phalluses of six species of ducks .
When she first visited in January , the phalluses were the size of rice grains .
Now many of them are growing rapidly .
The champion phallus from this Meller ’s duck is a long , spiraling tentacle .
Some ducks grow phalluses as long as their entire body .
In the fall , the genitalia will disappear , only to reappear next spring .
The anatomy of ducks is especially bizarre considering that 97 percent of all bird species have no phallus at all .
Most male birds just deliver their sperm through an opening .
Dr. Brennan is investigating how this sexual wonder of the world came to be .
A portrait of the games market in Brazil , by me :
80's - we had the Atari in the beggining of the 80's , yeah , it was late , but better than never .
It was the most popular console through the eighties .
90's -
NES - Was never really popular here , a little amount of people had the original NES imported from the US or the Famicom imported from Japan ( those japanese descendent friends from school come to mind ) hehehe .
Nes ' licensed clones like Phantom System and Bit System , from brazilian company Dynacom were very popular here , more than the NES itself , although it was the same console with a different skin .
Master System - Immensely popular around here in the 90's , yeah , I know , 80's consoles were popular here in the 90's , but the latest consoles were also around .
It was officially supported and released by Tec Toy , the same company that released that third world console Zeebo nowadays .
Mega Drive ( Genesis ) - Huge success , also with official support from Tec Toy , it was supported until 2002 .
That 's right , it lasted looooong and it was very succesful .
Mind that games had the right price , and piracy was n't that popular , the prices were good , and there were plenty of rental stores ( which do n't exist today anymore , because of piracy ) .
Sega CD and 32 x were also officialy released and supported .
Super Nintendo -
Also a great success , with official support from Playtronic , a brazilian brand that had a partnership with Nintendo .
It was sold until 1999 more or less , I guess , I do n't remember it properly .
But almost all of the games were launched in the same day as they were in Japan and United States ( same with Mega Drive )
There WAS piracy for Mega Drive and Super Nintendo , but it was n't as huge as for the CD and DVD based machines , because in the cartridge time , the games were less expensive .
Saturn - Released officially in 1995 , was CRUSHED by the Playstation , just like the rest of the world .
Officially released , with prices somewhat expensive for games , but still officially supported .
But only diehard Sega fans had it , the Playstation crushed it with its library and the huge selection of pirated games .
Nintend0 64 - released officially in 1996 , lasted until 2001 , more or less .
Officially supported by Playtronic , just like Super NES .
Somewhat pirated , but the pirate games were expensive , so the few who had this console , most likely had original games .
Playstation - Imported , started the piracy boom in Brazil .
Everyone and their mom had pirated CD 's for 5 reais ( 2.50 dollars , that 's right ) against games that normally cost more than 80 dollars ( it was n't that expensive compared to what we have today ) still , the piracy won .
Dreamcast - Again , officially released and supported , but almost all of the people that had it played pirated copies , it was n't a huge success , but a small one among followers .
Gamecube -
Was also officially released by Playtronic , as the last officially released console from a joint - venture in the country with a good price tag .
was n't a Success , because the PS2 crushed it ( just like the PS1 did with Saturn and N64 ) .
PS2 - Same story as the PS1 , it got here as soon as it was released , and modded really soon .
The original games` prices were VERY HIGH already because Sony never released it officially .
They did n't , because of the piracy .
Officially released in 2009 , almost 2010 , making us brazilians look very stupid ...
Xbox -
Only knew two people with one , imported , not officially released , of course .
I do have one nowadays because I really like it and I 'm a collector .
Was n't even close to a success .
The small amount of those who had it pirated its games or brought them from the US , as you could almost never find them in stores .
Xbox 360 - Brought here in 2005 / 06 as soon as it was released , and modded afterwards .
It was officially released in 2006 by Microsoft , just like the PS2 , because they saw potential in the market .
But they are still clows selling it with a higher price than imported consoles .
Today I saw that there was a price drop , to 600 dollars on an official store , it 's still expensive , but it 's a start !!
Fan base split between modders and people that care about live and buy original games .
PS3 - Selling like hotcakes , somewhat , around here , after the price drop .
It 's a good move because it 's unpirateable and it 's still selling a good amount .
Available on every electronic / game store , but not officially released .
Wii - Just like the Xbox , there are pirates and official games , and a split fan - base .
It 's selling very well , just like every place in the world .
NOT officially released , but officially imported by Latamel , a partner of Nintendo .
I excluded portables , but Game Gear , Game Boy , DS , DSi , etc , etc .
Are all available here , with the last officially released one being Gameboy Advance , the others are imported .
PSP is also around , imported , also modded like hell by a lot of people ...
And now , the truth .
Mega Drive , Master System , and older consoles ARE still around .
But they are n't available on bigger stores like FNAC , or UZ GAMES , or Saraiva Mega Store .
They are only available on stores geared towards low waged people like Casas Bahia and Americanas .
They do n't have cartridges anymore , just games in their memories , and they sell for roughly 100 dollars , I know , still expensive !
But it 's not like you 'll go to UZ GAMES ( kinda like our version of Gamestop ) and find it .
You 'll ONLY find seventh generation stuff , current portables and the PS2 .
It took a while for me to write this , but you guys have to understand that the Mega Drive is n't popular with hardcore gamers here , they are sold to people that do n't have a lot of money and parent 's that really do n't know better and end up buying them from confusion for their kids .
Oh , I do play Mega Drive , but because I 'm a retro-fan and I play lots of older stuff .
But ask a brazilian kid with a good financial situation what a Mega Drive is ... he / she wo n't know ... they do n't even know what the Game Boy is ...
Now , I 'm not saying that if you toss it and leave it , I would n't pull up quick to retrieve it ...

I would highly recommend the Burnett Driskill law firm for anyone needing help working through the disability system ... and medical insurance .
I worked with Mr. Kyle Sciolaro on my case for years .
Anyone that is on disability knows that it ’s a stressful , emotional process .
Mr. Sciolaro was so patient , kind and compassionate with me not only getting through my disability insurance quickly .... but also working with UNUM Insurance which took years to fight he stayed in the fight with me !
Because I have clarity issues with my brain Mr. Sciolaro was extra patient with me .
I could not have gotten through this stressful process without his patience and understanding with my specific condition .
it ’s an ugly process to get through the insurance companies and Disability are not fun for anybody to work with .
I do n’t have the right words to express how much I appreciate Mr. Sciolaro ’s compassion he went above and beyond for me and never gave up .
He walked step by step with me on days when I had difficulties understanding he helped me understand the forms I was not able to fill out myself .
He took his time and patience to give me examples so that I understood it clearly such a wonderful kind compassionate man .
I could not have asked for a better person to get me through this .
So thankful￼￼￼ for all of his help .
As long as we worked together it felt I had a real friend on my side .
Some people you find along the way you feel should not be in certain professions .
Mr. Sciolaro is a blessing to the people that he works with in this difficult kind of work .
I wish more people had his kind of compassion in this world .
Thank you so much for everything !
You are a shining star in my book .

NASA has found a significant amount of water ice on the Moon !
Holy Haleakala !
On October 9 , the LCROSS spacecraft watched as a Centaur rocket booster slammed into the south pole of the Moon , hoping to determine if any water ice exists under the lunar surface .
The idea is that over millions of years , comet impacts and other events have brought water to the Moon .
Most of it goes away over time , but if any water happens to accumulate at the bottoms of craters at the poles , where the Sun never shines , it can stay put , frozen forever in shadow .
By impacting a spacecraft into the Moon , it can eject the ice where it gets hit by raw sunlight .
The water breaks down into hydrogen and hydroxyl molecules ( OH - ) , which can be directly detected .
The target crater , Cabeus , has a temperature on its floor of - 230 Celsius , cold enough to store ice .
The Centaur slammed into it at high speed , making a new crater about 20 meters across and splashing debris over an even bigger area .
A plume went up and out of the crater , and it was that tower of ejected material that had the telltale signs of water .
The infrared spectrometer on LCROSS definitely detected absorption lines from water , and the ultraviolet spectrometer saw it in emission .
Not only that , the emission got stronger with time , which clinches the deal !
That 's exactly what you expect by a plume containing water .
Wow .
The amount of water they found in the plume was a couple of hundred kilograms in total , but that indicates there is a lot more still lying on the surface .
They do n't know how much exactly just yet ; NASA wanted to release this news as soon as they were sure they had definite results , but there is still much to do .
Where did this water come from ?
How long has it been there ?
How accessible is it to future astronauts ?
These questions and more will , hopefully , be answered in the coming weeks and months as the data are analyzed more thoroughly .
So stay tuned .
There 's lots more good news to come !

The facts as presented by the Army and the media reference the shooting at Fort Hood just do n’t compute .
While I routinely dismiss any " facts " disseminated by the Army and the state ’s propaganda wing , sometimes referred to as the mainstream media ( MSM ) , there are some glaring inconsistencies in what has been reported about this tragedy .
First is the report the perpetrator was dead and then hours later the revelation that he was still alive .
Exactly how long does it take to determine if a person is dead or alive ?
Could it be no one knew whom the shooter or shooters were and a story had to be concocted for public consumption ?
What happened to the two other " suspects " that were detained ?
What did they do to qualify as suspects and more importantly , what information surfaced that led to their release ?
One of the suspects reportedly stated he " was with the shooter . "
Second is the number of victims from a single shooter .
Let us not forget this shooting did not occur at the mall , it occurred on a military installation where the victims had been trained in military tactics and some were combat veterans .
We are to believe they did nothing to stop a single shooter and he was allowed to reload several times and continue shooting and the only thing that stopped him was the arrival of a police officer after the gunman had gunned down over 40 people ?
And how so very convenient for the state , a perpetrator who was both anti-war and a Muslim ; just does n’t get any better than that .
Could this be an example of following the philosophy of Rahm Emanuel on dealing with a crisis ?

Third was the shutting down of communications in and around Ft. Hood for hours .
While the Army and the media will explain this in various scenarios , it also provided the Army with a chance to create whatever story it was they wanted to provide the public on the terrible tragedy .
Of course we all know the Army would never distort or lie about the facts involving the deaths of innocents .
Well , there is that My Lai thing .
People on the ground have told me cell phone towers were jammed to prevent unauthorized dissemination of information after the shooting .
Again , the Army would not want any information contrary to the company line emerging from this disaster .
All too convenient for the Army was the rapid release of negative information related to the alleged shooter .
It was said he received a negative evaluation report and that he had caused " red flags " to be raised some months ago concerning emails .
Do we know anything this detailed about the " suspects " who were released ?
The caveat was added that it was unclear as to whether the suspect was the author of those emails .
So , months ago , alarms were raised about emails the suspect might have sent , yet , in all those months the Army has been unable to determine who wrote them .
Yeah , right .
If red flags were in fact raised months ago , why did the Army do nothing ?
Going back to the 9/11 paradigm , we see the same evidence exhibited : the state had prior warnings but did not act on them .
This proves unequivocally the government is either incompetent or complicit in both events .
Yet , the state would have us all unarmed and depending on them for protection .

President Obama pledged , " to get answers to every single question about this event " but he also promised an end to signing statements , a transparent government , no more torture of detainees , and many more lies .
There has been speculation on the Internet that the shooting could have been a revolt against the Army from soldiers faced with stop- loss and multiple combat tours to Iraq and Afghanistan .
While there is no evidence to support this theory , there is also no evidence to support the official Army version of events .
Suicides among military personnel and veterans are at alarming levels , yet the Department of Defense does more to hide these facts than it does to deal with them .
The last thing the state can let happen is an awakening by its enforcement arm ( military and LE ) that they are nothing but tools of oppression and in fact , slaves to the monster they serve .
While the military is trained and encouraged to kill and bomb in the name of the state , they are forbidden the means of protection for themselves and their loved ones once they are outside the killing zones designated by the state .
All is not normal inside the military community .
This is not just seen in our military , instruments of oppression in other countries are revolting as well .
While it is doubtful we will ever learn the truth of exactly what happened at Fort Hood , we know with a degree of certainty the truth will never be revealed by the Army or the media .
Could this have been a false flag event to divert the attention of the American public from the debates and planned demonstrations against the health care fiasco ?
Could it have simply been another MK Ultra event to further demonize the anti-war element in this country and to lay another crime at the feet of the current villain du jour : Muslims ?
Could there be a connection between this alleged shooter and his fellow Virginia Tech shooter Seung Hui Cho , other than an oblique reference to Cho having a Muslim influence ?
One must always ask this question when faced with a story that is issued and controlled by the State : Cui Bono ?
Wonderful , is it not , the state is empowered with the unique ability to investigate its own lies and the power of the media and academia to demonize any who would question its veracity , and the support of Boobus , whose livelihood depends on the state ’s power to redistribute the wealth of the nation from producers to parasites .

AKRON , Ohio —
An Ohio pet store employee has been sentenced to six months ' probation for drowning two injured rabbits and showing off about it on Facebook .
A judge in Akron also ordered Liz Carlisle to do 120 hours of community service and fined her $ 250 on Thursday .
That was after the 20 - year - old woman changed her previous not guilty plea to guilty on two counts of animal cruelty .
Defense attorney Ron Gatts says Carlisle decided she wanted to put the case behind her .
He says she received death threats and was attacked verbally over a Facebook photo showing her with the rabbits .
The case led Petland Inc. to shut down the Akron store where Carlisle worked .
The chain said the rabbits suffered " horrific mistreatment . "
A major drop for Service ISM : the core part of the US economy is back into contraction mode .
From the press release :
( Tempe , Arizona ) — Economic activity in the non-manufacturing sector contracted in November after two consecutive months of expansion , say the nation 's purchasing and supply executives in the latest Non-Manufacturing ISM Report On Business ®.
The report was issued today by Anthony Nieves , C.P.M. , CFPM , chair of the Institute for Supply Management ™ Non-Manufacturing Business Survey Committee ; and senior vice president — supply management for Hilton Worldwide .
" The NMI ( Non-Manufacturing Index ) registered 48.7 percent in November , 1.9 percentage points lower than the 50.6 percent registered in October , indicating contraction in the non-manufacturing sector after two consecutive months of expansion .
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index decreased 5.6 percentage points to 49.6 percent , reflecting contraction after three consecutive months of growth .
The New Orders Index decreased 0.5 percentage point to 55.1 percent , and the Employment Index increased 0.5 percentage point to 41.6 percent .
The Prices Index increased 4.8 percentage points to 57.8 percent in November , indicating an increase in prices paid from October .
According to the NMI , six non-manufacturing industries reported growth in November .
Respondents ' comments remain cautious about business conditions and reflect concern over the length of time for economic recovery . "
A Massachusetts man is pursuing a $ 400 billion ( $ 430 billion ) lawsuit against Bon Jovi , Time Warner and Major League Baseball , among others .
Last year , Samuel Bartley Steele filed a lawsuit against the defendants for allegedly ripping off his ode to the Boston Red Sox entitled ( Man I Really ) Love This Team .
According to the complaint , the song was released in October 2004 and performed by the Bart Steele Band .
Mr Steele says he handed out copies to Red Sox executives , sent copies of the song to players , performed it live on local television and sent it to MLB with the idea for a " country " song that would market baseball .
During the 2007 play - offs , Bon Jovi released a song , I Love This Town , that was used by MLB to promote baseball on Time Warner 's TBS cable station .
Mr Steele claimed that frontman Jon Bon Jovi either heard the song when he was campaigning for John Kerry in Boston in 2004 or that some executive passed it along to him .
A district judge ruled that no reasonable jury could conclude there was substantial similarity between the songs and dismissed the claim .
But Red Sox fans do n't give up very easily .
Mr Steele has now taken his $ US400 billion claim to an appeals court .

On the surface , English , Japanese , and Kinande , a member of the Bantu family of languages spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo , have little in common .
It is not just that the vocabularies of these three languages are vastly different ; many of their rules of grammar diverge too .
Consider that in English , verbs must agree with their subject :
We say , “ I write , ” or “ he writes . ”
But Japanese has no need for such agreement , while in Kinande , agreement rules spread beyond subject - verb couplings to objects of a verb as well .
Despite such differences , English , Japanese , and Kinande share deep and previously unrecognized similarities pertaining to the way sentences are formed , says Shigeru Miyagawa , the Kochi-Manjiro Professor of Japanese Language and Culture , and a professor in MIT ’s Department of Linguistics and Philosophy .
Miyagawa describes these commonalities in a new book , “ Why Agree ?
Why Move ? ” published by MIT Press this fall .
The existence of similar structures in such otherwise disparate languages , Miyagawa asserts , provides strong evidence that all human languages have a common origin .
Miyagawa believes we have an innate faculty for language that shapes the form all languages take , an argument MIT ’s Noam Chomsky developed in his theory of Universal Grammar , in the 1950s .
In this view , we do not invent languages from scratch .
Rather , their eye - catching variation — from English to Japanese to Kinande — has evolved historically within specific limits .
“ Languages have this wonderful diversity , ” says Miyagawa , who is also head of the Foreign Languages and Literatures section at MIT .
“ But language is a biological system .
It does n’t vary in some wild way .
It can not just be anything .
Language is diverse within a highly defined pathway . ”
Linguistic layer cake
Miyagawa ’s book argues that a linguistic phenomenon known as “ movement ” reveals language ’s universal nature .
Think of a simple sentence , such as “ John ate a pizza . ”
We have numerous ways to manufacture more complex variations of that sentence .
For example : “ Which pizza did John eat ? ”
The subject , verb , and object remain the same .
However , the word order changes ; that movement helps provide the new meaning of the new sentence .
“ If there were no movement in human language , you could not ask questions , ” says Miyagawa .
“ We would go around all day just making statements : ‘ I drink coffee .
It is a nice day . ’
Movement happens so that human language has this rich expressive power , like asking questions , or giving orders .
Without movement , human language would be just a shadow of itself , impoverished . ”
Movement provides the same general function across languages .
“ When you look closely at sentences in any human language , there is a hierarchical structure , like two layers of a cake , ” Miyagawa explains .
The bottom layer is the “ argument structure ” of a sentence , and contains its core meaning ( the fact that John ate a pizza ) .
The top layer is the “ expression structure ” and adds complexity ( as in , “ Which pizza did John eat ? ” ) .
Movement is one way sentences can distinctively express those more complex ideas .
As a basic rule , says Miyagawa , where there is movement , there are also changes in agreement .
In English and Kinande ( and the Indo - European and Bantu language families they represent ) , shifts in agreement are an essential part of a sentence ’s movement toward greater complexity .
For instance , note the way the verb changes from “ ate ” to “ did eat ” in our pizza example .
In Kinande , the sentence “ Abakali ba - ka - gul - a esyongoko ” means , “ The women buy chickens . ”
But an alternate version , " Esyongoko si - ka - gul - a bakali , ” introduces movement , and a slightly altered Kinande verb ( the middle word in both sentences ) .
This means “ the WOMEN buy the chickens . ”
By emphasizing “ women , ” the second version adds information :
The person forming the sentence finds it especially important to note who is buying chickens .
That leaves a question :
If movement is universal and almost always enabled by agreement , how does movement occur in Japanese , which has no agreement ?
In a novel argument , Miyagawa claims that although agreement does not exist in Japanese , movement occurs through two alternate facets of the language , “ topic - marking ” and “ focus - marking . ”
Topic - marking is the mechanism by which a phrase is placed at the head of a sentence ; focus - marking uses intonation to do the same thing .
These tools allow for greater sentence complexity in Japanese , as agreement does in English or Kinande .
Take the Japanese sentence “ Taroo - mo hon -o katta , ” which means , “ Taro also bought a book . ”
In this case , mo is a focus - marking word , emphasizing that it is Taro who bought the book .
( “ Hon ” means book , and “ katta ” means bought .
Verbs come last in Japanese . )
An alternate version of the sentence , however , is “ Taroo - ga hon - mo katta . ”
Here , mo comes after “ book ” and changes the sentence ’s meaning to , “ Taro bought a book , too . ”
In this case the alternate construction adds complexity in Japanese by telling us Taro bought a book in addition to other activities .
While topic - marking and focus - marking have long been recognized parts of the Japanese language , other linguists have regarded them as optional parts of sentence composition .
Miyagawa believes they are essential in order to generate the full complexity of Japanese , a hypothesis he developed after realizing that topic - marking and focus - marking are considered necessary for movement in Hungarian , too .
So although “ Japanese seems to be out in left field , ” as Miyagawa puts it , by lacking the link between agreement and movement , it also has a “ core computational system ” that generates movement in other ways .
A case for universalism
Colleagues say “ Why Agree ?
Why Move ? ” is a significant contribution to comparative linguistics .
“ What I particularly liked is the three - way comparison , ” says Mark Baker , a professor of linguistics at Rutgers University .
“ He ’s one of the leading experts on Japanese syntax , and it ’s the first time somebody like that has looked at the Bantu languages in such depth . ”
If Miyagawa is right , his argument would provide more evidence in support of the Universal Grammar theory .
That position has been fiercely debated in recent years , following claims by linguist Daniel Everett of Illinois State University , who contends the Piraha people of Brazil have a uniquely impoverished language , lacking numbers and other standard attributes .
The Piraha language , in Everett ’s view , stems from a unique culture , not a universal language facility .
In a 2007 paper , MIT linguist David Pesetsky , along with the linguists Andrew Nevins of Harvard and Cilene Rodrigues of Emmanuel College , disagreed with Everett ’s claims , arguing many features of Piraha exist elsewhere .
Miyagawa says he thinks the response to Everett “ is quite compelling and convincing . ”
Still , he acknowledges , “ Science is such that we ’re always challenged .
And whatever we say about the Universal Grammar has to be provisional , with more and more research that we must do with other languages . ”
" Bundesrepublik hat Millionen Briefe konfisziert "
Historiker : Illegale Postzensur bis 1968 diente dem Staatsschutz
Josef Foschepoth im Gespräch mit Ulrike Timm
Millionen von Briefen , die bei der Post eingingen , erreichten nie ihren Empfänger .
( AP )
In der Bundesrepublik seien von 1950 bis 1968 bis zu 300 Millionen Postsendungen aus Osteuropa konfisziert und zum Teil vernichtet worden , sagte der Freiburger Historiker Prof. Dr. Josef Foschepoth .
Die illegale Postzensur habe dem Schutz vor östlicher Propaganda gedient .
Ulrike Timm : Eigentlich eine Selbstverständlichkeit : Der erste Leser eines Briefes , der an einen gerichtet ist , das ist man selbst .
Seit 60 Jahren ist das im Grundgesetz verankert : Artikel 10 , das Briefgeheimnis sowie das Post - und Fernmeldegeheimnis sind unverletzlich .
So weit , so klar , aber eben doch nicht verbindlich .
In den Anfangsjahren der Bundesrepublik bis in die 1960er hinein erreichten nämlich Millionen Postsendungen ihre Empfänger nicht – vor allem solche aus der DDR und Osteuropa .
Darauf ist der Freiburger Historiker Professor Dr. Josef Foschepoth gestoßen in einer ziemlich bestürzenden Recherche – und von Art , Ausmaß und Gründen dieser Zensur erzählt er uns jetzt .
Schönen guten Tag !
Josef Foschepoth : Guten Tag !
Timm :
Was war denn das für Post , die den Empfänger nicht erreichte ?
Foschepoth : Nun , das war einfach ganz normale Post , in der Regel die , die in der DDR auf die Post gebracht worden ist , die aber oftmals natürlich gespickt war auch mit Propagandamaterialien .
Und als man darauf gekommen ist , hat man dann eine doch immer weiter sich vertiefende , systematische Postzensur eingeführt .
Wir müssen bei dieser Postzensur zweierlei unterscheiden :
Auf der einen Seite waren die Alliierten , die eine solche Zensur ausüben durften aufgrund höheren Rechts – es galt ja noch das Besatzungsrecht in Deutschland bis 1955 – , und zum anderen natürlich haben sich auch die Deutschen daran beteiligt , sie waren teilweise Hilfskräfte , oder auch die Ämter der Alliierten waren ja bis zu 80 , 90 Prozent durch deutsche Mitarbeiter besetzt .
Beide hatten das gemeinsame Ziel , Sendungen zu überwachen , die aus Osteuropa und natürlich aus der , wie es damals hieß , sowjetisch besetzten Zone kamen .
Timm :
Wie umfangreich war denn diese Zensur , in welchem Ausmaß wurde zensiert ?
Foschepoth : Also das ist in der
Tat ein wenig bestürzend .
Die Zahlen , die ich nachweisen kann , also die exakt auch in den Quellen zu finden sind , besagen Folgendes :
In der Zeit von 1955 bis 1968 wurden alleine von deutschen Stellen 100 Millionen Postsendungen , aus der DDR überwiegend und geringer auch aus anderen osteuropäischen Staaten , zensiert , angehalten , teilweise vernichtet und haben nie den Empfänger erreicht .
Auf der anderen Seite gibt es dann noch die Zahlen , die ich durch Auswertung entsprechender Abrechnungen ermittelt habe , an die amerikanische Besatzungsmacht .
Wenn
Sie das alles mal hochrechnen und ganz ernsthaft dieses gemacht , ohne zu übertreiben , dann können Sie davon ausgehen , dass wir in der Zeit von 1950 bis 1968 in der Bundesrepublik Postsendungen konfisziert haben in der Größenordnung bis zu 300 Millionen Sendungen .
Timm : Und was geschah mit diesen Millionen Briefen , Schriftstücken , Päckchen , die ihren Empfängern vorenthalten wurden ?
Foschepoth : Das war natürlich ein großer logistischer Aufwand .
Das heißt also , das sah konkret so aus , dass in der Regel Beamte , Postbeamte kurz nach der Grenze , hinter der Zonengrenze die Züge bestiegen und dann schon vorsortierten .
Dann wurden die in sogenannte zentrale Sammelstellen gebracht in Hamburg , Hannover , in Bebra und in Hof .
Bis dahin hatte man alles schon vorsortiert , und dann wurde die Post , die einem verdächtig vorkam , an die entsprechenden Stellen weitergegeben .
Das waren in der Regel Zollbeamte oder am Anfang erst sofort die Polizeibeamten , die es dann vor Ort vernichteten .
Und später wurde das etwas geordneter gemacht und ging dann seinen
Weg über den Staatsanwalt , der dann einen Beschlagnahmebeschluss des Richters herbeiführte .
Und dann landete das meistens irgendwo in Vernichtungsräumen .
Und ein Beispiel kann ich nennen aus Hannover : Dort war eine große Zentrale eingerichtet , eine sogenannte Postvernichtungszentrale , wo Strafgefangene dann im Gefängnis diese Post zu vernichten hatten .
Timm : Also letztlich war es Kalter Krieg mit dem Reißwolf .
Gab es denn irgendwelche Kriterien , um zu unterscheiden , das ist staatsgefährdendes Material aus dem Osten und das ist der Brief von Tante Frieda aus Leipzig – hat man da differenziert ?
Foschepoth : Nein , aber auch das ist ja im Postgesetz eigentlich nicht vorgesehen .
Niemand hat das Recht auch zu prüfen , welche Postsendung und welchen I nhalt man in einer Postsendung verschickt .
Normalerweise hätte auch nicht die Staatsanwaltschaft gegen solche , wie auch immer , tatsächlichen oder vermeintlichen Propagandasendungen vorgehen dürfen .
Und dennoch hat man es getan .
Timm :
Wer hat das eigentlich angeordnet und bestimmt , dass und in welcher Form Post aus der DDR insbesondere kontrolliert wurde ?
Foschepoth : Gut , das war die Bundesregierung , das heißt , es wurde abgestimmt zwischen den verschiedenen Ministerien .
Der Bundespostminister war sicherlich derjenige , der die größte Sorge noch hatte , weil er hat immer darum gekämpft , eine gesetzliche Grundlage zu bekommen .
Beteiligt waren ferner das Bundesjustizministerium , vor allem das Innenministerium , die ja mit der Strafverfolgung beschäftigt war , und dann noch das Bundesfinanzministerium als zuständiges Ministerium für die Zollbeamten .
Timm : Deutschlandradio Kultur , das " Radiofeuilleton " , im Gespräch mit dem Historiker Josef Foschepoth .
Herr Foschepoth , das Briefgeheimnis sowie das Post - und Fernmeldegeheimnis sind unverletzliche Beschränkungen , dürfen nur aufgrund eines Gesetzes angeordnet werden .
So steht es seit 60 Jahren im Grundgesetz , Sie sprachen es an .
Eine Bestimmung , die Ausnahmen hätte begründen und regeln können , die gab es bis 1968 nicht .
Hatte denn bei der Zensur , von der Sie uns berichten , niemand demokratische Bauchschmerzen , ein schlechtes Gewissen – das ist doch einfach klar grundgesetzwidrig ?
Foschepoth : Ja , das ist gerade noch das Erstaunliche , dass man durchaus diese Schmerzen hatte und man versucht hat auch , diese Schmerzen ein wenig zu bearbeiten , indem man hergekommen ist und hat Verordnungen erlassen , hat bestimmte Paragrafen geändert und hat um das Grundgesetz herum gewissermaßen gesetzliche Regelungen geschaffen oder auch Rechtsgutachten im Bundesjustizministerium verfasst , die alle das Ziel hatten , sagen wir mal , den Schaden ein bisschen zu begrenzen , vor allem dann , wenn der Beamte vor Ort – oder möglicherweise auch Beamte im Ministerium – eines Tages mal belangt werden würden .
Timm : Aber alle demokratischen Bemühungen schlug die große Angst vor dem wilden Osten ?
Foschepoth : Ja , und zwar deshalb , die Chance wäre ja da gewesen , man hätte ja ein solches Gesetz verabschieden können .
Und da liegt der eigentliche Skandal , dass man durchaus schon 1955 , das heißt also mit Verabschiedung des Deutschlandvertrages , der ja die Bundesrepublik in die Souveränität entließ , ein solches Gesetz hätte machen können .
Nur , man wollte dieses eigentlich nicht bzw .
befürchtete , dass der Bundestag und dass die Öffentlichkeit in große Unruhe kämen , wenn also jetzt zehn Jahre nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges eine solche Postzensur gesetzlich geregelt würde , denn die hätte dann auch zur Voraussetzung gehabt , dass man gewissermaßen den Alliierten einen entsprechenden Eingriff in das Post - und Fernmeldegeheimnis per Gesetz erlaubt hätte .
Darauf hatten die nämlich bestanden .
Timm : Gehen wir mal einen Moment weg von der juristischen Ebene noch mal auf die lebenspraktische Ebene : Das muss doch aufgefallen sein , wenn Post nicht ankommt – gab es denn keine Proteste , dass jemand gesagt hat , ich hab meinen Brief nicht bekommen , ich hab mein Buch nicht gekriegt , wo ist das ?
Foschepoth : Sehr richtig , es gibt eine ganze Reihe von Protesten auch natürlich in den Akten , aber es ist einfach immer individuell gewesen , es ist nicht so eine breite gesellschaftliche Bewegung gewesen .
Das lag auch daran , dass man in den 50er - Jahren wohl den Staatsschutz höher einschätzte als die Grundrechte .
Wir waren ja noch in ziemlicher Nähe auch zum Nationalsozialismus , das war ja gar nicht so lange vorbei , und ein starker Staat war der absolut höhere Wert als die Sicherung der Grundrechte .
Und diese Einstellung hatte sich durchaus aufgrund dieser Konfrontation mit dem Osten auch in der Bevölkerung verbreitet , sodass man nur bei einigen wenigen Menschen zunächst einmal Kritik und teilweise auch massiven Widerstand feststellen konnte – auch bei Richtern übrigens , die nicht mehr bereit waren , sich hier als Vollzugsorgane der Polizei zur Verfügung zu stellen .
Das hat es alles gegeben , hat aber letztendlich nicht zu einer grundlegenden Änderung geführt , bis , sagen wir , 1963 , wo es dann den ersten großen Skandal gab – Skandale sind ja immer wichtig in einer Demokratie , die bringen etwas ans Licht – , der sogenannte Abhörskandal , wo bekannt wurde , dass der Verfassungsschutz nicht nur gewissermaßen über viele ehemalige Mitarbeiter der SS und SA verfügte , sondern auch seit Jahren sich an einer Postzensur beteiligt hatte , zu der er laut Grundgesetz nicht berechtigt war .
Timm : Herr Foschepoth , die Bundesrepublik wusste ja um die Zensur in der DDR und auch um die Methoden , und sie hat immer alles dafür getan , um sich davon möglichst wohltuend abzuheben .
Hat sich denn niemand gefragt , warum Westdeutschland in diesem Punkt – Post aus Osteuropa – offenbar ganz ähnlich handelte ?
Foschepoth : Ich hab mir diese Frage natürlich auch gestellt , und sie trifft natürlich einen Kern des Problems bei einer vergleichenden Betrachtungsweise .
Wenn wir das , was in der Bundesrepublik vorgegangen ist , beurteilen wollen , auch historisch korrekt , dann dürfen wir natürlich in diesem Falle nicht die DDR als Maßstab nehmen und sagen , die haben das ja auch gemacht , also warum , im Kalten Krieg durften wir das dann auch , sondern wir waren natürlich ein Rechtsstaat und haben es trotzdem gemacht .
Und es war allerdings so häufig – das finden Sie dann auch in den Akten – die saloppe Formulierung :
Wir müssen es machen wie die DDR , nur besser .
Und natürlich wurde in der DDR Post zensiert , und zwar auch in großem Maße .
Und hier in der Bundesrepublik , das war ja bislang nicht bekannt , ist es ja wirklich auch flächendeckend im Umkehrschluss gemacht worden mit der DDR - Post oder auch mit der Post aus Berlin in die Bundesrepublik rein .
Also insofern , wir haben unsere Maßstäbe für die Bewertung der Vorgänge in der Bundesrepublik ja auf unsere gesetzlichen Grundlage zu beziehen , Grundgesetz und sonstige gesetzliche Regelungen , und können uns nicht in diesem Falle mit der DDR vergleichen .
So der Eindruck , wie er jetzt gerade anlässlich der Feierlichkeiten zum 60 .
Geburtstag immer wieder vermittelt wird , als sei das die geglückte und glückliche Republik und Demokratie gewesen – war sie von Anfang an eben nicht .
Die Belastungen waren deutlich größer und es hat wirklich einige schmerzhafte Prozesse gegeben , und dazu gehört eben auch die Verletzung von Grundrechten .
Timm : Das Briefgeheimnis war sehr löchrig , zumindest wenn die Post aus Osteuropa kam , in den Jahren bis 1968 .

Herzlichen Dank fürs Gespräch !
Foschepoth : Gerne .
91 years ago , the world marked the end of the Great War that had consumed tens of millions of lives , mostly those of young men sent to die far from home in a cause that few could explain , then or now .
It was a false dawn .
The chaos unleashed by the Great War spawned more and greater wars , revolutions and genocides that continued through most of the 20th century and still continue , in places , even to this day .
I ’ve written in the past about the futility of war , and that is the most important thought for this day of remembrance .
But there is something else that demands more attention than it has received .
The cataclysm of the Great War brought forth monsters like Hitler and Stalin , who killed millions .
But the War itself , with the millions and tens of millions of lives it took , directly and indirectly , was loosed on the world by political leaders more notable for mediocrity than for monstrous greatness .
The names of Asquith , Bethmann - Hollweg , Berchtold and Poincare are barely remembered , yet on any reasonable accounting they belong among the great criminals of history .
Not only did they create the conditions for war , and rush ( eagerly in most cases ) into it , they carried on even as the death toll mounted into the hundreds of thousands and beyond .
Even as the original grounds for war became utterly irrelevant , they continued to intrigue for trivial postwar benefits , carving up imagined conquests among themselves .
Eventually , most were displaced by leaders who were marginally less mediocre , and more determined to win at all costs ( Lloyd George , Clemenceau , Ludendorff , Hindenburg and others ) .
How could such ordinary , seemingly decent , men pursue such an evil and self - destructive course , and yet , in most cases , attract and retain the support of their people ?
I find it hard to understand .
A study released Wednesday which found that nine of 10 babies tested were born with bisphenol A in their systems has renewed calls for the chemical to be banned .
In the study commissioned by the Environmental Working Group , scientists found the chemical in nine of 10 randomly selected samples of umbilical cord blood .
Previous studies have found BPA in the urine of 93 % of Americans tested .
But Wednesday 's study is the first to find it in the cord blood of U.S. newborns .
" It 's alarming , " Janet Gray , director of the Environmental Risks and Breast Cancer project at Vassar College , said of the study results .
" What more evidence do we need to act ? "
More than 6 billion pounds of BPA are used each year to make polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins .
The chemical is used in thousands of common products , including the lining of nearly all food and beverage cans and as coating for carbonless paper receipts .
BPA , which was developed as a synthetic estrogen , has been linked to breast and prostate cancer , cognitive and behavioral problems , reproductive failures , heart disease , diabetes , asthma and obesity .
Scientists and health advocates have called for the chemical to be banned but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has declared it to be safe for all uses - though that decision , based on two studies paid for by the chemical industry , is being reviewed .
The FDA 's decision had been due Monday , but the agency postponed its decision .
Agency officials said they are working to complete it within weeks .
BPA makers maintain that BPA is safe .
" The mere presence of a chemical in our bodies does not mean there is a threat to human health , " said Steven Hentges , chief lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council , representing BPA makers .
News of the cord blood study came on the same day a U.S. Senate subcommittee met to consider an overhaul of laws governing the nation 's toxic chemicals .
The Toxic Substances Control Act was passed in 1976 , intending to give the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to ban toxic chemicals .
Since then , however , the agency has n't banned a single substance , including asbestos .
Loopholes have allowed companies to withhold information about the chemicals they manufacture - including the names of the chemicals .
Linda Birnbaum , director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , testified the law needs to be strengthened .
She urged a review of BPA which , she said , has been found to interfere with the body 's endocrine system , even at small doses .
" We need to protect our children at critical times of their development , " she said .
Chemical makers and their lobbyists say they support an overhaul of the laws .
But they do not advocate restrictions on BPA .
Canada has banned BPA for use in baby bottles .
Similar bans have passed in Massachusetts , Connecticut , the city of Chicago and two counties in New York .
Most major baby bottle manufacturers have stopped using BPA .
Laws have been introduced in Congress to ban BPA in all food contact items .
A hearing in the Wisconsin Assembly on a proposed state ban is set for 10:45 a.m. Wednesday in the State Capitol , Room 300 NE .
We 're not claiming to be experts on marketing or anything , but Cables To Go should really consider a name change .
The outfit who 's job it is to make your life one that 's completely devoid of cables has pumped out yet another cord - free solution in the Wireless USB Superbooster Extender .
Said device , which has an admittedly sensational name , is comprised of two pieces : a receiver that connects to your USB - equipped PC via a standard USB cable and a wireless dongle that connects to whatever USB device you 'd like to make wireless ( a printer , a scanner , a heated blanket , whatever ) .
The kit provides cordless connectivity up to 150 feet ( even through walls ) , though you 'll be paying dearly to take advantage .
How dearly ?
$ 189.99 -- yeah , that dearly .

[ Haskell - cafe ] call for help : FOSDEM devroom
Hi , I 'm thinking of trying to get a devroom for haskell.org at the next FOSDEM , which is Saturday - Sunday February 6th - 7th 2010 in Brussels : http://www.fosdem.org/2010/call-developer-rooms
The idea would be to try to introduce Haskell to people at FOSDEM who were interested , and thus help build our ties with We 'd try to have a few introductory talks about Haskell , and some demos etc .
It would probably also make sense to talk about / demo darcs at the same time .
Apparently there 's a lot of demand so it 's a bit of a long shot , and I expect we'd only get one day , which is probably all we 'd need .
To make this work , we 'll need several reasonably experienced Haskellers to turn up to help out with the talks , demos and talking to people in general .
I 've got a couple of people interested already but need more .
So , please could you let me know , preferably within the next week , whether you would be interested in coming along and helping .
You can email me directly or on - list as you prefer .
The deadline for actually making the application for the devroom is 22nd November .

The Komagata Maru attracted a lot of attention while she was in port
[ Photo : City of Vancouver Archives # CVA 7-129 ]
Komagata Maru On May 23 , 1914 a ship called the Komagata Marunormally used for transporting coalarrived at Vancouver and anchored in Burrard Inlet .
She carried 376 Indians : 12 Hindus , 24 Muslims and 340 Sikhs , British subjects all , and people who had come to make a new life in Canada .
( In this article  Indians  means people from India .  )
The arrival of the Komagata Maru had a convulsive effect on the city .
There was already deep - seated prejudice against non-white residents in the area , mostly Chinese and some Japanese .
Anti-Oriental riots had occurred as recently as 1907 .
That was also the year 901 Sikhs had arrived in Vancouver aboard the Canadian Pacific steamer Monteagle .
Many white residents particularly those who felt their jobs were threatened decided the new arrivals must be prevented from getting off the ship .
They had a lot of official sympathy .
The federal government was pressuring steamship companies to stop selling tickets to Indians .
In 1907 Ottawa passed a bill denying Indians the right to vote .
They were prohibited to run for public office or serve on juries , and were not permitted to become accountants , lawyers or pharmacists .
The provincial government had passed laws specifically intended to discourage their immigration .
They had to have at least $ 200 on their person to enter British Columbia the average Indian earned about 10 cents a day and they had to have come via direct passage from India .
Left from Hong Kong The Komagata Maru had not left from India .
She had departed April 4th , 1914 from Hong Kong with 150 passengers , picked up another 111 in Shanghai four days later , 86 more on the 14th at Moji in Japan and a final 14 at Yokohama .
Then she headed to Canada .
The ships journey was intended as a direct challenge to BCs exclusionist laws .
She had been chartered by Gurdit Singh , an affluent Hong Kong businessman .
Word of the ships approach reached Canada and newspapers picked up the story .
The Province newspaper headlined its report  Boat Loads of Hindus on Way to Vancouver . 
( To white Canadians , it seems , all Indians were Hindus . )
Other headlines referred to a " Hindu Invasion . "
Indians who already lived here began to gather and discuss how to help the new arrivals .
On May 23 , seven weeks after she left Hong Kong , the Komagata Maru arrived in Vancouver .
Waiting Komagata Maru in Vancouver harbor Canadian and BC authorities were waiting for her .
They refused permission for the passengers to leave the ship , saying it had not arrived via direct passage from India and most of the passengers did not have the $ 200 required to enter British Columbia .
They repeated their demand that the ship leave .
The passengers refused .
They were denied food and water , but local supporters managed to supply the men , women and children aboard the ship .
Desperate , the passengers seized control of the vessel .
Attempts by local mobs to expel them were met by a hail of bricks from the people aboard .
( One of those bricks made , incidentally , in Japan is preserved at the Vancouver Museum . )
Vancouver mayor Truman Baxter organized an anti-Asian rally , and the first speaker was the prominent politician H.H. Stevens .
 I have no ill - feeling against people coming from Asia personally ,  he told the crowd , but I reaffirm that the national life of Canada will not permit any large degree of immigration from Asia . . .
I intend to stand up absolutely on all occasions on this one great principle of a white country and a white British Columbia . 
Stevens speech was followed by thunderous applause .
In June a board of inquiry found all the passengers inadmissible .
But without supplies for the return voyage , the ship would not leave .
The Vancouver Maritime Museum picks up the story :  In the early morning hours of July 19 , 1914 , Sea Lion , with 35 specially deputized immigration officers , armed with rifles borrowed from the Seaforth Highlanders , and 125 Vancouver Police officers , approached Komagata Maru to force the vessel from Vancouver harbour .
The enraged passengers resisted any effort to board their ship .
Manning the rail , an armed group shouted and threatened to board the tug if she made fast .
Nonetheless , Sea Lions captain brought her in close , grappled and then tied on to Komagata Maru .
Passengers and police then battled , as one man with an axe chopped at Sea Lions line .
Finally , as a gunman aboard the ship opened fire on the tug , the line was cut and the tug retreated looking as if it had run under a coal chute .
Finally , the new Royal Canadian Navy in its first official task was called in .
Its ship , an elderly training vessel , HMCS Rainbow , entered Burrard Inlet July 21 and trained its six - inch guns on the Komagata Maru .
( This was the first appearance of an RCN vessel in Vancouver . )
On July 23 , 1914 exactly two months after she had arrived the Komagata Maru was forced to leave the city .
Some 20 of its passengers who already had resident status had been allowed to disembark .
The more than 300 others had to return .
William Hopkinson
This incident naturally raised tensions among members of Vancouver 's Sikh community .
Some had a particular enmity for Yorkshire - born William Hopkinson , a local immigration official , who had once served on the Calcutta Police Force and who had an affinity for Indian languages .
He spoke Hindi fluently , and could get by in Punjabi .
Hopkinson had come to Vancouver in 1907 , and was hired by the Canadian Government as an immigration inspector and interpreter .
He was also monitoring the activities of East Indian extremists living in British Columbia , and developing a network of pro-British Sikh informants .
( He also apparently disguised himself as a Sikh named Narain Singh , and gathered more information in this way ! )
He had been one of the men aboard the Sea Lion .
On October 14 , 1914 a man named Mewa Singha supporter of India 's independence movement shot Hopkinson to death at the provincial courthouse in Vancouver .
Mewa would be hanged January 11 , 1915 for the murder .
A hall in the Ross Street Sikh Gurdwara is named for him .
Tragedy The Komagata Maru story had not yet ended .
On September 26 , 1914 the ship , with its passengers now having been aboard for a miserable four months , approached Calcutta .
A British gunboat stopped the ship and held the passengers as prisoners .
Then they were taken to a place called Baj Baj , a Calcutta suburb , and told they were being sent to Punjab on a special train .
 Many of the passengers ,  says one website www.sikhpioneers.org about the incident , did not want to go to Punjab .
They had business to attend to in Calcutta , some wished to look for work there , and most importantly , the passengers wanted to place the Guru Granth Sahib , which they had taken with them on their journey , in a Gurdwara ( Sikh place of worship ) in Calcutta . 
The arrival at Baj Baj
[ image : www.Sikhpioneers.org]
The Guru Granth Sahib could be described as the scripture of the Sikhs .
They hold the book in great reverence and treat it with the utmost respect .
The British officials refused this request and repeated their insistence that all the passengers would be put on the train to Punjab .
The passengers rebelled and began to march toward Calcutta .
They were forced back to Baj Baj and ordered to board the ship again .
Led by Gurdit Singh , they refused .
A police officer attacked Singh , but was stopped by another passenger .
Then gunfire broke out .
Twenty passengers were killed , another nine were wounded .

Coda On May 23 , 2006 --- 92 years to the day after the arrival of the ship --- The Vancouver Sun published an article by Kim Bolan beginning :  Descendants of passengers aboard the ill - fated Komagata Maru want to open discussions with the federal government about a formal apology and possible compensation over Canada 's racist immigration laws early this century . 

It 's not quite as delicious when Sony ( in a rare move ) has actually confirmed its console for a release to market , but just because we know the 250GB PS3 is landing in the US on November 3rd does n't mean we can't derive any enjoyment at all by the fact that it 's been spotted at a Best Buy in Houston , all primed for the shelves .
Since the shipment 's obviously already been made , we suppose we 'll be seeing a few instances of early stocking of the console over the next couple of days , unless Best Buy has considerably cleaned up its act when it comes to launch dates -- doubtful !

Anticipation is supposedly sweet , but you know what ?
Instant gratification is a hell of a lot sweeter .
Sure , we could sit patiently and wait for official announcements on our favorite franchises .
We could avoid assumption , steer clear of speculation and only publish our opinion when it ’s unequivocally backed by cold , hard press release fact .
That would n’t be very much fun , though , and would n’t make the months and years until release go by any faster .
So instead , we ’re giving in to the guessing game .
We ’re embracing our wild theories , passionate predictions and somewhat educated estimates .
And we want you to do so as well …
Got a big idea about a big sequel ?
Read ours , then share your own in the comments below .
If we like it , we may include it in an upcoming feature .
What ’s already happened : Unassuming bartender Desmond Miles was kidnapped by the Abstergo corporation , a shadowy front for a centuries - old secret society called the Templars , to be a test subject in its experiments .
Abstergo then hooked him up to the Animus , a machine that brought to life the “ genetic memories ” of his ancestor , Altair Ibn La-Ahad , and shed light on a secret war between the Templars and the Assassin Brotherhood over ancient , mind - controlling relics called “ Pieces of Eden . ”
Desmond was then rescued from Abstergo by modern - day Assassin operatives and hooked up to another Animus , this time with the goal of teaching him the skills of a different ancestor , Ezio Auditore .
However , Ezio ’s journey ended with an apocalyptic revelation , addressed specifically to Desmond , which stands to completely change the course of the series .
What ’s coming next :
While there ’s been a lot of speculation about what era of history the next Assassin ’s Creed will drop players into , those who ’ve seen the ending know that the most likely answer is “ the near future . ”
Much as we ’d love to see another historical setting lavishly re-created , the things revealed to Ezio paint a dire picture of imminent doom for Earth .
Simply put , if Desmond and the Assassins plan to act on these revelations , there wo n’t be any time for dicking around in the Animus – the Vaults left behind by the mysterious precursors to humanity need to be found immediately , so that their secrets can be used to save the planet from cataclysmic disaster .
With that in mind , we can think of two likely outcomes for Assassin ’s Creed III : the first is that Desmond , with his newfound Assassin skills , will embark on a journey into the modern world to find the Vaults himself , battling misguided Templars ( who will likely see an impending doomsday scenario as a chance to “ cleanse ” humanity and tighten their hold on it ) all the way .
Alternately , he could continue working behind the scenes in the Animus , mining the genetic memories of ancestors who ’ve discovered the Vaults while Assassin field teams handle the task of securing them .
But sooner or later , those abilities he learned as Ezio are going to come into play , meaning we ’ll likely see a lot of free - running across Mirror ’s Edge - style cityscapes , mixed in with Tomb Raider - esque exploration of ruins and classical landmarks .
What ’s already happened : Both games share the same basic tale – four everyday people survive a zombie apocalypse and join forces to shoot , stab and slash their way to the nearest rescue point .
Thing is , there ’s not a lot of direct story told , so even at this point all we know is the infection has spread across the country .
No one knows how to stop it and the people surviving may actually be immune to the whole damn thing .
The first game takes place in the northeast United States and ends in the Great Lakes , while L4D2 begins in Georgia and finishes up in New Orleans , which is being bombarded by the military in a last - ditch attempt to contain the virus .
What ’s coming next : Judging by that map ( and another in L4D2 ’s Dead Center campaign ) , most of the US is compromised , save perhaps the mysteriously absent northwest coastline .
We do n’t think Seattle would be drastically different from the weather and topography already covered , so we think Valve ’s going to take the infection global .
It ’s the third game , which means the stakes and scenario have to really blow up to stand apart from the first two , and with that in mind we ’d love to see L4D do Japan .
Above : Art by Tyler Wilde
L4D3 could begin inside the largest , glitziest , most visually dazzling city in the world and follow four survivors through what has now become a pandemic .
You ’d storm through nerd capital Akihabara , fight through the grounds of Osaka Castle and explore the rich wilderness of Japan ’s hot springs , rice fields and active volcanoes , ensuring totally different geography and atmosphere from the first two games .
Oh , the survivors ?
We had a young Yakuza ( hardened but not quite ruthless ) ; a Lolita girl ( probably on her way to a Con when everything went to hell ) ; an overworked Salaryman who ’s actively loving the infection as it ’s a break from his rigid , unbreakable routine ; and finally a British tourist caught overseas during the outbreak .
Or it could be in Vegas .

Police believe Angus Sinclair may have murdered at least seven women
The Scottish government is set to introduce legislation that could see Angus Sinclair stand trial over the World 's End murders for a second time .
The proposals to end the double jeopardy rule were disclosed by Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill in an exclusive interview with BBC Scotland .
Sinclair was cleared in 2007 of killing Helen Scott and Christine Eadie .
Mr MacAskill said the Crown would have the government 's " full support " if it wished to re-prosecute Sinclair .
Sinclair 's trial for killing Ms Scott and Ms Eadie , in what became known as the World 's End murders , controversially collapsed after a High Court judge ruled he had no case to answer - although police and relatives of Ms Scott and Ms Eadie remain convinced of his guilt .
Our view is that the law officers should have the right , and if it is retrospective , then so be it
Kenny MacAskill
Justice secretary
The laws on double jeopardy prevent anyone who has already been cleared of committing a crime from standing trial for a second time over the same offence , even if new evidence comes to light .
But signalling his intention to end the 800 - year - old rule , Mr MacAskill said if fresh evidence against Sinclair was found in the World 's End case , the hands of prosecutors should not be tied .
He said : " People who commit heinous crimes and for whatever reason closure does not occur , we owe it to the victims , to the families , to the communities to allow action to be taken .
" The decision about whether a case should be re-prosecuted and double jeopardy should be overturned will ultimately be a matter for law officers .
" But our view is that the law officers should have the right , and if it is retrospective , then so be it .
The law officers will have our full support . "
Mr MacAskill , who said the World 's End case had " scarred the soul of Scotland " , stressed that exceptions to the double jeopardy rule should only occur when new and compelling evidence emerged , or an admission of guilt was made .
But he said the government had " a direction of travel " that had to reflect the 21st Century .
Sexual violence
The move would bring Scotland into line with changes made to the law in England and Wales four years ago , since when there have been three successful re-prosecutions .
However , it would go against recommendations made last week by the Scottish Law Commission , which said any change to the law should not be applied to cases retrospectively .
It is likely the matter will come before the Scottish Parliament early next year , and with opposition parties signalling their support for a change to the double jeopardy law it is likely to pass through easily .
BBC Scotland understands the Crown has carefully preserved forensic evidence from Sinclair 's trial , and is re-examining all aspects of the case - particularly the DNA - with a view to launching a fresh prosecution against him .
Sinclair , who has a long history of sexual violence and is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of Mary Gallacher in 1978 , is suspected of being a serial killer who is also responsible for the deaths of at least six other women , including Ms Scott and Ms Eadie .
The bodies of Ms Scott and Ms Eadie , who were both 17 , were found about six miles apart in East Lothian in 1977 .
The teenage friends , who were last seen alive leaving the World 's End pub in Edinburgh 's Royal Mile , had both been stripped , beaten and sexually assaulted .
Sinclair 's DNA was found at the scene .
Ms Scott ( left ) and Ms Eadie were last seen alive leaving the World 's End pub Morain Scott , the father of Helen Scott , welcomed the potential abolition of double jeopardy .
He told the BBC : " Our understanding is that all political parties are in support of changes to the double jeopardy rule and we hope that early agreement will be reached and our Scottish Parliament will make the right decision and allow the re-trial of Angus Sinclair for the murders of Helen and Christine .
" The comments made by Kenny MacAskill give us some confidence that we will still get the closure that we expected two years ago and we look forward to justice being delivered this time . "
Paul McBride QC , who spoke out strongly against the Law Commission 's decision last week , also welcomed the announcement .
He said : " I 'm delighted that the justice minister has decided to overturn the patently illogical recommendation from the Scottish Law Commission and follow the path preferred by all the other political parties as well as the public .
" If one thinks of rape cases involving children , rape cases involving adults , horrific murder cases , and new evidence of a compelling nature comes to light that was n't available at the trial that demonstrates beyond any question the person is guilty , is it right as a society to say that persons should go free ? "
Scotland 's Secret Serial Killer will be broadcast on Thursday at 2100 GMT on BBC2 Scotland and will be available on the BBC iPlayer .

Biggest changes in Wt 3
Let ’s step back and review the biggest changes since we started evelopment of the Wt 3 branch ( starting at Wt 2.99.0 ) :
Signal accessors Signals are now accessed through an accessor method , rather than being exposed with a public member .
Previously , you would write :
WPushButton * button = new WPushButton ( " Click me " ) ; button -> clicked .
connect ( SLOT ( button , WPushButton :: disable ) ) ;
Since 2.99.0 , this should be :
WPushButton * button = new WPushButton ( " Click me " ) ; button -> clicked ( ) . connect ( SLOT ( button , WPushButton :: disable ) ) ;
The benefit is that signal objects are created only on - demand .
Because most signals are not used , this resulted in both runtime and memory improvements .
WFlags ( C++ ) and EnumSet ( Java ) Rather than using an untyped int for passing a set of enum flags , which is used throughout the API , we are now using a WFlags < E > class ( in C++ ) and an EnumSet < E > ( in Java ) .
This allows type - safe combination of different enums , improving compile - time checks .
WFlags should not have any runtime overhead .
This probably does not require changes to your existing code , though .
Modified WResource API
The WResource API ( C++/ Java ) has been redesigned and greatly simplified .
The new API is simpler ( requires only one virtual method to be implemented ) and more powerful , providing support for continuations to serve large resources without blocking a thread or requiring large memory usage ( currently in C++ only , as this is only supported in the next version of the Java Servlet API ) .
Resources now have better thread - safety in C++ : they are now by default reentrant ( requests for a single resource may be handled concurrently ) and they are protected from concurrently being destroyed by the main event loop .
In addition , the mechanism for indicating that a resource has been changed and thus needs to be updated in its views , has been improved and sanitized .
Item delegates The WTreeView ( C++/ Java ) MVC view class has been updated to use a WAbstractItemDelegate ( C++/ Java ) to perform the actual rendering of cells .
This allows the view to be customized for specialized rendering of table cells .
In the future , we will extend the default view delegate , WItemDelegate ( C++/ Java ) to support inline editing , but , you can already implement your custom inline editing delegate .
Better support for testing
We added a WTestEnvironment ( C++/ Java ) , which allows you to write integration and unit tests that involve
Wt widgets and objects .
Progressive ( hybrid ) bootstrap
Wt has has always supported both AJAX clients and plain HTML clients .
To differentiate between the two , a small bootstrap page was used that sensed for AJAX availability , and which loaded the first page contents either using JavaScript , or by redirecting to a new page .
Some discussions on the mailing list indicated that this could be done better , suggesting a hybrid bootstrap model : the first page could contain already the entire page as plain HTML , and in the back - ground AJAX presence could be detected to upgrade this to a full AJAX interface .
This would have several benefits , including a faster initial response ( one round trip instead of two ) and better support for JavaScript libraries that need to load in the initial request , such as Google Ads .
We finally got around implementing this .
When enabled , first a plain HTML session is assumed , and widgets may later be asked to upgrade themselves to their AJAX version ( C++/ Java ) .
This is the principle of progressive enhancement , right there , entirely automatically embedded in your application !
Future ?
What to expect in the near future ?
In order to stabilize and polish Wt and JWt 3 , we have confined a lot of new developments in private branches .
Several of them are looking promising , and will hopefully find their way to Wt 3 in the near future :
Wt : : Dbo
We are finalizing an Object - Relational - Mapping ( ORM ) layer , which might be useful in many web applications .
This blog is actually our pilot project to find out how usable the current implementation is ( and , it seems , no web framework is considered complete without a blog as example ) .
We can already tell you that it does not use code generation , XML or ugly macro hacks , but instead you can declare the mapping entirely in plain compact C++.
More on it later !
CSS Themes
Many users have complained that the default look of Wt ’s widgets is boring , and we must confess , we have always given priority to functionality rather than looks .
We intend to change this with the advent of theme support .
All CSS that is currently provided within the inline stylesheet by each widget class , will be pushed out to external style sheets , and a small API has been added to select a particular theme .
XHTML Templates
It finally occurred to us that many things could be simplified if we admitted to support for XHTML templates .
Unlike traditional frameworks ,
Wt templates will be used to describe the XHTML for a single widget .
Within each template , widgets may be instantiated , and strings resolved .
This simplifies those situations where you would like to express the layout using XHTML / CSS , rather than using a nested hierarchy of WContainerWidgets .
The lovely Kelly has given us a glimpse of the promised land .
And the elephpant has approved …
Big shout out to Kelly & Ray for this one !
It 's a tricky thing to be a PC gamer who wants to play Modern Warfare 2 .
We were n't sure we'd get an advance copy from Activision , so we went to a local game store and put our money down to make sure there would be a copy waiting for us on launch day .
( If we complain about preorders in the future , be sure to point out this hypocrisy . )
When I went to pick up the game , the store manager let me know that I was the number four pre-order for the PC version of the game .
He then told me he had over 400 orders for the Xbox 360 version .
It 's hardly a scientific poll , but when one version of the game outsells the other 100 to 1 , it 's hard to feel like you 're part of a demographic the publisher is going to listen to .
When the time came to pick up the game , the clerk could n't find it .
It was tucked away in the back , with no display , and I was the first person who came in to get their copy .
No PC gamers attended the midnight launch .
I was asked , more than once , if I was sure I wanted this version .
Even if you bought on Steam , you have to wait until November 13 to play it , which is weird since the game uses Steamworks copy protection and requires a Steam account to play .
It seems retail was cut a break on this one .
The game is $ 60 , which is $ 10 more than PC games usually cost .
Without any licensing fees on the PC , publishers usually price the game slightly lower than its console counterpart .
Activision decided to simply take the larger profit margin .
There will be no dedicated servers , and you know the rest of our beefs with the PC version of the game .
This is a game by a company that does n't seem to care about PC gaming anymore , and the community has responded with boycotts and threats of piracy and other such nonsense .
Here 's the problem with all the righteous indignation : it 's about servers and politics and feeling important , not the actual game printed on the disc .
That 's what we 'll be looking at today .
Title Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 Developer Infinity Ward Publisher Activision Blizzard Price $ 59.99 Shop.
Ars Platform PC ( reviewed ) , Xbox 360 , PS3
Single - player
Once you start up the title , it becomes very apparent that you 're dealing with what appears to be a direct port of the console versions of the game : there is n't even a menu to adjust your mouse settings on the title screen .
You have to enter the game and hit escape before you can tweak the settings .
The game begins by asking if you 'd like to be asked to skip a mission " some players may find disturbing or offensive . "
We 're told this wo n't affect game completion , it will simply give us the option of skipping that content later in the game .
I chose yes , just so the game will tell me what I might be offended by .
Would n't want to miss it !
I 'll get into it a bit further down in the review , but if you 're squeamish , or do n't handle this sort of thing well , this may not be the game for you .
There is no flinching from graphic violence or complex issues .
Of course , any game with a thrilling snowmobile chase where you fire an automatic handgun gangsta - style probably is n't the most politically aware creature on the market , and the sobering moments are mixed with Rambo - style theatrics .
It can be jarring .
It can also be hard .
A few bullets is more than enough to take you down , although by simply avoiding fire for a few minutes you 'll heal all your wounds .
Your screen will often by filled with your own blood , however , which can sometimes make you feel like something of a bullet sponge .
Keep moving , look above and below you at all times , and always stay as aware as possible .
If you try to rush these missions , you 'll be stuck replaying the same segment over and over as you get shot to pieces .
The game is intense , almost numbingly so .
You 'll try your hand at firing an impressive array of weapons , you 'll remember that survival is by no means guaranteed , and you 'll be treated to a few vehicle segments that break up the action nicely without overstaying their welcome .
The story , involving invasions and double - agents ( or are they triple - agents ?!? ) and all sorts of over - the - top intrigue , can easily be ignored .
You 've played war games before , but the Modern Warfare world is dominated by quotes by Dick Cheney and Nathan Hale , and every character in the game thinks that problems are just one dead soldier or razed capital away from being fixed .
The graphics are strong , with many striking images throughout that I wo n't discuss for the obvious reasons .
There are n't many innovations in the single - player game ; the HUD is self - explanatory , the controls all make sense if you 've played other FPS titles , and you 'll know what to do with each item from the impressive array of weaponry .
There is now a graphical indication on the screen of where to go next and how far away the section is , and the game autosaves often ; you 'll rarely be sent very far backward when you die .
What makes the Modern Warfare series stand out is the heavy scripting , precise action , and unflinching look at this idea of war .
If the first game made you squirm , you have n't seen anything yet .
It 's a violent , one - dimensional world where might makes right , and the atmosphere is oppressive .
All of these design decisions work together to create a compelling , blood - soaked setting .
The campaign moves along at a breathless pace , and by the time you 've put the seven hours or so into the game that it takes to see the credits your ears will be ringing and your shoulder may feel a little bruised by the idea of all those virtual guns being fired relentlessly .
This is n't a game that glorifies violence — situations and characters such as this are n't attractive — it 's a game that overloads you with it .
You 'll be asked to take part in some repugnant things , and many of the peripheral details will stick with you .
You 'll want to talk about the single - player campaign long after it 's done , and it 's clear that people are going to have strong opinions one way or the other .
How do we feel about the controversial segment where you become part of a terrorist act ?
It 's hard to watch .
The actual mission that has gained all this controversy is , in all honesty , pretty shocking stuff .
The game slows down ; you can't run .
You have to walk slowly through the scene , watching innocents gunned down .
They scream .
They try to crawl away .
They hold their wounds and moan .
You can pull the trigger , or you can just watch .
But you 're holding a gun — you 're a part of this .
If you decide not to play this mission , you get a cut - scene .
Why is this section of the game playable ?
What does it add ?
That 's a huge question , with many different answers .
I 'm not saying the section makes the game better , but it certainly will get people talking .
But , yes : it is just as bad as people are saying , and just as hard to take .
Am I glad I played the game ?
Yes .
Can I see myself replaying it ?
Maybe not .
It 's satisfying to step into the shoes of people who are so uncompromising , and the game is brilliant at creating the feeling of moral vacuum , but it 's not exactly a feeling that 's comfortable , or even fun .
During many scenes , I found myself simply emptying clips into houses , knowing there could be innocents inside .
Why not ?
I was trying to survive , and in the thick of things it was hard to tell civilians from soldiers .
Yes , it 's just a game , and these are just pixels on a screen , but pixels and actions are enough to create a powerful emotional reaction .
This is very impressive stuff , not in terms of storytelling exactly , but as a tone poem about warfare .
For those buying the game only for the single - player , they will most likely walk away from the game a little sooner than they hoped , but satisfied nonetheless .
In the last decade , technology has reshaped industries and redefined the very nature of work for many Americans .
Yet even as the world has shifted , some jobs remain unaffected .
In honor of Labor Day , we asked writers from four different fields to discuss how their fields have -- or have not -- changed .
--
The invention of the phonograph was going to discourage people from going out to see live music .
The introduction of music radio was a surefire way of killing record sales .
“ Home taping is killing music ” screamed the magazine ads when the cassette tape was introduced to the marketplace .
Of course , each of those sky - is - falling alerts from the music industry over the last century was a false alarm .
With each technological innovation , music became more accessible and more lucrative than ever .
By 1999 , the music industry had become a nearly $ 15 - billion - a - year juggernaut .
Advertisement
That ’s also the year when the bottom started falling out of compact disc sales , and this time the industry ’s panic was justified .
Although new technology has meant that more people than ever are listening to music , it also has meant that record companies are no longer in full control .
The Internet has made it easy for artists to market direct to consumer -- and for fans to acquire music free through file sharing .
By some music biz estimates , for every music file that is purchased online , 40 are shared -- or “ stolen , ” if you prefer to use the industry ’s parlance .
But music is alive and well , even if the music industry is not .
A new grass - roots industry is taking shape , though how it will eventually look is anybody ’s guess .
Once a handful of big corporations funneled heavily marketed recordings by superstar artists through a few radio chains and MTV to the public .
In place of that top - heavy business model , a new , more chaotic brand of self - marketing is emerging , fueled by tweets , text messages and MP3 files .
Roles have changed .
Bands can now become de facto record companies : not only creating art but then distributing and publicizing it through websites and e-mail .
And fans are no longer a faceless marketing demographic to which products are sold ; they have become more like co-conspirators with the artists .
They ’re not only viral advocates for bands , they ’re collaborators -- participating in remixes and videos , and by extension helping shape careers .
They ’re invested in music personally in a way that was n’t possible a decade ago .
Not that infrastructure is unnecessary or going away .
The major labels still exist as big marketing machines , as anyone who ’s aware of the new album by Whitney Houston or the CD reissues by the Beatles can attest .
But the industry , like the music itself , is fragmenting into community - based niches and subcultures .
The trend is toward smaller , self - contained units .
Bands and artists who are already global brands , from Radiohead to Jay - Z , find they have more flexibility and keep more of the profit if they release music without having to deal with corporate politics .
And smaller acts , from Girl Talk to Dan Deacon , are using recordings as advertisements for increasingly lucrative live performances .
Advertisement
Indeed , the new way of doing business has hardly done away with the past .
On the contrary , cutting - edge technology that allows artists to connect with their fans 24/ 7 is building up an appetite for the oldest form of music distribution : the troubadour with the guitar ( or laptop ) slung across his back traveling from town to town to play for people .
That ’s one musical experience that ca n’t be digitized .

Dilbert enters Electrode Hut .

The clerk faints and falls to the floor .
Dilbert says , " That was the best one today ! "
Commissioned to celebrate the opening of the new cathedral at Coventry , built to replace the one destroyed by bombs , Britten used the opportunity to write a large - scale composition embodying his deeply held pacifist and humanitarian beliefs .
The result , the War Requiem , is regarded by many as his masterpiece in the non-operatic sphere .
Britten intersperses his setting of the traditional Latin Missa pro Defunctis with nine poems of the First World War poet Wilfred Owen , resulting in highly subtle and powerful contrasts and ironies .
Written in a direct style , the War Requiem carries overwhelming conviction , and concert audiences the world over continue to respond to its timeless relevance .
This video was produced by the Britten - Pears Foundation and appears on boosey .com with its kind permission .
It is part of a series of documentary films produced by the BPF , which are available to presenters for pre-performance events , on web sites , in foyers and within special exhibitions .

I was driving the other day and heard it -- hit my blower motor fans .
I did n't really know what it was at the time .
A few days later it started to smell ; that is when it hit me ... gotta be a dead animal of some sorts .
Long story short I NEED HELP on disassembly .
I got the glove box off and some of the bolts .
I can see it stuck in the fan blades of the blower motor but I cannot reach some of the bolts .
I had a Acura Legend and taking the blower motor out was cake .
This is insane !
how can they hide most of the bolts .
One has solder on it !
Anyone have HELMS or service manual pics of where all the bolts are ?
I need to get this out , the maggots are accumulating and the smell is pretty bad especially in the hot Houston weather .
Please pics or diagram .
Thank you .
OH and I really really do n't want to take it to a shop , I do most of my own work .
ok you know what ?
if you are going to post a video that shows some ( I presume ) some major plot element like someone shooting their child could you PLEASE exercise a teensie bit of restraint and not do the big reveal in the teaser paragraph that appears on the front page ?
thanks .
gdi. is it really too much to ask for a ' spoiler ' alert ?
as much as i love io9 even more do i hate spoilers .
There are data that show , for instance , that daughters of lesbian mothers are more likely to aspire to professions that are traditionally considered male , like doctors or lawyers — 52 percent in one study said that was their goal , compared with 21 percent of daughters of heterosexual mothers , who are still more likely to say they want to be nurses or teachers when they grow up .
( The same study found that 95 percent of boys from both types of families choose the more masculine jobs . )
Girls raised by lesbians are also more likely to engage in “ roughhousing ” and to play with “ male - gendered - type toys ” than girls raised by straight mothers .
And adult children of gay parents appear more likely than the average adult to work in the fields of social justice and to have more gay friends in their social mix .

Heterosexual couples might want to pay attention to these results .
While the gay - marriage debate is playing out on the public stage , a more private debate is taking place in kitchens and bedrooms over who does what in a heterosexual marriage ( takes out the trash , spends more time with the kids , feels free to head out with their friends for a beer ) .
The philosophical underpinnings of both conversations — gay marriage and equality in parenting — are similar , in that both focus on equality for adults ( in the case of heterosexuals , mostly wives ) .
But even if parents who seek parity do so for their own sanity and in pursuit of their own ideals , might it not also be better for their children ?
Yes , if less conventional , more tolerant children are your goal .
Because if the children of gays and lesbians are different , it is presumably related to the way they were raised — by parents with a view of domestic roles that differs from most of their heterosexual peers .
Same - sex couples , it seems , are less likely to impose certain gender - based expectations on their children , says M. V. Lee Badgett , director of the Center for Public Policy and Administration at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and author of “ When Gay People Get Married : What Happens When Societies Legalize Same - Sex Marriage . ”
Studies of lesbian parents have found that they “ are more feminist parents , ” she says , “ more open to girls playing with trucks and boys playing with dolls , ” with fewer worries about conforming to perceived norms .
They are also , by definition , less likely to impose gender - based expectations on themselves .
“ Same - sex parents tend to be more equal in parenting , ” Goldberg says , while noting that no generalization can apply to all parents of any sexual orientation .
On the whole , though , lesbian mothers ( there ’s little data here on gay dads ) tend not to divide chores and responsibilities according to gender - based roles , Goldberg says , “ because you have taken gender out the equation .
There ’s much more fluidity than in many heterosexual relationships . ”
So while we arguably spend too much time focusing on children , when it comes to the topic of nontraditional marriage , maybe we should start focusing on them more .
One of the few parenting conversations that is not child - centric might be well served to become so .
These are questions of rights and equality for adults , yes , but also questions of what is good for the kids .
Yves Smith packs a powerful insight into an unassuming sentence :
Liquidity is not a virtue in and of itself unless it produces a benefit to the real economy .
Liquidity is often said to be the great lubricant of financial markets .
Let 's go with that metaphor for a moment .
Yeah , baby , liquidity .
It 's high performance motor oil that turns hard metal to smooth silk and keeps the engine of capitalism firing on all cylinders !
Pop the hood and pour that stuff in .
Rub it onto the gears and axles , so nothing ever squeals , pops , or ( God forbid ) grinds to a halt .
Slather it all over the tires , so that no friction comes between our purring metal machine and the sweet American road .
Ummm , wait a minute ...
Putting lubricant on the tires might not be such a great idea after all .
Friction is precisely what tires need to do their jobs .
Throw a lot of oil on the tires and , well , something bad might happen .
Similarly , in financial markets , we want liquidity at some times and in some places .
But there are times and places where we want , even need ( gasp ! ) illiquidity !
Illiquidity .
That word is so ugly .
What might be another word for the same phenomenon ?
How about " commitment " ?
When a person invests in something that is not very liquid , they are committed .
They are necessarily betting on its fundamental value .
Liquid securities can be bought or sold as a trend or a trade or a play for a greater fool .
But if the thing you are buying can only be sold with a big haircut , you 'd better hope for a really gigantic fool if you have no confidence in its underlying value .
( Clever managers did find ways around this problem , but let 's put principal / agent issues aside for the moment . )
When financial markets are too liquid , everything looks like cash .
Superfluous distinctions — like the economic meaning of the assets bought or sold — fall by the wayside .
Sure , investors always prefer liquidity to illiquidity .
An option to buy or sell quickly and cheaply is preferable to an option to buy or sell slowly and with large transaction costs .
But just because investors like something does n't mean that it 's good .
Investors like rainbows and ice cream and free money from taxpayers .
But the rest of us prefer that investors make serious , informed decisions about what is and is n't of value , and that they be paid for evaluating and actually bearing risk , rather than artfully shifting it ( or whining when it cannot be shifted , because omigawd - there - is - no - liquidity ! ) .
Of course there is a balance here , commitment is one thing but a ball and chain is another , if assets become too hard to buy or sell , the costs of financing genuinely useful enterprises would increase until even good risks are not borne at all .
It 's not that liquidity is a bad thing .
It 's a good thing of which there can too much .
But how much ?
Another word that should be attached to any conversation about liquidity is " accuracy " .
There is , in some sense , a " right " level of liquidity , defined by the uncertainty surrounding the present value of an assets future payoffs .
We laud markets for " price discovery " , their ability to distill complex economic facts into simple prices that put a value to unknowable future events .
But we need markets to communicate the uncertainty surrounding those valuations as well .
The depth - weighted spreads of assets whose values are nearly certain should be much narrower than those of assets whose payoffs cannot be accurately predicted .
When that is not the case , it represents a market failure .
The recently wide spreads on complex structured credits are not the crisis — those spreads accurately reflect the uncertainty surrounding what the instruments are actually worth .
Nobody knows , so spreads should be wide .
The real crisis was two years ago , when " oceans of liquidity " meant that whatever the underlying value of a thing , you could sell it quickly for near what you bought it , so spreads grew artificially narrow .
Confidence is good only when confidence is merited .
We need not only accurate prices , but accurate confidence intervals , accurate spreads , accurate levels of liquidity rather than simply more , more , more .

BRASILIA ( Reuters ) - Jewish leaders on Tuesday criticized Brazil ’s plans to receive Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad next month and urged the South American nation to condemn his denial of the Holocaust and “ support of international terrorism . ”
Brazil , which has defended dialogue and engagement with Iran , is due to get a visit from Ahmadinejad in late November .
“ For us , it is very sad to know that Brazil will receive a man who publicly says he wants to destroy our country , ” Israeli Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger told reporters after meeting with Brazil ’s Senate chief , Jose Sarney .
Metzger , who participated in a religious seminar in the capital , Brasilia , urged Brazilian authorities to call off the visit .
The Simon Wiesenthal Center , or SWC , a Jewish human rights organization , said Brazil should use the visit to condemn what it described as Ahmadinejad ’s anti-Semitic rhetoric .
“ Brazil will have the opportunity ... to condemn his dangerous calls for the destruction of Israel , his denial of the Holocaust , and his support of international terrorism , ” Shimon Samuels and Sergio Widder of SWC Latin America in Buenos Aires said in a letter to Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim .
In an e-mailed statement , they said Iran harbored terrorists involved in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people .
Iran has repeatedly denied any link to the attack .
Brazil ’s Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment on the Jewish leaders ’ remarks but reaffirmed its position of promoting engagement with Iran .
Brazil , a rising diplomatic power campaigning to gain a permanent seat at the U.N. Security Council , has adopted a more conciliatory line toward Iran than Western allies , including the United States .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva urged Western leaders
Last month to stop pushing Iran over its nuclear program and instead talk to it to foster peace .
Israeli President Shimon Peres is expected to visit Brazil later this year .
Silicon Valley Insider reports that the rumors of Amazon buying Netflix are circulating again ( they 've been going around for years ) :
Earlier today , Reuters reporter Anupreeta Das tweeted " Netflix - Amazon rumor doing rounds of options market again . "
While we read on Fly On The Wall , the rumor mill / financial news aggregator , " Netflix calls active on renewed takeover chatter . "
It would be a great combination ( Netflix on a Kindle ? ) , but I 'm wondering who else should buy Netflix ?
AT&T to go after Comcast ?
Microsoft for Zune & Xbox ?
Who do you think should buy Netflix ?
Introduction
Canonical releases a new version of its Linux distribution , Ubuntu , every six months .
Sometimes new versions , like 9.04 “ Jaunty Jackalope ” are definitely worth the time investment , while others , like 8.10 “ Intrepid Ibex ” should be avoided .
So , where does version 9.10 stand ?
Is the free download worth your time and bandwidth , or should you stick with the ( still ) cutting - edge 9.04 , or even the rock - solid 8.04 LTS release ?
We 've had a month to really get to know the Karmic Koala .
We 've put it through the paces and now have our final verdict .
Going against all prior experience and common sense , I decided to install Ubuntu 9.10 onto my main production machine , as well as my secondary desktop .
Normally , I would use a tertiary box to test a new distro , but Ubuntu is my current OS of choice , so chances are good that I 'm going to want the latest version .
First , I backed up all my data because I wanted to do a fresh installation .
I would have been stuck with the ext3 filesystem and the legacy version of the GRUB bootloader had I opted to simply upgrade my current 9.04 installations .
Along with the standard review of the latest Ubuntu , this article debuts the Tom 's Hardware cross-platform benchmarks .
The suite is made up of a few time - based tests , some application - based benchmarks , as well as two popular synthetics .
Besides being cross-platform , these benchmarks are all free ( as in gratis ) to download , so there is nothing stopping you from testing out your own boxes .
The Desktop Edition of Ubuntu is the main focus of this review .
While I do include a section on Ubuntu Netbook Remix , only the Desktop Edition is benchmarked and covered in detail .
Variants , like Kubuntu and Ubuntu Studio , are n't covered here either .
It seems that Ubuntu Moblin Remix ( UMR ) has not yet reached a final release , and therefore will not be reviewed .
UMR is available from Ubuntu's Web site , but only as a daily development build .
If you want to give it a whirl , head on over here .
Just do n't expect too much from it at this point in time .
Shtetl , Mayn Khoyever heym ; a gedenknish ( Shtetl , My destroyed home ; A Remembrance ) , Berlin , 1922 .
In this book , also in the Beinecke collection , the artist depicts scenes of Jewish life in his shtetl ( village ) in Ukraine before it was destroyed in the pogroms which followed the end of World War I. Indeed , Shtetl is an elegy to that world .

Video : Treating transgender humans like animals in a Kalama - zoo
by Jeremy Hooper
Brace yourself , for we 're about to show you one of the most disgusting political ads we 've ever had the misfortune of viewing ( which is saying a lot ) .
Our opposition in Kalamazoo is literally targeting specific individuals to scare voters into voting against a simple nondiscrimination ordinance :
Do n't you just feel so sorry for Ms. Stark , possibly losing her right to not dignify certain kinds of people ?
And perhaps relinquishing her ability to discriminate in areas of public accommodation , so that maybe next Halloween she will have to scare you with something other than actual humans who simply want to live in peace ?
You 're totally worried for her , right ?
No ?
You totally realize that this is a cold , callous , unbelievably targeted tactic ?
And you 'll be proudly supporting the " yes " side , because you know that all people deserve protection ?
And you can see right through these attempts to use a figurehead of science to discredit certain biological realities ?
Oh .
You 're a wise one , dear reader .
Hopefully the clear difference between these two sides will be as Stark to Kalamazoo voters as it is to the fair - minded people who understand these nonstop " culture war " games for exactly what they are !
* Contribute now to Respond to Their Misleading Attacks [ ActBlue ] *

Your thoughts
So , Dr. Mary Ann Stark , PhD , RN is n't an MD , she 's a registered - nurse that they are hoping that people will assume to be an MD by virtue of the fact that she has a PhD , and is wearing a lab coat .
They probably tried to find an MD who would spout their hateful drivel , but had to settle for an angry white ( probably religiot ) nurse .. that ( fortunately for their lying liar ways ) happens to have a PhD ... probably in theology from a mail order diploma mill !
But , hey , angry white female religiocrats are equally free to spout their hatred as any other supremacist .

You know , they could have made that commercial much shorter .
' Transgendered people - ew ! '
It would take less than five seconds , and be much more honest .

She should be ashamed of herself .
Posted by : Em | Nov 1 , 2009 12:14:41 PM
Dick - you 're right .
A simple search shows that her PhD is in philosophy .
She is a member of the " Kalamazoo Citizens Voting No to Special Rights Discrimination " campaign advisory board ( whatever that is ) along with the expected gaggle of religiocrats .

Yeah any man can just wander into a girls bathroom , its not like transsexuals have to go through a gauntlet of doctors and psychologists to get a ' bathroom letter ' * my doctor actuallly called it that * explaining their situation , and that they only risk getting their asses kicked by going into the bathroom with bigots like her because they 're LEGALLY REQUIRED to spend a year living as the other sex .
Nope all those ' facts ' were just made up by those evil sodomites and their propaganda from the APA .
All True Christian Morons know that anyone who puts on a dress is covered under these laws and theirs an epidemic of cross dressers peaking at people in the bathroom , its not like you can google ' chicks on the toilet ' and find dozens of websites devoted to that were you can watch women who arent ugly as hell take a crap without getting beat up .
Posted by : penguinsaur | Nov 1 , 2009 1:54:31 PM
Once again , we 're using the " women and children " defense against transpeople just looking for equal , non judgmental treatment under the law .
This ad actually layers in ' abused women ' to up the ante .
Let 's have a test - compare the number of TG / TS women who peep around the stalls versus the number of TG / TS women or men who get their butts kicked in by some bigot in the wrong gendered bathroom .
I 'll bet more TS folks get roughed up by phobic , closed minded people who this nurse would call her friends .
Did I actually see a TG clergy member used as an example of peeping Thomasina ??
Posted by : Julie Kristine | Nov 1 , 2009 8:53:51 PM
Just to clarify , her PhD is from the University of Michigan ( hardly a diploma mill ) and is probably in nursing or a related discipline ( PhD is a type of degree , not an indication of Philosophy as a major . )
She has a strong educational background , and she 's an associate professor , so she 's been tenured at a good , accredited university .
That scares me a lot more than if she were a hack with a mail order diploma teaching at Liberty University .
Posted by : Kat | Nov 2 , 2009 9:19:44 AM
i hope this woman never goes to any other country in the world .
she 'll have to " hold it " until she gets back to the US .
a bathroom 's a bathroom in the rest of the world .
and education has nothing to do with ignorance .
she 's just too stupid to know that she is ignorant - you know , an idiot ...

Are there rules about using someone 's likeness in a political ad ?
If there are , I hope the person they 're trying to humiliate nails them to the legal wall .
Posted by : DN | Nov 2 , 2009 2:03:04 PM
As a Nurse she should be ashamed of herself .
I would now question her ability to provide unbiased care for any non-heterosexual women .
Part of being a nurse is taking a non-judgmental and objective view .
She has compromised her integrity as a Nurse by appearing in this ad .
There should be calls for her resignation .
Posted by : Tom | Nov 2 , 2009 5:12:42 PM
This ad will be quite effective at rousing the deep homophobia in the hearts of " good people " who " are n't really homophobes " but think " men in women 's bathrooms " is icky and secretly believe that gay / non - gender normative " men " are all sexual predators hoping to gain access to pure , straight children who they can attack and " turn to the dark side . "
Here 's hoping for compassion and clear thinking on the part of the targeted audience .

[ Editor 's Note : While I know we have a history of making up items like this as satire , I assure you this is true and this article was penned by the father of T.J. Oshie .
He welcomes your questions and feedback via his email , listed below .
This article originally appeared in the Nov. 12 edition of St. Louis Game Time . ]
THE BIG TIME ... on St. Louis Game Time !
Whoa Nelly ( as long - time ABC Sports broadcaster Keith Jackson would say ) and a big thanks to Sean Gallagher and the entire staff of St. Louis Game
Time for allowing me the distinct opportunity to express my views , beliefs and visions regarding the fastest game on Earth .
My name is Timothy Oshie , and I 'm the father of the St. Louis Blues No. 74 , T.J. Oshie .
I 'm a free - lance writer from the State of Hockey ( Minnesota ) and currently in my 31st year of sports and broadcast journalism .
My focal points will be to discuss issues surrounding the game and tidbits featuring the world of hockey .
I will also welcome , " Ask Coach Oshie , " a wide array of questions surrounding the hockey world from the fans of Game Time .
This section will be open to any hockey question , within reason , surrounding the game .
Direct your questions to me at oshiesports@gmail.com via the world wide web with each week I 'll pick two - to - four to feature in the upcoming issues .
So that 's me .
Now sit back and enjoy Ice Chips while you watch the 2009 - 10 version of the St. Louis Blues .
THE IMMINENT ?
The question is , are you T.J. Oshie 's dad ?
It goes without saying the last name of Oshie is very different and rare .
Oshie is a derivative of a longer Ojibwe Indian name which dates back to the mid-1800's .
So , yes , I 'm the father of No. 74 .
It almost goes without saying but this was n't my first trip to the shores of the Mississippi River and the Gateway to the West .
My initial visit to the city of St. Louis was in 2007 ( although my family did drive by in 2004 en route to the 2004 USA Hockey In - Line National Championships in Alpharetta , GA ) .
We came to follow and to witness the 2007 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Frozen Four / National Championships .
It was my initial time entering the Scottrade Center as a hockey fan .
The University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux Men 's hockey team was playing Boston College in the semi-final nightcap .
I was thoroughly impressed by the droves of college hockey fans as the " Scott " was filled to capacity in early April ( Easter Sunday weekend ) .
My journey was by vehicle .
But the bigger story was that Grand Forks , ND / East Grand Forks , MN , from where I reside , was fighting through the flood waters upon my departure from the Grand Cities .
Once on the outskirts of Fargo , ND , which is 77 miles south of Grand Forks , the flood waters were up to the bottom of the cars on the famous I - 29 freeway .
Just south of Fargo the weather turned .
We encountered a vicious blizzard halting us at times to single digits on the speedometer due to " white - out snow " circumstances .
So it 's easy to say the journey to St. Louis was filled with stories of similar trips for the Oshie family which extends to the West Coast of Washington state and British Columbia , Canada .
Although , the weather of North Dakota / Minnesota gets to as far as minus - 50 wind chill at times , it simply does n't compare to the blizzards of the mountainous regions of the Cascades which extend from Oregon to British Columbia .
Like every hockey parent , I 've had the unique opportunity spend thousands of hours on the open road with my children ( T.J. , Taylor , Tawni and Aleah ) .
It was the cornerstone of our family time which extended from Seattle , WA to Warroad , MN to Grand Forks , ND to St. Louis , MO .
The trips that bonded a family .
So there is the start of our story , the word is out .
Send me your questions and check back here for further editions of Ice Chips with Timothy Oshie .

MagLev is a Ruby implementation built by GemStone on their Smalltalk VM .
GemStone /S , which is GemStone 's Smalltalk product , been around for decades and is particularly known for it's mature distribution and persistence capabilities .
MagLev was announced in 2008 , and the team has been busy working on it ever since .
After a while in a private alpha , the cat is now out of the bag : a public version of MagLev is now available , which includes the MagLev source code which is hosted at GitHub .
To try MagLev , first get the source with a quick
git clone git://github.com/MagLev/maglev.git
followed by a
./install.sh
in the MagLev source directory and follow the instructions it provides .
To start MagLev use
rake maglev: start
which fires up the system .
A quick way to run Ruby code is maglev - irb , which will connect to the common MagLev backend ; maglev - ruby and maglev - gem are also available .
A quick dig around the examples directory brings up the hat_trick example that Avi Bryant showed at the first MagLev demo .
It showed off the persistence features , which allowed to ѕet up an object in one irb instance and then access it in another .
To reproduce it , simply fire up MagLev and two maglev - irb instances .
To make an object execute this in one maglev - irb instance :
Maglev.persistent do Maglev:: PERSISTENT_ROOT [ : stuff ] = [ " hello world " ] end Maglev.commit_transaction
Switch over to the other maglev - irb instance and execute :
Maglev:: PERSISTENT_ROOT [ : stuff ]
which will return the string " hello world " .
Obviously , this is a very simple demo of the persistence features ; for more details of MagLev 's persistence API see the docs .
A more slightly involved example is an implementation of Ruby 's PStore using the persistence features .
It shows how GemStone 's persistence features make it easy to keep whole object graphs persistent without having to deal with an ORM .
While Rails is not yet supported on MagLev , working Rack and Sinatra examples are available .
A public Trac for MagLev is available to track the progress .
For compatibility , this graph hows the number of passed RubySpecs , whereas links to detailed results are available too .
No details about licensing seem to be available on MagLev , but GemStone does offer free versions , eg of GemStone / S that bundles the web framework Seaside and is free up to 4 GB of data .
While there 's a lot of buzz around the NoSQL databases these days , GemStone / S is a mature solution that 's been around for decades .
MagLev now tightly integrates these features with Ruby .
What 's your take - will you try MagLev ?
People have been attempting to name this decade since 1989 .
But with the starts - with - a - zero years drawing to a close , it 's clear that none of the proposals — from silly ( " the naughty aughties " ) to depressing ( " the terror era " ) — have quite caught on .
Here are 20 of the more memorable suggestions , in chronological order :
1. The Zippy Zeros : " That is only a working title . "
( The New York Times , 1989 )
2. The Ohs : " It passes the out - loud test . " ( NYT , 1996 )
3 . The Love Years : " We 'll be able to say , ' Remember the Summer of Love - Five ? ' " ( Washington Post , 1998 )
4. The Two Thousands : " But that 's going to sound mighty silly in the year 2525 . " ( Washington Post , 1998 )
5 . The Noughties : " The ' noughties ' could be the one to head the — admittedly sorry — list of contenders .
And yet the ' noughties ' still sounds like a word East End villains might use to describe imprisonable activities — or even worse a polite , middle - class code for the reproductive organs . "
( BBC , 1999 )
6 . The My Decade : " What is it that has come to characterize the expectations of consumers in the Aughts ?
The answer is personalization . "
( itWorldCanada.com , 2000 )
7 . The Millie - nillies : " [ Cute but ] so 90s .
If a name [ for the decade ] emerges , ' The Ohs ' have the inside track ... because people already refer to the individual years as oh - one , oh - two , oh - three and oh - four . "
( ABC News , 2002 )
8 . The Anxious Aughts : " Anxiety is the new normalcy . "
( USA Today , 2003 )
9. Naughty Aughties : " Naughty Aughties is simple , catchy , rhymes and intimates fun and mischievous behavior ... Naughty Aughties fills the void in a fun and ' roll off your tongue ' sort of way . "
( NaughtyAughty.com )
10 . The Zeros : " If you wanted to go continue on with the standard numbers , The Zeroes would make the most sense mathematically , provided they can work out a licensing agreement with the Houston Texans . "
( Blog Critics , 2005 )
11 . The Dark Decade : " It reminds me of the Dark Ages in Europe , or Darth Vader .
Now we ’re on the edge of a renaissance , thank goodness . "
( News- record.com , 2008 )
12 . The Oh - nos : " Based on the way things have gone so far , I nominate ' the oh - nos . ' "
( Washington Post , 2008 )
13 . The Naughts : " The 2000s — [ which ] will be remembered chiefly for their [ shortcomings ] — were a decade ... in which the social and political systems normally responsible for maintaining the healthy functioning of the body politic have instead turned against it with particular savagery .... "
( Harper's , 2008 )
14 . The Whatevers : " Some Americans have adopted a doomsday outlook to cope with a world where bad news never fails to stop piling on .
The ' Whatever ' generation rolls its eyes , shakes its head , and talks about how things ca n’t get any worse . "
( Mediaite , 2009 )
15 . The Decade of the Unthinkable : " If nothing else pleasant can be said about the last 10 years , they sure were n’t dull . "
( NYT , 2009 )
16 . The Buster Decade : " We had this big boom and now we 're bust . " ( Chicago Tribune , 2009 )
17 . The Decade of Disruptions : " It ’s been a decade as bumpy as the ’90s were blithe . ” ( NYT , 2009 )
18 . The Unies : " It 's a mathematical answer .
The prefix “ uni ” means one ( single digits ) and can also be looked upon as a means to unify , or bring together which is exactly what we are trying to accomplish . "
( Ryan Guerra at Google Knol , 2009 )
19 . The Ooze : " Ooze need not only signify decay .
It can also represent the conditions for lasting growth and renewal — the kind that emerges from the ground up . "
( The DemocraticStrategist.com , 2009 )
20 . The Decade from Hell : " We 're still weeks away from the end of '09 , but it 's not too early to pass judgment .
Call it the Decade from Hell ... or the Decade of Broken Dreams , or the Lost Decade .
Call it whatever you want — just give thanks that it is nearly over . "
( Time , 2009 )

More than a year has passed since I originally posted about Chocolate Milk Beverage .
Since then it ’s become one of the most popular posts on this blog !
I appreciate all of the comments !
As you can see to your right , they ’re not even calling it milk anymore .
This begs the new question : What is Chocolate Dairy Beverage ?
First , let ’s see what Metro and Beatrice had to say …
Response from Metro
True to their word , Metro got back to me within two days .
Kudos !
Dear [ redacted ] , Thank you for your e-mail .
I know there have been some changes to labeling regulations as to what a product is called and what has to be included in the ingredients .
I suggest you contact Parmalat directly at their website “ parmalat.ca ” or call 1-800-263-2858 for more information .
Kindest regards , Judy [ redacted ]
Customer Care Specialist
Metro Ontario Inc .
1-877-763-7374
I appreciate Metro ’s timely and personal response .
Judy actually read my e-mail and wrote a reply in her own words that was useful and appropriate , given Metro ’s position as the retailer .
Based on Judy ’s response , my initial assumption is that Health Canada ’s website was n’t quite up - to - date last November .
More on that in a bit , but first , lets see what Parmalat had to say .
Response from Parmalat ( Beatrice )
Unlike Metro , it took Parmalat three months to formulate this canned reply .
Not only that , but the central section of the e-mail was in a different font from the header and footer – I have indicated this section in bold .
Content is king but the formatting is simply another indicator of how little effort they put into this response .
Dear [ Redacted ] ,
This is to acknowledge receipt of your recent e-mail to Parmalat Canada .
Thank you for your recent enquiry on our Chocolate Milk Beverage product .
Parmalat and Beatrice have been providing Canadian families with the wholesome benefits and great taste of milk for generations .
Proudly made with milk from Canadian dairy farms , our products are great tasting and nutritious .
Chocolate Milk and Chocolate Milk Beverages are both standard dairy products under the Milk Act .
The primary ingredient in both products is milk .
Chocolate Milk Beverage is a good nutritional choice as it is :
Low in Fat
Excellent Source of Calcium
Excellent Source of Vitamin D
A Source of Vitamin A Beatrice and Parmalat also offer a variety of other value added Chocolate Milk Products , such as Smart Growth 2 % Chocolate milk with DHA , and Omega - 3 1 % Chocolate milk as other options for consumers who are looking for chocolate milk products with additional functional ingredients .
We appreciate your input and will provide your comments to our product development team for consideration in future developments .
Thank you for your loyalty and for taking the time to write to us .
Sincerely , Consumer Relations ,
Parmalat Canada
1-800-563-1515
Wow , thanks Parmalat .
This sounds more like advertising copy than an e-mail response .
I asked several pointed questions ; your lengthy reply has not answered any of them .
Interestingly , the Beatrice website nolonger lists Chocolate Milk or any of its relations on their product page .
Why not ?
Buttermilk , Egg Nog , Banana Milk and Strawberry Milk are all apparently worthy of mention ?
Banana and Strawberry milk are not even sold in all provinces , Egg Nog is only available at Christmas time and Buttermilk is for pancakes , not for drinking .
Chocolate is available all year round .
You would n’t be trying to hide your chocolate flavoured dairy concoction , would you ?
Dairy Farmers of Canada
Since Beatrice was no help at all , I decided to write the Dairy Farmers of Canada on November 18th to see if they could help .
A few months ago they changed their blue cow logo to include the text “ 100 % Canadian Milk ” and was curious to see what they had to say about dairy beverages .
Hello Dairy Farmers of Canada , I have noticed over the past year the appearance and prevalence of products labelled as Chocolate Milk Beverage or Chocolate Dairy Beverage , in place of real Chocolate Milk .
I have been trying to figure out what exactly a ‘ dairy beverage ’ is and was wondering if you could shed some light on that ?
Would you mind sending me some information on your 100 % Canadian Milk programme ?
How do ‘ dairy beverages ’ align the goals of that programme ?
Much appreciated
Anyone care to guess what they ’ll say ?
They ’re basically a lobby group , so they do n’t want to piss off their dairies , however , they want to sell REAL milk .
There ’s a bit on their website about frozen desserts being substituted for real ice cream .
We ’ll see , I guess …
What are we drinking ??
Packaging copy : “ Made with partly skimmed milk ( fortified with vitamins A and D ) and added dairy ingredients . ”
Unlike real partly skimmed milks as defined by Canada ’s food and drug regulations , the packaging of Beatrice ’s dairy beverage does not overtly indicate the milk fat content .
To the average consumer , the packaging looks nearly identical to Beatrice ’s old Chocolate Milk and Chocolate Milk Beverage products .
For the record , Beatrice Chocolate Dairy Beverage contains thirteen ingredients , fifteen if you count the mandatory vitamins :
partly skimmed milk ( vitamin A palmitate , vitamin D3 )
modified milk ingredients
sugar
reconstituted skim milk powder
cocoa
dipotassium phosphate
modified corn starch
salt
colour
carrageenan
cellulose gum
guar gum
artificial flavour
There are five ingredients that I actually understand , which I have highlighted in grey .
Several of the ‘ questionable ’ ones would seem to be thickening agents : modified corn starch , carrageenan , cellulose gum and guar gum .
What are modified milk ingredients , anyway ?
A quick Google search comes up with all sorts of interesting stuff .
CBC ’s Marketplace summed it up well :
That name can mean just about any product that was initally part of milk , especially including the following : skim milk powder
milk protein concentrates
milk protein isolates
casein
caseinates
As pointed out in a comment on the previous post , Parmalat ’s own Protelac products are sold to the food industry as ‘ milk replacers . ’
Their frightening marketing copy identifies the true goal : cost savings .
Each Prestige and Protelac milk replacer is an all - natural , advanced technology ingredient specifically designed to replace the functionality and taste of milk solids in your formulation while generating substantial cost savings verses skim milk ( non fat dry milk ) .
There ’s much more to cover in the exciting world of chocolate dairy beverages masquerading as chocolate milk …
In a subsequent post , I ’d like to review what real chocolate milk options are left to us , beyond the dairy beverage offerings of Parmalat , et al .

I have jumped on the Unity 3D bandwagon and I have to say , it 's a smooth ride .
It 's refreshing to work in a tool that 100 % devoted to game development .
I immediately jumped on their 2D platformer tutorial but quickly felt there was too much to wade through .
I searched around and found some great tutorials , especially for Flash developers .
Unity for Flash Developers ( 1 - 7 ) .
These will teach you basic Unity concepts and how many are similar to Flash .
You have to walk before you can run , but in game development , you have to shoot bullets and make explosions before either .
This tutorial will show you how : http://www.unitytutorials.com/video/290/muzzle-flash--raycasting--bullet-explosion1
This tutorial takes you from the start as well and shows great stuff like making terrain in Unity .
I have n't made it all the way through this one yet but its the best one have found so far .
He uses Cinema 4D ( which is Mac only I think ) to do some modeling .
I just downloaded a 30 - day trial of 3Ds Max and everything transferred easily .
Unity 3D definitely deserves all the buzz it is getting .
When it gets something along the lines of MochiAds I might have to switch over from Flash .
MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow caught Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) on Tuesday seemingly arguing that his state ’s 31 percent African - American population puts him at a disadvantage — and that it ’s a good reason not to support healthcare reform .
What ?
Maddow explains .
Sen .
“ Lindsey Graham is a Republican which means in 2009 that he does not support health reform , ” she says .
“ While arguing against the bill that is almost certain to pass the senate this thursday at 8:00 a.m. , Sen .
Graham made an argument that i think was supposed to be about health reform .
But it was one that quickly became more about him than it was about any policy issue whatsoever . ”

Maddow cuts to Graham :
“ Throughout the nation there are going to be thousands more people enrolled in Medicaid and every state except one is going to have to come up with matching money , ” Graham remarks .
“ I have 12 percent unemployment in South Carolina .
My state ’s on its knees .
I have 31 percent African - American population in South Carolina . ”
“ We ’ve got it tough , ” he adds .
“ We ’re on our knees .
12 percent of our people are unemployed and 31 percent of our people are black . ”
Graham later says : “ My state , with 30 percent African - American citizens , a lot of low income people in South Carolina is going to cost my state a billion dollars , that ’s the same old stuff that I object to .
That ’s not change we can believe in .
That ’s sleazy . ”
“ The argument here appears to be that Sen .
Graham believes it is sleazy to expect a state with lots of black people in it , to have health reform , ” Maddow says .
“ Because you know , black people .
Maybe he meant something other than what it seemed like with those remarks .
But it should be noted he did use the same inexplicable argument twice .
Once on the Senate floor and once on The Today Show .
We contacted Sen . Graham ’s office today for an explanation .
We ’ll let you know when and if we hear back . ”
This video is from MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show , broadcast Dec. 22 , 2009 .

Iranian jailed in US for arms trafficking plot
Attorney David Weiss revealed the unsealed Ardebili papers this month An Iranian man has been jailed for five years in the US after admitting plotting to procure and smuggle arms to Iran , prosecutors say .
Amir Ardebili was seized by undercover US agents overseas in 2007 following a five - year investigation .
In May 2008 , he pleaded guilty to arms trafficking , but this was only revealed two weeks ago .
Iran complained to United Nations officials in October about how the US had seized Ardebili .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has likened the case to three US hikers who were detained after crossing the border from Iraq .
' Acquiring components '
A federal prosecutor in the state of Delaware , Assistant Attorney David Hall , said Ardebili had acquired thousands of items , including military aircraft parts , the Associated Press news agency reported .
Iran has linked the case to that of the detained US hikers Mr Hall said Ardebili had been arrested in the Republic of Georgia in October 2007 .
The defendant was extradited to the US in January 2008 .
When the documents on his case were unsealed this month , US attorney David Weiss said : " For years , the defendant was in the business of acquiring components , many with military applications , for the government of Iran .
" The government 's investigation and prosecution has put the defendant out of business and removed this threat to our national security . "
Ardebili , also known as Amir Ahkami and Alex Dave , is reported to have said his intention was to protect Iran from missile attacks .
His court appearance in May 2008 was reportedly conducted under high security .
The windows of the court room were covered and a guard placed outdoors , the Delaware News Journal reported .
Ardebili is one of a number of Iranian citizens Mr Ahmadinejad noted last month that the United States was detaining .
Analysts say Iran may try to use these detentions in negotiations for the release of the three hikers .
On Monday , Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said the hikers , Shane Bauer , Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal , would stand trial , although he did not specify on which charges .
They have previously been accused of illegal entry and spying .
However , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said any charges would be unfounded and she called on Tehran to release the three immediately .

Dobbs : 2012 presidential run not " crazy " UPDATE
Watch your back , Glenn Beck .
Ex-CNNer Lou Dobbs tells WTOP this morning that he feels " liberated and emancipated " since leaving the network — and he's not ruling out the possibility of running for president in 2012 .
When one of the WTOP anchors joked that pundits were floating the crazy idea of the immigration - fixated Dobbs running for president , he shot back : " What 's so crazy about that ? " — and disclosed that he 's talking to advisers to suss out his political options .
" For the first time I 'm actually listening to [ people who want him to run for office ] .
... I do n't think I have the nature for it .
...
But we 've got to do something for this country . "
Dobbs has become a prime target of Hispanic groups for his fire - breathing pronouncements about illegal immigration — including a discredited claim that Mexicans were bringing leprosy across the border .
These days , he says he 's trying to mend fences with immigrants rights groups " to try to bridge some of these conflicts and try to create solutions . "
UPDATE [ via JMart ] : Dobbs tells Fred Thompson he 's thinking about it — and will let his wife make the final call .
" I 'm going to be talking some more with folks who want me to listen over the next few weeks , " Dobbs said .
" I do n't even know what to tell you in terms of how I 'm leaning — I 'm going to have the best advic .
... I may make a terrible decision — but I 'll have great advice . "

Has there ever been an industry more unwilling to make its customers happy than publishing ?
Simon & Schuster and Hachette have ( independently ) decided they ’re going to hold back the ebook releases of some titles .
Not all of course .
Most likely just the ones they paid far too much for anyway .
They ’re taking a stand by creating marketplace confusion … some books yes , some books no .
Consumers will need to guess .
Gee , that ’s a good idea .
But not a problem for me .
If the book is n’t available , I ’ll buy something else .
I wo n’t be checking back in three or four months , because , well , clearly the publishers do n’t want my money .
And the chances of me remembering ?
Going with nil to nada .
And even if I do , what bright and shiny new books will capture my attention …?
This new delay relates to windowing , the concept of moving a product through specific retail channels for specific periods of time .
Windowing is a concept that works really well in the motion picture industry , though studios are trying to compress those windows , while the music industry ( another business prone to overpaying advances ) works with simultaneous release of formats .
[ Part One : Response to Nat Sobel ]
The window argument , as practiced by the motion picture industry , is often cited as justification for withholding digital books ( and even trade and mass market paperbacks ) .
To me , this represents a flawed understanding of how money flows in the motion picture industry .
Books and movies are not comparable .
But first , let ’s talk about rebellion .
Nat Sobel used the window argument with an unconvincing twist .
He chose Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs as an example .
Despite being pulled early by a number of [ unnamed ] exhibitors , it grossed , am I reading this right ? , $ 30.1 million on 3,119 screens .
I have n’t seen this film , so I do n’t know if the sub - Pixar numbers are warranted , but I can tell you this : with that many screens reporting for opening week ( generally the most lucrative ; mama did n’t raise no stupid exhibitors ! ) , the protest was , at best , muted .
Like books , movies suffer from the limited marketing attention , though motion picture awareness and dollars are much higher .
New titles are constantly displacing old , to the point where a release from a month ago is largely forgotten .
( Engrave that thought on your brain . )
Yes , motion pictures ( a category that includes feature films , television series , and made - for - video / DVD ) cycle through a series of windows .
Those windows are growing ever - tighter , especially the one between theatrical release and home entertainment .
It ’s a money thing .
The difference between books and motion pictures is this : a revenue continuum with direct , indirect , and sometimes repeat consumer sales .
Say that three times fast !
So what do I mean by “ revenue continuum with direct , indirect , and sometimes repeat consumer sales ” ?
Good question .
Let ’s walk through an oversimplified ( ha ! ) feature film lifecycle .
I think it ’s instructive to dissect if this what publishing thinks it wants .
Note : I am purposely leaving out some , mostly ancillary , revenue streams ( this is not a master class ) , and there may be steps skipped in real life .
Also , I am leaving out marketing costs associated with trade shows .
Theatrical : Movie is shown in a theatrical setting .
It ’s generally the first time people interact with the film , and if it ’s good , they might pay two or three ( or more ) times to watch it again .
Popcorn and really huge sodas are often involved .
The money split is interesting , with studios getting decreasing returns the longer the film is in the theater ( 90/10 , 80/20 , 70/30 , and so on ; unless it ’s an art house film , which plays out differently ) .
Marketing costs are largely borne by studios ( big , huge marketing costs ) with co-op between studio and theater also in play .
Consumer sales : direct .

Consumer sales : direct .
Non-Theatrical :
This is a pretty big market with not a lot of dollars .
It ’s all showings outside the traditional theater setting ( prisons , schools , boats ) .
Airline sales are generally lumped into this group .
Some consumers may be watching the film for the first time ; others caught it in the theater .
Most marketing costs are borne by the third party , though some co-op comes into play in “ theatrical non-theatrical ” settings .
Consumer sales : direct ( ticket , pay - to - view ) and indirect ( streaming on airplane ) .

Airline sales are generally lumped into this group .
Some consumers may be watching the film for the first time ; others caught it in the theater .
Most marketing costs are borne by the third party , though some co-op comes into play in “ theatrical non-theatrical ” settings .
Consumer sales : direct ( ticket , pay - to - view ) and indirect ( streaming on airplane ) .
Pay - Per -View : A television - based market .
Consumers pay to access a movie .
First - timers and repeat viewers are engaged .
New models are emerging .
Marketing mostly a function of the third party , though , again , possibility for third party .
Consumer sales : generally direct .

Home Entertainment :
Right now , this is mostly DVD , and for a long time , it was the golden egg .
Home entertainment covered that awful gap between production , marketing , and print costs and , oh , profitability .
People have largely finished with building their libraries , and now purchase more selectively .
At its most basic , the home entertainment market breaks down into three areas : sell - through ( consumer purchases product ) , rental / premium ( Blockbuster , Netflix ) , and streaming ( models emerging all the time ) .
Again , first - timers and repeat customers .
Marketing has trended toward the theatrical model .
Consumer sales : direct and indirect .
Pay Television :
In this instance , we ’re talking about the premium pay channels like HBO and Showtime .
Big bucks are paid by premium channels for the privilege of an exclusive television window ( U.S. only ) starting about 12 - 13 months after theatrical release .
First - timers and repeat customers tune in ; people who paid in the theater or own the DVD are funding the license fee if they ’re also premium pay subscribers .
Marketing mostly borne by the third party .
Consumer sales : indirect ( money not associated with a specific product ) .

Network Television / Basic Cable :
Other stuff is happening between Pay and Network , and it ’s discussed below .
Once upon a time , the network debut of a motion picture was a big deal ( and reasonably lucrative ) .
It ’s less so now .
Basic cable has picked up some of the slack here .

Syndicated Television :
This is the never - ending revenue stream ( or seemingly never - ending ) .
International sales do kick in earlier in the lifecycle ( and are a mix of pay and free , depending on the country ) , and domestic syndication happens after the network window .
Films are syndicated like crazy .
In a 24 - hour programming world , there is always time to be filled .
First - timers and repeat customers .
Marketing largely borne by individual stations , though some additional dollars may shake loose , especially if a barter arrangement is employed .

Wash , Rinse , Repeat :
In addition to the ongoing television sales , home entertainment sales continue .
Sometimes a film will get be reissued theatrically , sometimes an older title will show up on an airplane ( crazy , but it happened to me on a flight ! ) .
As long as a product can be sold , it will be sold .
Marketing : situation dependent .
Consumer investment : ditto .
So that ’s what I mean about the revenue continuum .
So how do books fit into this model ?
Well , let ’s see .
Gifts aside , books are generally a one time sale ( more if that consumer suffers from my particular form of insanity and poor library management ) .
As you can surmise from above , there is never an actual gap in the windows .
Ever .
Okay , books can do that .
And , as you can surmise from above , there is a marketing continuum .
Studio and theater advertising leads to airline advertising leads to retailer and studio advertising leads to premium pay advertising leads to network advertising leads to endless commercials in the free television space .
Well , I guess books can do that .
I mean , it ’s gonna take some work to keep titles in the minds of readers , but , sure , I ’ll play along .
The key to success here is constant marketing .
Luckily the costs are spread among players .
This stuff gets expensive .
Trust me .
I ’ve been there .
Note : without this ongoing effort , all hope is lost .
Differences .
“ Windows ” in books do n’t have that lovely mix of direct and indirect money .
They do n’t have that revenue continuum .
Authors only get paid on that first sale .
Actors , directors , and other get residuals and participations , whether the sales are direct or indirect .
A hardcover window does n’t protect hardcover sales from anything but people who want to buy the book in another format ( the horror , people who want to buy books ! ) .
I ’ll be absolutely frank about one thing : publishers have already lost the pricing battle .
They ’re being subsidized by Amazon and Barnes & Noble now , but if they cannot figure out how to make their business work in a consumer - friendly way , well , we saw how ugly it got for the music business .
I love that some publishers argue that it ’s for the authors , because we all know how many authors actually earn a living wage from their writing .
It ’s a business thing , I get that , and there is definitely concern for authors .
There ’s just as much concern for the bottom line .
No shame there .
Truly .
Publishing has , I ’d guess , a year , maybe two , to figure this out .
I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but protecting the current business model — especially since publishers have done nothing to justify any aspect of their ebook pricing stance — is a zero sum game .
You ’re losing me and others as customers .
How do you recover from that ?
Personally , I ’d look to another industry for guidance .
In music , multiple formats have , with some blips , had simultaneous releases .
In some cases , that lead to multiple sales .
Yes , consumer behavior has changed , but it ’s clear two separate formats can co-exist without diminishing the value of either .
Look at how people can — with some teeth - gnashing on the part of the music industry !
— move their music from CD to portable audio player of choice back to CD .
I would also look at the motion picture tradition of skipping theatrical releases when it ’s clear some films are better as direct - to - video ( sadly , a decision sometimes made after expensive production ) .
I get that this is hard .
I ’ve watched it happen in other industries .
It ’s been painful every time , but if you want to succeed , you make it work .
If you want to go down with the ship , I have a lovely window seat for you … .
Updated Hackers from the US and Israel say they have broken copyright protections built in to Amazon 's Kindle for PC , a feat that allows ebooks stored on the application to work with other devices .
The hack began as an open challenge in this ( translated ) forum for participants to come up with a way to make ebooks published in Amazon 's proprietary format display on competing readers .
Eight days later , users going by the handles Labba and i♥cabbages had a working program that did just that .
The hack is the latest to show the futility of digital rights management schemes , which more often than not inconvenience paying customers more than they prevent unauthorized copying .
Once upon a time , Apple laced its iTunes - purchased offerings with similar DRM restrictions that evoked major headaches when trying to do something as simple as transferring songs to a new PC .
When reverse engineering specialist DVD Jon neutered the mechanism , that was the beginning of the end to the draconian regimen , which Apple called , ironically enough , Fairplay .
But most vendors do n't bow so gracefully or quickly out of the reverse - engineering arms race .
Witness , well , Apple , which regularly issues iPhone updates to thwart users who have the audacity to jailbreak the devices they own .
Texas Instruments has also been known to take action against customers who reverse engineer calculators .
Amazon representatives have yet to indicate how they plan to respond .
Queries put to a spokesman on Tuesday were n't returned .
According to a writeup of the Kindle hack here , Amazon engineers went to considerable lengths to prevent their DRM from being tampered with .
The Kindle for PC uses a separate session key to encrypt and decrypt each book " and they seem to have done a reasonable job on the obfuscation , " the author , i♥cabbages , says .
Labba and the US - based i♥cabbages , who declined to give his real name , discovered the attack vector independently around the same time .
The resulting crack is a piece of software called unswindle , which was written by the latter hacker and is available here .
It relies on reverse engineering from a hacker called darkreverser to discover the encryption algorithm used by the universal Mobipocket reader and most Kindle books .
Once unswindle is installed , proprietary Amazon ebooks can be converted into the open Mobi format .
And from there , you can enjoy the content any way you like . ®
This article was updated to add details about collaboration between Labba and i♥cabbages .
I saw that Nickelback just received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance with their song ‘ Burn it to the Ground ’ and wanted to celebrate the event .
Since Nickelback is known for their consistent sound , I thought I ’d try to remix their Grammy - nominated performance to highlight their awesome self - similarity .
So I wrote a little code to remix ‘ Burning to the Ground ’ with itself .
The algorithm I used is pretty straightforward :
Break the song down into smallest nuggets of sound ( a.k. a segments )
For each segment , replace it with a different segment that sounds most similar
I applied the algorithm to the music video .
Here are the results :
Considering that none of the audio is in its original order , and 38 % of the original segments are never used , the remix sounds quite musical and the corresponding video is quite watchable .
Compare to the original ( warning , it is Nickelback ) :
Feel free to browse the source code , download remix and try creating your own .
( CNN ) --
A new anti-government movement has sprung up among protesters in Iran -- and now among their supporters in other countries -- with men posting pictures of themselves on the Internet wearing women 's head scarves as a political statement .
The movement began in recent days as an online backlash after the arrest of one anti-government protester , Majid Tavakoli .
The day after his arrest , an Iranian news agency published a picture of Tavakoli dressed in a chador , a black head - to - toe garment worn by Iranian women .
The government claimed the man had been caught wearing the garment in an attempt to hide himself and avoid arrest , but opposition bloggers insisted that the photo published by the semi-official Fars news agency had been manipulated .
Within hours of the Fars report on the arrest of the 22 - year - old protester , men both inside and outside Iran responded using a what appears to be a new tactic for the opposition -- they began posting pictures of themselves online wearing head coverings that are mandated for women in the Islamic republic .
Hamid Dabashi , professor of Iranian studies at New York 's Columbia University , told CNN Sunday that the pictures are an attempt at causing the Iranian government 's tactics to " humiliate , intimidate or stifle this movement " to backfire .
iReporters cover heads to support protests
" They ( Iranian government officials ) use a standard cliche to try to humiliate men , as if being a woman were something bad , and thousands of Iranians respond by posting these pictures , showing there is absolutely nothing wrong with women or veiling , " said Dabashi , who is a supporter of the arrested protester , Tavakoli .
Adding to the controversy is the Fars agency 's decision to juxtapose the photos of Tavakoli alongside a decades - old photo of the first president of the Islamic republic , Abolhassan Banisadr .
Years ago , Iranian officials accused Banisadr of using women 's clothes to try to escape arrest .
In the nearly 30 - year - old image , Banisadr , who was president for one year at the beginning of Iran 's post - revolutionary period , is shown wearing what appears to be a white floral head scarf .
Though many question the authenticity of the picture , state media at the time used it as evidence that Banisadr attempted to escape the country in a " cowardly " way after his ouster in 1981 .
The Fars report gave no explanation for publishing Banisadr 's photo alongside Tavakoli's , and the two men have no other apparent links .
A blog that focuses on religion and politics in the Muslim world -- Spittoon.org -- interpreted the juxtaposition as being an attempt by the authorities " to humiliate [ Tavakoli , using ] an old practice by the government to prove to the public that the opposition leaders are ' less than men , ' lacking courage and bravery . "
One commentator on that site wrote , " It is ironic how [ the ] head scarf , which was traditionally seen as a symbol of women 's oppression ... is now being used by men to show membership in a liberation movement . "
A Facebook page created Friday night for Tavakoli exhorts supporters to " condemn the state media 's behavior towards Majid Tavakoli , " and " act in solidarity ... to affirm his status as a known symbol of integrity . "
The page adds that the invitation to wear a head covering is " without connotations to hijab as a religious practice , " and that the group 's leaders are " against any kind of forced or imposed hijab . "
Hijab refers to religiously sanctioned dress for men and women in Islam .
Thus the new protest also speaks to the societal aspect of Iranian women being forced to accept a dress code , according to Dabashi .
Alongside his own photo on Facebook , Dabashi describes the varied shades of meaning that this particular form of protest holds for him , referring to his rusari , the loosely tied head scarf that covers only the hair .
" Proud to wear my late mother 's rusari , the very rusari that was forced on my wife in Iran , the very rusari for which my sisters are humiliated if they choose to wear it in Europe , and the very rusari that the backward banality that now rules Iran thinks will humiliate Majid Tavakoli if it is put on him --
He is dearer and nobler to us today than he ever was . "
Tavakoli remains in custody of Iranian security forces , and it is not known what he thinks about becoming associated with this particular protest tactic .
He was arrested after a protest demonstration last Monday .
December 7 is " Students Day " in Iran , an annual observance extolling the virtues of the Islamic Revolution that toppled the Western - backed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , the shah of Iran .
The holiday remembers the killing in 1953 of three university students by the shah 's security forces .
In a speech before his arrest , Tavakoli played on the theme of the day 's historical significance in light of current anti-government protests .
" Stand up against dictatorship and scream all you can against dictatorship .
We do n't accept a dictatorship any more , " Tavakoli said , according to a video of his speech posted on YouTube.com .
" Let 's go to the gates of the university and one more time let 's show our solidarity and unity . "
Columbia University 's Dabashi said the head scarf protest is a way of showing the same solidarity against a system that came into being after the Iranian Revolution .
" We Iranian men are late doing this , " Dabashi said .
" If we did this when rusari was forced on those among our sisters who did not wish to wear it 30 years ago , we would have perhaps not been here today . "
Welcome to Episode 6 of this series .
In this episode , we will learn how your Google App Engine Java ( GAEJ ) Application can receive incoming email .
In an earlier episode of this series , we have covered how to use the Email Service of GAEJ to send out emails from your application .
At that point in time , we were using version 1.2.5 of the AppEngine SDK .
That version did not provide support for handling incoming email .
Since then a newer version of the AppEngine SDK for Java 1.2.6 has been released .
And one of the nice features of this new release is support for incoming email in your application .
What it means is that anyone can send an email to your GAEJ hosted application , it can receive an email and then you can process and perform some business logic with that as required .
Prerequisites
Before we move on , it is important that you have a working setup of the environment and are comfortable with developing a new project using the Google Eclipse plugin .
If not , please go through earlier episodes that contained detailed setup information along with a few development episodes like using Email Service , using the URL Fetch service , etc .
The most important prerequisite is to make sure that you have upgraded your Eclipse environment to the latest AppEngine SDK i.e. 1.2.6 .
Please go through the following : Episode 5 : Upgrading to Google App Engine 1.2.6
A quick check :
To make sure that you have version 1.2.6 of the SDK installed , do the following :
1. In your Eclipse IDE , go to Window –> Preferences .
2. Navigate to Google –> App Engine
3 . You should see version 1.2.6 of the SDK installed .
And make sure that it is the default one by selecting it .
By selecting it , it will be added to the Build Path of your Google Web Application projects .
And we need the latest SDK since it will have support for the Incoming Email feature .
Receiving Email Feature
App Engine now supports incoming email in your applications .
Read the official documentation here .
Your applications can now receive email and you can parse out the email and determine any business logic that needs to be processed .
This opens up a whole new range of applications where you can fulfill requests and send information from your application by allowing users to simply send an email from their favourite email client .
Think of it as a Instant Message itself that your application can receive and react to it .
We had seen in an earlier Episode how through XMPP Support , we can write our own Agent that can receive XMPP messages directly and respond to them .
Now with version 1.2.6 of the SDK , the same functionality has got extended to email too .
And the best part about it is the consistency with which Google has implemented it .
The steps to follow to receive an email is identical to the ones required to receive XMPP messages :
1. Configure your application to receive incoming email by configuring the Mail Service
2. Write and configure a servlet to receive email
3 . Once the application is deployed , anyone can send an email to SomeID@YourApplicationId.appspotmail.com .
SomeID is any id like test , admin , support , etc .
It is just an id .
And YourApplication
Id is the application id of your hosted Google App Engine application .
Let us look at each of the above points in detail now .
But before we begin , create a New Google Web Application Project ( If you wish you can continue to use an existing project to add the incoming Email support , which is what I have done personally , but the choice is yours ) .
Follow these steps to create a new project :
1. Either click on File –> New –>
Other or press Ctrl - N to create a new project .
Select Google and then Web Application project .
Alternately you could also click on the New Web Application Project Toolbar icon as part of the Google Eclipse plugin .
2 . In the New Web Application Project dialog , deselect the Use Google Web Toolkit and give a name to your project .
I have named mine GAEJExperiments .
I suggest you go with the same name so that things are consistent with the rest of the article , but I leave that to you .
3. Click on Finish
This will generate the project and also create a sample Hello World Servlet for you .
But we will be writing our own Servlet .
Configuring the incoming Email Service
This is straightforward and all you need to do is add the following element to the appengine - web.xml file .
The appengine - web.xml file as you know is specific to the Google Java Web Application project and is used for configuring certain services .
You need to configure the Incoming Email Service so that your application is enabled to receive it , being one of them .
It is found in the war \WEB - INF folder of your Web Application Project .
The XML fragment to add at the end but before the < / appengine - web - app > element
< inbound - services > < service > mail</service > </inbound- services >
Configure and code a Java Servlet that will receive the incoming Message
All Email messages to your application are delivered via POST to following URL path in your application : / _ah / mail / as per the Google AppEngine documentation .
So you will need to configure the servlet like the following snippet in the web.xml file , present in the war \WEB - INF folder of your Web Application Project .
We need to add the < servlet / > and < servlet - mapping /> entry to the web.xml file .
This file is present in the WEB - INF folder of the project .
The necessary fragment to be added to your web.xml file are shown below .
Please note that you can use your own namespace and servlet class .
Just modify it accordingly if you do so .
< servlet > < servlet-name>emailhandler</servlet-name > < servlet-class>com.gaejexperiments.email.GAEJReceiveEmailServlet</servlet-class > </ servlet > < servlet - mapping > < servlet-name>emailhandler</servlet-name > <url - pattern>/_ah/mail/*</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping > < security - constraint > < web-resource-collection > <url - pattern>/_ah/mail/*</url-pattern> </web-resource-collection > < auth - constraint > < role-name> admin</role-name > </auth-constraint > </ security - constraint >
In the above snippet , you will find the fixed URL path / _ah / mail / * configured as the < url - pattern / >.
And then I have a Java Servlet class com.gaejexperiments.email.GAEJReceiveEmailServlet as the < servlet - class >.
The security constraint has been added so that in case anyone invokes your url directly , then only Google Account authenticated users will be able to do that .
Now , all we have to do is write our Servlet .
As mentioned , the incoming Email messages will be POSTed to our Servlet , so we need a simple doPost ( … ) implemented in our Servlet .
The code is shown below :
package com.gaejexperiments.email ; import java.io.IOException ; import java.io.
InputStream ; import java.util .
Properties ; import java.util.logging .
Level ; import java.util.logging .
Logger ; import javax.mail.MessagingException ; import javax.mail .Multipart ; import javax.mail .
Part ; import javax.mail .
Session ; import javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage ; import javax.servlet.ServletException ; import javax.servlet.http.* ; @ SuppressWarnings ( " serial " ) public class GAEJReceiveEmailServlet extends HttpServlet { public static final Logger _log = Logger.getLogger(GAEJReceiveEmailServlet.class.getName( ) ) ; @ Override public void doPost ( HttpServletRequest req , HttpServletResponse resp ) throws ServletException , IOException { try { Properties props = new Properties ( ) ; Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance ( props , null ) ; MimeMessage message = new MimeMessage ( session , req.getInputStream ( ) ) ; // Extract out the important fields from the Mime Message String subject = message.getSubject ( ) ; _log.info( " Got an email .
Subject = " + subject ) ; String contentType = message.getContentType( ) ; _log.info(" Email Content Type : " + contentType ) ; printParts ( message ) ; // Parse out the Multiparts // Perform business logic based on the email } catch ( Exception ex ) { _log.log ( Level .
WARNING , " Failure in receiving email : " + ex.getMessage ( ) ) ; } } private static void printParts ( Part p ) throws IOException , MessagingException { Object o = p.getContent ( ) ; if ( o instanceof String ) { System.out.println ( " This is a String " ) ; System.out.println (( String )o ) ; } else if ( o instanceof Multipart ) { System.out.println
( " This is a Multipart " ) ; Multipart mp = ( Multipart ) o ; int count = mp.getCount ( ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < count ; i++) { printParts ( mp.getBodyPart( i ) ) ; } } else if ( o instanceof InputStream ) { System.out.println
( " This is just an input stream " ) ; InputStream is = ( InputStream ) o ; int c ; while ( ( c = is.read ( ) ) != - 1 ) System.out.write( c ) ; } } }
Let us discuss the main parts of the code :
1. We have a doPost ( ) method that gets invoked by the Google App Engine when an email is received .
2. In the doPost ( ) method , we build out the email message ( a instance of class MimeMessage ) using the javax .
mail .* classes as shown below :
Properties props = new Properties ( ) ; Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance ( props , null ) ; MimeMessage message = new MimeMessage ( session , req.getInputStream ( ) ) ;
3 . We extract out key attributes from the Message like subject , content type , etc .
//Extract out the important fields from the Mime Message String subject = message.getSubject ( ) ; _log.info( " Got an email .
Subject = " + subject ) ; String contentType = message.getContentType( ) ; _log.info(" Email Content Type : " + contentType ) ;
4. We have a utility method printParts ( ) , that helps simply print out the contents of the message .
But you could explore the Java Mail API to parse out the multiparts as required and then incorporate your business logic .
5 . To help debug our Servlet , we have put in some log statements along with System Out statements , which we shall look for to verify that the Application did receive email .
Finally , we have used the INFO level to log if the message was sent out successfully or not , so we will have the change the logging level by modified the logging .
properties file present in the war \WEB - INF folder .
The necessary line after modification is shown below :
# Set the default logging level for all loggers to INFO . level = INFO
Deploying our application
To deploy the application , you will need to first create your Application ID .
The Application Identifier can be created by logging in at http://appengine.google.com with your Google Account .
You will see a list of application identifiers already registered under your account ( or none if you are just getting started ) .
To create a new Application , click on the Create Application button and provide the Application Identifier as requested .
Please note this name down since you will be using it for deployment .
For e.g .
I have registered an application identifier named gaejexperiments .
To deploy the application , follow these steps ( they should be familiar to you now ) :
Click on the Deploy Icon in the Toolbar .
In the Deploy dialog , provide your Email and Password .
Do not click on Deploy button yet .
Click on the App Engine Project settings link .
This will lead you to a dialog , where you need to enter your Application ID [ For e.g. my Application Identifier gaejexperiments ]
Click on OK .
You will be lead back to the previous screen , where you can click on the Deploy button .
This will start deploying your application to the GAEJ cloud .
You should see several messages in the Console window as the application is being deployed .
Finally , you should see the message “ Deployment completed successfully ” .
Testing our Application
To test our application , send an email from any mail client to an address within your application .
As explained below , the email address to be used is shown below :
SomeID@YourApplicationId.appspotmail.com
For e.g. my Application
Id is gaejexperiments , so I can send email to any of the following :
test@gaejexperiments.appspotmail.com
user1@gaejexperiments.appspotmail.com
and so on …
Once the email has been sent successfully from a Google Mail Account or Yahoo Mail or Outlook / Thunderbird , etc – you can use the App Engine console to verify if your application received the email or not .
To do that , perform the following steps :
Go to http://appengine.google.com and log in with your account .
You will see a list of applications registered .
Click on the application that you just deployed .
In my case , it is gaejexperiments .
When you click on a particular application , you will be taken to the Dashboard for that application , which contains a wealth of information around the requests , quotas , logs , versions , etc .
This will be a subject of a future episode but for now , it is sufficient to say that you can come over here to monitor the health of your application and also to analyze what is going on .
Click on the Logs link as shown in the screenshot below :
This will display the application log .
And all your application log statements that you code using the Logger class can be visible here .
By default , the severity level is set at ERROR and we can change that to DEBUG , the lowest level and you should be able your log statements that had the log level of INFO .
This was the log level at which we had logged statements like Received an Email , etc in our Java Servlet , so that is what we need to check for .
If you see the statements , it means that the message has been received .
Shown below is a screen shot of the log for a message that I sent .
Once this mechanism is in place , it means that your application has been correctly setup and deployed for receiving email messages .
You can now build in business logic on what you need to do when an email is received .
Hope you had a good time reading this episode .
The next episode I plan to extend an existing episode in which we built an XMPP Bot and deployed it on the Google App Engine .
I plan to extend the bot to support the collaboration tool Google Wave , so that your bot can participate in a Wave conversation too .
Till then , happy GAEJ ’ing !
When Ben Bernanke took charge of the Federal Reserve in 2006 , the media made a few passing references that suggested he secretly subscribed to libertarianism .
" I worked with him for years before I even knew he was a libertarian - leaning Republican , " the former Fed vice chairman Alan Blinder told CNN .
The Wall Street Journal reported that Bernanke , " though a libertarian Republican … displays few partisan leanings . "
Last summer President Barack Obama re-nominated Bernanke to another four - year term atop the central bank , a reward for allegedly saving the world from a second Great Depression .
Bernanke will arrive at his Senate confirmation hearings this January with an unbeatable recommendation .
" As an expert on the causes of the Great Depression , " Obama raved in August , " I 'm sure Ben never imagined that he would be part of a team responsible for preventing another .
But because of his background , his temperament , his courage and his creativity , that 's exactly what he has helped to achieve . "
" Mission Accomplished , " the banner might have read .
Missing from Obama 's speech was any mention of Bernanke 's economic philosophy .
These days , the media have taken to calling him a Keynesian — a believer in fiscal stimulus and the mixed economy .
" We are all Keynesians again , " the liberal Washington Monthly headlined a January 2009 feature on the Fed chief .
In reality , Bernanke is following a monetarist depression - prevention model laid out by Nobel laureate and libertarian patron saint Milton Friedman .
The Fed chairman has invoked the late economist in support of lowering interest rates to zero and bailing out banks .
Trillions of dollars have been staked on the insights of " monetarism , " the economic theory of central banking and inflation - management associated with Friedman and Anna Schwartz .
Though Schwartz now distances herself from Bernanke , opposing his reappointment on the grounds that he 's gone too far , the irony remains that a series of Fed policies many libertarians find repugnant are being championed by a man claiming to take his chief inspiration from the most influential libertarian economist of the 20th century .
A Monetary History of Ben Bernanke
The story begins in 1963 , when Friedman and co-author Anna Schwartz published A Monetary History of the United States , an opening salvo in what Friedman called a " counterrevolution " against Keynesian theory .
Their chapter on the Great Depression was spun off into a stand - alone book , The Great Contraction : 1929 –1933 , an epic revisionist history that changed America 's understanding of the causes of the Depression .
Friedman and Schwartz contended that the Federal Reserve — not capitalism or Wall Street — was to blame for the dismal ' 30s .
" The fact of the matter is that it was the [ Fed 's ] decision to tighten credit policy in 1928 that produced the Great Contraction , " the 93 - year - old Schwartz says by phone from her office at the National Bureau of Economic Research in New York City .
The Fed hiked interest rates in 1928 to curb what it saw as rampant speculation on Wall Street — a conflagration of leverage , margin buying , and outright Ponzi scheming fueled in the first instance by cheap credit from the Federal Reserve .
( Goldman Sachs ' various pyramid schemes from that era , after they collapsed in 1929 , generated losses of $ 475 billion in today 's dollars . )
Friedman and Schwartz rejected the widely held theory that speculation had been a major problem , or that there had even been a credit bubble in the 1920s .
Bad loans and reckless banking practices were a " minor factor , " at most , in the Great Depression , they said .
In this narrative , a Federal Reserve paranoid about speculation had needlessly constricted the money supply , imploding an otherwise sound economy .
After the Great Crash of 1929 , the Federal Reserve drastically cut interest rates from a brief high of 6 percent to 1.5 percent by mid-1931 .
But during the first few years of the crisis , the Fed occasionally felt forced to abruptly raise rates again in complicated maneuvers to stem outflows of gold into Europe .
Friedman and Schwartz blamed these sporadic interest rate hikes for smothering incipient recoveries , opening a vortex of deflation , and transforming a recession into the Great Depression .
" What the Fed had to do was increase the money supply , " Schwartz tells me .
" By taking that action , it would have revived the economy .
That 's the lesson of the Great Depression . "
In The Great Contraction , she and Friedman argued that the Fed squandered its ample latitude to combat deflation .
" The monetary authorities , " they wrote , " could have prevented the decline in the stock of money — indeed , could have produced almost any desired increase in the money stock . "
When it comes to his academic specialty , Bernanke is a disciple of Friedman and Schwartz .
In 2002 , at Friedman 's 90th birthday party at the University of Chicago , Bernanke was effusive .
" Among economic scholars , " he began , " Friedman has no peers . "
He developed the " leading and most persuasive " explanation of the Depression , whose impact on economics and the popular mind " cannot be overstated . "
At the end of his encomium , Bernanke made a soon - to - be - famous apology on behalf of the Federal Reserve , where he was then president of the powerful New York branch : " I would like to say to Milton and Anna…regarding the Great Depression .
You 're right , we did it .
We 're very sorry .
But thanks to you , we wo n't do it again . "
( The speech was published as the afterword to the latest edition of The Great Contraction . )
Schwartz was present at the birthday party .
" I 'm sure he was sincere when he said that , " she says .
And Bernanke stayed true to his word .
In 2006 he replaced Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve .
Greenspan , a self - described " libertarian Republican " who had once been part of Ayn Rand 's inner circle , had engineered an era of low - inflation growth that won Friedman 's endorsement .
" There is no other period of comparable length in which the Federal Reserve System has performed so well , " Friedman declared in The Wall Street Journal on January 31 , 2006 .
Monetarism and Freedom
When the economy collapsed two years into Bernanke 's watch because of a massive credit bubble , he slashed interest rates to zero and ordered the money - printing presses to full steam .
He also embarked on a course of " quantitative easing , " where a central bank convolutedly buys its own government 's bonds with printed money so as to sink interest rates even further .
This approach was not new .
Friedman had prescribed quantitative easing , combined with " easy money " and inflation , as a cure for Japan 's 1990s economic slump , which he described as an " eerie , if less dramatic , replay of the Great Contraction . "
As he did with the Depression - era Fed , Friedman emphasized that " there is no limit to the extent to which the Bank of Japan can increase the money supply if it wishes to do so . "
In 1998 , a year after Friedman penned his advice in The Wall Street Journal , Japan introduced monetary stimulus : a cocktail of zero interest rates and quantitative easing .
But deflation continued .
Today Japan 's exports are down an unthinkable 36 percent from just last year , and prices are plummeting at an all - time record pace .
Stateside , in the shadow of the Fed 's multi-trillion - dollar balance sheet , it has been all too easy to categorize Bernanke simply as a Keynesian supporter of public works projects , socialistic safety nets , and profligate , government - led consumption .
While it's true that the Obama ad- ministration is pursuing Keynesian fiscal stimulus , the Federal Reserve under Bernanke has consciously acted on the Friedman / Schwartz insight that loosening central bank credit is a fundamental tool in forestalling deflation and depression .
Understanding that monetarism can mean both the management of low inflation in good times , and the creation of inflation in bad times , has proven too difficult for most of the media .
The New York Times , for instance , has identified Bernanke as " a student if not necessarily a devotee of the British economist John Maynard Keynes . "
Actually , Bernanke spent most of his academic career elaborating on Friedman 's Keynes - refuting interpretation of the Great Depression .
Athough his research sometimes strayed into nonmonetary subjects , it was always , as he said at Friedman 's birthday party , " an embellishment of the Friedman - Schwartz story … and in no way contradict[ed ] the basic logic of their analysis . "
In 2003 , at a conference honoring Friedman 's Free to Choose , Bernanke said , " Friedman 's monetary framework has been so influential that , in its broad outlines at least , it has nearly become identical with modern monetary theory and practice . "
So great was Friedman 's influence that Bernanke compared it with Shakespeare 's contributions to English literature .
Even Bernanke 's nickname " Helicopter Ben " derives directly from Milton Friedman .
It came about during a 2002 speech entitled " Deflation : Making Sure ' It ' Does n't Happen Here , " in which he quoted Friedman on the importance of conjoining fiscal and monetary policies .
The ideal fiscal stimulus , Bernanke said , was a shower of tax cuts " equivalent to Milton Friedman 's famous ' helicopter drop ' of money . "
Friedman had originally used the phrase to counter Keynes ' idea of the " liquidity trap , " in which setting interest rates at zero leads to bank hoarding and leaves the Federal Reserve no room to maneuver .
Friedman suggested that countries could escape the liquidity trap by handing out money to consumers , and he explained his argument in a tale about a helicopter unloading cash on a town .
Likewise , Bernanke 's Federal Reserve has created special " vehicles " to disburse consumer credit from on high .
In February , Bloomberg News added to the philosophical confusion by reporting that " Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is siding with John Maynard Keynes against Milton Friedman by flooding the financial system with money . "
Of course , Bernanke has said precisely the opposite .
He 's flooding the financial system with money during a deflationary crisis , he says , because that 's what Friedman would have him do .
On February 10 , Bernanke further underscored his allegiance to Friedman in an overlooked Capitol Hill question - and - answer session with Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .
Their exchange is worth quoting at length .
" Chairman , " Paul began , " you have written a lot about the Depression .
There was a famous quote you made once to Milton Friedman , apologizing for the Federal Reserve bringing on the Depression .
But you assured him it would n't happen again .
… But the key to this discussion has to be :
Was it too much credit in the ' 20s that created the conditions that demanded a recession / depression , or was it lack of credit in the Depression that caused the prolongation ?
…
Here we 're working frantically to keep prices up .
What 's wrong with allowing the market to dictate this …and prices to go down quickly so we can all go back to work again ? "
In response , Bernanke repeated the lesson of The Great Contraction : " Milton Friedman 's view was that the cause of the Great Depression was the failure of the Federal Reserve to avoid excessively tight monetary policy in the early ' 30s .
That was Friedman and Schwartz 's famous book .
With that lesson in mind , the Federal Reserve has reacted very aggressively to cut interest rates in this current crisis .
Moreover , we 've tried to avoid the collapse of the banking system . "
For her part , Schwartz is critical of Bernanke 's application of her and Friedman 's theories .
" You do n't have to lower the interest rates to the extent that he has in order to increase the money supply , " she says .
" The essential action should be increasing the money supply .
That 's the lesson of the Great Depression . "
She adds , " There 's nothing contradictory in The Great Contraction with reference to what the Fed should be doing currently . "
Schwartz is alarmed by the enthusiasm with which Bernanke has put " monetary expansion " into practice .
She berates the Fed for going too far and predicts that it will have to raise interest rates " in the near future " to arrest inflation .
Asked if she sees hyperinflation on the horizon , she exclaims , " Oh , yes ! "
In a New York Times op - ed last July , Schwartz criticized Bernanke as a " man without a plan , " warning that his " easy monetary policy is a sin . "
She concluded , " He does not deserve reappointment . "
Schwartz also seems to have undergone a late - life conversion to at least some part of Keynesian theory .
Asked for her current solution to the crisis , she repeats the ultimate Keynesian maxim :
The government should pick up slackening demand in the private sector .
" People are saving , not spending .
In order to revive this economy , " she says , hesitating before continuing , " the government will have to resume spending .
By spending , the government will require that the current inventory will be depleted and have to be replenished .
And that will bring on additional production and jobs . "
Bernanke 's Money Mischief
Ron Paul , like Schwartz and Friedman , is a libertarian , but he embraces the " Austrian " school of economic theory that rejects the very concept of the Federal Reserve .
He is critical of what he sees as the Fed 's ongoing monetarism .
" In essence , " Paul says in a phone interview , " Bernanke is following Friedman 's advice .
He 's a Friedmanite when it comes to massively inflating .
Bernanke was able to justify [ his policies ] by using Friedman . "
Does Friedman 's enthusiasm for inflating the monetary supply in crises flout libertarianism ?
" Absolutely , " Paul answers .
" The monetarists said that you could overcome a natural market correction of a collapsing system by inflation — print money faster !
Which contradicts Friedman 's whole thesis .
He wanted a steady , managed increase in the supply of money of about 3 percent . "
Here Paul is alluding to Money Mischief , Friedman 's 1991 book in which he called on the Fed to grow the money supply at 3 percent annually , presumably forever .
" Yet at the same time , Friedman said the Depression could have been prevented by massively inflating . "
Paul has kind words for Friedman , whom he praises as a staunch defender of economic liberty , but his final summation is damning : " Friedman 's very , very libertarian — except on monetary issues . "
With Bernanke at the helm , the Federal Reserve has unleashed monetary expansion , the very definition of inflation — and Friedman 's blueprint for averting economic depression .
According to Bernanke , Obama , and scores of economists , it 's working .
" Prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good , " Bernanke predicted in August .
But with lenders foreclosing on 358,000 homes that month , the commercial real estate market only beginning to collapse , a 20 percent annual fall in railroad freight , and unemployment projected to crack double digits any minute now , the much - vaunted recovery is no given .
And if it is n't working , we might still relapse into recession , or worse .
The total cost of the Fed 's monetarist - inspired program is mysterious .
Paul , whose bill to audit the Fed is now co-sponsored by more than half of the House of Representatives , declares : " We do n't know for sure how much the Fed has spent — I 've heard it could be $ 6 trillion .
But we have no knowledge of what the Fed 's doing .
All these dealings are very secret . "
A Reuters estimate in late September pegged the Fed 's balance sheet around $ 2.1 trillion , with $ 111 billion doled out to banks every day through the Fed 's overnight discount window .
Bloomberg News has sued the Federal Reserve for full disclosure , and we may soon find out the exact number .
Manhattan Chief U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska has ordered the Federal Reserve to open its books , though the bank has filed an appeal .
Friedman and Schwartz , those champions of low inflation , have helped inspire the greatest monetary expansion in Federal Reserve history , a program of limitless market interventions and tireless money printing whose end game is likely to be a return to the bad old days of inflation that they fought for so long .
For two libertarian champions of free markets and limited government , this unintended legacy has the ring of a world - historic irony .

Alyson Hannigan tweeted earlier tonight about shooting a musical number for How I Met Your Mother , and the special guest she invited .
alydenisof : I asked Joss to visit today while we were shooting the musical number .
He did .
Joss + Musical = FLASHBACKS
alydenisof : I have to say I sound MUCH better now !!!
( now that nobody is listening )
alydenisof : Luckily Neil does most of the singing !
alydenisof : Anytime I sing , it will be mostly filler .
That last tweet is so perfect , is n’t it ?
( Hint : It ’s very similar to a line she sings in the Buffy musical . )
Sigh. View Alyson Hannigan ’s Twitter .
related : Dear Joss Whedon , Do n’t Stop Believing
A longtime Joss Whedon fan reflects on the past in a piece that is less of a structured argument and more of a hopeless love letter .
Read it while you listen to “ Hopelessly Devoted to You ” by Olivia Newton John for the full effect .
In September 26th I wrote a post about a new space strategy game in the making called Aphelion : Phoenix Rising .
You can read the post here : Aphelion Phoenix Rising : A new 4 x Space Strategy Game under Development .
By then Brad Ottoson ( main developer ) told me that “ [ Aphelion ] wo n’t be out for a few years still but we have a lot of it done ” .
Having liked what I saw and after having a nice chat with Brad I decided to invite Brad for an interview which he kindly accepted .
Here is the interview we did .
I hope you enjoy it as much as I have .
1. In Aphelion : Phoenix Rising ( APR ) website you introduce the game Races .
To help people connect and know a bit more about APR could you make a small preview of the game background story ?
Essentially most the races are interconnected in someway .
We do n’t want to say to much , otherwise we ’ll be giving away the plot that will unfold during gameplay so we can tell you the basics .
Essentially everything started with an event in the past in which a Brown dwarf ( Solar system is n’t old enough for it to exist yet ) appears out of now were and is in a collision course with Sol ’s sun , roughly 100 years in the future from now .
The collision will create a supernova when the Brown dwarf ’s gravity sucks the hydrogen from the Sun and it explosively fuses all the hydrogen from the sun in one massive fusion reaction , destroying the solar system .
The governments of earth all band together to create 3 embryo ships to carry humanity elsewhere .
These are named the Pinta , the Nina and the Santa Maria and bring with them storage devices , detailing all of earth technologies .
Each ship takes off in different direction in hopes of finding a suitable planet to colonize using powerful sub light speed drives .
The story continues , thousands of years in the future when an empire created from the survivors of the Pinta emerges .
The Pinta arrived at it ’s destination a few thousand years late , this was due to the fact that it sustained substantial damage to it ’s engines from space debris , slowing it speed .
The Pintar began to explore the galaxy and encounter 5 other distinct races .
They encounter the Therans who are a peaceful aquatic race who are naive .
As a result the Therans are easy marks at first to other races as they are caught unprepared to violence and greed that other exhibit .
Also encountered are the Greys .
They are an unique species with fragile bodies and massive intellect , but unfortunately for them they are rather irrational and unfocused in their thinking .
The Pintar view the Greys with suspicion , because rumors have it that the Grey ’s technology gives off readings similar to those that were detected when the Brown dwarf appeared in the past and it is felt they had some part in it .
They also encounter the Vitruvians , who are a cybernetic race .
This is not by choice though as in the past their race was infected by a complex and deadly infection that they named “ the sickness ” .
“ The sickness ” bonded with their DNA and became part of them .
As time progress the nature of “ the sickness ” mutated and began to create congenital problems their organs .
As a result , they became experts at replacing vital organs with mechanical ones , prolonging their lives while a cure is created .
Progress has been mixed and it is unknown if they will ever reverse the damage to become “ pure ” again , but they have been successful at creating treatments to slow the mutation of “ the sickness ” , prolonging the survival of their species .
The next two species encountered had an interconnected past .
The subterranean Atton and the insect - like Atrox had fought on opposite sides in an ancient galaxy wide war in the past .
The Atton were allied with the “ Precursors ” who they worshiped as gods .
Both were losers in the battle when the Atton were beaten back and all but exterminated when their planet ’s surface was vaporized in a massive nuclear holocaust .
They continued by living underground for countless years until the lingering radiation on the planet ’s surface dissipated .
They Blame the Atrox for this apocalyptic event and vow vengeance .
The Atrox were beat back in a series of massive battles till they were isolated on their home planet .
The “ Precursors ” in a stroke of tactical genius , altered the course of a planet in their solar system to create a never ending eclipse of the Atrox home world .
This rapidly cooled the planet and froze the Atrox in an icy grave .
This recently has been undone though , as a massive asteroid has struck the eclipsing planet and altered its course , thawing the Atrox and releasing them back upon the galaxy .
Curiously the Atrox and the Atton share Some DNA and show signs of DNA manipulation within their genetics , the Atrox more so than the Atton .
There is little record of the “ Precursors ” in historic documents after the sealing of the Atrox within their prison .
It is thought that they left the galaxy to search out a new galaxy to start anew .
The Atton await the return of their gods and focus their efforts and religion on reconnecting with them .
2 . In the website you mention that the APR Races will have their “ own individual tech tree , that is unique to them ” .
Does this mean that there will be different specific techs ( different bonuses , requirements , special abilities ) for each race or just a different combination ( tech path ) of the total number of techs available to all the races ?
You also mentioned that the tech trees are somewhat randomly generated in each game .
Could you explain a bit more how it works ?
Yes , all the technologies for each race are completely specific to that race and are not shared with any other race .
These technologies reflect each race and give each a distinct feel .
To give an example , the Atton are a faction that is controlled by an authoritarian government centered on their beliefs .
Many of their “ system ” technologies revolve around religious decrees .
In addition they are distinct as they are the only faction to lack any form of shielding for their spaceships .
In contrast , the Vitruvians are a cybernetic race and much of their “ system ” technologies revolve around increasing society efficiency by joining their consciousness .
Also the Vitruvians are quite reliant on shielding technologies to protect their ships , and are equipped with the minimal armor .
3 . You also mention that players will be able to colonize planets according to their terraforming capabilities , and that will depend on the right level of terraforming technology .
Does this mean that the player will be allowed to colonize every planet or does he / she need to unlock some specific techs first ?
There will be a variety of different planets within our game much like there is in the real universe .
These will range from Irradiated planets in a semi locked orbit such as Mercury is , to frozen wastelands such as Pluto .
Obviously some planets such as these on the extreme ranges of the spectrum could not be terraformed regardless of technological knowhow .
In our game we will have inhabitable planet classes such as Barren , Swamp , Oceanic , Arid , and Terrain .
These planets will be colonizable without any further terraformation and will support population dependent on class and size .
The Therans will receive an additional population bonus on Oceanic planets since they are an amphibious race and can thrive in water .
Terraformable planets are either too hot to sustain any substantial amount of life such as desert planets , or conversely too cold such as Arctic and Arctic Desert planets .
To colonize these planets , the player must first research specific technologies that allow them to terraform these planets .
The technologies will be either “ warming ” technologies for the Arctic and Arctic desert planets or , “ cooling ” technologies for Desert planets .
Each planet will have a specific level of technological difficulty to terraform .
These are represented by “ tick ” marks and each planet can have up to 7 levels .
Conversely each technology will allow the player to terraform a number of levels alone .
These technologies can be combined together to terraform more difficult planets .
An example would be if you had a desert planet with that needed four levels of terraforming .
To terraform this planet you may have to combine a technology that cools a planet two levels with two additional technologies that cool a single level apiece .
At this point the planet would slowly be terraformed over a certain number of turns depending on it ’s size and technologies used , and will become one of the habitable planet types in the end .
Technologies used to terraform cost resources in the form of alloy and Galactic credit’s .
Not all technologies are equal and some are faster , or more resource efficient than others .
As mentioned before , not all planets are terraformable .
Irradiated , Frozen core , Volcanic and and Gas giant planets fall in this class of planets .
This does not mean they are worthless since many structures that you build in you system are dependent on these classes of planets and could not be built otherwise .
4 . You mentioned to me previously that APR is inspired by various 4 x space strategy games like Master of Orion 2 and StarTrek : Birth of the Federation .
Taking this into consideration in which aspects will APR innovate the genre and why should the fans be looking forward for APR ?
Our original goal was to make a game very similar to Birth of the Federation with new graphics , since we were frustrated that no one had came out with a proper sequel .
We then stood back and thought “ what was great about this game ” and “ what did it not do that well ” .
What we thought was great was the layout for planets and the main exploration screen .
BOTF ’s planet management was nice in the fact that you managed systems as a whole instead of individual planets , this allowed you to manage many more planets then the typical per planet way .
This allowed you the feeling of managing a massive empire without the headaches of actually having to manage every aspect of a massive empire .
We felt one of the weaknesses of MOO2 was that you had to build the exact same structures on every planet of your system and could n’t manage them as a whole .
What we did find that MOO2 did better than BOTF was primary their Tactical combat system .
In Birth of the Federation , you built a fleet and then had them battle with an enemy fleet in a battle royal .
Though options for tactical maneuvers existed , the most of the time the best tactics ended up being limited to charging in and firing all your weapons at opposing ships .
This went against the core gameplay for a turn based strategy game .
MOO2 on the other hand allowed the player to move each ship independently and to maneuver to present their least exposed side to the enemy while trying to focus firepower on one quadrant of the enemies .
This was exceptionally strategic and plays the core gameplay that our fans enjoy .
So we chose to have a style similar to MOO2 in that aspect with a top down view on a grid battle map where each ship in maneuvered individually .
We have innovated and expanded gameplay in many area ’s within our game .
As mentioned before , we have a unique method for players to terraform planets and research technology .
We also like to give the players choices throughout the game , and many times throughout the tech tree the player will have to choose one technological branch over another .
Players will not be able to research both branches in these instances .
Another instance where we will infuse choice into the game is during events .
These can be triggered many ways .
Often the player will be given a situation where they must choose one action over another , and the outcomes are not set in place .
Often what was determined to be the right choice in one game , brings an entirely different outcome in another game .
In addition we have added much to espionage within our game .
Players will train spies and maintain a pool of them .
To perform tasks , a player will choose an action and send a spy on a mission .
After a certain number of turns this task will come to completion .
For each mission there are a vast number of outcomes that can happen , such as the agent could successfully complete his mission and then succeed in implicating another faction in the deed .
This would lower that player ’s trust rating and cause the friendliness rating between the 2 factions to fall .
On the opposite end of the spectrum , your agent could fail and become captured and turned into a double agent .
If this happens , you will be notified that your agent failed at his mission and has returned .
Any operations following this action will be severely compromised until your spy agency uncovers that there is a traitor .
In addition , if your moral is faltering , you can send agents to perform operations to silence critics within your empire , raising morale .
Nothing is without consequences though , and these operations could fail and backfire .
One area which we felt was often neglected within our genre that we wish to improve on , is ground combat .
In APR , we decided we wanted to implement an engaging , yet brief ground combat system .
We did this because we wanted to add more depth to the game , yet we did n’t want to drag the game to a crawl by adding a long in depth battle system which would force other player to wait , while other completed .
Our combat system will be engaging and entertaining and the outcome will not be completely predetermined , leaving some suspense .
Mostly this will be based on each player ’s choices prior to combat .
It will also take into account , technologies researched , building built and population for the defending side and numbers of transports used by the attacking side .
To help the story line progress , many random events will occur throughout that will uncover portions of the past to give back story .
In addition , while exploring the galaxy , players will uncover artifacts on planets that will give bonuses and back story as well .
As the galaxy is essentially completely explored by mid game , we devised a way to extend this exploration portion by allowing players to form expeditions to explore inhospitable planets in search of artifacts and secret laboratories .
To do this , players must research specific technologies that will enable exploration parties for specific planet types .
An example of this would be ultra high pressure exploration vessels for gas giant exploration .
APR is built on what we feel are the strong points of our favorite games , but it has grown to be unique on it ’s own , with far to many innovations to list .
What I have listed above are just a few of things that players can look forward to .
5 . Will APR provide multiplayer capabilities ?
Hot - seat , LAN support ?
APR can be played over the internet with any extra seats being controlled by AIs .
Players on a LAN can play , though LAN players will have to connect to the matchmaking server though the internet to start the game .
There will not be a hotseat mode in the game .
6 . When do you plan to release a playable demo ?
We have n’t decided to release a playable demo yet .
We ’re still weighing the pros and cons of doing so , such as the time required to produce it vs the increased interest it could generate .
7 . For which platforms are you planning to release for ?
Will this include Mac ?
The platforms we initially release on will most likely depend on our publishing arrangement when the game is complete .
The game source code is occasionally compiled and run on a computer running Linux , and we expect there wo n’t be many problems getting it to run on Macs .
8 . And by mentioning APR release .
In September 2009 you mention to me that APR “ wo n’t be out for a few years still but we have a lot of it done ” .
In the site ’s forum , in a 2006 post you mention 2011 as the release date .
Is this still the target for APR release ?
Much depends on if we receive outside funding through a publisher or other outside source .
While this would certainly speed up APR ’s development , we are unwilling to sign a publishing deal just for the sake of getting funding .
If we must continue to finish the game on our own it may take longer than we anticipated , but we are willing take do this route if needed .
Everyday brings us closer to completion and progress has been steady .
So far we have not gotten any bids on Jared ’s left kidney , but we are still hopeful .
Thank you for your time Brad .
Thanks .

Posted by John , December 27th , 2009 - under Imperialism , Saudi Arabia , Yemen .
A vicious little war has broken out in the Middle East , along Saudi Arabia ’s border with Yemen .
It is rooted in a struggle for control over the strategically vital Arab country .
In the latest incident , Saudi warplanes are accused of killing at least 70 people in a mass bombing raid on villages said to be under the control of Shia Muslim rebels , known as Huthis .
The Huthi rebels claim that there have been 50 such raids since November .
In August , the Yemeni government launched a mass offensive against a five - year Shia rebellion .
The Shia tribesmen retreated to the mountainous region along the border with Saudi Arabia – and in November Saudi troops were drawn into the fighting .
The first Saudi offensive in November ended in humiliation .
Huthi rebels routed Saudi troops and captured large amounts of equipment and ammunition .
There have been several further attempts by Saudi forces to dislodge the rebels and the latest raids are part of this ongoing campaign .
This conflict is being framed as one between the Western - backed Yemeni government and its Saudi allies on one side and Shia rebels supported by Iran and trained by Hizbollah on the other .
This fits with a rhetoric that paints the region as being in the grip of wider sectarian conflict pitting Shia Muslims against Sunni Muslims .
But the rebellion is far more complicated .
It marks an ironic turn in the fortunes of the Huthis and the shifting sands of Middle East alliances .
Divided
Yemen is made up of two major regions with different histories .
What is now northern Yemen was once part of the Ottoman Empire .
Following the collapse of the empire in 1918 , the Shia royal family ruled northern Yemen from its capital in Sanaa .
The south , with its key port of Aden , had been ruled by the British Empire since 1839 .
This region is mainly Sunni Muslim .
In the 1950s and 1960s a popular rebellion inspired by Gamal Abdul Nasser ’s revolution in Egypt swept both countries .
Rebels in Aden launched a war of liberation against the British , while an alliance of disaffected tribes and army officers plotted to depose the king in the north .
In 1962 , a coup inspired by pro-Nasser officers overthrew the king .
He found refuge in Saudi Arabia .
Feted as a hero in the struggle against “ communism ” , the king launched an insurgency that was supported by Saudi Arabia , Jordan , the Shah ’s Iran and the West .
The Israelis ran regular supply drops to the royalist forces and even offered to bomb the Arab nationalist forces under siege in Sanaa .
In response Nasser dispatched some 70,000 troops to help crush the royalist insurgency .
The plan ended in disaster .
Nasser ’s troops found the royalists ’ mountain strongholds impossible to conquer and , following Egypt ’s crushing defeat by Israel in the 1967 war , they eventually withdrew .
Western - backed forces now surrounded Sanaa .
Although the fighting reached a stalemate , they forced the nationalist officers to flee .
But while the royalists were cementing their victory , nationalist rebels in the south finally drove out the British , declaring independence in 1967 .
In 1969 south Yemen was declared a socialist republic .
The two Yemens came to represent the intractable conflict between the West and the Arab revolutions .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 , the two countries united .
The new Yemen was hailed as a triumph for the West .
The new government became a firm ally of the West and the port of Aden was transformed into a key US naval base .
The Shia tribes found themselves abandoned by their former allies .
Isolated and out of favour , they began to demand more autonomy .
Five years ago they erupted into rebellion .
Meanwhile the Yemeni authorities found themselves facing a second enemy .
Popular discontent , fuelled by Israel ’s attacks on the Palestinians and a failing economy , spilled out into the streets .
The discontent created fertile terrain for radical Sunni Muslim groups , said to be inspired by Al Qaida , to launch a series of well planned attacks on US forces , including the spectacular October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole at anchor in the port of Aden .
Battleground
The US began to fear that Yemen would be torn apart by both Shia and Sunni rebels .
The country was declared as an “ Al Qaida rear base ” and the new battleground between the West and Iran .
The West and its Arab allies poured in money and arms to shore up Yemen ’s unpopular government .
There is another bitter twist to the conflict .
Many Yemenis despise the Shia tribes for their role in destroying the Arab nationalist republic .
Meanwhile many of the radical Sunni groups are deeply hostile to the Shias who they consider to be heretical .
The West is now fearful that the country is being pulled apart in a three - way conflict .
The US announced this month that it will be sending special forces to help the regime fight the Sunni rebels , while Saudi Arabia is stepping in to “ deal ” with the Shia rebels .
The recent aerial bombardment by Saudi warplanes is reminiscent of the raids by Egyptian forces in the 1960s .
Those raids proved ineffective in driving the rebels out of their mountain strongholds .
The Saudis could find themselves dragged into a similar conflict – this time with an enemy smarting at being betrayed , and well - honed in the art of guerrilla warfare .

Your Grandma was right .
It turns out that the acetic acid found in plain ole ’ vinegar is effective in suppressing body fat accumulation .
The Science
Earlier this year , Japanese researchers found that laboratory mice fed a high - fat diet and given acetic acid developed significantly less body fat ( up to 10 percent less ) than other mice .
Based upon their findings , the scientists believe that acetic acid fights fat by turning on genes for fatty acid oxidation enzymes .
The genes churn out proteins involved in breaking down fats , thus suppressing body fat accumulation in the body .
Conclusion
Vinegar is cheap , harmless and versatile in the kitchen .
It may also help you metabolize sugars more efficiently , lower blood pressure and lose weight .
What do you have to lose ?

Several thousand people who had settled illegally in Kenya 's most important forest have left their homes at the beginning of an eviction plan designed to end rampant environmental degradation in the Rift valley .
Security officers this week entered the Mau forest , the country 's largest water catchment basin , in the first stage of a government operation that will eventually see up to 30,000 families leave .
More than a quarter of the 400,000 - hectare forest has been lost because of human activity over the past 20 years , threatening Kenya 's crucial tourism , tea and energy sectors and the livelihoods of millions of people reliant on the Mau ecosystem .
" We have no time to waste here , " said Christian Lambrechts , a United Nations environment programme expert seconded to the government 's Mau Secretariat .
" The ecological services must be restored . "
The dozen or so rivers that originate in the montane forest complex feed the Masai Mara Reserve and Lake Victoria , as well as the lush tea fields of Kericho .
But in recent years the river flows have decreased or stopped during the dry season .
At Lake Nakuru , Kenya 's most visited national park , wildlife officials were forced to pump in water to supply the animals this summer when all the feeder rivers dried up .
A serious drought that has led to water and power shortages across the country was a contributing factor .
But human destruction of the once - thick Mau Forest , which has caused its aquifer levels to fall significantly and seen soil erosion increase , played a major part .
At its root , as so often happens in Kenya , is politics and corruption .
Before the 1990s , the forest was a protected area .
But then senior officials in President Daniel arap Moi's government grabbed large plots of the highly fertile land for themselves – Moi still owns a large tea farm in the Mau – profiting from the timber they cleared .
They also removed protection from other parts of the forest where thousands of their supporters were allowed to settle and begin farming .
Many of the plots were subdivided and then illegally sold on , sometimes to unwitting buyers .
Amid warnings that the entire ecosystem in the Rift valley and western Kenya was in danger due to the rapid deforestation , Kenya 's government has made saving the Mau its number one environmental priority .
A task force formed by the prime minister , Raila Odinga , last year recommended that all settlers in the forest be removed and that cleared areas be rehabilitated through mass tree planting .
Only genuine titleholders – many of the titles in circulation are fictitious – are to be considered for compensation .
Some politicians from Moi's Kalenjin ethnic group , among them large beneficiaries of the land grab , have opposed the plan , describing it as an attack on their community .
They have demanded alternative land for the nearly 1,700 families – about 8,000 people – identified as illegal squatters without title who are being targeted in the first phase of the operation .
About 3,500 of them had left the Mau by this morning after being served with eviction notices .
Some have complained they have nowhere else to go .
The next round of relocations , due in the next few months , will focus on those people with some sort of title to the land .
The trickiest part will be dealing with the large landowners , including the politicians , who are unlikely to give up their farms without a fight .
It is likely that some forest dwellers , including a few thousand members of the Ogiek ethnic group who have lived in the Mau for generations , will be allowed to remain .

Matt Taibbi ’s long polemic about Barack Obama ’s economic team in the current issue of Rolling Stone has attracted its share of both support and derision in the blogosphere over the past couple of days .
Big surprise , eh ?
Digby rounds up some of the reaction here .
Well , after reading the piece this afternoon you can basically count me among the supporters .
Is it over the top ?
Of course it is .
Are there some matters of interpretation that I think Taibbi gets a bit wrong ?
Sure .
For example : the conceit of the piece is that Obama chose to build his economic team around people who were acolytes of Bob Rubin , and this strikes me as misguided .
Basically , Obama chose to build his economic team around mainstream Democratic economists with previous government experience , and virtually all of these guys have ties to each other and therefore to Rubin .
That ’s every bit as bad — maybe worse , in fact — but it changes the problem from one of personal influence to one of systemic influence .
There ’s a real difference there .
What else ?
Taibbi spends a lot of time on Rubin pal Michael Froman , who led Obama ’s search for an economic team during the transition , and this leads him to say that Tim Geithner was “ hired to head the U.S. Treasury ” by Froman .
But that ’s kind of silly .
At the cabinet level , Obama did n’t need Froman ’s advice .
He chose Geithner all on his own .
Taibbi also commits one of my pet peeves , suggesting that the bailout may eventually cost taxpayers $ 23 trillion .
That ’s ridiculous .
He also fails to emphasize enough that virtually all of the bailout money was directed by the Fed and virtually all of it predates Obama ’s presidency .
But look : this is all just nitpicky bullshit .
Taibbi ’s piece is basically about how the finance industry owns Congress and the Obama administration , and that ’s basically true .
In fact , I have a piece coming out in a week or so in the print magazine that makes pretty much the same point .
My approach is different , and my language is all PG - rated , but my conclusions are pretty much the same .
The finance industry , through both standard lobbying and what Simon Johnson calls “ intellectual capture , ” has , over the decades since Reagan was elected , convinced nearly everyone that what ’s good for Wall Street is good for America , and that what ’s bad for Wall Street would be catastrophic for America .
Everything else follows from that .
So , sure , I think Taibbi overstates Rubin ’s influence and thereby understates the real systemic problem here , but hey — it ’s his article , not mine .
Generally speaking , he gets his facts right and he gets the big picture right : Obama ’s team is nearly as dedicated to the economic status quo as Republicans are .
Ditto for many — though not all — Democrats in Congress .
It ’s worth reading .
POSTSCRIPT : One more thing .
Here ’s the final paragraph of Taibbi ’s piece :
What ’s most troubling is that we do n’t know if Obama has changed , or if the influence of Wall Street is simply a fundamental and ineradicable element of our electoral system .
What we do know is that Barack Obama pulled a bait - and - switch on us .
If it were any other politician , we would n’t be surprised .
Maybe it ’s our fault , for thinking he was different .
I do n’t think Obama has changed , or that he pulled a bait - and - switch .
In fact , I ’d say his moderate , mainstream centrist approach to the economy was pretty clear during the campaign .
I vote instead for the influence of Wall Street being a “ fundamental and ineradicable element of our electoral system . ”

A group of Democratic legislators wants to give Goldman Sachs and General Electric veto power over financial reform legislation .
That may not be what members of the Congressional Black Caucus say they want .
But it seems to be the result of a power play described in The Times today by Eric Lipton .
Those legislators are unwilling to vote for a financial reform bill until a company owned by their backers , Inner City Broadcasting , persuades lenders including Goldman and GE Capital to renew a loan .
The article reports :
If caucus members vote against it , the legislation could fail , dealing a significant blow to the administration .
“ While we appreciate the need for the expansion of regulatory authority , we can no longer afford for our public policy to be defined by the world view of Wall Street , ” Maxine Waters , Democrat of California , said Wednesday , in explaining the decision by Black Caucus members to withhold their votes .
It seems to me that is exactly what she is doing .
If Goldman and G.E. want to block the bill , then all they need to do is refuse to make the loan .
Better yet , they could hold out for amendments to weaken it , which might be inserted without the public knowing why those changes were being made .
Representative Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Affairs Committee , says he has talked to unnamed companies about the need to finance Inner City , which seems to be over - leveraged .
Imagine the reaction if , perhaps during the 1998 Asian financial crisis , a group of Republican legislators had threatened to block legislation unless a contributor to their campaigns received special treatment .
Then imagine what would have happened if a powerful House committee chairman had called companies with a direct interest in legislation pending in his committee and asked them to help out that contributor .
Why is this any different ?
Check out this video , via Peter Daou , of one of the protesters outside the Obama town - hall meeting in New Hampshire :
Protester : [ Unintelligible ] illegals ... we send on the first bus one way back to wherever they came from .
We do n't need illegals .
Send 'em home on a bus , send 'em home with a bullet in the head the second time .
Nothing like a little eliminationism with your tea , is there ?
Then he adds :
Read what Jefferson said about the Tree of Liberty -- it ’s coming baby .
As Daou notes : Jefferson said " The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . "
Indeed , Tim McVeigh was arrested wearing a T - shirt with that very quotation .
Yep , just another " Patriot " fomenting civil war .
A fellow teabagger then proclaims that Obama is becoming " a dictator , " and warns that opposing him will lead to people being imprisoned .
Hoo boy .
These people speak volumes about what 's happening with these protests .
As we noted earlier .
UPDATE : Be sure also to check out the complementary video from the same YouTuber , of a ranting " Patriot " verbally assaulting ACORN volunteers , while his scary - looking militiaman buddy hovers nearby .

Jere Doyle , wealth strategist at Bank of New York Mellon , said the wealthy should not get their hopes up for an end to the estate tax .
He pointed out that an estate did not have to submit its first tax bill until nine months after a person ’s death .
The Senate could wait , then , until the summer to decide on the estate tax and make it retroactive to the beginning of the year .
This would wreak havoc on estate planning .
Even if the Senate acted early in the coming year , it could still lead to a flurry of legal challenges on the constitutionality of reinstating a tax that had disappeared .
But there is a broader issue for moderately wealthy people .
When a person dies now , the value of his or her assets gets a “ step - up in basis , ” which means for tax purposes the assets are valued on the day of death .
Without an estate tax , this provision disappears , and the appreciated value is subject to capital gains tax .
The Internal Revenue Service will grant a $ 1.3 million “ artificial basis ” on assets of a single person and $ 3 million for couples if the estate tax disappears .
But on the rest of the assets , the heirs will have to determine what the original cost was and pay the capital gains on the appreciated amount .
For long - held stock that has split many times , this could be extremely difficult .
“ If there is no estate tax in 2010 , we have an income tax problem for a larger group of the population , ” Mr. Kesten said .
He estimated that the number of people affected would go from 6,000 to 60,000 .
Image Jere Doyle , wealth strategist at Bank of New York Mellon , said the wealthy should not get their hopes up for an end to the estate tax .
Credit ... Jodi Hilton for The New York Times
Still , most advisers and accountants expect that an estate tax will be reinstated , and this has pushed the wealthiest to find new ways to reduce its impact .
“ If we ’re resigned to an estate tax existing , it ’s not a call on where rates will go but an acknowledgment we wo n’t have a repeal , ” said Janine Racanelli , managing director and head of the Advice Lab at J. P. Morgan Private Bank .
One way is through giving money to heirs above the $ 1 million lifetime exemption level and paying the 45 percent gift tax now .
This may seem odd at first , since the estate tax is currently the same rate .
But the benefit comes from how the taxes are applied : the gift tax is added like sales tax , while the estate tax is deducted like income tax .
Mr. Kesten noted that a person with a $ 30 million estate could give roughly $ 20 million to his heirs during his lifetime and pay $ 10 million in gift taxes , or he could leave the $ 30 million to them and they would receive $ 15 million , after estate taxes .
President Barack Obama issued an order Feb. 17 , 2009 , to send two additional brigades to Afghanistan .
" This increase is necessary to stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan , which has not received the strategic attention , direction and resources it urgently requires , " Obama said .
He also recognized " the extraordinary strain that this deployment places on our troops and military families .
I honor their service , and will give them the support they need . "
Obama often said during the campaign that Afghanistan required more troops and attention than it was receiving from the Bush administration .
( Read our previous campaign coverage . )
Obama said the United States " had taken our eye off the ball " by invading Iraq instead of concentrating on Afghanistan .
" Our troops have fought valiantly there , but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need — and deserve , " Obama said in a speech on Aug. 1 , 2007 .
" As a result , parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban , and a mix of terrorism , drugs and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country .
As president , I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to reinforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATO 's efforts against the Taliban . "
In his Feb. 17 action , Obama said he would deploy a Marine Expeditionary Brigade during the spring of 2009 and an Army Stryker Brigade with support troops by the summer .
That 's two , just as he said he would .
Promise Kept .
Finally , we want to note that our ruling here only covers Obama 's pledge to send two brigades .
We 'll use Promise No. 148 to rate whether he equips them properly .
Opinions Nov 3 , 2009 A Common Nomenclature for Lego Families
Thousands of different Lego exist , yet when your seven - year - old asks for “ a clippy bit , ” you know exactly what to hand him .
A breakdown of the atoms of a Lego universe .
A selection of various Lego bricks
Catch us on a rainy weekend afternoon , and you ’ll probably find my son and me busy spreading Lego over the living room floor .
It ’s easier to see it that way .
Typically , we will build spaceships .
I ’ll commence work on a solid chassis on which to hang all the fancy bits — the wings , superfluous for space flight but essential for seven - year - olds — and the greebles that make everything look , you know , more spaceship -y .
My son will cast around for people - bits , with which to fabricate a spaceship pilot and perhaps a co-pilot .
They will all need light sabers , of course .
And control panels that move .
So each of us has a clear idea of which pieces we ’re after , and two enormous plastic crates full of Lego from which to extract them .
It ’s a scene that is replayed by kids and parents everywhere .
And it ’s the starting point for a unique quirk of language : Lego nomenclature .
Every family , it seems , has its own set of words for describing particular Lego pieces .
No one uses the official names .
“ Dad , please could you pass me that Brick 2x2 ? ” No .
In our house , it ’ll always be : “ Dad , please could you pass me that four - er ? ”
And I ’ll pass it , because I know exactly which piece he means .
Lego nomenclature is essential for family Lego building .
“ Dad , I ’m building a roof for the medical pod , but I need a hinge -y bit to make it open up .
You know , one of those four - er flat hinge -y bits . ”
Raimi often builds spaceships but has never referred to the pieces by name , until prompted by his father — at which point he reveals that he possesses names for all of them in his head .
Yes I do know .
I ’ll keep my eye out for one , I say .
And do you want this flat groovy piece to go on the top there , behind your lasers ?
“ Oh , thanks Dad . ”
Then , when another seven - year - old came round for tea after school one day , I overheard the two of them , busy in the spaceship construction yard that used to be our living room , get into a linguistic thicket .
“ Can you see any clippy bits ? ” my son asked his friend .
The friend was flummoxed .
“ Do you mean handy bits ? ” he asked , pointing .
“ Yes , ” replied my boy .
“ Clippy bits . ”
Of course !
This language of Lego is n’t just something our family has invented ; every Lego - building family must have its own vocabulary .
And the words they use ( mostly invented by the children , not the adults ) are likely to be different every time .
But how different ?
And what sort of words ?
Hence , a survey .
I asked fellow parents to donate their children for a few minutes , and name a selection of Lego pieces culled from the Lego parts store .
Our small , international cast ( half Brits , half Americans ) is made up of four children .
First , my seven - year - old son Barney , who surveyed the list as if it was another piece of homework .
His friend , Jem , also seven , went through the list and then wanted to do it again .
Five - and - a - half - year - old Max did n’t hesitate to name every piece .
Six - year - old Raimi often builds spaceships , but has never referred to the pieces by name , until prompted by his father — at which point he revealed that he possessed names for all of them in his head .
So that ’s how we discovered that a “ cylinder one - er ” can also be known as “ Coke bottles ” or a “ golden wiper . ”
Or that an “ upper ” is also a “ bow ” or a “ cannon , ” or a “ four - studded upward slope . ”
And that a “ light saber ” is a “ light saber ” no matter where you live or how much Lego you have .
And most of the time it , it all works fine .
Within families , the communication is clear , and a clippy bit is most clearly a clippy bit .
Even if there are three different kinds of clippy bit in one model , we ’ll know exactly which one we ’re all talking about at the time .
Lego , like language , benefits from context .
A Common Nomenclature for Lego Families
After discussing my last post with a friend and talking about a few other issues , we came to the conclusion that it would be worthwhile to discuss more gotchas .
First though , what is a gotcha ?
Wikipedia gives a good definition :
In programming , a gotcha is a feature of a system , a program or a programming language that works in the way it is documented but is counter - intuitive and almost invites mistakes because it is both enticingly easy to invoke and completely unexpected and / or unreasonable in its outcome .
So let ’s start with “ __del__ is not the opposite of __init__ ” .
If you come from c++ or a similar background , you are probably well versed in object oriented concepts , specifically , constructors and destructors .
The usual expectation is to have the destructor called only for fully constructed objects – i.e. , objects whose constructor returned without raising an exception .
If the constructor raises an exception , it is expected to “ clean up after itself ” , and not expect the destructor to run .
Since in Python __init__ is the de-facto constructor , and __del__ is considered the destructor , most people expect this line of reasoning to work with __init__ and __del__ .
This is mistaken .
__del__ is not the opposite of __init__ , but rather of __new__ .
Which means that if __init__ raises an exception , then __del__ will still be called .
I ’ve run into this issue myself several times in the past .
Consider the following sample code :
class A ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , x ) : if x == 0 : raise Exception ( ) self .
x = x def __del__ ( self ) : print self .
x class A ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , x ) : if x == 0 : raise Exception ( ) self .x = x def __del__ ( self ) : print self .x
This code demonstrates a common case : a constructor that might fail , and a destructor that does something with the instance ’s members .
If you try to instantiate A with x = 0 , you ’ll get an exception .
This is to be expected .
However , what is less expected is when the partially constructed A is garbage - collected ( which may be anytime later , and not necessarily right away ) :
Exception exceptions .
AttributeError : " ' A ' object has no attribute ' x ' " in < bound method A. __del__ of < __main__ .
A object at 0x02449570 >> ignored Exception exceptions .
AttributeError : " ' A ' object has no attribute ' x ' " in < bound method A.__del__ of < __main__ .
A object at 0x02449570 >> ignored
What happened is that __del__ was called even though __init__ raised an exception .
When __del__ tried to access self .x it got an attribute error , because it has n’t been defined yet .
The solution ?
1 . Do n’t use __del__ unless you really have to .
I ’m going to write a more about it soon .
2 . If you do use __del__ make sure you are covered for any case in which __init__ did n’t finish running .
Wallace Souza lost his parliamentary immunity when he was expelled
A Brazilian TV presenter accused of ordering killings to boost his programme 's ratings has turned himself in to police after going on the run .
Authorities had been looking for Wallace Souza since he disappeared when an arrest warrant was issued .
Mr Souza , also a former local politician , is accused of murder and drug trafficking offences .
He denies the allegations .
He enjoyed legislative immunity until stripped of a political post last week .
" Souza turned himself in to the police this morning , " a police spokesman in the Amazonas state capital , Manaus , told AFP news agency .
' Removing rivals '
Mr Souza has insisted that the accusations were an attempt by rivals to smear him and that there was no evidence to back them .
Authorities in the Amazonas region claim he ordered several killings in order to get rid of his rivals , while afterwards TV crews from his programme would mysteriously arrive at the crime scenes before the police , enabling them to secure graphic footage .
Police are reported to have become suspicious about Mr Souza 's programme last year , when a report showed the body of a suspected drug dealer burning in the woods long before police arrived .
One of the arrest warrants described Mr Souza - a police officer whose career ended in disgrace - as the " mentor " of a gang that killed rival drug traffickers .
He is accused of being part of a criminal grouping which includes 40 members who face charges of murder .
Authorities say the former TV star 's alleged crimes removed potential drug - trafficking rivals and also increased audience figures for his " Canal Livre " programme .
( CNN ) -- President Obama -- fighting wars in two countries -- will arrive in Norway on Thursday to accept the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 .
The president will spend 26 hours in Oslo meeting the royal family , accepting the Nobel at an afternoon ceremony and attending an award banquet that evening .
At the ceremony , Obama will accept a $ 1.4 million prize check , a gold medal and a diploma .
He also will speak at the ceremony , which will be streamed live on CNN.com starting at 7 a.m. ET .
He will touch on the war in Afghanistan , for which he last week announced a surge of 30,000 U.S. troops , said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs .
Obama 's day will begin with a trip to the Nobel Institute , where he will meet for the first time the five - member panel that unanimously picked him for the prize , said Mette Owre of the Norwegian Foreign Affairs Ministry .
The president and first lady Michelle Obama will then meet with Norway 's King Harald V and Queen Sonja before heading to the award ceremony .
" Then he goes to the hotel where he is staying .
He will have some downtime .
He is governing America at the time , " Owre said .
In the evening , the president will be the guest of honor at a banquet where the king and queen and the Norwegian prime minister will be among 250 attendees , Owre said .
Obama 's Nobel Prize win , announced in October , elicited swift reaction -- some hailing the choice ; others asking what he had accomplished to deserve it .
Nominations for the prize had to be postmarked by February 1 , only 12 days after Obama took office .
The committee sent out its solicitation for nominations last September , two months before Obama was elected president .
The Nobel committee said it recognized his efforts at dialogue to solve complex global problems , including working toward a world free of nuclear weapons .
" Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world 's attention and given its people hope for a better future , " the committee said .
The president said he saw the decision less as a recognition of his accomplishments and more as " a call to action . "
Some analysts have speculated that the prize could give Obama additional clout as he forms a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan and attempts to engage Iran and North Korea .
The domestic political consequences are unclear .
Obama 's supporters hope the prestige associated with the prize will strengthen the president 's hand in the health care reform debate .
Obama , the first African - American to win the White House , is the fourth U.S. president to win the prestigious prize and the third sitting president to do so .
The ceremony honoring the winners in the other Nobel Prize categories also will be held Thursday , but in Stockholm , Sweden .
Those winners were picked by a committee separate from the one that determines the Peace Prize winner .
December 10 is the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel , the inventor of dynamite and founder of the prizes .
CNN 's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report .
A Victoria Police sergeant sacked for issuing speeding drivers with smaller fines than the law required had been maintaining the practice for the last 10 years , Deputy Commissioner Ken Lay said .
The northern suburbs sergeant , who was dismissed this week , is accused of reducing the penalty for drivers by increasing a zone 's speed limit on a ticket .
If a motorist was caught driving 80 km / h in a 60 km / h speed zone , the sergeant allegedly falsely increased the speed limit to 70 km / h so the driver would be fined less and receive one instead of three demerit points .
Deputy Commissioner
Lay said in a statement this afternoon the officer had recorded incorrect details on at least 250 tickets in the past year and had admitted continuing the practice for the last 10 years .
He said the sacking was the result of a " long and thorough " investigation .

Behind - the - scenes lobbying , coupled with a grassroots mobilization of Catholic churches across the country , led the House Saturday to pass an amendment to its health - care bill barring anyone who receives a new tax credit from enrolling in a plan that covers abortion , a once - unthinkable event in Democrat - dominated Washington .
The restriction would still have to be accepted by the Senate , where it will likely face a tough fight .
The issue could sink the larger health legislation if the chambers fail to reach agreement , or if any consensus language leads supporters to defect .
The House vote , and the central role played by one of the country 's biggest religious denominations , stunned abortion - rights groups that had worked hard to elect Mr. Obama and expand Democratic congressional majorities .
Activists on the left had thought social issues would take a back seat to economic concerns .
The bishops ' success served as a reminder that Democrats ' strategy over the past two election cycles of recruiting more conservative candidates to run in competitive House and Senate seats can have unwelcome policy consequences for liberals among the party 's base .
About 40 House Democrats are opposed to abortion rights .
The bishops have a history of political activism .
In the 2004 presidential race , some bishops said they would refuse to grant communion to Democratic nominee John Kerry , a Catholic who favored abortion rights .
In 2005 , the bishops ' conference backed efforts by then - President George W. Bush and Republican lawmakers to intervene in the Terri Schiavo right - to - die case .
But rarely has the church entered the fray with such decisive force .
" The Catholic bishops came in at the last minute and drew a line in the sand , " said Laurie Rubiner , vice president for public policy at the abortion - rights advocacy group Planned Parenthood .
" It 's very hard to compete with that . "
The deposition was in its fifth grueling hour .
The lawyer and the witness had dueled over the meaning of common words , about whether an executive “ supervises ” or “ administers , ” about the difference between a lie and a failure to tell the truth .
Then the lawyer sprang his big question :
You could have prevented someone from hurting people and you decided not to .
Why ?
The witness was Edward M. Egan , then the Roman Catholic bishop of Bridgeport , Conn .
The question was about a priest who had been accused of sexually molesting children .
“ I did n’t make a decision one way or the other , ” said Bishop Egan , whom the lawyer suggested had failed to act quickly against the cleric .
“ I kept working on it until I resolved the decision . ”
The exchange is one of hundreds recorded in a vast trove of documents the Diocese of Bridgeport made public on Tuesday after battling in court for seven years to keep them sealed .
The archive — more than 12,000 pages of memos , church records and testimony — was gathered for 23 lawsuits , alleging sexual abuse of children by seven priests , that the diocese settled in 2002 .
At the heart of it lies the bishop ’s testimony , in two wide - ranging depositions from 1997 and 1999 .
Punctuated by legal parsing and frequent exasperation on both sides , transcripts of the videotaped sessions show the man who would become one of the church ’s most prominent American leaders — the archbishop of New York , and a cardinal — as he navigated a budding scandal that still threatens the church ’s finances and reputation .
Since 2002 , when he moved to New York and nationwide attention focused on the church hierarchy ’s handling of abuse complaints , Cardinal Egan has faced troubling accusations about his tenure in Bridgeport : that he allowed priests facing multiple sex abuse allegations to continue working ; that he did not refer complaints to criminal authorities ; and that he showed little interest in meeting with accusers .
[ snip ]
He sparred at one point over the difference between the supervisory and administrative duties ; and at another point acknowledged that “ media attention ” to allegations of sexual abuse by priests had already become a serious problem for the church by 1988 , when he arrived in Bridgeport , prompting him to take action .
Soon after settling in , he said , he codified — in written form — the diocese ’s “ excellent policies ” for handling sexual abuse complaints , which under previous bishops had been passed along by word of mouth .
Even then , Bishop Egan played down the importance of the action he had taken to stem a problem which , to him , was not a widespread one .
At one point , when the deposition resumed in 1999 , he stopped in his description of church policies to challenge the notion that any abuse had actually occurred .
“ Incidentally , ” he said , “ these things do n’t happen , and we are talking about ifs . ”
“ Forgive me , Father — Bishop , ” replied one lawyer , Cindy Robinson .
“ But these things do happen because that ’s the reason why we ’re seated here today . ”
She had been asking about two priests with long records of abuse allegations , whom Bishop Egan had sought to remove from the priesthood , though both continued working .
“ These things happen in such small numbers , ” the bishop said .
Bishop Egan was at his most combative when voicing his belief in the innocence of most accused priests , including one , the Rev. Raymond Pcolka , who was accused by 12 former parishioners of abuses involving oral and anal sex and beatings .
We recently saw just how much influence the Catholic Church has over the creation of legislation in this country when the Stupak Amendment remained in the House health care legislation :
WHY is it hard to compete with that ?
A bunch of guys dress up in robes and funny hats and decide that they are God 's emissaries and we 're all supposed to accept them as holy men ?
Yes , if you are Roman Catholic , the bishops are important .
But why , in a country in which nonestablishment of religion is codified in the very documents on which it was founded , do Catholic bishops have this kind of influence ?
And they get a tax deduction on top of it , this church whose empire is headquartered in one of the wealthiest city - states in the world .
Just yesterday , the Catholic Church lobby helped defeat gay marriage legislation in New York .
And a few weeks ago , the Washington DC archdiocese threatened to stop providing services to the poor if the city passed a law permitting gay marriage .
That the Catholic Church has any more credibility than any other lobby just because its hierarchy paints itself as being of God is preposterous in a diverse nation like ours .
And that we buy into this business about Godliness from an organization with a history of protecting child molesters is even worse .
Yesterday the Cardinal of the New York Diocese , Edward Egan , gave a deposition in a case that occurred when he was the Bishop of Bridgeport , Connecticut Nice , is n't it ?
And yet the organization that protects priests like this wants to have control over women 's reproductive systems and whether same - sex people who love each other can be married .
What kind of happy horseshit is this , anyway ?
And in case William Donohue is having the vapors over this , let me be clear : I have no beef with people who practice Roman Catholicism as a religion .
If the theology of this faith speaks to you , more power to you .
There are aspects to Catholicism that I applaud , such as the ritual of confession , which to my mind is a far preferable framework for developing a moral code than the clean - slate " All you have to do is believe that Jesus died for you and you can do whatever you want " theology that seems to drive much of the Republican Party .
I know Catholics of deep and abiding faith who DO help those less fortunate , and who DO turn to their religion for comfort and for whom this faith speaks to them .
Whatever gets you through this often hideous level of reality , I say .
But to defend the church hierarchy as somehow morally superior and worthy of a strong role in policymaking just does n't hold water , given its record .
Forget about the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition , we 're only talking about what these men ( and yes , it 's all men ) have done IN OUR LIFETIMES .
I am not intolerant of religion , but I am intolerant of corruption and hypocrisy , ESPECIALLY that which is occurs while preaching moral superiority .
And when this church 's hierarchy starts getting involved in policy , and has a role disprportionate to what it should in a nonetablishment government , and is characterized by a hypocrisy and corruption of this magnitude , it 's time we stopped letting it beat our legislators into submission .

The T - Storm Coalition for Gender Justice organized a forum Nov. 23 to discuss the new door policy at Hunters Nightclub in Elk Grove Village that supposedly targets transgender individuals .
Prominent figures and concerned citizens in both the Chicago trans and greater LGBT community gathered at the Center on Halsted , 3656 N. Halsted , for the discussion , which was moderated by openly gay state Rep. Greg Harris , D - Chicago .
Among the topics addressed were the reasons for the change in policy and which laws , if any , defend it .
Hunters ' management was invited to the forum but were not present .
Instead , they provided a written statement that was read aloud at the meeting .
Part of the statement , as follows , addresses the legal aspect of the policy .
" Without our true and steadfast dedication to the laws that govern our industry there would be no place in the northwest suburbs for the LBGTQ community to assemble and enjoy a safe environment , " the statement read .
" If these laws seem discriminatory , it is not our intention .
These laws are in place to stop underage drinking and every retail liquor establishment must follow these laws , not just Hunters .
This is NOT Hunters Nightclubs Elk Grove 's policy , it is the law . "
Management from local LGBT nightspots Big Chicks and Roscoe 's were present at the meeting and addressed this particular point .
" Our concern is , ' Are you over 21 ? ' " said Michelle Fire , owner of Big Chicks .
" That 's the real key .
Not what you dress like , not what you look like , not what gender you appear to be .
[ Trans ID ] has n't been an issue .
In the history of the business everybody has always looked different .
It 's not like there 's a cookie - cutter version of any of us , so I think this issue is kind of strange to come up at this point . "
In a previous Windy City Times story about the Hunters ' ID controversy , manager Peter Landorf said the law is that the look must match the ID , which is an obvious obstacle for any patron who goes out in a look that is not permanent .
Landorf also said that issues with sexual solicitation on the Web site Craigslist involving Hunters and indecent exposure prompted the tightening of the policy .
Members of T - Storm and their advisor Rick Garcia , political policy director of Equality Illinoisas well as Harris were not aware of any law or legal precedent that upholds Hunters right to turn down anyone whose look is not identical to their ID photo .
The Human Rights
Act , however , is inclusive of the transgender population , stating one cannot take into consideration a person 's sexual orientation or gender identity in housing , employment and public accommodations .
" [ Equality Illinois is ] very concerned that everyone be treated fairly and equitably in the great state of Illinois , nothing more or nothing less , " Garcia said .
" You can't have a different set of rules for different groups of people .
We 're committed also to helping business and public accommodations understand what they can and cannot do under the law . "
Discussion leaders also felt prostitution was a separate issue that Hunters is responsible for policing within their establishment .
The pressing concern , they said , is that the policy appears to be applied arbitrarily .
On Oct. 23 , members of T - Storm and others totaling 40 people attempted to enter Hunters in drag .
According to Kate Sosin and other T - Storm organizers , many were let in with looks that did n't match their IDs , although two were turned away in the initial group and a few who tried to get in later in the night reported much later that they had also been denied entry .
One member who was turned away was Aidan Tharp , a 22 - year - old grad student who went to Hunters in a dress , a brunette wig , some make - up and a female ID .
Tharp says he then changed out of his drag clothes and approached the same doorman who turned him away earlier and at that point was allowed in the club .
" If this is supposed to be a law or standard , it 's not being applied consistently , " said T - Storm organizer Christina Kahrl .
Many voiced concern over the arbitrary timing of the policy as well .
Hunters has existed for 27 years and has served the trans community for much of that time .
" This has been a safe place for us to gather for many , many of those [ 27 ] years , " said Helena Bushong , T - Storm organizer and transgender health advocate .
" Why now ?
Why now is this policy being instituted , and I might add again , inconsistently ?
Why is it after 25 years of participating in their business and being a safe place for gender variant people they can't come to us , even today they can't come to us , and talk to us ? "
" Hunters Nightclub is one of our bars , and we 're invested in it , in keeping it a safe place , " Sosin said .
T - Storm and other organizations including the Gay Liberation Network , Join the Impact - Chicago , The Bilerico Project , Genderqueer Chicago and the Straight and Gay Alliance Ministry endorse a boycott of Hunters until the club makes a concerted effort to work toward a change in the policy or the way it is currently implemented .
Chicago Gender Society ( CGS ) President Jackie Perry was also at the forum .
Hunters has sponsored the CGS float at Chicago 's annual pride parade in the past as well as solicited through the organization 's newsletter .
Perry said she was stunned and disturbed by news of this policy and , consequently , CGS has stopped accepting money and withdrawn all advertising for the nightclub .
T - Storm , Garcia and Harris all encouraged anyone who has felt discriminated against by Hunters to file a complaint with either or both the Illinois and Cook County departments of Human Rights .
The meeting ended with Sosin calling for solidarity on the issue and an end to the notion of the " T " in LGBT being silent .
Organizers also stressed the importance of reaching out to the " L , " " G " and " B " for support if any change is to occur .
THE OFFICE OF THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ….
From time to time , we ’re reminded of the fact that members of Congress — many of whom are fighting to kill health care reform — give themselves pretty good coverage .
Several weeks ago , the LA Times reported on the taxpayer - subsidized insurance federal lawmakers currently enjoy .
The piece noted that , while most Americans have to go with whatever their employer offers , members have a choice of 10 plans that offer access to a national network of doctors .
“ Lawmakers also get special treatment at Washington ’s federal medical facilities and , for a few hundred dollars a month , access to their own pharmacy and doctors , nurses and medical technicians standing by in an office conveniently located between the House and Senate chambers , ” the article added .
ABC News explores this conveniently located facility in more detail today .
It sounds like a pretty sweet deal for lawmakers .
This fall while members of Congress toil in the U.S. Capitol , working to decide how or even whether to reform the country ’s health care system , one floor below them an elaborate Navy medical clinic — described by those who have seen it as something akin to a modern community hospital — will be standing by , on - call and ready to provide Congress with some of the country ’s best and most efficient government - run health care .
Formally called the Office of the Attending Physician , the clinic — and at least six satellite offices — bills its mission as one of emergency preparedness and public health .
Each day , it stands ready to handle medical emergencies , biological attacks and the occasional fainting tourist visiting Capitol Hill .
Officially , the office acknowledges these types of services , including providing physicals to Capitol police officers and offering flu shots to congressional staffers .
But what is rarely discussed outside the halls of Congress is the office ’s other role — providing a wealth of primary care medical services to senators , representatives and Supreme Court justices .
Through interviews with former employees and members of Congress , as well as extensive document searches , ABC News has learned new details about the services offered by the Office of Attending Physician to members of Congress over the past few years , from regular visits by a consulting chiropractor to on - site physical therapy .
“ A member walked in and was generally walked right back into a physician ’s office .
They get good care .
They are not rushed .
They are examined thoroughly , ” said Eduardo Balbona , an internist in Jacksonville , Fa. , who worked as a staff physician in the OAP from 1993 to 1995 .
The Office of the Attending Physician includes at least four Navy doctors as well as at least a dozen medical and X - ray technicians , nurses , and a pharmacist .
When a specialist is brought in , members pay no additional costs .
Indeed , lawmakers receive top - notch , wait - free care , and money is largely no object .
Members pay a flat annual fee of $ 503 , and it covers all expenses — without submitting claim forms to their insurer .
Despite soaring costs throughout the health care system , prices have been largely stagnant in the Office of the Attending Physician for 17 years .
Some lawmakers did n’t pay the fee and still took advantage of OAP services .
Keep this in mind the next time you hear a member of Congress complaining about the nightmares of government - run , taxpayer - subsidized health care .
Neocons like Reihan Salam are worried that Republicans will soon " begin to abandon the president en masse over Afghanistan . "
As well they might be : Salam , a self - described advocate of " a Pax Americana foreign policy , " and a fellow at the New America Foundation – a corporate - funded let ’s - promote - " new " - but - safely - conventional - ideas , formerly headed up by James Fallows – knows his enemies , and is preparing to meet them , albeit not head on .
Before the battle is joined , however , he wants to define the enemy – in his own terms , of course .
There are plenty of antiwar conservatives to cite , including politicians : the primary example being Rep.
Ron Paul , whose presidential campaign mounted an amazingly successful challenge to the GOP Establishment – and , as a result , earned the undying enmity of the neocons .
There are others : John Duncan , Republican of Tennessee , Rep. Walter B. " Freedom Fries " Jones ( R - North Carolina ) – whose stunning turnaround on the war provoked a neocon hissy - fit and an electoral challenge , both of which he survived – but Senor Salam chose Jason Chaffetz , a freshman Republican from Utah , perhaps because he ’s the newest addition to a growing group .
But also , perhaps , because it ’s easier to characterize his " antiwar " views in a certain , limiting way .
" Among grassroots conservatives , " Salam avers , " there is a growing sense that the U.S. military is too hamstrung by concern about civilian casualties and political correctness to wage an effective military campaign under Obama , which implies that there is little point in offering him political support . "
According to Salam , Chaffetz " makes this point explicitly , " but this is not at all clear .
Here is what Chaffetz actually says :
" We must redefine the Rules of Engagement : A politically correct war is a lost war .
If we are going to sacrifice lives and resources in this fight , we must go in with everything we have .
We must be committed to win .
But then we must go home .
Anything short of an all - out commitment to accomplish the mission puts too many American lives at risk . "
Rather than saying that the strategy we ’re pursuing is n’t bloodthirsty enough – a typically neoconnish criticism – Chaffetz appears to be advocating a Colin Powell - esque approach : go in with overwhelming force , or else do n’t bother .
The reference to political correctness may be a thrust at the new counterinsurgency doctrine recently adopted by the Petraeus - CNAS clique within the administration , the centerpiece of which is the goal of " protecting " the Afghan population from … itself .
Go figure .
The Mao-quoting Anita Dunn is n’t the only admirer of the Great Helmsman in a position of influence in this administration : the top military strategists and advisors , centered around COIN theorist John Nagl , are committed to a strategic vision inspired by the Maoist concept of " people ’s war , " based on the concept of " clear , hold , and build " – that is , the old Maoist ( or , really , Guevarist ) concept of seizing a hamlet , village , or whatever , carving out a revolutionary " base camp , " and building parallel structure of administrative authority and local services – e.g. Hezbollah in Lebanon ( or the Chinese Communist forces in the struggle against the Nationalists . )
Che Guevara famously attempted the same stunt in the jungles of Bolivia , and wound up a dead man .
In any case , this strategy of conducting a " people ’s war " means our troops will be living close to the people we are pledged to protect : force protection is to be sacrificed in the name of securing and consolidating control over " liberated " spaces .
Which means we ’ll be taking a lot of casualties – and for what ?
That ’s what Chaffetz , and a growing number of Americans want to know .
Salam elides the primary point made in the Chaffetz statement , and that is his first bullet point :
" First , we must define the mission : Our military is not a defensive force for rough neighborhoods around the world .
They are trained to be an offensive , mission - driven military force to protect the United States of America .
They are not trained to be nation builders or policemen .
They are trained to be an aggressive machine that destroys and eliminates the enemy .
Give them a mission and then get out of the way .
They will accomplish the mission swiftly with outstanding results . "
This is n’t about how we should accomplish the mission , but instead focuses on a more fundamental question : what , exactly , is the mission in the first place ?
If our war aims are to eliminate al - Qaeda , and possibly capture or kill the top leadership , that ’s one thing .
Fighting a protracted " people ’s war " is quite another .
Given the choice between withdrawal and an extended – and much wider – commitment , Chaffetz is choosing the former .
As he puts it :
" Mr. President , it is time to bring our troops home .
If our mission in Afghanistan is simply to protect the populace and build the nation , then I believe the time has come to bring our troops home .
" We have successfully rooted out Al - Qaeda from Afghanistan .
Fewer than 100 Al - Qaeda operatives are operating in Afghanistan according to Retired General James L. Jones ’ assessment of the situation .
‘ I do n’t foresee the return of the Taliban , ’ he said in an October 4 Associated Press report .
Jones , who is President Obama ’s National Security Advisor , continued : ‘ Afghanistan is not in imminent danger of falling .
The al Qaeda presence is very diminished .
The maximum estimate is less than 100 operating in the country , no bases , no ability to launch attacks on either us or our allies . ’
" Mr. President , we all recognize that we will still have to fight Al - Qaeda around the globe .
So let ’s bring home the tens of thousands who have fought so valiantly to protect America .
Let ’s instead use the best human and electronic surveillance available to allow our special forces to target and kill those who actually threaten us . "
Chaffetz , in short , takes a position elaborated on by such critics of the war as Michael Scheuer , author of Imperial Hubris , and the former head of the bin Laden unit at the CIA – and by yours truly .
My immediate response to the 9/11 attacks in this space , you ’ll recall , was " Kill ’em – and get out . "
This is precisely Chaffetz ’s position .
This minimalist approach is no less deadly : the difference is that it is focused , realistic , and saves lives , both American and Afghan .
The idea is to treat the enemy as exactly what it is : not a nation - state , but a criminal conspiracy .
Along these lines , Chaffetz cites the view of retired Marine Gen. Chuck Krulak [ .pdf ] , who " has suggested ‘ Hunter - Killer Teams ’ with resources and rules of engagement that allow them to root out the enemy and suppress any Al - Qaeda entrenchment .
I concur with the retired General .
If the mission is to root out Al - Qaeda , we do not need to risk the lives of tens of thousands of troops to fulfill it . "
Amen to that .
Ron Paul has said very much the same thing , on occasion , although his critique of the war , and the system that makes it possible , is much more comprehensive .
Curiously , the words " Ron Paul " do not appear in Salam ’s piece .
True , Paul is not approved by the Washington cognoscenti , and the neocons in particular are none too eager to lend him any more recognition than he ’s already gotten , and yet this is still a curious omission in an article purportedly about the antiwar Right .
It ’s not as if Paul and his movement are invisible , or of no consequence , especially in Utah .
At the Utah GOP convention held in the summer of 2007 , Paul came in second in the polling , behind Mitt Romney , and third in the primary .
Utah has always been a libertarian stronghold , and the Paul organization , the Campaign for Liberty , is quite visible in the state , supplemented and energized as it is by a campus - based group , Young Americans for Liberty , which has two active chapters : together , these two groups have thousands of members and sympathizers in Utah .
The long term strategy employed by the Paulistas , with their explicitly " entrist " tactic , is to create a grassroots movement dedicated to , among other things , an explicitly anti-interventionist foreign policy , and they are finding a fertile field in precisely those sorts of voters who put Chaffetz in Congress and will keep him there next time around .
Chaffetz represents a growing trend , one that is in transition – but to what ?
While the leadership of the Republican party is passing resolutions [ . pdf ] requiring all candidates to support an interventionist foreign policy – question : will they be cutting off funding for Chaffetz ’s reelection bid ?
– a look at the recent Pew poll results underscores the stupidity of such a policy .
Forty - nine percent of Americans say the U.S. should start minding its own business – a trend the Pew pollsters label " isolationist " – and they are n’t all Democrats , not by a long shot .
As Pew reports :
" Isolationist views have typically been more prevalent among Democrats than among Republicans , and that remains the case today .
But the rise in isolationism is evident across partisan lines : overall , 49 % say the United States should mind its own business internationally , up from 30 % in 2002 .
Currently , 53 % of Democrats express this view , up from 40 % in 2002 .
Among Republicans , 43 % agree the U.S. should mind its own business , up from 22 % in 2002 .
Roughly half of independents ( 49 % ) offer this opinion , compared with 27 % in 2002 . "
This bloggingheads exchange between Chris Hayes of The Nation and Matt Welch of Reason magazine has an interesting section about the political space – so far uninhabited , except by the Paul grouping – available for antiwar conservative - libertarian candidates to appropriate , either within the GOP or without .
The " tea party " crowd may not be calling for the US to get out of Afghanistan , and they may disdain the idea that they ’d ever be up there with Code Pink calling for withdrawal – but when they realize that Code Pink and the other " progressive " pro-Obama groups are n’t calling for withdrawal , and conservative leaders like Chaffetz ( and George Will ) are , those archetypal " little old ladies in tennis shoes " may take up where the counter - cultural Code Pinkos left off .
The reaction to Chaffetz ’s commentary has been disappointing .
Among those one would think would be trying to encourage him , such as The American Conservative ‘s foreign policy blogger - in - residence Daniel Larison , the response had been oddly hostile : Chaffetz , it seems , comes to the right conclusion , but for the wrong reason .
And he does n’t really come to the right conclusion , at least by Larison ’s standards , as it turns out : Larison accuses him of wanting to turn Afghanistan into a " shooting gallery . "
This is nonsensical – Chaffetz is in favor of precisely the sort of limited police action Larison himself comes out for in the same post .
Weirdly , Larison writes : " As anyone can see , I am defending the proposed war plan against Chaffetz ’s insipid criticisms , and I will be defending the war plan in my next column . "
So Chaffetz wants out , Larison is " defending the war plan " – which is to stay in for the next three to five years , and mount a full - fledged counterinsurgency campaign – and Chaffetz is " pro-war and wrong " ?
Maybe it ’s all that incense , but Larison needs to go outside , and take a deep breath of fresh air : maybe that will clear his head .
Salam , taking his cues from Walter Russell Mead – one of the founders of the New America Foundation , by the way – characterizes Chaffetz as a " Jacksonian , " i.e. when it comes to war , the Jacksonian prefers to strike out at the enemy with full force , or else refrain from doing battle .
Yet this overemphasizes one aspect of Chaffetz ’s position , and minimizes where it diverges from the Bushian - neocon position in a major way .
The Bush - neocon position insists that the " war on terrorism " is more akin to World War II than to a conflict which can be handled by Gen.
Krulak ’s " hunter - killer teams . "
True , Chaffetz does warn against the alleged danger from Iran , but when it gets right down to it would he be willing to go to war with the Iranians ?
Somehow I doubt it , especially when he goes on to say that massive debt is the " greatest danger " facing our nation .
" Jacksonian " or not , I doubt Rep. Chaffetz would be happy with $ 200 a barrel oil prices and the subsequent spike at the pump .
Unlike Larison , I am willing to give advocates of withdrawal such as Chaffetz the benefit of a doubt , for two reasons .
One , it is clear that a great many conservative Republicans are undergoing a transition : faced with the consequences of eight years of dangerous and debilitating militarism , some are beginning to question the basic premises of interventionism , as Chaffetz does with his insistence on limiting the goal of the " war on terrorism " to simply taking out al - Qaeda .
Which brings us to the second reason for cutting Chaffetz a little slack , and that is the political importance of an emerging anti-interventionist caucus in the GOP , especially at the congressional level .
The political rationale for Democratic hawkishness is always that the Republicans will supposedly beat up on Obama and the Democrats in Congress if they show " weakness . "
With a strong anti-interventionist tendency in the GOP , the Democratic Leadership Council and its " centrist " allies will have to come up with a different excuse .
Yes , it ’s true that politics in Washington is all about partisanship , and to be against this president and his programs is to at least call into question the conduct and motivating principles of his foreign policy – and anti-interventionists should n’t hesitate for one moment to take full advantage of this .
During the run up to the second world war , Republican opposition to FDR "s strenuous ( albeit largely covert ) attempts to drag us into the European side of the conflict provoked antiwar sentiment on the Republican right .
The group that came together to oppose the Rooseveltian program of war abroad and a highly - centralized , semi-socialist state at home – those we call , in retrospect , the Old Right – came from very disparate points on the political spectrum : the Hooverites , Liberty Leaguers , and Taft Republicans on the right , and on the left disillusioned old - fashioned liberals like the journalist John T. Flynn , and anti-war , anti-Washington Midwestern progressives , such as Senator Burton K. Wheeler , of Montana .
Together , they built the biggest antiwar movement in American history , the America First Committee , which , at its height , had 800,000 dues - paying members , and a large activist contingent .
This is the model we should emulate when building a contemporary movement against our policy of perpetual warfare .
It will take a broad - based coalition , one that spans the political spectrum and allows for a high degree of variety , to stand against the Empire .
But if we ’re going to have our old Republic back , it will be a battle worth fighting .
At a Danish climate summit this week , one subject will certainly be raised :
The theft of thousands of private e-mails and files recently hacked from computers at East Anglia university , a leading climate research center .
The e-mails , which were made public and appear to show scientific misconduct , have fueled a firestorm among those who believe that global warming is not chiefly driven by human influences .
The case is still unfolding , and East Anglia has launched an investigation " to determine whether there is any evidence of the manipulation or suppression of data which is at odds with acceptable scientific practice . "
On the surface , it seems that there was in fact misconduct of some sort .
In some cases , words and phrases ( such as " trick " ) were used out of their academic context to make them seem duplicitous .
Other cases are more serious : Scientist Phil Jones was quoted as stating that he would attempt to keep papers whose conclusions argued against a connection between warming and human activity out of an important climate panel report .
Researcher Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University was portrayed as discussing the boycott of an academic journal that had published what he and others felt was an inadequate study .
These actions certainly seem improper , and in one case may have been illegal .
The question is not whether at least some of the scientists quoted in the private e-mails exhibited poor judgment or even scientific misbehavior .
The real question is whether that misconduct is relevant to the larger issue of whether there is solid evidence for global warming .
For all the furor and controversy , what has not been found among the decade 's worth of stolen e-mails is revealing .
If the e-mails truly are the " smoking gun " that the critics of global warming claim them to be — revealing the tip of the melting iceberg of scientific fraud regarding climate change data — then it is puzzling that no one has yet identified the numerous faked studies .
For all the innuendo and accusations , the scientists ' critics have yet to locate a single instance of fraudulent research exposed in the e-mails .
Personal e-mails between climate scientists may be ill - advised and embarrassing , but by themselves do not provide hard evidence of scientific fraud .
The fact is that the evidence for climate change does not hinge upon data from the East Anglia University researchers whose e-mails were exposed .
Data supporting the global warming hypothesis has been collected over decades from a wide variety of independent organizations around the world , including NASA , the Met Office Hadley Centre in England , the Meteorological Office in Germany , and many others .
To use an analogy , it would be like if , during a worldwide eclipse of the sun , one observatory was accused of faking the telescopic images it showed visitors during the event .
Even if that were true , it would n't change the fact that the eclipse happened , nor that dozens of other observatories recorded the same thing .
Many of the claims made by the so - called global warming skeptics have been raised and addressed ( see , for example , http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php).
None of this excuses the scientist 's alleged behavior .
They should not suppress nor delete data they disagree with .
Scientists , like people in every other profession , sometimes act unprofessionally and maliciously .
Fortunately the data they produce stands or falls on its own merits .
If the scientists ' data is revealed to have been faked , they will undoubtedly be charged with scientific misconduct , their papers recalled , and their careers ruined .
So far , however , the only crime known to have been committed is the original hacking of the university 's private e-mails .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Regulators closed regional banks in three U.S. states Friday , bringing the total number of failed banks this year to 133 , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said .
Customers of the failed banks are protected .
The FDIC , which has insured bank deposits since the Great Depression , currently covers accounts up to $ 250,000 .
In Florida , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) closed Republic Federal Bank , NA , and the FDIC was named receiver .
The four offices of the Miami - based bank will reopen Monday as branches of 1st United Bank , which is based in Boca Raton , Fla .
1st United will acquire all of the failed bank 's $ 352.7 million deposits .
It will also buy $ 267.1 million of the $ 433 million worth of assets Republic Federal had on its books as of late September .
Elsewhere , state regulators in Kansas closed the six branches of SolutionsBank , which is based in Overland Park .
Arvest Bank , of Fayetteville , Ark. , will assume all of the failed bank 's $ 421.3 million worth of deposits and will purchase all of its $ 511.1 million in assets .
SolutionsBank branches will reopen Monday as branches of Arvest Bank .
The sole branch of Mesa , Ariz . - based Valley Capital Bank , NA , was closed by the OCC .
Its roughly $ 41 million in deposits and $ 40 million in assets will be assumed by Enterprise Bank & Trust , of Clayton , Miss .
The FDIC said customers of the failed banks can access their money over the weekend by writing checks or using ATMs or debit cards .
Checks will continue to be processed , and borrowers should make mortgage and loan payments as usual .
An average of 11 banks have failed per month this year , and the FDIC 's deposit insurance fund has slipped into the red for the first time since 1991 .
As of the end of September , the fund was $ 8.2 billion in the hole .
But that figure includes $ 21.7 billion the agency has earmarked for future bank failures .
Friday 's failures of the three banks will cost the FDIC an estimated $ 252.1 million .
The fund is expected to move back into the black by 2012 as banks repay their insurance premiums over the next three years , which the FDIC says could raise $ 45 billion .
This year 's tally of bank failures is the highest number since 1992 , when 181 banks failed .
But the total is far from 1989 's record high of 534 closures which took place during the savings and loan crisis , when the insurance fund also carried a negative balance .

An ancient Roman ruin has been discovered by builders working on the £ 25.6 m redevelopment of the Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury .
The townhouse , thought to date from between the late second and early third Centuries , is believed to have belonged to a wealthy citizen .
Archaeologists found the remains of the building 's under - floor heating , leather shoes , seeds and a plate .
Experts will examine the remains before the redevelopment work resumes .
' High quality '
Archaeologist James Holman said : " It 's quite unexpected .
" It 's very unusual to find buildings of this type in this area of Canterbury , this side of the River Stour .
" It is a very high quality building , it would have had heated floors . "
But he added : " A lot of it has been disturbed by earlier buildings , when they built this theatre in the 30s and when it was redeveloped in the 80s .
" A lot of the archaeology has been removed so there is n't enough of it left to preserve it in situ . "
In March the owners of the Marlowe Theatre were given permission to build a 1,200 - seat auditorium and a second 150 - seat performance space on the current site .
The £ 25.6 m redevelopment of the venue has been backed by host of stars from stage , screen and television .
In June Sonia Copeland - Bloom , the mother of actor Orlando Bloom , announced she was selling some of his possessions to raise money for the scheme .
Bloom appeared at the Marlowe Theatre early in his acting career and is now one of its patrons .
In a world devastated by an outbreak , Brian , his girlfriend Bobby , his brother Danny and their friend , Kate , are heading to a beach where the brothers spent their childhood vacations expecting it to be a sanctuary .
When their car breaks down on the road in the desert , they negotiate with a man called Frank , who is also stranded but without gas .
He is trying to get his daughter Jodie to the hospital ( she is infected with a disease of some kind ) , they all decide to travel together .
During the journey , massive moral dilemmas arise , as events head into a downward spiral .

Major health insurers , which decided early to support key aspects of President Barack Obama 's health - care overhaul , are now picking through the Senate 's version of the legislation and finding cause for concern .
Big insurers are still hoping to influence some language in the legislation before Congress sends it to the president .
But one thing is clear :
The initiative is poised to change their industry more than any other sector of the U.S. health - care system , with huge potential to disrupt profitability .

The electroencephalogram ( EEG ) is widely used by physicians and scientists to study brain function and to diagnose neurological disorders .
However , it has remained largely unknown whether the electrodes on the head give an exact view of what is happening inside the brain .
Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen , Germany , have now found a crucial link between the activity generated within the brain to that measured with EEG .
These findings will provide a better understanding of the waveforms measured with EEG , and thus potentially allow for a better diagnosis and subsequent treatment of patients .
The electroencephalogram ( EEG ) has been widely used in research and medicine for more than 80 years .
The ability to measure the electrical activity in the brain by means of electrodes on the head is a handy tool to study brain functions as it is noninvasive and easy to apply .
The interpretation of the EEG signals remains , however , difficult .
The main reason for this is that the exact relationship between the activity generated in the brain compared to that measured on the scalp is unclear .
Therefore , a question of paramount practical importance is how EEG can be used to deduce neural activity in the brain .
Recently , Kevin Whittingstall and Nikos Logothetis from the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tubingen have addressed this very question for the first time .
By combining recordings of both EEG and individual neurons in trained monkeys , Whittingstall and Logothetis found that a combination of specific waves in the EEG could indeed reliably predict the activity of cells in the brain .
They presented different movie clips consisting of everyday natural scenes to trained monkeys .
While the monkeys watched , their brain activity was recorded via EEG and via electrodes that were placed directly on the neurons , thus allowing for a direct comparison between data sets .
Specifically , they observed that the firing pattern of cells was highest during periods where bursts of ' fast ' EEG activity were embedded within the slow - wave EEG .
As the degree of this so - called ' frequency band coupling ' changed , so also did the cells firing rate .
" We succeeded in identifying which aspects of the EEG best represent changes in the activity from a population of neurons in the brain , " explains Kevin Whittingstall .
" With this information , we can now move to better understand the cause of abnormal EEG waveforms in patients with certain neurological disorders . "
Sir Jeremy Greenstock tells inquiry that war ' did not have backing of great majority ' of UN states

The invasion of Iraq was legal but of " questionable legitimacy " because the US and UK had failed to persuade other countries of the need for war , the then - British ambassador to the UN told the Chilcot inquiry today .
Sir Jeremy Greenstock said : " I regard our participation in the military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy in that it did not have the democratically observable backing of the great majority of [ UN ] member states , or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the UK . "
Earlier , Greenstock told the inquiry that he had threatened to resign if the UN security council failed to pass a resolution on Iraq in the lead - up to the invasion .
He and others in the British delegation to the UN believed a resolution was " essential if any military action was to be regarded as internationally legitimate " .
The diplomat also said he had put pressure on the government to give greater consideration to delaying the invasion until October 2003 , but that the " momentum for earlier action in the United States was much too strong for us to counter " .
The UN security council approved resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002 , paving the way for the return of weapons inspectors to Iraq .
But Britain and the US were unable to get a second resolution directly authorising war after they had argued that Saddam Hussein was not cooperating with inspectors and was playing for time .
The lack of a second resolution led critics of military action to argue that the invasion was illegal under international law – a claim the British government has always denied .
Before the first resolution , there were differences between Washington and its team of diplomats at the UN assembly in New York .
That resulted in a complex set of negotiations between the British and American delegations at the UN , George Bush 's administration in Washington , and the British government over what the resolution might say and how to ensure that it was passed .
Greenstock said he would have been " most uncomfortable " with UK military participation in the invasion of Iraq happening without a resolution .
" I myself warned the Foreign Office in October [ 2002 ] that I might have to consider my own position if that was the way things went , " he said .
In a written statement to the inquiry and responses to questions at the hearing in London today , he also criticised Washington 's belligerence .
" The UK 's attempt to reconstitute a consensus had only a slim prospect of success , made slimmer by the recognition by anyone else following events closely that the United States was not proactively supportive of the UK 's efforts and seemed to be preparing for conflict whatever the UK decided to do , " he said .
" These noises off were decidedly unhelpful to what I was trying to do [ at the UN ] in New York . "
He said the US push towards war hampered efforts to achieve a second resolution .
" It seemed to me that the option of invading Iraq in , say , October 2003 deserved much greater consideration , " he added .
" But the momentum for earlier action in the United States was much too strong for us to counter .
" The prime minister 's arguments for more time , as I observed them from New York , appeared to win two weeks or so of delay , but no more .
" The second resolution as we designed it for March 2003 might have taken on a different shape and character on a different timing . "
Questioned by the inquiry panel , Greenstock said he had been kept in the dark about private discussions taking place between Tony Blair and Bush .
He said he realised there had been a shift in thinking following the two leaders ' meeting at Bush 's ranch in Texas in April 2002 .
" It was n't until the Crawford meeting of 2002 that I realised the UK was being drawn into quite a different discussion .
That discussion was not totally visible to me , " he said .
" I was not being politically naive , but I was not being politically informed either . "

Today is the 25th anniversary of the Methyl Isocyanate ( MIC ) leak at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal , India .
The number of people affected , injured , and killed has been the subject of debate .
But it seems clear that a half a million were exposed to some degree to MIC and other chemicals released and approximately 40,000 people died either immediately or from injuries directly related to the accident .
MIC was a key ingredient in India ’s petrochemical Green Revolution — an intermediate chemical in the production of a number of insecticides , some still in use today .
Photo and caption courtesy Ascanio via Flickr Union Carbide still claims the MIC release was an act of deliberate sabotage and that “ it ” was the victim at Bhopal .
This giant - chemical - corporation - as - victim delusion is symptomatic of our time ; the end - of - free - market capitalism in which corporations have become too big to fail , too powerful to be held accountable .
So why remember the Bhopal tragedy on this 25th anniversary , aside from respect for all its victims ?
I believe the Bhopal tragedy offers us some insights and lessons in our struggle to build true community food security today .
In the years after the tragedy , I encountered countless “ near Bhopal scale ” incidents in the U.S. chemical industry .
At Bhopal ’s sister MIC facility in Institute , W.Va. , an emergency inspection of the unit found three of the four redundant safety systems disabled — the same as at Bhopal .
A hydrofluoric acid spill in Texas City , Texas came within 6 inches of killing 50 - 100,000 people downwind .
The petrochemical industry has a long record of valuing production and profits over safety .
I believe they have made a calculation that the costs of an accident or an exposure are miniscule compared to the career building profits possible from a kind of “ what can I get away with ? ” attitude towards production and safety .
Indeed , the record suggests they are right .
No one has been held accountable for the Bhopal tragedy .
Token payments have been made to some victims , but Union Carbide has never claimed responsibility for the failure .
This denial is part of an agrichemical industry strategy to escape the costs of corporate irresponsibility or at least delay them long enough to allow current management to retire blameless .
In Michigan , where I live , Dow Chemical ( now owner of Union Carbide ) has fought a shameful battle against residents of the Midland and the Tittabawasee River basin exposed to very high levels of dioxins and furans .
Dow ’s goal has been to avoid responsibility for at least a quarter century of contamination while claiming it now acts with the highest standards of safety .
In the west end of Louisville , Ky. , in an industrial area known as Rubbertown , Dupont exposed largely African - American chemical workers to hazardous chemicals for decades .
One Dupont manager reportedly said that the corporation would resist settling a class action lawsuit based on this poisoning until “ all the plaintiffs were dead . ”
I could go on and on with stories like these based on my two decades of work investigating the petrochemical industry .
What is important for us today is to realize the large corporations that monopolize conventional industrial agriculture today are n’t going to suddenly change when they “ see the light ” .
From the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico to the health of agricultural workers to consumer exposure to unsafe ingredients , these corporations have too much liability , too much to lose to engage in real negotiations about changing the way our nation farms .
Petrochemical domination of conventional and industrial farming is based on a fundamentally wrong paradigm of destruction of life in the soil .
Living soil is seen as the enemy .
Their goal is organism - free dirt that functions as a medium to deliver human - made inputs and nutrients .
This extraordinary mistake has produced record amounts of production ( not food ) in the very short - term while reducing carrying capacity in the long term and causing almost unimaginable damage in the process .
If a realistic calculation were done to assess the total environmental , economic , and public health damage done by agricultural chemical and industrial corporations , the sum would exceed the book value of the corporations responsible .
So , if the food security of our nation depends , in some critical measure , on the scale and speed of a transition to sustainable farming using 80 percent less petroleum , that protects water quality and conserves water quantity through organic growing practices based on healthy , living soil , what are we do to about the corporate inheritors of the legacy of Bhopal ?
I propose we look to South Africa for a solution .
When apartheid was abolished and Nelson Mandela was released after 27 years in prison , the new South Africa was confronted with legacy of repression , torture , and death caused by its own citizens .
There surely must have been a very strong temptation to take revenge .
But a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was created instead .
The goal was to make public the “ truth ” about what had happened under apartheid — to grant amnesty to virtual all responsible for past actions .
The “ truth ” was important to help the new nation find a path forward .
We are in a similar moment with regard to industrial , petrochemical intensive conventional agriculture .
Though its corporate proponents still rule in Washington like South African President de Klerk ruled in Pretoria , change from the ground ( literally the soil , in our case ) is coming .
We need our own version of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for agriculture , one that helps conventional farmers see not only how they have been victimized by the agricultural petrochemical industry , but helps them chart a new path ahead .
We also need to grant amnesty to those corporations that stop producing the most damaging , most resilience destroying chemicals .
Short of consumers marching on agrichemical corporate headquarters with pitchforks and torches , I do n’t see any better way of making this change .
We need to acknowledge what has happened is wrong .
Forgive and move swiftly in the right direction ( because of our survival requires it of us ) .
That is the lesson of Bhopal that I see .
I still dream of what it must have been like that night of Dec. 3 in Bhopal ’s crowded neighborhoods pressed up against the Union Carbide plant .
The choking .
The panic .
The crush and trampling .
The long - term suffering of those who did n’t die immediately .
We must remember those victims .
Al Franken Alan ( Al ) Stuart FrankenGOP
Senate candidate says Trump , Republicans will surprise in Minnesota Peterson faces fight of his career in deep - red Minnesota district Getting tight — the psychology of cancel culture MORE , the Democrat from Minnesota who won election to the Senate after a successful career as a comic and author , has begun to show the sharp - tongued side of his personality by ripping into GOP staffers behind the scenes .
Franken has worked diligently to keep a low public profile in Congress while focusing on wonky policy debates .
But he has been unable to completely repress the fiery passion that made him a hero of the Democratic Party ’s liberal base .

Franken has teamed up with GOP colleagues to introduce a variety of legislation , something that may surprise fans who read his books , such asBut he has also pummeled Republican senators and their aides , showing a glimpse of the pugilistic style of his best - seller , Franken has surprised some of his colleagues behind the scenes by getting into heated tangles with GOP staffers .
One such exchange took place in Franken ’s office during a recent meeting with Sen . ( R - Tenn . ) and his aides .
Franken invited Corker to his office to discuss an op -ed that Corker penned in a Tennessee newspaper opposing an amendment Franken offered to a defense bill .
The measure gave the employees of defense contractors who suffer rape or sexual assault at the workplace the right to sue in court .
The meeting quickly deteriorated when Franken began berating one of Corker ’s aides , according to GOP aides familiar with the incident .
Franken ’s sally was so harsh that Corker told Franken to lay off his aide and direct the comments at him instead .
Franken ’s tough approach came as a surprise because Corker scheduled the meeting to mend fences after Franken confronted him about the op - ed during an angry exchange on the Senate floor .
Another GOP staffer , an aide to a Senate Republican leader , found herself at the sharp end of Franken ’s wit at a recent reception in the Senate ’s Mansfield Room .
The tongue - lashing took place at an event to celebrate the swearing - in of GOP Sen .
George LeMieux ( Fla . ) .
After the conversation began ordinarily , Franken started to grill the aide about what he sees as the failings of the GOP .
Franken demanded to know why it had become the " Party of No " and had exaggerated facts in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , according to another GOP leadership aide .
A spokeswoman for Franken declined to comment on either exchange .
The aide emphasized Franken 's accomplishments during his short time in the Senate .
" Sen . Franken is always looking for ways to work with his colleagues to make people 's lives better and get things done for Minnesota , " said spokeswoman Casey Aden - Wansbury .
" He has built good working relationships with colleagues on both sides of the aisle — half the bills he has introduced have Republican co-sponsors .
Sen .
Franken is pleased that two of his bills have already been signed into law — and that both passed with bipartisan support , " she said .
The incidents with GOP staff have reminded some Senate observers of a mocking interaction Franken had with a conservative student , Peter Fritz , at Carleton College during his Senate campaign .
After learning of Fritz ’s political orientation , Franken pressed him to defend Reaganomics and mimicked his speech patterns , according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune .
Aden -Wansbury vigorously denied that Franken made fun of Fritz and claimed that element of the report was inaccurate .
“ There is a war within Al Franken , ” said Lawrence Jacobs , a professor of political science at the University of Minnesota .
“ The Al Franken head tells him to steer away from the limelight and build his reputation .
Then there is his heart , which is quite fiery . "
Jacobs said Franken must be careful not to engage in too many political brawls , or it could “ reinforce for independent voters what they feared about him , that he ’s a hot - headed partisan . ”
Franken has not just confronted GOP aides at private meetings ; he has also mixed it up with Republican colleagues in public on the Senate floor .
In addition to chewing out Corker over the op -ed , earlier this month Franken clashed loudly with Sen. John Thune John Randolph ThuneHouse in near - unanimous vote affirms peaceful transfer of power
In rare move , Schumer forces vote to consider health care bill amid Supreme Court tensions Supreme Court nominee gives no clues in GOP meeting MORE ( R - S.D. ) on the Senate floor .
The dust - up was spurred by Thune ’s claim that Democratic healthcare legislation would impose new taxes immediately but fail to implement benefits for several years .
Franken derided
Thune ’s floor presentation and implied that he had fabricated some of his facts , a more personal confrontation than usual in the clubby Senate .
An irate Thune walked off the Senate floor after Franken revealed a private conversation they had on the topic .
“ I asked if he mentioned any of the benefits that do kick in [ immediately ] and he said , ‘ Uh no , ’ ” Franken said in front of C - SPAN television cameras .
“ We are entitled to our own opinions ; we ’re not entitled to our own facts , ” Franken said , raising his voice .
“ Benefits kick in right away , and if you ’re going to hold up a chart that says when taxes kick in and when benefits kick in … you better include the benefits that do kick in right away . ”
Franken later apologized to Thune .
And last week , Franken cut off Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) during his speech on the Senate floor .
Lieberman , who has drawn the ire of liberals over his opposition to the public health insurance option , asked for an additional moment to finish remarks about amendments he planned to offer , but Franken , who was presiding over the Senate , refused to grant the routine request .
" In my capacity as the senator from Minnesota , I object , " Franken said .
" Really ? " replied Lieberman .
A spokeswoman for Franken said that the senator was just trying to move along with the legislation , but at a press conference late last week , Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainAmerica 's presence in Cam Ranh Bay should be more than occasional Meghan McCain , husband welcome first baby girl , Liberty Sage McCain Domenech The Hill 's Morning Report - Sponsored by JobsOhio - Showdown : Trump - Biden debate likely to be nasty MORE ( R - Ariz . ) expressed disgust with Franken , saying that Lieberman 's request for more time to extend his remarks was " objected to by the newest member of the United States Senate in a most brusque way ...
We 've got to stop this kind of behavior .
I have never seen anything like that and I hope that I do n't see it again . "
An aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidGOP senators confident Trump pick to be confirmed by November Durbin : Democrats can ' slow ' Supreme Court confirmation ' perhaps a matter of hours , maybe days at most ' Supreme Court fight pushes Senate toward brink MORE ( D - Nev. ) confirmed to reporters the leader asked colleagues presiding over the chamber to strictly enforce a 10 - minute speaking rule .
And Democrats note that despite his criticism , McCain did the same thing to a colleague in 2002 when he objected to former Sen.
Mark Dayton ’s ( D - Minn . ) request for an additional 30 seconds of floor time during the Iraq War debate .
These incidents have pulled Franken away from his stated goal of modeling his early career in the Senate on former Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , who made a point of proving herself as a “ workhorse , ” in Senate parlance , and who teamed up often with Republicans .

Franken ’s sharp - elbowed exchanges have come in moments of passion .
By all appearances , he has worked to keep partisan outbursts to a minimum , knowing that what may draw listeners to Air America does not play well in the buttoned - down Senate .
He has stayed off national cable shows such as " Countdown with Keith Olbermann " and " The Rachel Maddow Show " to avoid appearing as a celebrity liberal spokesman instead of a hard - working senator from Minnesota .
Franken stayed away from the popular liberal blog Daily Kos until this past weekend , when he submitted a measured defense of his decision to vote for Senate healthcare reform legislation .
Franken , who has shared a lot of his time with Minnesota media outlets , has kept the national press at arm ’s length .
He participated in his first national conference call over the weekend .
The call with colleagues did not , however , push political hot buttons .
Instead , it focused on consumer protections in the healthcare bill .
And he has wooed a significant number of Republican colleagues to cooperate on legislative initiatives .
For example , he introduced the Service Dogs for Veterans Act with Sen . ( R - Ga. ) ; a diabetes prevention amendment with Sen. Richard Lugar ( R - Ind. ) ; a bill to assist the victims of sexual assault with Sens . ( R - Iowa ) and ( R - Utah ) ; and the Compassionate Care for Servicewomen Act with Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) .
But even while Franken has tried to focus on sober policy issues , he has at times become embroiled in heated political debates inadvertently , his defenders say .
This happened with the so - called “ anti-rape ” amendment Franken offered to a defense bill .
The measure barred the government from doing business with contractors that required employees to settle rape and sexual assault charges through arbitration instead of the courts .
The amendment was popular enough to attract 68 votes in the Senate , but it quickly became a political football when liberals used it to attack 30 Republican lawmakers who opposed it .
Liberal comic Jon Stewart slammed Republican opponents on his talk show , and other critics set up a fake website , RepublicansForRape.org , something that did not endear Franken to some of his conservative colleagues .
“ It ’s partly because Franken ’s on a 24/7 watch , ” said Jacobs of the University of Minnesota .
“ Even when he ’s not intending to go public , he ’s finding himself in the media spotlight . ”

‘ Tis the season of merry - making , which means you ’re probably more likely than usual to find yourself making polite and perhaps awkward chit-chat .
One of the challenges of the holidays !
If you have trouble talking to a stranger in those situations , here are some tips to consider .
But once you ’re talking , how do you know if the other person is interested in your conversation or not ?
One challenge is that the more socially adept a person is , the better he or she is at hiding boredom .
It ’s a rare person , however , who can truly look fascinated while bored .
Here are the factors I watch for when trying to figure out if I ’m connecting with someone .
These are utterly unscientific —
I ’m sure someone has made a proper study of this , but these are just my observations ( mostly from noting how I behave when I ’m bored and trying to hide it ) :
1. Repeated , perfunctory responses .
A person who repeats , “ Oh really ?
Wow .
Oh really ?
Interesting . ” is n't particularly engaged .
2. Simple questions .
People who are bored ask simple questions .
“ When did you move ? ” “ Where did you go ? ”
People who are interested ask more complicated questions that show curiosity , not mere politeness .
3. Interruption .
Although it sounds rude , interruption is actually a good sign , I think .
It means a person is bursting to say something , and that shows interest .
Similarly …
4. Request for clarification .
A person who is sincerely interested in what you ’re saying will ask you to elaborate or to explain .
“ What does that term mean ? ” “ When exactly did that happen ? ” “ Then what did he say ? ” are the kinds of questions that show that someone is trying closely to follow what you ’re saying .
5. Imbalance of talking time .
I suspect that many people fondly suppose that they usually do 80 percent of the talking because people find them fascinating .
Sometimes , it ’s true , a discussion involves a huge download of information desired by the listener ; that ’s a very satisfying kind of conversation .
In general , though , people who are interested in a subject have things to say themselves ; they want to add their own opinions , information , and experiences .
If they are n’t doing that , they 're probably keeping quiet in the hopes that the conversation will end faster .
Or maybe you just are n't letting them get a word in — recently I was talking to someone who , though fascinating , did n't want to let me contribute to the conversation .
I enjoyed it , but not as much as if I 'd been able to talk , too .
6. Abrupt changes in topic .
If you ’re talking to someone about , say , the life of Winston Churchill ( I have a tendency to dwell at length on this particular subject ) , and all of a sudden the other person says , “ So how are your kids ? ” it ’s a sign that he or she is n’t very interested or perhaps not listening at all .
When someone makes this kind of switch , I have to fight the urge not to drag the topic back to what I want to talk about — but the fact that someone has introduced a completely different subject is a sure sign that the subject is not engaging .
7. Body position .
People with a good connection generally turn to face each other .
A person who is partially turned away is n’t fully embracing the conversation .
Along the same lines , if you ’re a speaker trying to figure out if an audience is interested in what you ’re saying , then consider ...
8. Audience posture .
Back in 1885 , Sir Francis Galton wrote a paper called “ The Measurement of Fidget . ”
He determined that people slouch and lean when bored , so a speaker can measure the boredom of an audience by seeing how far from vertically upright they are .
Also , attentive people fidget less ; bored people fidget more .
An audience that ’s sitting still and upright is interested , while an audience that ’s horizontal and squirmy is bored .
I often remind myself of La Rochefoucauld ’s observation , “ We are always bored by those whom we bore . ”
If I ’m bored , there ’s a good chance the other person may be bored , too .
Time to find a different subject .
( Here 's a list of some topics to avoid , if you do n't want to risk boring people . )
Have you figured out any ways to tell if you ’re boring someone ?
Domain names can soon be registered using Chinese characters or Cyrillic script , ending the exclusivity of the Latin alphabet in top - level domain names , according to a Friday ICANN vote .
ICANN , the net ’s ruling body on naming , expects the change will help make bring even more users to the internet .
Currently , domain name endings ( e.g. .com and .us ) can be composed only of the Latin letters A to Z , numbers and dashes .
India , for instance , has 22 official languages and each could get its top - level domain .
Applications will start on November 16 , and the first non-Latin domain names will be live sometime next year .
Allowing other languages and scripts , comes as an addition to ICANN ’s June 2008 decision to allow nearly limitless top - level domains .
It allowed for instance . halloween , so long as a registrar is willing to pay hundreds of thousands to set up and manage that top - level domain .
The approval of Internationalised Domain Names will also likely lead to another boom in domain - name registrations .
Companies will be forced to protect their brand by registering yet more variations of their current domains ( think Coca - Cola in every language possible ) .
Domain - name speculators will race to buy as many names as they can in languages they do n’t understand in order to create more contentless “ landing ” pages to make money from people who accidentally type that URL into a browser address bar .
The vote came on the final day of ICANN ’s meeting in Seoul , Korea .
“ This is only the first step , but it is an incredibly big one and an historic move toward the internationalization of the internet , ” said Rod Beckstrom , ICANN ’s President and CEO .
“ The first countries that participate will not only be providing valuable information of the operation of IDNs in the domain name system , they are also going to help to bring the first of billions more people online — people who never use Roman characters in their daily lives . ”
Countries with officially registered languages will get to go first through a fast - track process .
Names for those domains must be composed entirely of the non-Latin characters of that particular language — no mongrel names combining scripts from separate languages will be allowed .
Security experts have cautioned that expanding the net ’s domain - name system will lead to more cybercrime and fraud , but ICANN decided that the threat was minimal , compared to the benefits of attracting more users to the net .

How would you like to be a New Jersey police officer and look out your window and see several known criminals , including a man you arrested several weeks ago and another who had just been released from prison for shooting a cop ?
And then find out that the men were sent into the neighborhood by the Democratic Party for GOTV operations – complete with lists of voters names , addresses and phones numbers !
That is what happened Sunday on a quiet street in Morris Township .
The officer , who ’s name we are with holding , specifically heard the men discussing that he was a police officer and that they now know where he lives .
The officer confronted the men and they took off .
He contacted the local police who responded and caught up with them and about a dozen other men a few blocks away .
According to the police report , the men were known criminals and when asked why they were in the neighborhood they stated they were
“ campaigning for the Democratic Party . ”
Below is an interview with another Morris Township resident who also witnessed the gangbangers going door to door .
She contacted a local Democratic Party Official who sent her an email stating
“ Thanks for writing .
Yes , I heard about this and am very sorry for the incident . ”
Shockingly , this is n’t the first time New Jersey Democrats have used gang bangers for GOTV .
According to this story on PolitickerNJ , the Bloods Street gang stole $ 6000 from the NJ Democratic State Committee through a check fraud scheme .
NJ Democratic Party Chairman Joseph Cryan said “ that checks were copied from payments sent out for the party ’s 2006 field operation . ”
It ’s 9:00 AM and things are just heating up in Jersey .
Before anyone ELSE gets the wrong idea , I want people to realize that this video is NOT representative of the true capacity of a dedicated server .
It is simply showing ONE of the things you can do with them , and that one thing happened to show the extensive level of customization that can be applied to the game rules in a dedicated server .
While I 'm ecstatic at the idea of the game having been broken into to provide greater functionality , to be honest , I DESPISE how the video only shows godmode weapons being overused to hell and back .
It makes it seem like the only reason why anyone would wanna enable dedicated servers is to cheat and break the game .
See ?
Look at all the comments below .
It 's all stuff like " THIS is what you wanted it for ? "
" Unbalanced version of a balanced game . "
It 's a terrible video that only shows that the feat has been accomplished , but not why the feat is actually a worthwhile endeavor to accomplish in the first place .
Show us some legit things , like increased max player caps , custom gametypes , admin control , and other things that actually make dedicated servers appealing .
You 've shown us that yes , you can enable cheats for one or all players .
Show us instead that you can play on a cheat - free server where an admin has the ability to ban anyone using illegitimate hacks , instead of everyone being subjected to the hacker 's cheating ways until the end of the match .
Show us that you can modify the gametype settings to produce new and innovative gametypes .
Show us that you can indeed have a maximum of 16vs16 players .
Show us that the game room persists even after the party has left .
While nuclear negotiations between Iran and the West have yet to yield a final result , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) chief warns against imposing fresh sanctions on the country .
Speaking on Friday in Berlin , IAEA Director - General Mohamed ElBaradei expressed hope that Iran would agree to an international nuclear fuel proposal , which is said to be aimed at resolving a long - standing dispute over the country 's nuclear program .
"
We have not received any written response from Iran .
What I got of course is an oral response , which basically said 'we need to keep all the material in Iran until we get the fuel , ' " ElBaradei said .
" I hope to get an answer soon , within the next week or so , " he added .
The IAEA chief was referring to a proposal put forward to the Tehran government by major powers in Geneva on October 19 , suggesting that Iran sends the bulk of its low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) stockpile out of the country in exchange for metal fuel rods for its Tehran medical research reactor .
While Iran said that it would accept the essential elements of the UN offer , it sought modifications to the formula .
Arguing that a guarantee for the fuel supply is the core concern for Iran , nuclear officials in the Islamic Republic say Tehran wants its enriched uranium stockpile kept in a room inside the country sealed by the UN nuclear watchdog .
Iranian officials say that once the nuclear fuel is supplied to Iran , the agreed amount of LEU can be taken out of the country as part of the deal .
ElBaradei went on to warn the West against imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic , saying the move would prompt the Tehran government to further toughen its stance on its nuclear program .
"
We got a positive response from the Russians and the Americans and the French who also said that they are ready to help and that , I thought , is a unique opportunity to move from sanctions and confrontation to the process of building confidence and trust , " the outgoing head of the UN nuclear watchdog said .
" I would hate to see that we are moving back to sanctions , " ElBaradei said .

PM Maliki appealed for Iraqis to stand by their security forces
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has fired the head of Baghdad 's security forces in the wake of Tuesday 's bombings which killed 127 people .
" [ Mr Maliki ] ordered the removal of Lt Gen Abboud Qanbar from his post , " a statement from his office said .
Lt Gen Qanbar would be replaced by the deputy chief of the Iraqi army , Lt Gen Ahmed Hashem , the statement said .
A total of 127 people were killed and 448 wounded in Tuesday 's bombings , the third such major attack since August .
" This crime will prompt us to review security strategies .
It will bring changes in positions of officials in order to develop tactics to confront these developing challenges , " Mr Maliki said .
Public anger
Iraqi MPs have demanded that top ministers face questions in parliament over security .
Iraq 's Interior Minister , Jawad al - Bolani , said he was willing attend the session as long it was held publicly .
Reports said the defence minister and Prime Minister Maliki had also been asked to attend .
The bombings came two days after Iraq 's parliament backed a new election law and set delayed polls for 7 March .
The top US military officer said plans to withdraw US forces next year had not been altered , despite the attacks .
Toll questioned
Also on Wednesday , the Iraqi government questioned the media 's death toll for the bombing , which quoted unnamed police and hospital officials who said the number of dead totalled 127 .
The government - run Baghdad Operation Centre said 77 people had been killed .
Relatives of the dead from Tuesday 's attacks waited outside Baghdad hospitals to pick up their remains .
Some mourners carried black - draped coffins through the streets to the burial grounds .
Officials say that attacks on state - run institutions are designed to undermine the Iraqi government , especially ahead of the parliamentary election .
Also on Wednesday , another bomb , planted by the side of a road in north Baghdad , killed two people and injured seven .
Later , a sniper shot a policeman dead in the same district .
Iraqi government figures have shown that violence generally has fallen over the past 18 months .
In October , however , co-ordinated bomb attacks killed at least 155 people and wounded hundreds in Baghdad .

A comparative look at the role - playing game industry on both Western and Japanese shores yields a strong dichotomy : one of consistent innovation , and one of arguable stagnation .
At least , that is the belief that Bioware co-founder / director Greg Zeschuk recently expanded upon in an interview with video game website Destructoid .
“ The fall of the JRPG in large part is due to a lack of evolution , a lack of progression .
They kept delivering the same thing over and over .
They make the dressing better , they look prettier , but it ’s still the same experience . ”
He added , “ My favorite thing , it ’s funny when you still see it , but the joke of some of the dialogue systems where it asks , ‘ do you wanna do this or this , ’ and you say no .
‘ Do you wanna do this or this ? ’
No .
‘ Do you wanna do this or this ? ’
No .
Lemme think — you want me to say ‘ yes . ’
And that , unfortunately , really characterized the JRPG . ”
“ We have big debates on whether GTA is an RPG , for example , ” said Zeschuk .
“ It ’s got all the elements , it just does n’t have the numbers .
And what gamers here want is that higher depth , that higher integration of features …
Mass Effect 2 is in some ways a continuation of that evolution . ”
Do you agree with Dr. Zeschuk ?
Or is there more innovation in JRPGs than many realize ?

If you experience impotence , instead of a little blue pill maybe you want to apply shockwaves to your privates instead .
Experiments now suggest directing shockwaves at penises can help treat erectile dysfunction .
" We can really reverse erectile problems with this , " researcher Yoram Vardi , head of the neuro - urology department at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa , Israel , told LiveScience .
" While patients with erectile dysfunction can function with Viagra or Cialis , this is not a cure — when they stop the medication , they cannot function , " he added .
" This is only a preliminary study , but here with shockwaves , we can do something biological for the problem — after treatments , these patients can function without the need for medication . "
In animal studies , low - intensity shockwaves have been proven to trigger growth of new blood vessels from existing ones .
Vardi and his colleagues therefore speculated that shockwave therapy could help men whose erectile dysfunction stems from reduced blood flow to their penises .
" Cardiovascular problems are responsible for approximately 80 percent of patients with erectile dysfunction , so that 's a huge amount of patients , " Vardi explained .
Volunteers shocked
The researchers treated 20 volunteers with an average age of 56 years old who had mild or moderate erectile dysfunction for roughly three years .
At each session , a device that resembles a computer mouse applied shockwaves at five different sites on their penises .
" These are very , very low energy shock waves , " Vardi said .
Each shockwave applied roughly 100 bar of pressure — some 20 times the air pressure in a bottle of champagne , but less than the pressure exerted by a woman in stiletto heels who weighs 132 lbs. ( 60 kg ) .
" This sort of energy is completely different from what you would get in a massage , although everyone can do what they want , " Vardi said .
Each site on the penis received some 300 shockwaves over the course of three minutes .
The men underwent two weekly sessions for three weeks , and then repeated this course of therapy after three weeks of rest .
Significant improvement was seen in 15 of 20 men .
" We did n't find any side effects , and it did n't hurt , " Vardi noted .
Even if further studies bear out these results , this is not a cure for everyone , Vardi cautioned .
The researchers chose men whose problems were apparently due to blood flow , as opposed to nerve , muscle or other issues .
Expanding tests
The researchers are now expanding their research with placebo groups and more patients .
" This is only the beginning — we need to understand much better what is happening , " Vardi said .
" We also want to see how long this response will stand — is it forever , one year , two years , six months ?
We know that at three months , it stays the same . "
Vardi and his colleagues detailed their findings November 17 at the European Society for Sexual Medicine meeting in Lyon , France .
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK .
Most women diagnosed with breast cancer are over the age of 50 , but younger women can also get breast cancer .
About 1 in 8 women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime .
There 's a good chance of recovery if it 's detected at an early stage .
For this reason , it 's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always have any changes examined by a GP .
In rare cases , men can also be diagnosed with breast cancer .
Find out more about breast cancer in men .
Symptoms of breast cancer Breast cancer can have several symptoms , but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue .
Most breast lumps are not cancerous , but it 's always best to have them checked by a doctor .
You should also see a GP if you notice any of these symptoms : a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts
discharge from either of your nipples , which may be streaked with blood
a lump or swelling in either of your armpits
dimpling on the skin of your breasts
a rash on or around your nipple
a change in the appearance of your nipple , such as becoming sunken into your breast Breast pain is not usually a symptom of breast cancer .
Find out more about the symptoms of breast cancer .
Causes of breast cancer
The exact causes of breast cancer are not fully understood .
However , there are certain factors known to increase the risk of breast cancer .
These include : age – the risk increases as you get older
a family history of breast cancer
a previous diagnosis of breast cancer
a previous non-cancerous ( benign ) breast lump
being tall , overweight or obese
drinking alcohol
Find out more about the causes of breast cancer .
Diagnosing breast cancer
After examining your breasts , a GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests .
This might include breast screening ( mammography ) or taking a small sample of breast tissue to be examined under a microscope ( a biopsy ) .
Find out more about how breast cancer is diagnosed .
Types of breast cancer
There are several different types of breast cancer , which develop in different parts of the breast .
Breast cancer is often divided into either : non-invasive breast cancer ( carcinoma in situ ) – found in the ducts of the breast ( ductal carcinoma in situ , or DCIS ) which has not spread into the breast tissue surrounding the ducts .
Non-invasive breast cancer is usually found during a mammogram and rarely shows as a breast lump .
invasive breast cancer – where the cancer cells have spread through the lining of the ducts into the surrounding breast tissue .
This is the most common type of breast cancer .
Other , less common types of breast cancer include : invasive ( and pre-invasive ) lobular breast cancer
inflammatory breast cancer
Paget 's disease of the breast
It 's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body , usually through the blood or the axillary lymph nodes .
These are small lymphatic glands that filter bacteria and cells from the mammary gland .
If this happens , it 's known as secondary , or metastatic , breast cancer .
Breast cancer screening Mammographic screening , where X - ray images of the breast are taken , is the most commonly available way of finding a change in your breast tissue ( lesion ) at an early stage .
However , you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers .
It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions , including surgery , even if you 're not affected by breast cancer .
Women with a higher - than - average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition .
As the risk of breast cancer increases with age , all women who are 50 to 70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every 3 years .
Women over the age of 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit .
The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial , offering screening to some women aged 47 to 73 .
Find out more about breast cancer screening .

Treating breast cancer
If cancer is detected at an early stage , it can be treated before it spreads to other parts of the body .
Breast cancer is treated using a combination of : surgery
chemotherapy
radiotherapy
Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you 'll have , followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or , in some cases , hormone or targeted treatments .
The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have .
Your doctor should discuss the best treatment plan with you .
In a small proportion of women , breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body ( metastatic breast cancer ) .
Secondary cancer , also called advanced or metastatic cancer , is not curable , so the aim of treatment is to relieve symptoms .
Find out more about treating breast cancer .
Living with breast cancer
Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways , depending on what stage it's at and the treatment you will have .
How people cope with the diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person .
There are several forms of support available , if you need it .
Forms of support may include : family and friends , who can be a powerful support system
communicating with other people in the same situation
finding out as much as possible about your condition
not trying to do too much or overexerting yourself
making time for yourself

It may be no accident that , while some of the best American mathematical minds worked to solve one of the century 's hardest problems — the Poincaré Conjecture — it was a Russian mathematician working in Russia who , early in this decade , finally triumphed .

Mozilla plans to debut a " lockdown " feature in Firefox 3.6 to force third party application developers to toe the line by preventing them from adding their own code into the browser 's components directory .
" Firefox is built around the idea of extensibility - it ’s part of our soul , " proclaimed Mozilla 's Jonathan Nightingale in a blog post earlier this week .
" Users can install extensions that modify the way their browser looks , the way it works , or the things it ’s capable of doing .
Our add - ons community is an amazing part of the Mozilla ecosystem , one we work hard to grow and improve . "
However , the open source browser maker has proved it is n't averse to slamming the door on rebellious coders .
Nightingale said from Firefox 3.6 onwards - including future beta releases of that iteration of the browser - it would prevent third party applications from adding code directly to the components directory .
" There are no special abilities that come from doing things this way , but there are some significant disadvantages , " noted Nightingale .
He said such components are added via a stealth installation making them invisible to the user , which prevents them from being able to manage or indeed disable the extensions through the add-ons manager function .
" What ’s worse , components dropped blindly into Firefox in this way do n’t carry version information with them , which means that when users upgrade Firefox and these components become incompatible , there ’s no way to tell Firefox to disable them , " he said .
" This can lead to all kinds of unfortunate behaviour : lost functionality , performance woes , and outright crashing – often immediately on startup . "
Effectively , from hereon in the components directory will be a Firefox - only playpen .
Mozilla hopes this lockdown will make the browser more stable for the user . ®
Contents 1 Abstract 2 High - level design 2.1 Firmware 2.2 System - level and user - land software 2.3 Chromium and the window manager Abstract Chromium OS consists of three major components :
The Chromium - based browser and the window manager
System - level software and user - land services : the kernel , drivers , connection manager , and so on
Firmware
High - level design
We 'll look at each component , starting with the firmware .
Firmware
The firmware plays a key part to make booting the OS faster and more secure .
To achieve this goal we are removing unnecessary components and adding support for verifying each step in the boot process .
We are also adding support for system recovery into the firmware itself .
We can avoid the complexity that 's in most PC firmware because we do n't have to be backwards compatible with a large amount of legacy hardware .
For example , we do n't have to probe for floppy drives .
Our firmware will implement the following functionality : System recovery :
The recovery firmware can re-install Chromium OS in the event that the system has become corrupt or compromised .

Verified boot : Each time the system boots , Chromium OS verifies that the firmware , kernel , and system image have not been tampered with or become corrupt .
This process starts in the firmware .
Each time the system boots , Chromium OS verifies that the firmware , kernel , and system image have not been tampered with or become corrupt .
This process starts in the firmware .
Fast boot :
We have improved boot performance by removing a lot of complexity that is normally found in PC firmware .
System - level and user - land software From here we bring in the Linux kernel , drivers , and user - land daemons .
Our kernel is mostly stock except for a handful of patches that we pull in to improve boot performance .
On the user - land side of things we have streamlined the init process so that we 're only running services that are critical .
All of the user - land services are managed by Upstart .
By using Upstart we are able to start services in parallel , re-spawn jobs that crash , and defer services to make boot faster .
Here 's a quick list of things that we depend on : D - Bus :
The browser uses D - Bus to interact with the rest of the system .
Examples of this include the battery meter and network picker .

Chromium and the window manager
The window manager is responsible for handling the user 's interaction with multiple client windows .
It does this in a manner similar to that of other X window managers , by controlling window placement , assigning the input focus , and exposing hotkeys that exist outside the scope of a single browser window .
Parts of the ICCCM ( Inter - Client Communication Conventions Manual ) and EWHM ( Extended Window Manager Hints ) specifications are used for communication between clients and the window manager where possible .
The window manager also uses the XComposite extension to redirect client windows to offscreen pixmaps so that it can draw a final , composited image incorporating their contents itself .
This lets windows be transformed and blended together .
The window manager contains a compositor that animates these windows and renders them via OpenGL or OpenGL|ES .

Did you just feel a quake ?
By Jonathan Amos
Science correspondent , BBC News , San Francisco
The Great California Shakeout was a drill and not a real quake event
Tweets are being used by the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) to get instant public reaction to earthquakes .
The agency is trawling the messages to find out what people felt during a tremor - whether there was a lot of shaking in their area or not .
There are big spikes in Twitter traffic immediately following a quake and the USGS believes emergency responders might find the information useful .
It could help them assess very quickly the severity of a particular event .
However , the survey stressed that the social networking tool would only ever supplement the existing scientific reporting systems which determine shake effects .
Quake tweets
" It is a speed versus accuracy issue , " explained Dr Paul Earle .
" Twitter messages start coming out in the seconds after an earthquake whereas , depending of the region , scientifically derived information can take 2 - 20 minutes , " he told BBC News .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Dr Earle has been describing the Twitter Earthquake Detection project here at the American Geophysical Union 's ( AGU ) Fall Meeting , the world 's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists .
It seems that sharing their experiences is one of the first things tweeters are most keen to do following a quake .
For example , typical messages after a magnitude 5.1 event offshore of New Zealand earlier this month included : • Wellingtonians - was that an earthquake or just a very big truck going past our building ?
• that was a bigger earthquake the mirror shook in the bathroom and the floor moved .....
Scared :( • Just had a Earthquake , biggest one ive ever seen , not huge , but enough to really shake our house and everything on my desk , good old NZ •
My monitors were shaking like the water in Jurassic Park , kinda awesome .
#earthquake #wellington " Twitter provides a stream that dumps out the tweets continuously , " explained Michelle Guy , a software engineer working on the USGS project .
" We put a filter on that stream , looking for key words like ' earthquake ' or ' quake ' .
We download it 24/7 . "
Noise filter
The USGS continuously collects , geo-codes ( where the information is supplied , perhaps by a GPS enabled device ) and stores the tweets .
When the national seismic network detects a quake , the new system then checks back to see if there was a significant increase in messages following the event .
If there was , it can send interested scientists emails that summarise where the tweets were coming from and the text from a sample of them .
The USGS development team concedes there can be a lot " noise " in the data stream .
For instance , the filter has had to be tuned to ignore references to the popular video game " Quake " and an ice cream known as the " Oreo Brownie Earthquake " .
" Because there is a lot of noise in this data and we do n't believe this system could ever be used to initiate a critical response such as shutting down a nuclear power plant , but what it may do is give us an initial heads - up in a region which does n't have a dense seismic network that further scientific evaluation is needed , " said Dr Earle .
A paper describing the project will be published soon in Seismological Research Letters .

Magnesium and heart disease
( NaturalNews ) Magnesium may be the most under - rated minerals in human nutrition .
It 's not only pivotal in preventing heart disease , it also prevents diabetes by helping the body properly regulate sugar metabolism .
There are perhaps a thousand benefits for magnesium in the human body , and yet Here , we present a fascinating collection of supporting quotes and states about magnesium that we 've researched from some of the top health books ever published .
Enjoy this collection -- and boost your magnesium intake !
The benefits of magnesium in treating heart disease include the well known decrease in ischemic heart disease and sudden death found in communities drinking hard water ( magnesium containing ) , powerful prevention of platelet clumping ( clot prevention ) known to be caused by magnesium , strong blood vessel dilating properties of magnesium , and effective action to block dangerous heart rhythms in persons taking magnesium .
The decrease in number of heart attacks probably resulted from the magnesium in Bufferin .
Magnesium calms the nerves .
As this mineral mediates digestive processes , a lack is associated with many eating - related problems , including vomiting , indigestion , cramps , flatulence , abdominal pain , and constipation .
When under stress , we use up much magnesium .
Chocolate cravings may be a sign of magnesium deficiency , because chocolate is high in magnesium .
Magnesium deficiency has been implicated in depression , diabetes , heart disease , migraines , and menopausal symptoms .
Natural sources of magnesium include dark , leafy vegetables , sea vegetables , and whole grains .
Since food processing refines out a very large portion of magnesium , most Americans are not getting the RDA of magnesium .
What is the result of this low dietary magnesium ?
Low levels of magnesium in the diet and our bodies increase susceptibility to a variety of diseases , including heart disease , high blood pressure , kidney stones , cancer , insomnia , PMS , and menstrual cramps .
Magnesium 's role in preventing heart disease and kidney stones is the most widely accepted .
Individuals dying suddenly of heart attacks have been shown to have very low levels of magnesium in their heart .
In addition , while inorganic magnesium salts often cause diarrhea at higher dosages , organic forms of magnesium generally do not .
In general , magnesium is very well tolerated .
Magnesium supplementation can sometimes cause a looser stool , particularly magnesium sulfate ( Epsom salts ) , hydroxide , or chloride .
Magnesium supplementation must be used with great care in patients with kidney disease or severe heart disease ( such as high - grade atrioventricular block ) .
If you are a heart patient concerned about magnesium , have your doctor monitor levels in your red blood cells , Dr. Sueta suggests .
" If your levels are low , you know for sure you 're low in magnesium .
And if your levels are borderline , you still are probably low in magnesium , " she says .
You can have normal levels of magnesium , however , and still be low enough to have magnesium deficiency - related heart problems , she adds .
If you have kidney problems or heart disease , it 's important to take magnesium supplements only under medical supervision .
Magnesium is abundant in foods such as wheat bran , almonds , and tofu , but most Americans do not get enough magnesium from food .
Magnesium is of particular importance to women , who often suffer magnesium deficiencies .
Postmenopausal women , who are especially likely to be low in magnesium , are more vulnerable to dangerous blood clots , which can lead to heart attacks and stroke .
In addition to increasing the risk of heart disease in women , low levels of magnesium contribute to another major health problem : osteoporosis .
Many patients with CHF have a magnesium deficiency .
The level of magnesium in the blood correlates with the ability of the heart muscle to manufacture enough energy to beat properly .
Many disorders of heart rhythm are related to an insufficient level of magnesium in the heart muscle .
CoQ10 is an important natural prescription for all types of heart disease .
Carnitine improves cardiac function in patients with congestive heart failure .
An alternative approach is to use magnesium supplements , because calcium and magnesium both compete for the same receptor sites in smooth muscle .
When calcium lands in those sites it induces spasm , but magnesium does n't .
If high enough levels of magnesium are maintained in the blood , the magnesium will land in those sites in place of the calcium and prevent the spasms in the same way that calcium blockers do .
This supports the idea that magnesium supplements can play a role in preventing heart disease .
Experts estimate that 25 percent of people with diabetes are low in the mineral magnesium .
The problem is even worse in those who have diabetes - related heart disease or a type of eye damage known as retinopathy .
Since low levels of magnesium have been linked to damage to the retinas , it 's likely that upping your intake of this mineral may help protect your eyes .
Good sources of magnesium include baked halibut , which contains 91 milligrams of magnesium per 3 - ounce serving , 23 percent of the DV .
Even in apparently healthy senior citizens , it is usually deficient .
Magnesium is especially important for men , because a deficiency can cause the arteries of the heart to spasm , resulting in a heart attack .
Epidemiological studies have shown that areas with low magnesium in the water supply have a higher incidence of heart disease .
Deficiency can occur from decreased intake of foods rich in magnesium , eating foods depleted of magnesium due to poor farming techniques , decreased absorption , and disorders and medications that impair magnesium absorption .
Some controversy exists over the calcium / magnesium ratio , and a few sources recommend equal amounts of calcium and magnesium or even twice as much magnesium as calcium .
I have often recommended twice as much calcium as magnesium , but I currently prefer using equal amounts of both .
I recommend up to twice as much magnesium as calcium for treating atherosclerosis , coronary heart disease , heart rhythm disturbances , spastic colon , nervous irritability , high blood pressure , and dry skin not helped by essential fatty acids or improved fat absorption .
Excess vitamin D may lead to magnesium deficiency .
Antibiotics , antidepressants , estrogen and heart drugs can all affect magnesium levels .
Diuretics are a major cause of magnesium deficiency .
Magnesium salts may decrease the absorption of other drugs taken at the same time such as digoxin , tetracycline , iron and phenytoin .
People with kidney problems and some heart diseases should not take large doses of magnesium .
Of the minerals inside the cell , all are vitally important , but magnesium has a role that permits perpetuity of function , and the lack of it will impact a cell 's efficiency and duration of its useful life .
Magnesium is involved in more than 300 enzymatic reactions concerning protein , starch , and fat metabolism .
Blood sugar regulation could benefit from additional availability of magnesium .
Magnesium deficiency in the body is a very serious unrecognized problem .
Hard water is a good source of magnesium .
People who drink hard water seem to be less prone to heart disease and irregular heartbeat .
Through the years the best information about magnesium has come from renowned magnesium researchers Dr. Mildred Seelig , and Dr. Jean Durlach .
Seelig has watched , observed and researched every phase of life affected by magnesium .
In this book we have written about magnesium 's effect on birth , life and aging , sexuality , menopause , osteoporosis , various illnesses , such as cancer , diabetes and heart disease prevention .
We have seen how easily many diseases can be cured or avoided when we bring sufficient attention to our magnesium needs .
With preeclampsia , pregnant women can develop convulsions , nausea , dizziness , and headaches ; in hospitals , this is treated with magnesium infusions .
Adequate levels of magnesium are essential for the heart muscle .
Those who die from heart attacks usually have very low magnesium but high calcium levels in their heart muscles .
Patients with coronary heart disease who had been treated with large amounts of magnesium had a better survival rate than patients who had received drugs .
We suspect that magnesium is another mineral that offers more benefits to health than realized by nutritionists , who 've long considered magnesium as essential to the nervous system .
It 's also a part of some key enzyme systems .
It 's possible , though , that magnesium has an important role in preventing heart disease .
Low levels of the mineral have been linked to higher risk of heart attack .
What 's more , magnesium is found in bone , raising concern that a healthy intake of the mineral may help in the war against osteoporosis , too .
In addition to preventing atherosclerosis , magnesium promotes dilation of blood vessels and improves the functioning of the heart muscle .
While taking extra magnesium by mouth may help prevent heart disease from developing , magnesium injections are usually necessary once the disease is already established .
Fortunately , intramuscular or intravenous magnesium therapy is of great benefit in many cases .
As early as 1958 , a South African physician reported that patients frequently responded to magnesium injections in a " dramatic and almost unbelievable manner . . . The widespread shortage of magnesium , not calcium , in the western diet is attributed to the high rates of sudden - death heart attack .
Adequate levels of magnesium are essential for the heart muscle .
Those who die from heart attacks have very low magnesium but high calcium levels in their heart muscles .
Patients with coronary heart disease who have been treated with large amounts of magnesium survived better than those with other drug treatments .
Magnesium dilates the arteries of the heart and lowers cholesterol and fat levels .
Chocolate contains large amounts of magnesium , and a craving for chocolate may be an indicator of a magnesium deficiency .
Magnesium by itself can cause diarrhea , so unless you are constipated , be sure to take it in a multivitamin , in combination with calcium , or in the form of magnesium glycinate , gluconate , or citrate .
You can take 300 to 400 mg of magnesium daily as a supplement .
Although the mechanism is unclear , magnesium supplements ( 430 mg per day ) lowered cholesterol in a South American study .
Others have reported that magnesium deficiency is associated with a low HDL cholesterol level .
Intravenous magnesium has reduced death following heart attacks in some , but not all , studies .
Though these outcomes would suggest that people with high cholesterol levels should take magnesium supplements , an isolated trial reported that people with a history of heart disease assigned to magnesium supplementation experienced an increased number of heart attacks .
Decreases in magnesium intake have been more prevalent in our American diet with additions of supplemental vitamin D and calcium , dietary phosphorus , and refined or processed carbohydrate foods .
Drinking soft water decreases magnesium intake , while diuretic drugs cause magnesium loss , as do alcohol , caffeine , and sugar .
Decreased blood and tissue levels of magnesium have been shown to be related to high blood pressure , kidney stones , heart disease and , particularly , heart attacks due to coronary artery spasm ( magnesium helps relax and dilate coronary arteries ) .

Holy city 's municipality planning new housing in four different Arab neighborhoods , says it is also destroying illegal structures
The Jerusalem Municipality is plowing ahead with plans for construction of more than 5,000 housing units in Arab neighborhoods .
These include the following :
A master plan for the Tel Adasa neighborhood in northern Jerusalem , where 2,000 new housing units are planned .
A master plan for the Arab a - Sawahara area for a new housing compound with 2,500 units that is currently being prepared for discussion at the local council and district council levels .
A master plan for the Dir el - Amud and Al - Muntar areas in Beit Safafa in southeastern Jerusalem , currently in advanced planning stages .
A construction plan for 172 housing units and public buildings at the Jabal Mukabar neighborhood , which has completed the mandatory waiting period and will soon come up for additional discussion and approval in the district council .
The municipality noted that it is also destroying illegal structures in the Arab sector .
Three buildings were demolished Wednesday : a structure , 90 square meters in size , that was built on public land in Isawiya ; a structure in Wadi Hilwah , also built on public land , sized 32 square meters ; and three temporary structures in Silwan that served as pens for sheep and horses .
All of the structures were razed after courts ordered them to be torn down .
Mayor Nir Barkat noted that the Jerusalem Municipality is acting to meet the demands of both Jewish and Arab residents for new housing on a basis of equality .
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama asked for a full review of how a Virginia couple vying for a spot in the cast of a reality - TV show was able to crash Tuesday 's state dinner for the prime minister of India , a White House official said Friday .
Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan issued a rare apology , saying the service took full responsibility for the episode and was " deeply concerned and embarrassed . "
White House aides added a new wrinkle Friday , saying the couple was photographed with Mr. Obama on the receiving line .
They also had their pictures taken with Vice President Joe Biden .
The Secret Service has not ruled out pursuing criminal charges against the couple , Michaele and Tareq Salahi , though it has not determined whether party - crashing is technically illegal , spokesman Jim Mackin said .
He could not think of a previous instance similar to the Salahis ' breach .
The couple was admitted to the White House grounds and the state reception without an invitation , but they were n't seated for the dinner .
In a market over - saturated with numbered titles , it becomes a natural expectation for series to fall into sophomore slumps and mindless retreads .
So much so that the rare superior sequel can sometimes garner more acclaim for failing to be as terrible as we foresaw .
Nonetheless , any numerated gem is cause for celebration , especially in a year as full of amazing continued properties as 2009 .
There has never been a better time to come with a number attached .
Nominees
Assassin ’s Creed II ( Ubisoft Montreal , Ubisoft )
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 ( Infinity Ward , Activision )
Killzone 2 ( Guerilla Games , Sony Computer Entertainment )
Need for Speed SHIFT ( Slightly Mad Studioes , Electronic Arts )
Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves ( Naughty Dog , Sony Computer Entertainment )
Winner : Killzone 2
While some may argue the overall quality of Killzone 2 compared to the other nominees , those that remember the original Killzone recall that there was a much larger gap for the sequel to leap to make it to the AAA status .
While not living up to its 2005 CG trailer , Guerilla Games came as close as conceivably possible , making one of the most visually stunning shooters on the market .
Coming packed with a punchier story and some heartily - DLC - supported multiplayer campaigns did n’t hurt either .
Killzone 2 ’s impressive triumph over its mediocre origins is more than enough to merit it ’s honorable discharge with this medal .
This week is the Gay - Straight Education Network 's ' Ally Week ' , an opportunity for schools and communities nationwide to encourage straight allies to speak out against anti-LGBT bullying and harassment , whether it be physical , verbal , or psychological .
Take GLSEN's Ally Week Pledge :
I believe all students , regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity / expression ,
deserve to feel safe and supported .
That means I pledge to :
1 . Not use anti-LGBT language and slurs ;
2. Intervene , if I safely can , in situations where other students are being harassed ;
3. Support efforts to end bullying and harassment .
Take the pledge online here .
What is an Ally ?
Often referred to as " straight allies , " allies generally are non-LGBT people who are committed to ending bias and discrimination against LGBT people .
While straight allies are an integral part of GLSEN's Ally Week , the term " ally " is more inclusive within the Safe Schools Movement to refer to anyone who supports ending anti-LGBT name - calling , bullying and harassment in schools .
For instance , a bisexual adult can be an ally to LGBT students , and a lesbian student can be an ally to a transgender student ( GLSEN ) .
Tools for Ally Week in your school and / or community :
I was stupid lucky enough this Friday to make the 400 + mile round journey up north to the Leeds International Film Festival for the day .
Given the length of the journey and the insane price of train tickets here in the UK that might seem a bit excessive to catch a couple of movies , but the festival ’s anime weekend was being kicked off by an unmissable double bill .
First off was Mamoru Oshii ’s lost , experimental classic Angel ’s Egg ( more on that to follow ) , being shown in the UK for the first time in over 20 years , but the real incentive for me was to see the UK premiere of Momoru Hosoda ’s latest blockbuster Summer Wars .
Hosada has already made big waves with his 2006 hit The Girl Who Leapt Through Time – the charming sci- fi comedy - drama that touched the hearts and imaginations of both critics and audiences and earned a place in my list of 10 anime films to see before you die – and as ever following up such a renowned piece of work is a tough challenge .
Set in an alternate 2010 , the film centers around 17 year old otaku Kenji Kosio , a socially inept maths genius , who spends most of his waking hours immersed in the virtual reality world
Oz , the ultimate convergence of communication technologies that has fused social networks , online games , telephone systems and just about every other form of internet related activity into a single , all encompassing interface .
Shocked one day to be invited by his unrequited crush Natsuki Shinohara to go and stay with her and her family in Nagano over the summer , Kenji nervously agrees , believing he is going to lend a helping hand with the grand celebrations for Natsuki ’s grandmother ’s 90th birthday .
Which is why he is even more shocked when he is introduced on arrival as Natsuki ’s fiancee , the girl wanting to assure her aging grandmother that she is happy .
While watching him clumsily take on the part we are also introduced to Natsuki ’s huge extended family in another fantastic display of Hosoda ’s ability to portray realistic , everyday characters with humanity and humour .
It was the hallmark of TGWLTT , and here Hosoda does it again with apparent ease and flourish , especially considering the scale of the cast he has chosen – I can’t remember another anime film that effortlessly portrays so many fleshed out , convincing characters without once resorting to easy stereotypes .
While certain archetypes have obviously been chosen – the insolent , black - sheep - of - the - family - uncle , the prissy aunt and the moody , reclusive video gaming teenager are all here – not once throughout the course of the story does Hosada leave you in any doubt that this are real people , with emotions and depth beyond their initial two - dimensional appearances .
Also as with The Girl Who Leapt Through Time , just when Hosoda has lulled you into believing it may be just another , all be it exquisitely crafted , romance tinged family comedy , he reminds you of Summer Wars ‘ science fiction roots .
On the first night at Natsuki ’s family home , as the embarrassed Kenji is trying to catch some sleep , he receives an anonymous text message inviting to him to solve a complex maths code .
Unable to resist the challenge he stays up till dawn trying to solve the puzzle , only to wake for breakfast – in one of the films most amusing sequences – and find himself the main story on the TV news .
It turns out that he has not only inadvertently helped someone hack Oz ’ highest level security systems , but also allowed them to frame him for it .
Suddenly Kenji has to not only convince Natsuki ’s family that he ’s not a cyber - terrorist , but also try to enlist their help in stopping the mysterious hacker before the damage to Oz has devastating consequences for the real world .
Summer
Wars is n’t a film heavy on subtext or philosophy , with its perhaps most obvious theme being modern society ’s over - reliance on technology , but elsewhere Hosoda seems to have something to say about the nature of families and relationships in the internet age .
To say it is about virtual communities versus real families would be an over simplification , and certainly he does n’t want to take sides – even while Kenji is envious of Natsuki ’s close knit clan , we are subtly reminded that family life is never perfect , and how non-biological bonds can often be the strongest .
It is tempting to see this as a response to Miyazaki ’s outspoken comments on the detrimental effects of the virtual world , especially in light of Hosada ’s short - lived career at Ghibli , but in reality the director is refusing to preach at all , the main message here being that strength and happiness lies in the bonds between individuals , and the nature of the connection – digital or analogue , blood or friendship – is ultimately immaterial .
Visually the film is as stunning as could have been hoped for after the subtle splendor of TGWLTT .
The character design is immaculate throughout , with Yoshiyuki Sadamoto again not resorting to generic or stereotyped work despite the unusually huge cast .
Similarly the background work is exquisite , and instantly reminiscent of the best of Makoto Shinkai ’s productions , and elsewhere TGWLTT ’s eye for subtle slapstick makes a welcome , occasional return .
However where the film really grabs the attention is in the depiction of the virtual world Oz .
Those that remember the brief , stylish CGI time leap sequences from Hosoda ’s last film will recognize the basic aesthetic feel , but here influences from video games , anime , consumer GUI and Japanese mascot design are drawn together to make a frenetic , futuristic but utterly believable environment populated by avatars that somehow look both cutting - edge and all - too familiar .
Perhaps the film ’s only weakness is its only briefly explored back story as to the identity of the mystery hacker .
I wo n’t reveal the answer here , but it ’s a cyberpunk standard familiar from everything from Neuromancer through Ghost in the Shell to Denno Coil – the later , incidentally being a work that Summer Wars seems to give a noticeable nod of acknowledgment to .
Both Madhouse productions seem to want to achieve the unlikely pairing of VR techno - thriller and Ghibli - esque family adventure , and while both succeed , there ’s no denying Summer Wars does it in a more big - budget blockbuster style .
And I mean that as a compliment ; while it may be louder and more colorful than the The Girl Who Leapt Through Time , at its heart still lies a similarly subtle , intelligent and touching film .
As such Summer Wars is a rare treat , and one you should enjoy as soon as you can .

CANNABIS CULTURE – A debate over legal marijuana has been raging in Denmark this summer because of an unpleasant gang war .
Denmark has had a liberal attitude towards cannabis since the 1970s .
The open sale of hashish and marijuana had long been tolerated in the famous Pusher Street in Christiania , a haven for hippies and anarchists allowed to exist in the middle of Copenhagen .
In its early years , Christiania had a conflict between users and sellers of hard and soft drugs , and the hard drugs were expelled from the village .
Only soft drugs were tolerated , a policy that has worked well for many years .
Since the conservative government chose to close down the open sale in 2004 , the cannabis market spread all over Copenhagen .
Cannabis quickly became even more available than before , and illegal coffeeshops , so called “ hash clubs ” opened everywhere .
Danish police have closed over 150 such clubs in Copenhagen .
In Odense , Denmark ’s third - largest city , they are still openly advertising their services .
With increasing clampdowns came increasing violence , and biker gangs were pitted against other gangs consisting mainly of immigrants .
Gangs performed visitations of random passerbys to check for rival gang members , and several liquidations and shootouts took place .
People were afraid to get caught in the crossfire , and the Danish police asked people to stop buying hashish .
That ’s when several danish politicians came up with a better idea : legalize it .
And do n’t do like the dutch and just legalize the retail outlets , but the whole chain , to take away the entire criminal market .
The Social Magistrate of Copenhagens city council , Mikkel Warming , suggested letting coffee shops sell hashish legally .
His proposal was not voted on , instead the city council voted to get concrete proposals on how it can be done , and continue debate after summer .
Ann -Sofie Von Bech of the Social Administration of Copenhagen came up with the requested report and recommendations on the 25th of May .
The report refers to the Beckley Foundation Cannabis Commission report in several places .
It can be read here , through Google Translate :
http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&hl=en&js=y&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kk.dk%2FeDoc%2FSocialudvalget%2F17-06-2009%252016.15.00%2FDagsorden%2F11-06-2009%252013.46.17%2F4599149.PDF&sl=da&tl=en&history_state0=
In short , the report concludes ( like Arnold Schwarzenegger ) that there are no examples of state controlled and regulated cannabis , but that it could nevertheless be an alternative to the current situation of illegality .
It admits that prohibition has not had an effect on use of cannabis or the criminality surrounding it .
Furthermore , the report recommends that the government , if they choose to legalize , put an eighteen year age limit on the drug , and that relevant information about harmful effects are distributed to users .
Advertising would be illegal , and the situation should be monitored closely .
Polls showed that 59 % of Denmark supports legalization , and a majority of the youth wings of the political parties support it as well ; however , the chances of it passing now are slim , as it would have to be approved by the Ministry of Justice .
The Minister of Justice has already made it clear that Copenhagen would not get this dispensation , but a majority of Copenhagen ’s politicians are taking this discussion seriously , and Warming says the “ idea is being kept alive ” .
Expect debate to continue soon , especially if the drug wars do not calm down in Copenhagen .
Washington ( CNN ) --
A beef recall is under way in a half - dozen states involving possibly contaminated products from the Oklahoma company National Steak and Poultry , according to the firm and federal inspectors .
U.S. Agriculture Department officials said a cluster of illnesses involving the E. coli bacteria was reported in Colorado , Iowa , Kansas , Michigan , South Dakota and Washington state .
The cases then were linked with beef the Owasso , Oklahoma , company produced in October , prompting the government to direct a Class I recall , indicating the highest risk of illness if the products are consumed .
On Thursday , National Steak and Poultry began a voluntary recall of 248,000 pounds of beef products marketed under its name as well as under names that include Carino 's Boneless Beef and Moe 's Beef Steak .
A consumer hotline at the company carries a recorded message noting " this is the first recall in our company 's nearly 30 - year history . "
National Steak and Poultry did not acknowledge any contamination in its beef processing or packaging facilities , but the recording said the firm " will err on the side of being cautious " with the recall .
A Drew County jury found Benjamin Briney not guilty of aggravated animal cruelty , following the admitted beating to death of a horse on August 1 , with a baseball bat .
This is Arkansas ’ first attempt at prosecuting someone under the new “ felony aggravated animal cruelty ” law that went into effect as of midnight on July 31 .
The death of this horse occurred approximately one hour later .
The background for Wednesday ’s trial began around mid-July , when it ’s owner loaned a Shetland pony to a family on Countryview Road , just south of Monticello , to be ridden at a child ’s birthday party .
On approximately July 22 , “ Cupid ” was reportedly attacked by another animal , causing severe injuries to the horse ’s head and ears .
The first witness called was Peggy Trantham , the horse ’s owner .
She told the court that after the horse was attacked on July 22 , a veterinarian checked the horse , and left an anti-biotic ( which was to be given to it daily ) .
Briney was at the scene and lived nearby , so she soon asked Briney to “ handle it ” , explaining that she meant for him to provide nursing type care and feed the horse for her .
On July 31 , the horse was again attacked by an animal , causing further damage .
Trantham , after further questioning , admitted that she did not call the veterinarian this time .
( It was explained that her son was having severe medical issues at the time . )
Testimony from Trantham , Briney , and another witness gave much different versions of who called whom , as well as when calls where made , and how many calls were attempted .
( The jury was told that this witness had a prior felony conviction , just for the record . )
Shortly after midnight on July 31 , which would now make it August 1 , the date of implementation of Arkansas ’ new “ felony aggravated animal cruelty law ” , Briney took the horse , which he described by him , as not able to stand by itself , into the woods .
Briney reportedly came out of the woods around 45 minutes later and told a friend of his ( the other witness ) that he had been “ told to put the horse down ” , “ I did it ” , “ I killed the horse ” , and “ I used a baseball bat . ”
The witness followed Briney back into the woods , where he told the court he saw the horse still alive .
He added that Briney then began jumping up and down on the pony ’s rib area , and then walked around to the front of the horse and said , “ I ’m sorry , Buddy , ” and proceeded to hit the wounded animal in the mouth and nose area with the bat .
The witness estimated to the courtroom that he saw Briney hit the dying pony around 40 times , as Briney “ hog- tied ” the horse to the tree , when the pony was trying to get up .
Briney ’s statement to Sheriff ’s Dept. Detective Rick Rausch said that there was only one blow with the baseball bat .
Briney admitted to the jury that there were three times he hit the horse with the bat .
The witness estimated 40 blows were made to the animal .
Six photos were presented to the jury showing at least six separate injuries to the horse ’s skull and jawbone , as well as the pony lying on the ground around the time of it ’s death .
~~~~~~~~~~
Peggy Trantham was recalled to the stand , and was questioned about her leaving the animal at the scene where the original attack occurred , the reason for calls made and not made to the veterinarian , and whether she tried to locate the horse ’s remains after she was informed about it ’s death .
She reportedly used phraes like “ handle it ” and “ take care of it ” to Briney , about the horse .
Briney told the jury her words were “ take care of it , go ahead and kill it , because she did n’t want to see it . ”
He then added , “ it was suffering because they had pressured me into killing the horse . ”
~~~~~~~~~~
Under the new law there were two questions facing the jury : “ Did he kill the horse ? ” and “ was it torture ? ”
It was admitted throughout the trial that Briney killed the horse , but the legal definition of torture , as presented in court , included the word “ knowingly ” .
Deputy prosecuting attorney Zach Vaughn told the jurors , “ It does n’t matter if he hit the horse 1 time , 3 times , or 40 times , it ’s still torture . ”
Defense attorney Chris Hayes told them , “ he believed the horse was suffering , and he acted in the only way he knew how to put the horse out of it ’s misery . ”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After 35 minutes of deliberation , the jury returned with a verdict of “ not guilty ” .
An annonymus member of the jury panel explained that there were three votes taken , with totals of 8 - 4 , 11 - 1 , then unamimous .
The jury ’s decision kept coming back to the word “ knowingly ” .
Based on how they felt Briney understood the situation .
Trantham ’s testimony seemed to leave other questions unanswered .
Also considered was that Briney had taken care of the horse for a length of time , before it ’s death , including feeding and medical care , which , to some extent , reflected positively upon him , in the eyes of the jury .
The giant iceberg spotted ... off the coast of Australia
Advertisement
Australia is known for sunny beaches , surfers , and blistering Outback heat .
So scientists were a bit taken aback when they spotted this giant iceberg floating near an island Down Under .
Australian Antarctic Division researchers were working on Macquarie Island when they first saw the iceberg last Thursday about about five miles off the island .
It is rare to see an iceberg floating so far north of Antarctica , researchers said .
Should that be there ?
A giant iceberg is seen off Macquarie Island which lies halfway between Antarctica and Australia .
Scientists say it is unusual to see one so far north
The iceberg was about five miles off the island , part of which can be seen in the foreground , when it was spotted last week
Macquarie Island is about halfway between Antarctica and Australia , some 930 miles from Tasmania .
The iceberg is about 160 ft ( 50 m ) high and 1,640 ft ( 500 m ) long .
It is probably part of one of several larger icebergs that broke off Antarctica 's Ross Ice Shelf between 2000 and 2002 , said Neal Young a glaciologist with AAD .
Several icebergs have been drifting slowly northward with the ocean current toward the island over the past year , but it is uncommon for them to move so far into warmer northern waters , he said .
The scientists believe the iceberg will break up and melt rapidly as it continues its journey north .
Before it melts , however , it could present a danger to ships navigating the region , Young said .
In 2000 , several massive icebergs broke off from Antarctica 's Ross Ice Shelf and the Ronne Ice Shelf .
The first iceberg was about 190 miles ( 300 kilometres ) long and 23 miles ( 37 kilometres ) wide .
Those icebergs are now drifting away from Antarctica .
Icebergs are formed as the ice shelf develops .
Snow falls on the ice sheet becomes compressed and forms more ice , which gradually flows outwards to the edges .
Eventually , pieces around the edge break off - forming the floating icebergs .
The unusual sight is likely to furnish evidence for both sides of the argument on global warming .
While some may say it is indicative of the world cooling others will say it shows the opposite and that the iceberg was created precisely because the planet is heating up .
Recent polls have shown that belief in global warming is waning .
Last month , Cardiff University found an increasing number of Britons are becoming more sceptical about climate change .
It found that 29 per cent believe the threat has been exaggerated - compared to just 15 per cent five years ago .
One in five are hardened sceptics who believe manmade global warming is a myth .
In the U.S. polls have shown that nearly half of Americans no longer believe in global warming .
Only 57 per cent of Americans agree that world temperatures are rising , while just one in three believes humans are causing climate change , the survey carried out by the Pew Research Centre based in Washington showed .
Adrift :
The journey taken by the iceberg
Andrew Kohut , director of the think tank , said : ' The priority given to environmental concerns and other issues is down because of the economy and the focus on other things . '
In some parts of Antarctica , ice sheets have been losing 30ft a year in thickness since 2003 , according to a paper published in the journal Nature in September .
Some of those areas are about a mile thick so still have plenty of ice to burn through .
But the drop in thickness is speeding up .
In parts of Antarctica , the yearly rate of thinning from 2003 to 2007 was 50 per cent higher than it was from 1995 to 2003 .
The more the ice melts , the more water surrounds and eats away at the remaining ice .
' To some extent it 's a runaway effect .
The question is how far will it run ? ' said Hamish Pritchard of the British Antarctic Survey .
' It 's more widespread than we previously thought . '
The study does not answer the crucial question of how much this worsening melt will add to projections of sea level rise from man-made global warming .
Some scientists have previously estimated that steady melting of the two ice sheets will add about 3 feet , maybe more , to sea levels by the end of the century .

BLACK FRIDAY
WEB SITES
MINNEAPOLIS --
Call it a pre-emptive strike .
Retailers once called in the lawyers when Black Friday ads got leaked prior to that day - after Thanksgiving shopping bonanza .
This year , many are n't bothering .
Instead , they 're releasing the ads themselves .
A dozen or more major retail chains made all or parts of their ads available Monday on Facebook pages , Web sites and through e-mails to their best customers , hoping to drum up some deal - busting excitement for consumers who still feel the tug of the recession .
" It 's sort of like , ' If you ca n't lick them , join them , ' " said Akshay Rao , marketing professor at the University of Minnesota .
Best Buy , Macy's , Toys " R " Us , JCPenney , Sears , Wal - Mart and Walgreens were among those rolling out their Black Friday promotions early .
Black Friday is a marketing term retailers use to signal the start of the holiday season that often turns retailers ' fortunes around , putting them " into the black . "
Toys " R " Us put prices on 120 items for fans of its Facebook page including Leapster learning game system for $ 29.99 ( normally $ 59.99 ) ; Furreal S'mores Pony $ 99 ( normally $ 250 ) ; Lego Indiana Jones set $ 42.59 ( normally $ 70 ) .
At Kohls.com shoppers can browse through 300 early - bird specials and add gifts to a printable wish list to bring into the store .
At Macys.com , consumers can share sale items on Facebook and Twitter .
For years , deep - pocket retailers battled Black Friday Web sites that shared leaked advertisements with impatient consumers .
Best Buy and Target Corp. were among the many retailers that routinely sent out cease - and - desist orders .
Last year , Michael Brim , founder and Webmaster of BFads.net , said he got such letters from half a dozen retailers , including Wal - Mart , Sears and Macy's .
This year , he heard only from Wal - Mart and Office Max .
Some stores , including Menards , Lowe's , Ace Hardware and Northern Tool Equipment joined hands with BFads.net , sending their finalized ads to the Web site .
" Some of the smaller stores and regional chains now want to use us as a promotional source , " said Brim , who will graduate this spring from California Polytechnic State University .
" Whereas in previous years , it was butting heads to get agreement . "
Indeed , there was little response a few weeks ago when Gottadeal.com revealed that Target 's Black Friday ads promoted $ 3 Chefmate kitchen appliances , including toasters , slow cookers and coffee makers .
Two years ago , Target Corp. said it considered the leaked ads a " serious infringement of intellectual property rights . "
The Black Friday sites often scan store circulars , resulting in ads that are unsightly at best or hard - to - read at worst .
Sometimes the ads are early versions that contain typos or prices that later change .
" The retailers probably assume , ' Well , it 's going to leak anyway so we might as well take advantage of it directly and then kind of control the conversation , ' " said Mike Allen , founder of Shopping - Bargains.com .
With retailers competing for every dollar they can grab , no one wants to get caught flat - footed by being late on a promotion .
" Typically , all would hold off , but if one of them defects , all consumers go and wait outside that store 's doors at 6 a.m. , " Rao said .
" From a game - theory standpoint , everybody says , ' What the heck .
Let 's just provide the information right now . '
The sale will kick in the day after Thanksgiving because of the tradition associated with that , but we 'll inform everybody now about the terms of the sale . "
Many retailers on Monday went beyond Black Friday and touted Thanksgiving Day specials that will last through Nov. 30 , also known as Cyber Monday .
Others started weeks ago .
Wal - Mart announced its 100 toys under $ 10 program on Sept. 30 .
Sears began running " Black Friday now " ads on Oct. 28 , promoting half - off Craftsman tool sets ( saving $ 200 ) and diamond stud earrings for $ 79.99 ( normally $ 259.99 ) .
Said Barry Boone , CEO of currentcodes.com : " A lot of the stores because they 're really scrambling to get those holiday sales , they 're sort of jumping the gun on their competitors to get some of these sales out there on the early side and try to get what they can ahead of the curve . "
CENTCOM commander General David Petraeus conceded again today that the war in Afghanistan will continue to “ get harder before it gets easier , ” a daunting prospect as the war has spiraled to record violence already , and the Taliban is taking growing control over much of the nation .
But as the war continues to worsen , Gen .
Petraeus does n’t want to hear any complaints , insisting that Congress should “ reserve judgement ” on the new strategy for at least a year .
The prospect that America will throw 30,000 more troops at Afghanistan and forget about for the next 12 months as the death toll continues to spiral seems unlikely , as President Obama ’s March escalation of 21,000 troops only lasted a few months before generals started hankering for another surge .
Gen Petraeus is just the latest in a growing chorus of military commanders conceding that the record violence of 2009 is going to give way to record violence in 2010 .
All seem to be keeping on message that the violence is going to eventually drop , but for the time being the effort seems mostly to stifle criticism of the rising casualties .
Tim Bray is spreading more misinformation about tail recursion .
He describes it this way :
It looks like a subroutine call , but in the case where it occurs as the last thing in the routine , it magically , silently , and automatically gets turned into , now how did I put it ?
“ A highly controlled and structured GOTO . ”
A tail - call is a subroutine call .
The efficient implementation does not magically transformed into something else ; if it does n't create a stack frame on such a call , it 's because one simply is n't relevant .
The essential observation behind the efficient - tail - call implementation ( not " optimization " — more on which in a moment ) is as follows :
For most programming languages , a stack frame is needed not for a subroutine call but only for an argument evaluation , that is , an evaluation whose result is temporary and needs further processing .
Calls in the middle of a procedure are " argument " evaluations , because their results need further processing .
It 's really the temporary , non-final natural of the result that forces us to do the book - keeping that remembers where to come back to .
Another confusion is between semantics and cost model :
Call me old - fashioned , but it just seems wrong when the semantics of two identical function invocations vary wildly as a function of whether there ’s an executable statement between the invocation and the function exit .
The semantics of the call does n't change ; the result and the side - effects are the same ( that 's what 's usually meant by " semantics " anyway ) .
The cost , on the other hand , might be quite different depending on whether a stack frame is needed .
Unfortunately , efficient tail recursion has often been described as a transparent " optimization , " so that it might or might not be efficient and the programmer can't tell in advance .
Efficient tail calls ( or space - consuming ones ) really should be part of the official " cost model " of the language , something that goes along with the semantics , as a peer to the semantics , in fact .
The cost model tells you how expensive you can expect things to be , but should be a little less binding than the semantics , since language implementors should have some freedom to do additional optimizations .
The idea that stack frames should correspond directly to the call structure is just odd .
Maybe we want to know the call structure at runtime ; in that case , we should capture that as debugging information , or as a reflection feature of the runtime system , but not as a core language design .
Let the language implementation use the stack as efficiently as possible !
To summarize :
Mr Curry is one of many MPs to face an inquiry into his expenses
The head of the Commons standards body has stepped down pending an inquiry into his own expenses - a few weeks after being appointed .
The Daily Telegraph alleged Tory MP David Curry claimed nearly £ 30,000 for a second home that his wife had barred him from using after he had an affair .
Mr Curry admitted the affair but said reports his wife had banned him from the home were " akin to Harry Potter " .
He said he used his cottage " to carry out my duties as a constituency MP " .
But he said he would refer himself to Parliament 's standards commissioner John Lyon and step down while he investigated .
Affair allegations Mr Lyon 's reports are passed to the Standards and Privileges Committee - of which Mr Curry was elected chairman last month - to recommend punishment , where necessary .
Mr Curry said he was willing to share any information with the Parliamentary commissioner , adding : " I am not expecting to end up in the Tower of London . "
I have had the house since 1987 , I have not bought it on a speculative whim
David Curry According to the Daily Telegraph , Mr Curry 's wife asked him not to use the cottage in his Skipton and Ripon constituency , in North Yorkshire , after she discovered five years ago that he had had an affair .
But challenged over the allegation , Mr Curry said : " That 's akin to Harry Potter .
I have stayed in it hundreds , if not thousands , of times .
" I have had the house since 1987 , I have not bought it on a speculative whim . "
The Daily Telegraph alleged that since 2004 Mr Curry had claimed £ 28,078 towards the cottage but usually stayed at a Travelodge when he was in his constituency .
Mr Curry told the newspaper he sometimes used the Travelodge because he represented a large constituency and it was sometimes more convenient .
He told the newspaper he had used the cottage " less intensively " in the past four years " because I preferred , if possible , to get back to my family home . "
Expenses furore
He also said it had been uninhabitable for seven months last year because of damage caused by damp and between 2006 and 2008 had often stayed with his father , who was terminally ill .
MPs ' use of their second homes allowance has been at the heart of the expenses scandal - the allowances system is set to be overhauled following a six - month inquiry .
Many
MPs have faced accusations they have made unreasonable claims under the old additional costs allowance , which allowed them to recoup up to £ 24,000 each a year for the costs of running a second home .
Several have referred their own cases to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards , who investigates complaints then refers his findings to MPs on the standards committee who decide what action to take .
In recent months , it has asked two former ministers , Jacqui Smith and Tony McNulty , to apologise to the House of Commons over their use of the controversial second homes allowance .
But Mr Lyon cleared Tory MP Alan Duncan and the standards committee had warned against MPs referring their own cases to the standards commissioner .
" Investigations of this kind cost public money and can divert resources away from other work .
We will not allow the commissioner 's office to be used by members simply as a means of refuting unfounded allegations that appear in the press , " the committee said .
Mr Curry , a former minister in the Major government , was first elected to Parliament in 1987 .

Legendary investors Jim Rogers and Marc Faber have similar outlooks on the financial crisis and the efforts of the Federal Reserve to revive the U.S. economy .
What do they think of the Fed 's quantitative easing policy ?
In a word , it is a recipe for disaster .
According to Rogers , governments have not addressed the underlying problems which triggered the crisis , but instead have " flooded the world with money . "
He argues that trying to solve the problem of too much consumption and too much debt with more consumption " defies belief , " and will result in epic failure .
Faber 's outlook echoes the sentiments of Mr. Rogers .
He says , " If we agree that excessive credit and excessive leverage led to the crisis , then what the Federal Reserve is doing is giving a wrong medicine to the patient — they are giving the drug addicts more drug instead of sending them to rehabilitation , which is not good for the economy .
So I think that the whole policy will eventually end in another disaster but we do n’t know when and many things can happen in between . "
So where do Faber and Rogers see opportunity ?
Well , both are extremely bullish on agricultural commodities and companies .
Rogers says that it will be farmers not bankers driving Ferraris in the coming decades .
Faber likens investing in agriculture to investing in oil in 2001 or 2002 .
If you are interested in a fairly simple and straightforward way to act on the advice of Rogers and Faber , the PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF ( NYSE : DBA ) tracks the price of corn , soybeans , sugar , and wheat .
Another way to take advantage of a surge in commodity prices in the coming years is to invest in managed futures or buy currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollars which are linked to the price of commodities .
This can also be done with ETFs .
The Australian Dollar Trust ETF is ticker symbol ( NYSE : FXA ) and the Canadian Dollar Trust ETF is ticker symbol ( NYSE : FXC ) .
We ’ve all pretty much had it up to our keesters with the brusque and dismissive treatment that commenters who do n’t agree with the RC world view get over there .
This is why many of us have simply given up trying , there ’s no point in attempting to have a relevant and open discussion there anymore .
It should be foremost on the minds of many that the RealClimate.org webserver domain is funded by Fenton Communications , an eco media group .
Further , our tax dollars pay the salaries of people like Dr. Gavin Schmidt of NASA GISS who has been ( according to several post and comment times noted ) using his taxpayer paid time at work to participate in that blog .
One of the missions of RC ( Actually most of the mission , as it was setup as a response to the McIntyre and McKitrick paper in E&E , ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT VOLUME 14 NUMBER 6 , November 1st 2003 ) is to counter skeptical arguments .
One of the ways they do this in to provide a list of people they disagree with , with links to rebuttals .
Long before RC went online , we have this 10/31/2003 email from Michael Mann , excerpt :
Lets let our supporters in higher places use our scientific response to push the broader case against MM .
So I look forward to peoples attempts to revise the first part in particular .
Steve McIntyre started ClimateAudit on 10/26/2004 .
Here is his very first blog post .
RealClimate.org was registered November 19th , 2004 – see the WHOIS screencap .
Today , while searching for something else , I found myself looking at this list .
It reads like a who ’s who of climate skeptics , but for one telling and glaring omission …
Here ’s the list at RCWiki done as a screencap below and to a PDF file , so that Gavin or Mike or some other team member can’t fix it fast and then claim I “ simply did n’t see it ” .
Steve McIntyre is missing .
Ross McKitrick is missing .
Why ?
Because Gavin and Mike and the other Team members know that M&M is right , and they do n’t want to draw any attention to it themselves , particularly now .
They do n’t want RC to have a discussion on the faulty dendro and dubious statistical issues that are fairly presented in peer review by M&M , even though there has been a concerted effort by Team members and associates to stifle publication of dissenting views .
RC and in particular Mann , do n’t want to focus on the data , statistical failures , or process , but instead on the “ stolen emails ” and how they “ do n’t change the conclusion ” .
It ’s spin cycle science .
A way RC might try to spin this omission would be to say that they do n’t consider the argument of M&M valid or prominent , but that wo n’t fly because they have dismissals listed there of arguments many lesser known skeptics , who have not published a peer reviewed paper , such as Lucy Skywalker .
That ’s nothing against you Lucy , just an example .
Inarguably , McIntyre and McKitrick are now the two most well known skeptics on the planet , and they are about to become even more well known with a Fox News special tonight .
Yet RC ’s world view of Climategate and M&M ’s vindication in the emails revealed is to say “ it does n’t matter ” , it does n’t change the conclusions of climate science . ”
Yeah right , just keep singing that tune .
What Climategate shows more than anything is that the climate science process has been corrupted by a few people with influence , and RC is the centerpiece for showcasing the Team consensus of that corruption .
UPDATE : I made chronology typo in the original posting , fixed within minutes thanks to many commenters who pointed it out .

LastThought ,
MERRY REDDITMAS !
I hope these gifts find you well !
It has been a pleasure stalking you .
Rest assured that your internet footprint was a very positive one .
In the end , I decided to give a taste of Lancaster county PA .
When we give gifts in my part of town it is almost always food ( 99 % ) .
And so I did n't think twice about this .
My girlfriend has subsequently pointed out that maybe homemade food from some strange dude on the internet ...
If you do have reservations about it , then do n't fret , my feelings wo n't be hurt .
If you do , I hope you enjoy it .
I have included peanutbutter fudge , which does include real peanutbutter , and mocha fudge , made with locally made Hershey 's Milk chocolate .
I hope you enjoy your holiday season , and thank you again for helping to make reddit the best place on the internet !

After troop deaths , British establishment rallies behind Afghan war
By Robert Stevens
7 November 2009
The killing of five British soldiers by an Afghan policeman on Tuesday has only served to highlight the British government ’s determination to remain in Afghanistan .
The five soldiers , three from the Grenadier Guards and two from the Royal Military Police , were killed by an Afghan police officer they had been “ mentoring ” in Helmand province .
The Afghan officer then escaped .
The killings were particularly devastating to the government , given that what passes for an exit strategy from Afghanistan is the plan to train Afghan army and police personnel to take over the role being played by US , British and European personnel .
In another setback , the killings coincided with an announcement by the United Nations that it was evacuating 600 of its 1,100 international employees in Afghanistan .
In the face of this deteriorating situation , the leaders of the three main parties , Labour , the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats , along with numerous columnists stepped forward to insist that there should be no retreat from Afghanistan .
Rather , they insisted , President Barack Obama should “ stop dithering ” and send more US troops .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown , in a speech Friday , reiterated that he will increase UK troop numbers by a further 500 to 9,500 .
“ We have made clear for some months that Britain accepts General McChrystal ’s recommendation to accelerate the expansion of the Afghan army to 134,000 by this time next year , ” he stated .
Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown acknowledged , “ We are not succeeding in this war ; we are failing at an accelerating rate . ”
But he did so in order to insist that the growing “ clamour ” for Britain to withdraw from Afghanistan could only be thwarted by “ a powerful defence of the war at home and a game - changing shift from the US . ”
This left one dissenting voice from a senior political figure .
Labour Member of Parliament Kim Howells wrote in the Guardian admitting that “ public support for our military involvement in that United Nations - led operation is diminishing ” and arguing , “ It 's time to pull out of Afghanistan and take the fight to Bin Laden in Britain . ”
Far from articulating popular hostility to the Afghan war , Howells was an ardent supporter of the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq .
From 2005 to 2008 he was a figure central to the execution of these wars as the former minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office .
His responsibilities included the Middle East , Afghanistan and South Asia , as well as counter - terrorism .
His present plan for an Afghan withdrawal is based on proposals that would constitute the establishment of a de-facto police state within the UK itself .
He wrote , “ It is time to ask whether the fight against those who are intent on murdering British citizens might better be served by diverting into the work of the UK Border Agency and our police and intelligence services much of the additional finance and resources swallowed up by the costs of maintaining British forces in Afghanistan .
“ It would be better , in other words , to bring home the great majority of our fighting men and women and concentrate on using the money saved to secure our own borders , gather intelligence on terrorist activities inside Britain , expand our intelligence operations abroad , co-operate with foreign intelligence services , and counter the propaganda of those who encourage terrorism . ”
Detailing what such a shift in policy would entail , he continued , “ Life inside the UK would have to change .
There would be more intrusive surveillance in certain communities , more police officers on the streets , more border officials at harbours and airports , more inspectors of vehicles and vessels entering the country , and a re-examination of arrangements that facilitate the ‘ free movement ’ of people and products across our frontiers with the rest of the EU . ”
Howells claims that “ these are my views , not those of any part of the British government or of any parliamentary committee . ”
Such disclaimers carry no weight .
He speaks as someone who is very close to the highest levels of the British intelligence and security services in MI5 and MI6 .
He is the chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee ( ISC ) , a highly secretive body that is supposed to oversee Britain ’s intelligence and security agencies , and a member of the Privy Council .
Howells ’ statement expresses the thinking of those whose voices have not yet been heard openly , but who are primarily concerned with the dangers faced by the ruling class of the emergence of mass popular opposition in Britain itself
In the first instance , this represents a concern over mass antiwar sentiment .
Howells has made previous criticisms of British strategy in Afghanistan , telling parliament in December , “ Forget the nonsense about being prepared to fight on the mountains and plains of Afghanistan for 30 years .
People will not accept the notion that British families should send their sons and daughters , grandsons and granddaughters to risk their lives fighting religious fanatics , tribal nationalists , corrupt warlords and heroin traffickers in one of the most godforsaken terrains on the face of the earth . ”
But Howells ’ concerns — and those of the security services — do not stop there .
His call for repressive measures within Britain can only be properly understood as a response to the emerging development of struggles by the working class against the onslaught on jobs , wages and living standards .
Howells is particularly acute in his reaction to such dangers because of his background in Stalinist politics and his past relations with the trade union bureaucracy .
He first became politically active as a student at the Hornsey College of Art where he participated in an occupation against the Vietnam War in 1968 .
He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and built a career first of all as an official of the National Union of Mineworkers in South Wales .
Howells came to national prominence through his efforts to undermine the year - long miners ’ strike of 1984 - 85 .
He maintained that the action was not valid , as a ballot for industrial action had not taken place .
During the strike , he called for an end to the conflict and for a return to work without a settlement .
In December 1984 , at the height of the bitter dispute , he pronounced that any struggle against the powers that be was futile .
“ The state is much better organised for taking on mass pickets than it was in the early 1970s , ” he said .
“ It is the hardest lesson any workforce has had to learn since 1926 .
The whole of the organised labour movement has to take a fresh look in future disputes . ”
The basis of Howells ’ provocative stance during the 1984 - 85 strike is still to be fully revealed .
But an indication of how close Howells has been for a long time to British intelligence is provided by a November 9 , 2008 , Daily Mail article , “ MI5 ’s watchdog Kim Howells was an art school anarchist ... trailed by the Spooks in his revolutionary student days . ”
The Mail reported that the MI5 files remain closed “ on Mr Howells ’s later role as an official of the National Union of Mineworkers during the Miners ’ Strike of 1984 - 5 . ”
Rejecting any perspective based on the previous reformist programme of Labour and the trade unions , Howells was one of the progenitors of New Labour and avidly supported the transformation of the Labour Party under Tony Blair into an avowed party of big business .
In 1996 , he called for the word socialism to be “ humanely phased out ” of Labour Party documents , and in 2003 said , “ New Labour is about running capitalism better than the Tories . ”
As with so many prominent Labour MPs , particularly fellow former Stalinists such as Jack Straw and Peter Mandelson , Howells ’ left background and knowledge is now deployed directly against the working class .
An avowed opponent of socialism , Howells and those sections of the establishment he represents have drawn the conclusion that financing a losing war in Afghanistan is a fundamental diversion from the pressing task of preparing for major struggle against the working class in Britain .
He is not an opponent of war , but the advocate of preparing for class war at home on behalf of the secret state .
This thought came to me as I was piloting the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle prototype around Dodger Stadium last Friday :
When gasoline - powered cars sleep at night , they dream of being electric .
Think about it : Every year , automotive engineers find new ways to smooth more rough edges off the conventional automobile .
For example , long gone are the rude jolts that used to accompany gear changes in automatic transmissions .
These have been ironed out either by continuously variable transmissions ( which have no stepped gear intervals ) or by sophisticated suites of computer programming that modulate engine torque at the precise moments of gear change .
Even set - to - kill sports cars like Ferraris and Lamborghinis and Porsches -- cars that used to wrench your neck like a Leavenworth hanging -- now shift gears with a kind of eerie , liquid transparency .
The only things that change are engine pitch and the needle on the tachometer .
This level of refinement , which is such a struggle to achieve in conventional cars , is a birthright of electric cars .
In the Leaf -- an all - electric , five - passenger car that will start hitting American streets in late 2010 -- you step on the accelerator and the car spools out velocity in one continuous , syrupy stream .
It ’s nothing short of elegant .
Once upon a time -- 10 years ago -- cars had such things as torque curves .
Which is to say that , because of the peculiarities ( the volumetric efficiency ) associated with different internal combustion engine designs , each model of car hit maximum torque at a particular rpm .
Cars with big American push - rod V8s under the hood typically had massive torque at lower rpm , and cars with multivalve overhead - cam fours and sixes hit peak torque at higher rpm .
Advertisement
These liabilities have been largely erased in the current generation of cars , thanks to computer - controlled throttles , variable valve timing and duration , forced induction and variable - geometry intake manifolds -- all of which help optimize the flow of gas in and out of an engine and establish a “ flat ” torque curve .
In the case of a BMW twin - turbo 3.0 - liter engine , for example , maximum torque comes at 1,400 rpm and does n’t start to go away until 5,000 rpm .
The BMW engine is , in other words , more like an electric motor .
In fact , an EV ’s motor produces maximum torque at 0 rpm and maintains consistent torque across most of its operating speed range .
That ’s what makes EVs such little hot rods -- loads of off - the - line quickness and mid-range punch .
During my all - too - brief drive , the Leaf prototype ( clad in Nissan Versa bodywork ) , with three people on board , shot across the stadium parking lot like it had been pinged with a BB gun .
Zero - to - 40 mph acceleration , I estimate , is in the mid-5 - second range , which would suit a decently sporty little car .
Arrayed around the Leaf chassis is 90 kilowatts worth of lithium - ion batteries driving an electric motor good for 106 horsepower and a healthy 207 pound - feet of torque .
According to Nissan , the Leaf ’s top speed is 90 mph and the nominal range is 100 miles .
One last tech - wonk example : Automakers are continuously evolving technology to help cars maintain traction and directional stability .
With conventional traction and stability systems , if wheel slip or vehicle yaw is detected , the computers will pulse the appropriate wheel ’s brake or retard engine timing or both , until the vehicle regains stability .
But this is a big , sloppy , coarse means of doing the job .
What ’s needed is a finer - grain method of modulating wheel speed without scrubbing off all the speed and momentum .
Advertisement
Electric motors are instantly and almost infinitely variable , and are vastly more articulate with regard to changes in traction .
This is why the Tesla Roadster , which can maintain almost 100 % traction at the rear wheels under acceleration , corners harder and faster than the Lotus Elise upon which it is based .
Imagine the potential road - holding power of an all - wheel - drive electric sports car , such as Audi ’s promised e-Tron .
Imagine what you could climb with an electric Jeep .
Here ’s my point :
As repeatedly underlined at the Nissan Leaf ’s U.S. debut last week , the future of EVs comes down to the question of consumer acceptance .
Will consumers buy them ?
Will they like them ?
What about battery leasing and recharging infrastructure , and carbon emissions ?
What about cost ?
These are reasonable questions .
But I predict consumer acceptance will ultimately be a nonissue .
Why ?
Because the trajectory of vehicle engineering has trained car buyers to expect their next car to be smoother , quieter , quicker , more high - tech , with better cabin isolation and more road - holding , than the one before .

Two decades of computerization of the automobile have created a kind of well - oiled semiautonomous being , half semiconductor , half metal and glass .
Many cars today have electric steering , electric brakes , virtual gauges , video camera mirrors , even virtual bumpers .
In other words , cars are nearly electrified already .
The next logical -- even inevitable -- step in the evolution of the automobile is when we jettison the big , heavy , hammering , noisy piece of reciprocation under the hood .
The Leaf is definitely Car 2.0 .
Sweet , glycerin smooth , techy , frisky and even a little bit beautiful .
It just feels like tomorrow .
Perhaps the question is not “ Will people buy them ? ” but “ Can we build enough ? ”

An international team of physicists working in the bottom of an old iron mine in Minnesota said Thursday that they might have registered the first faint hints of a ghostly sea of subatomic particles known as dark matter long thought to permeate the cosmos .
The particles showed as two tiny pulses of heat deposited over the course of two years in chunks of germanium and silicon that had been cooled to a temperature near absolute zero .
But , the scientists said , there was more than a 20 percent chance that the pulses were caused by fluctuations in the background radioactivity of their cavern , so the results were tantalizing , but not definitive .
Gordon Kane , a physicist from the University of Michigan , called the results “ inconclusive , sadly , ” adding , “ It seems likely it is dark matter detection , but no proof . ”
Dr. Kane said results from bigger and thus more sensitive experiments would be available in a couple of months .

NY church / state separation is a lie
by Jeremy Hooper
Want even more insight into the kinds of sentiments that 38 New York state Senators chose to support over civil fairness ?
Well check out the following .
This is the celebratory press release from the so - called New Yorkers For Constitutional Freedom , a group who NOM and others have cited as being a major player in the anti-equality lobbying .
Read along as two reverends tell you why , exactly , you are n't worthy of CIVIL marriage :
On December 2 , 2009 , the New York State Senate Democratic leadership brought same - sex marriage legislation to the Senate floor .
The legislation was soundly defeated by a vote of 24 to 38 .
New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms ( NYCF ) is thankful that the sustained , principled opposition to this bill culminated in a successful effort to block its passage .
Rev. Jason J. McGuire , Executive Director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms , said , “ Today ’s vote results from the efforts made by a bipartisan , multiracial alliance united in support of the proposition that marriage is not just about adult satisfaction or the whims of a special interest group — it ’s about kids .
The bottom line is that children do best when raised by their biological mother and father .
This bill would have encouraged and promoted the deliberate formation of households that deprive children of either a mom or a dad . ”
Rev. Duane Motley , Senior Lobbyist for New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms , made the following comments : “ It is gratifying to see that so many senators from both parties are listening to their constituents and taking heed to the many objections that have been raised regarding this bill .
The legislation placed freedom of religion and freedom of conscience in jeopardy .
New Yorkers ’ voices were heard today . ”
McGuire added , “ The authentic marriage movement in New York is a movement based on love and justice .
Our existing marriage laws are just .
They do not violate the Constitution , nor do they violate the civil rights of same - sex partners .
All people are created equal , but not all choices are equal and not all relationships are marriages .
We are pleased that today a majority of the senators recognized and upheld the true purpose of marriage . ”
Motley concluded , “ According to the Word of God , marriage is and always will be the union of a man and a woman .
Since God created marriage , only He has the authority to change it . ”
NYS Senate Soundly Defeats Same - Sex Marriage [ NYCF ]
Never mind that gay households have already been " deliberately formed , " and civil marriage equality would simply grant these tax - paying citizens the same rights as their heterosexual peers .
Never mind that the idea of civil marriage threatening religious freedom is an absolute lie propagated by these so - called " moral " types who should not be bearing false witness
Never mind that all recent polling shows that " New Yorkers ' voices " support marriage equality in majority numbers , and that the Senate vote breakdown is widely different from a poll released on the exact same day .
Never mind that marriage has been changed many times before , and at no point did God swoop down and give the okay .
Never mind that the kid argument is another abject lie , considering that ( a ) kids are not a requirement for any kind of marriage , and ( b ) many gay couples in New York state already have little ones .
None of these points should be minded at all , because they are all MINDLESS REDUCTIONS OF THIS CRUCIAL CIVIL RIGHTS CONVERSATION !
Yet 38 New York state Senators chose to sidle up to faith - based bigotry .
FOR SHAME !
Your thoughts
And the biggest never - mind is that NYS currently does recognize same - sex marriages that are performed elsewhere .
The , " Our existing marriage laws are just , " sounds like the lying liars are okay with same - sex marriage - yet they seem happy to crow about something that benefits no one , and only hurts others .

I do n't know why they are so celebratory .
From my impression , the LGBT community in New York is a very powerful community .
We 'll just get rid of the senators that voted against us and replace them with senators who will treat everyone equally , regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity .
I truly believe that those who did n't want this to come to a vote is because they are afraid of our community 's backlash against them .
They made their choice to vote against our equality and now we know what we must do in the coming elections .

" Bipartisan , multi-racial alliance . "
Oh , Jeremy , you called it last night .
@ Dick Mills : I thought it was kindness motivating them .
Obviously they think other states need the money from our weddings and related travel far more than we do .
@ Sam : I so hope you 're right .

My money is going to target specifically those Dems who voted no ( hear us , Monserrate ? ) , and also towards progressive candidates who can compete against some of those Republican nays .
It is time to have a representative body who believes in fairness and not " Sticking it to the governor " for political points !

Monserrate 's fate is all but sealed .

I love the line : " This bill would have encouraged and promoted the deliberate formation of households that deprive children of either a mom or a dad . "
Because , you know , it does nothing to address the formation of same - sex households outside of the protections and rights that marriage provides .
Of course , if those are n't deliberate , then we must be forming families accidentally , right ?
Right - wing idiots should n't be given access to press agencies .

Jeremy , A great post as always .
I followed up on your idea on my blog .
I am SO OVER one religious view being enshrined in the civil laws .
That Maggie Gallagher and others are enriching themselves in the process is even more disgusting .

Dodge Challenger police cars
Broward County 's Dodge Challenger police cars
Deputy Tom Sheridan of the Broward County Sheriff 's Regional Traffic Enforcement Unit , in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , sent photos of his departments 2009 Dodge Challenger R/T police cars .
These are used for a variety of roles including Aggressive Driving , Education , and Patrol .
The gray Challenger is used for aggressive driving enforcement , equipped with a front and rear radar system and Mopar Cold Air Intake system , for improved performance and gas mileage .
Their pursuit policy is strict but if it falls within their guidelines , then the Challengers are up to the task as they are equipped with lights and siren .
The marked Challenger is equipped with an in car camera system , Lo - Jack stolen vehicle tracking system , and a laptop monitor which is linked to their helicopter to receive live video feeds .
There are LEDs in the fog lights as well as the behind - the - grille , rooftop , and top - of - windshield strobes .
The interior photos showing the baton and yellow computer monitor is that of the marked Challenger .
The other interior shot is of the gray Challenger , note the radar antenna near the top of the window .
Note in the reverse light housing on the Dodge Challengers , the department has incorporated red and blue LEDs behind the clear DODGE lens .
In the shot showing the rear of the marked Challenger you can see them illuminated .
The Sheriff 's Office operates a large fleet consisting of legacy Crown Victorias and over 200 Dodge Chargers for patrol .
Sheriff Al Lamberti and Fleet Director Deputy Don Prichard were instrumental in acquiring the Challengers and forming their Multi-Agency Aggressive Driving Task Force , where the Challengers are widely used .
Deputy Tom Sheridan , who provided the information in this article , wrote , " I get stopped / flagged down all the time where people want to comment on how professional and sharp looking our vehicles are .
I have to say it goes hand in hand with the men and women that operate them .
My agency has some of the most dedicated men and women in law enforcement and our vehicles project that professionalism . "
Dodge Challenger fleet car from Group 1
Group 1 's Dallas Dodge Chrysler Jeep is now selling a customized special - service version of the Dodge Challenger with a retuned 400 horsepower Hemi engine that outpowers the factory Dodge Charger squads .
The 1 - 4 shift was deleted and the top speed was adjusted up to 165 mph , making it the fastest and most powerful police car available .
This package started within Dallas Dodge early in 2009 ; at that time Chrysler did n't offer any price concessions , or even the availability of ordering the Challenger for fleet / government sales .
With the new structure at Chrysler , and new senior manager Mitch Mitchell , Chrysler came forward with a small concession to order Challengers on the fleet / gov side .
Dallas Dodge 's Director of Government Sales , Bert D. Stull , said , " We started asking our customers what they would like to see in a 2 - door pursuit / traffic vehicle .
We had a wide variety of responses , as you can imagine .
Most was directed at speed combined with safety , and not much interest in overhead lights .
So we brought all that to the table , and then went with pricing structures and other requests so the vehicle would n't be priced out of the market .
" The vehicle that we stayed with was the R/ T Challenger with the customer selection of either automatic or standard transmissions , and package 27 F or M which moves the vehicle into more of a low profile tire / rim handling configuration .
Speed wise , we did n't deviate much from factory , other than optional small tuning configurations and top speed increase .
" We put all that together with a nice slick - top lighting package by Brooking industries , [ directional remote - controlled ] radar by Kustom signals , Digital Ally camera system , and a remote siren / light controller that is a remote type of operating system .
We have quoted over 18 units in a variety of color selections as well as different equipment .
Most of the input was from people that were just happy to see a car built that did n't have the same old ‘ let 's put a lightbar on the roof and call it a police car ' mentality . "
The setup includes black OEM wheels , a custom push - bumper , electronic shotgun lock , trunk tray , along with a custom LED light kit that displaces the traditional light bar .
By December 2009 , Stull had sold two of the 2010 Dodge Challenger DDSSV - 27 M cars , and has had numerous queries .
Dallas Dodge - Chryler - Jeep is the largest police car dealer in Texas , and the second largest in the nation ; they provide nationwide delivery , purchasing and COOP selections , in stock units around the year ( with over $ 500,000 of in - stock police equipment ) , and complete turn - key packages .

At the end of the Ice Age , The Machine came from outer space with the purpose to change men into mutants .
However , a hero defeated the device and a great seal was laid over The Machine .
In 2707 , the depleted world is ruled by four Corporations : Mishima , Bauhaus , Capitol and Imperial that are in a constant state of war .
During a battle between Capitol and Bauhaus , the great seal is broken and The Machine works again transforming soldiers and civilians into hordes of mutants .
A small part of the population escapes to Mars , leaving millions of people behind .
The man of faith and leader of an ancient brotherhood , Brother Samuel , is a believer in God and the Chronicles , a bible about the mutants from ancient times .
With the city besieged by the mutants , he visits the Corporations ' leader Constantine , asking for an aircraft and twenty men for a suicide mission to destroy The Machine , planting a bomb and a detonator following the knowledge of the Chronicles .
He recruits the tough Major '...

Sachin Tendulkar may have inspired others to write poetry but he batted in robust prose .
Not for him the tenderness and fragility of the poet , the excitement of a leaf fluttering in a gentle breeze .
No .
Tendulkar is about a plantation standing up to the typhoon , the skyscraper that stands tall , the cannon that booms .
Solid .
Robust .
Focused .
The last word is the key .
He loves the game deeply but without the eccentricities of the romantic .
There is a match to be won at all times .
But Tendulkar too was a sapling once .
And his brother Ajit sheltered him from the gale , kept him focused .
Sachin looked after his cricket , Ajit looked after Sachin .
Twenty - two years ago , I was asked by Sportsworld to do an article on this extraordinary schoolboy .
It was n't Sachin I had to speak to , it was Ajit .
When the time for the interview came , at Ramakant Achrekar 's net in Shivaji Park , Ajit was there with a cyclostyled copy of Sachin 's scores .
And Achrekar admonished me for spoiling his child , for fear that Sachin would get distracted .
The interview was done .
Sachin was neither overwhelmed nor garrulous ; indeed he was so limited with his words that you had to hold on to every one of them .
It was sent to Sportsworld in Calcutta by courier ( or was it just put into a normal post box ? ) and then came a request for two photographs .
Again it was Ajit who produced them .
When I got the cheque , I noticed they had paid me an extra 100 rupees for the photographs .
They were n't mine but Sportsworld had a policy of paying for them and so I wrote out a cheque to Ajit for Rs 100 .
It was acknowledged and accepted gratefully .
We lived in different times then !
It was also my first realisation that young men in the public eye needed to be sheltered so they could focus on playing cricket ; that they needed an elder brother , or an equivalent , to put a gentle hand on the shoulder and , occasionally , lay one the back side .
A lot of other young men today see Tendulkar 's runs , eye his wealth , but their brattishness comes in the way of noticing his work ethic .
For Tendulkar 's life is not the story of extraordinary ability but of an extraordinary work ethic .
Twelve years later , on a cold evening in Bristol , preparing for a World Cup game against Kenya the next day , I saw him in dark glasses , fiddling around with his kit .
Aimlessly , like he was searching for something to do .
At most times he would be bounding around with energy , bowling off 18 yards , taking catches , shouting thoughts to other batsmen .
I approached him hesitantly , I could n't see his eyes because they were shrouded by these huge dark glasses , probably the only time they were used to cover rather than to adorn , for he had just lost his father .
I asked him if he would talk to us about coming back to play .
He nodded his head and only briefly took the glasses off .
His eyes were red and swollen ; you could see he had been crying copiously .
For the interview he put them on , and once the camera had stopped rolling , admitted he did n't want to return , that his mind was all over the place , that he felt anchorless .
It was the only time he did n't want to play for India but he had been forced back by his family , aware that only cricket could help him overcome his grief .
When he got a hundred the next day and looked heavenwards , some other eyes were moist .
Even in his grief there was resolve , for he wanted that century .
It might only have been Kenya but he was battling himself , not the bowlers .
" It has been fantastic having a ringside view of this journey , watching a cricketer , and a person , grow .
But one thing has n't changed .
He still approaches every game like a child would a bar of chocolate , feeling happy and fortunate "
Four years later he agreed to do an interview for a series of programmes I was then doing .
Our producer thought we would make it special , and to our surprise and joy , Amitabh Bachchan agreed to introduce the programme .
In the first break Sachin whispered , " That was a beautiful surprise . "
Little did he know there was more to come .
Sometime earlier he had told me he was a big fan of Mark Knopfler and we thought it would be great if we could get the great Dire Straits man to talk to us .
" I 'm recording all night but immediately after that , before I fall asleep , " Knopfler said , and somehow we persuaded Sachin to do the programme in the afternoon rather than in the morning .
And when the moment came , we patched the line on and when I said , " Hello Mark , " Sachin looked puzzled .
A minute later his eyes lit up when he realised which Mark we had on the line .
And then he was like a child , tongue - tied , fidgety , excited - much like most people are when they first meet Tendulkar .
Even the stars can get starry - eyed !
And there have been moments of surprising candour .
When asked , as batsmen tend to be , which bowlers had troubled him the most , he smiled an almost embarrassed smile and said , " You wo n't believe this . "
When probed , he said , " Pedro Collins and Hansie Cronje . "
" In fact , " he said , " I once told my partner ' Will you please take Hansie for me ?
I do n't mind playing Allan Donald ' "
Tendulkar 's batting has been much chronicled over the years .
Indeed , I believe he has been the most analysed cricketer in the history of the game .
Yet he has found the urge , and indeed the solutions , to play on for 20 years .
Now that is a landmark to be celebrated , not the many inconsequential others that we exploit for our own need .
It has been fantastic having a ringside view of this journey , watching a cricketer , and a person , grow .
But one thing has n't changed .
He still approaches every game like a child would a bar of chocolate , feeling happy and fortunate .

We 're at a crucial moment in the fight against DRM .
This year -- thanks to the strength of the movement you 've built and been a part of -- we defeated DRM on music .
But DRM on books , games , and other digital media is a bigger threat than ever .
Meanwhile the Free Software Foundation , the organization behind Defective by Design , is engaged in a broader battle : fighting for our rights to control the technology we use by promoting free software .
The FSF is a member - supported nonprofit .
Please consider donating or becoming a member today .
Membership is $ 10 a month or $ 5 a month for students .
Free software is our best weapon against DRM .
When you use free software , no company can use your hardware to control you .
You 're free to share whatever you want with whoever you want .
And there are no artificial rules or restrictions : the only limit is our community 's imagination and ingenuity .
The FSF believes that anybody who does n't give you this freedom is doing something fundamentally wrong and needs to be stopped .
This conviction often pits us against some of the biggest companies and the most dominant ways of thinking in the technology business .
What gives us the independence to speak out -- and the power to make our voice heard -- is the support of our members .
You can also give a gift membership to a friend , or refer a friend to join -- and receive recognition .
The FSF can take on controversial campaigns like Defective by Design because it is n't built on the support of big companies and Silicon Valley CEOs : it 's built on the support of other activists like you .
If you believe that the technology we use should be free from arbitrary restrictions , the best way to put that into action is by becoming an FSF member .
The FSF is a 501 ( c ) 3 nonprofit , and donations are tax deductible in the US .
Thanks for your time , and thanks for all the work you 've done this year .
Keep reading below for some of the highlights of Defective by Design 's work this year .
We 're proud of it , and we 're proud of you !
Sincerely ,

Free Software Foundation / Defective by Design
P.S. Here are some highlights from Defective by Design 's work in 2009 :
2009 was the year that music DRM died .
But when Apple 's iTunes store went DRM - free on music , we celebrated the victory without buying the hype :
Apple still uses DRM on virtually everything else they sell ( movies , TV shows , games , audiobooks , applications , and of course hardware ) .
Ebooks and ebook readers took off this year , and so did the threat of DRM on books .
When Amazon deleted copies of George Orwell 's 1984 from hundreds of people 's ebook readers , we collected thousands of signatures from readers , authors , public intellectuals and librarians demanding an end to ebook DRM .
At the same time , we praised and promoted the work of authors and publishers who do the right thing and keep their books DRM - free , like Harlequin 's new publishing house Carina Press , or the hundreds of publishers who tagged their work " drmfree " .
Through all this , Defective by Design is proud to be the only voice saying loud and clear that there 's no such thing as " better " or " friendlier " DRM .
No matter how many devices it works on , or what " features " it includes to trick people into accepting it , DRM robs us of our basic rights and insults human curiosity -- it needs to go .
This work is critical .

PHILADELPHIA – Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine discovered that a dietary antioxidant found in such vegetables as broccoli and cauliflower protects cells from damage caused by chemicals generated during the body ’s inflammatory response to infection and injury .
The finding has implications for such inflammation - based disorders as cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , diabetes , heart disease , and neurodegeneration .
Through cell - culture studies and a synthesis of known antioxidant biochemistry , Zhe Lu , MD , PhD , Professor of Physiology , Yanping Xu , MD , PhD , Senior Research Investigator , and Szilvia Szép , PhD , postdoctoral researcher , showed that the antioxidant thiocyanate normally existing in the body protects lung cells from injuries caused by accumulations of hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite , the active ingredient in household bleach .
These potentially harmful chemicals are made by the body as a reaction to infection and injury .
In addition , thiocyanate also protects cells from hypochlorite produced in reactions involving MPO , an enzyme released from germ - fighting white blood cells during inflammation .
They published their finding this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Lu is also an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
“ Dr. Lu’s work throws new light on how the genetic defect underlying CF leads to the lung illnesses that are the leading cause of death , ” said Bert Shapiro , Ph.D. , who oversees membrane structure grants at the National Institutes of Health ’s National Institute of General Medical Sciences ( NIGMS ) .
“ His team ’s findings suggest that the lungs of people with the disease are more susceptible to the damaging effects of cellular oxidants .
While the idea is tantalizing and creative , further testing is needed to confirm it . ”
The research team demonstrated that in three additional cell types used to extend their ideas to other inflammation - related conditions – cardiovascular disease , neurodegeneration , and diabetes – thiocyanate at blood concentrations of at least 100 micromolar ( micromoles per liter ) greatly reduces the toxicity of MPO in cells , including those lining blood vessels .
Humans naturally derive thiocyanate from some vegetables and blood levels of thiocyanate in the general population vary from 10 to 140 micromolar .
This comparison raises the possibility , the authors point out , that without an adequate dietary supply of thiocyanate , hypochlorite produced by the body during inflammation would cause additional collateral damage to cells , thus worsening inflammatory diseases , and predisposing humans to diseases linked to MPO activity , including atherosclerosis .
Connection to CF
For over a decade Lu and colleagues have been exploring the inner workings of ion channels and how this knowledge relates to the pathology of such diseases as CF .
The CF disease originates from mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein , an ion channel protein in the cell membrane commonly thought to transport mainly chloride ions .
It has , however , remained a mystery why a defect in a chloride - transporting channel leads to cystic fibrosis , a disease with exaggerated inflammation in both the lungs and the digestive system .
Lung injuries inflicted by excessive inflammation and recurring infection cause about ninety percent of CF patients ’ symptoms and mortality .
Although known as a chloride channel , CFTR also conducts thiocyanate ions , important because , in several ways , they can limit potentially harmful accumulations of hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite , chemicals produced by the body to fight germs .
In CF patients , there is also a high incidence of diabetes , partly caused by damage to the pancreas .
Type 2 diabetes is also associated with higher levels of MPO in the blood .
The researchers found that the MPO - caused injuries to pancreas cells and endothelial cells used in their experiments can be greatly reduced by as little as 100 micromolar thiocyanate .
Their finding raises the possibility that MPO , in the absence of adequate thiocyanate , contributes to diabetes .
In the cell - based experiments , thiocyanate at concentrations below 100 micromolar did not eliminate hypochlorite accumulation and did not fully protect against MPO toxicity .
Conceivably , inadequate thiocyanate levels would aggravate MPO - produced injuries in patients suffering from inflammatory diseases , surmise the authors .
Links to Other Diseases
In other studies , MPO activity has been linked to lung cancers among smokers and also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases .
Intriguingly , people with congenital MPO deficiency are less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases .
The research team found that MPO - caused injuries to nerve cells , as well as to blood vessel - lining endothelial cells , can be greatly reduced by 100 micromolar thiocyanate .
Genetic defects in the CFTR predispose CF patients ’ lungs to excessive inflammation entangled with recurring lung infection .
Defective CFTR channels would be expected to result in lower thiocyanate concentrations in the affected regions within the respiratory , as well as the digestive systems , leaving tissues inadequately protected from accumulated hydrogen peroxide and overproduced hypochlorite .
Conceptually , delivering thiocyanate directly to the digestive and respiratory systems might be a therapy for CF disease , propose the researchers .
As for the general population , individuals with low blood levels of thiocyanate may be at risk for chronic injuries by MPO , predisposing them to inflammatory or inflammation - mediated diseases .
Many investigators have proposed developing drugs that specifically inhibit MPO - catalyzed hypochlorite production to combat these diseases , but natural thiocyanate not only decreases MPO - catalyzed formation of hypochlorite but also rapidly , once it is made , neutralizes it .
“ In light of the obvious implications of this protective action of thiocyanate against the cell - damaging effect of MPO activity with regard to both CF disease and general population health , my colleagues and I will vigorously investigate the potential health benefit of thiocyanate , ” says Lu .
He emphasizes though , “ until the research community acquires a better understanding of both positive and negative impacts of thiocyanate on human health , it would be unwise for anyone to self - administer thiocyanate because like many other chemicals , thiocyanate has adverse side effects at improper doses and / or under inappropriate conditions . ”
The research was funded by NIGMS and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
Around ten years ago I learned to program in Lisp , Common Lisp to be more precise .
And since then I believe I never actually learned a new language that impressed me , and excited me , so much as was the experience of learning Lisp .
Well , yesterday I started to learn more seriously Haskell .
For quite some time my interest in the language has been increasing .
From several blogs posts , comments and discussions on the web , it is almost impossible not to be curious .
Yes , I ’ve heard of Haskell for a very long time but it seems the buzz on my ears raised a lot recently .
And so , I ’ve decided to take a look .
In the worst case scenario , it would a be just a few hours of playing around with a new language .
Up until now , I did n’t do much .
Installed the Haskell platform , haskell - mode in Emacs ( although I ended up using Vim too to code ) and searched for some basic tutorial .
My starting choice is “ Learn You a Haskell for Great Good ! ” .
It looks nice .
Seems suitable for a beginner and starts in a simple way .
The first real chapter is the second one , which I just did yesterday .
I was very impressed with it .
And perhaps more important , very happy with the experience .
To be honest , I do n’t remember a similar feeling with other languages … except Lisp !
Although this “ Starting Out ” chapter introduces just some very basic Haskell stuff , it is already a lot to feel the language and the potential of it .
The last example was very cool .
Suppose you want to find the right triangle that has integers equal or smaller than 10 for all sides and has a perimeter of 24 .
With tuples , list comprehensions it ’s just a matter of writing :
[ ( a , b , c ) | c <- [ 1..10 ] , b <- [ 1..c ] , a <- [ 1..b ] , a ^2 + b^2 == c^2 , a + b + c == 24 ]
Simple , concise and very neat !
I still did n’t do anything proper with Haskell .
I am just in the very very very beginning but it looks promising .
I could be wrong about it sure , but the feeling is nice .
Also , recently , I started to take a look at Clojure , another Lisp .
I had some hopes that would be a very nice experience .
Unfortunately , it was not .
For some reason , I am unable to appreciate the “ beauty ” of a JVM language .
But let ’s see how Haskell will fare when I start to try it with the kind of stuff I ’m interested in .
When a woman who filmed her sister 's birthday party and minutes of a movie was arrested recently , it showed how far MPAA brainwashing had spread .
Theater managers , knowing full well that the lady faced three years in jail , insisted on pressing charges .
Today , prosecutors threw out the case against her .
On 2nd November , 22 year - old Samantha Tumpach was out with family celebrating her sister ’s 29th birthday .
Like many , they chose a movie theater for the happy occasion , specifically the Muvico Theater in Rosemont , United States .
Watching ‘ Twilight : New Moon ’ would be an experience she ’d never forget .
Camera in hand , Tumpach took pictures of her family before the movie began and recorded her relatives singing “ Happy Birthday ” .
She also turned the camera towards the big screen , snagging small portions of adverts , previews and short sections of the movie – 4 minutes in all – accompanied by her own amateur voice - over .
Then a theater robot worker saw what was going on , immediately recalled their MPAA programming and decided that evil had been done .
Tumpach was taken to theater managers who identified her as a professional and criminal pirate .
Eventually she was handed over to the police who sympathized with her situation .
“ They were so nice to me , ” Tumpach said .
Despite this , the managers insisted on pressing charges .
Tumpach spent two nights in jail , charged with criminally recording a motion picture , before being released pending a court appearance .
“ We were just messing around , ” she said .
“ Everyone is so surprised it got this far . ”
Hearing of her plight , Tumpach received support from an unlikely corner – Twilight : New Moon director Chris Weitz .
“ Needless to say , the case seems to me terribly unfair and I would like to do what I can to address this , ” Weitz wrote in an email .
Whether or not this pressure made any difference is unclear , but Tumpach left a courtroom a free woman today , the charge against her dismissed after prosecutors decided not to pursue the case .
“ She ’s traumatized by this , ” said her attorney Dominick Dolci .
“ This is the worst event of her life and she wants to put it behind her . ”
Her other attorney , Howard Kavenow , added : “ This was nothing more than a birthday party where photos were being taken .
It ’s nonsense . ”
Samantha Tumpach will not now face three years in jail , no thanks to the heartless and completely idiotic theater managers who tried to ruin her life .

The 1967 Piaggio Vespa 150cc VBC Super and 1973 Honda City 50 cc
Chaly were bought for less than 15 million Vietnamese Dong ( VND ) ( £ 500 ) and were sold for £ 2,530 and £ 1,955 respectively .
The Vespa was the preferred ride of Jeremy Clarkson , whilst the rather incongruous Stars ‘ n’ Stripes Honda Chaly , that continuously played Bruce Springsteen ’s Born in the USA , was intended as a punishment for those whose motorbike was afflicted by repeated breakdowns .
Both machines were bought by the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu , as a contribution to their Top Gear exhibition .

In many ways , the folks who say we a have lots of oil are correct .
All one has to do is include the oil which is extremely expensive and slow to extract .
Much of the cheap , easy - to - extract oil has already been removed .
There is a huge amount of oil which theoretically can be extracted , but the question is whether the cost will be cheap enough for us to be able to afford to extract it .
If the oil is too expensive to extract , the shortage of oil seems to cause a recession , similar to what we are having now .
I discuss this in purely monetary terms , but it is also an issue with respect to low energy return on investment ( EROI ) , for those of you used to thinking in EROI terms .
What economic theory really says is that oil prices will rise , and substitutes will be found , which will tend to bring prices back down .
When oil prices rose , we found substitutes , but they were poor substitutes .
They are more generally more expensive , when all of the costs are included .
Biofuels interfered with food supply ; wind is a substitute for natural gas and coal in electricity production , but it is not as a transportation fuel , which is one of the things that we specifically expect to be short of .
In the above slide , I purposely exaggerated the impact of an oil price rise on food and gasoline .
The effect would be greatest on a low income individual .
It would also be very great , if the price rise were to something like $ 400 barrel .
This is pretty obvious , if you think about it .
Does it sound like anything we have run into in the last few years ?
Many people think of the effects of peak oil as a future event .
But we are really experiencing them here and now .
Oil production stopped rising in 2005 , so by 2006 , we were feeling the effects of the squeeze .
The effects were being felt as early as 2004 , when oil prices began to rise .
I have omitted several slides , showing the rise and fall of oil production in the US 48 states , Alaska , and the North Sea .
At this point , most of the fields that are in easy to access locations are in decline , and we are " stuck " with what is left -- the slow to extract , expensive oil from difficult locations .
So many people have equated high prices with oil shortages , that people have come to believe that if prices are low ( or at least relatively low , compared to last years ' prices ) , everything is OK .
But we really need lots of quite inexpensive oil to fuel the economy , or it goes into a recession .
Reduced credit reduces demand , and has the effect of bringing oil prices down .
In the above slide , the cutback in credit is especially important .
Without credit , many people cannot buy new cars , new houses , or expensive Christmas presents .
All of these use oil in their manufacture and distribution , and keep oil prices up .
US consumer credit ( including things like credit card loans and auto loans ) peaked the same month as oil prices .
Mortgage loans peaked about the same time , and many types of commercial credit have been affected .
The government has tried to pick up the slack with additional borrowing , but this is not the same .
The EIA indicates that on a constant dollar basis , energy expenditures more than doubled between 1990 and 2008 .
Going forward , the EIA sees more increases in energy expenditures , on an inflation adjusted basis .
I might mention that one of the major uses of new technology is to bring down prices .
There are limits to what can be done -- if oil is very deep in the ocean , it is likely never going to be cheap to extract .
The need for new technology to bring down prices is probably as great or greater with fossil fuels as it is with things like wind , solar , and biofuels .
Fossil fuels are at least well adapted to running our current infrastructure .
Anything that is very different will require huge expenditures for conversion .
In my view , the big question mark is how debt ( and financial institutions ) will do .
The front page story on today 's Atlanta Journal Constitution is " Troubled banks find it hard to stay afloat " .
How long will bailing out failing banks with printed money work ?
The growing gap is the concern .
Regardless of whether oil production remains flat , or declines fairly steeply , we have a major problem .
With many people from around the world interested in using oil products , and many new cars in places like China and India , the gap between production and what we would normally consume ( if prices were low and credit were available ) is likely to continue to grow , even if somehow oil production could be kept flat .
In the recent past , the advanced economies have been able to " offshore " their energy intensive industries to places like China , giving the illusion that countries can get along with only non-energy intensive services like finance .
But for the world as a whole , there seems to be a close relationship between growth in oil consumption and GDP growth .
Since finance and some other services do n't need much oil to grow , the relationship is not exactly 1:1 .
Efficiency growth would also tend to raise make GDP growth higher ( but declining EROI would tend to lower it ) .
My big concern is international trade .
If debt defaults are a problem , this could interfere with the workings of the whole system , especially if it leads to major countries ( perhaps Greece ) defaulting on their debts .
In the years since fossil fuel use has developed , world population has greatly expanded .
We are already seeing problems with people in some of the poorer nations having adequate food .
Even in the US , there are people at the margins who are " food insecure " .
Currently , there are government programs to help , but states are finding it increasingly necessary to cut back , because of falling tax revenue .
It would be a lot easier to get politicians to talk about the situation if there were a good solution in sight .
There are some partial mitigations , but they likely do n't get us back to " business as usual " .
Voters are likely to be very unreceptive to such news .

# 11 : bygge Online innflytelse Stephanie Sammons jeg har en enkel og snakker om deg hvis du ikke gjør det samme for dem .
Since the credit crunch , middle - class shopping habits have changed .
Their preferences have remained broadly similar , it 's just they no longer like to pay for things – and are now shoplifting to " keep up appearances " , according to one report .
The great , sprawling iniquity of the way we look at crime is right there in the headline .
You never hear about a blue collar criminal doing it to " keep up appearances " .
You never hear about working - class crime at all , in fact , in terms of why they might be doing it – only that they do it relentlessly , being louts and scofflaws .
I have a friend who , in the middle of the last recession , used to steal by buying a Guardian on his way into the supermarket , laying it flat at the bottom of the trolley and slipping cheese into it .
It was an imperfect dinner party solution , in my view , since the cheese had to be flat and relatively odourless .
It basically had to be gruyère .
But the principle – that the middle classes do n't steal – worked .
Nobody would ever look inside a Guardian for cheese , and nobody ever did .
At the level of shoplifting , I would say this fallacious assumption of middle - class honesty is no more than a curiosity .
The victim is a shop , the misdemeanour is pretty minor and who really cares ?
These perceptions do n't stop , however , at the doors of Waitrose .
Research earlier this year conducted by the Fabian Society and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation asked people to estimate the social cost of benefit fraud relative to that of tax evasion – and their answers misfired by an order of magnitude that was laughable .
The majority thought benefit cheats cost more than tax evaders ; in fact benefit fraud is estimated by the Department for Work and Pensions to cost £ 800 m a year , while personal tax avoidance was thought to be running at £ 13 bn .
This misconception is more troubling than assumptions about middle - class honesty : if the taxpayer is thought to be broadly honest , while society 's net recipients are all crooks , then clearly that will have an impact on our readiness to pay tax and support even the most modest redistribution .
All that is nothing , however , compared with the legal system and how it has evolved to reflect , endorse and perpetuate our most idiotic prejudices , as demonstrated by Radio 4's Thinking Allowed .
This is now in the middle of a brilliant series ( the final programme is next Wednesday at 4 pm ) on white - collar crime spurred , according to the producer , Charlie Taylor , by various factors , including the banking crisis and MPs ' expenses .
The reach of the programme 's findings is staggering , from the sheer scale of white - collar crime to the under - resourcing of fraud squads – in favour of investigations into crimes whose significance and social cost do n't even come close .
There is a tendency to think of middle - class crime ( if you will admit to its existence in the first place ) as victimless , since the targets tend to be corporations .
But of course the proceeds do n't exist in a vacuum ; they exist as individuals ' pensions , so white - collar crime is morally no different to a bloodless mugging in an alley .
But there is also the tendency to think of this sort of wrongdoing as lacking any violent aspect .
Taylor stresses that corporate crime can and does manifest itself in workplace fatalities – in numbers far greater than those that are reported .
He makes this additional point : " There 's a different law when it comes to white - collar crime : it 's much harder to detect , much harder to mount a prosecution , much harder to convict ; and if they are convicted they have much shorter sentences in much nicer prisons .
They get let out earlier , they get tagged , they only serve a third of their sentence inside .
They 're deemed not to be recidivists , and thought not to be dangerous .
" You can understand this , there 's some argument for it .
But their social position was taken into account when they were sentenced in the first place , the judge is likely to take a loss of reputation into account .
To us that seems to undervalue working - class lives .
Just because somebody 's a steelworker , it does n't mean that if they get caught stealing , that is n't as much of a shock to their communities as with someone who works in an office . "
It starts with a little light bigotry , a world in which the well - spoken do n't lie , in which a Guardian reader can steal gruyère without getting caught ; and it ends with a legal system that is n't just two - tiered , but bears down with its full weight on blue - collar crime , and will prosecute a bent accountant only grudgingly , as an afterthought .
It 's easy , it 's often a bit funny , it 's egregious , this assumption of honesty as a matter of breeding ; but it is also particularly worth revisiting , re-evaluating , and then ripping up – now , while we are in the eye of so many conversations that hinge upon it .
From regulation in the City and the perks of parliamentarians to the future of benefits and tax in the coming lean years – not to mention the fact that fraud is already on the rise and is expected by City analysts to treble during this recession – all these issues will be better resolved if we recast these bankers and solicitors , these trusted professionals , as just hoodies with good jobs .
Stop giving them the benefit of the doubt .
Ban them from the Bluewater of your heart .

D.C. Council vs. the Catholic Church
The D.C. Council is considering a law forbidding discrimination against those in gay marriages .
The law would apply to all groups that have contracts with the District , including Catholic Charities , one of the city 's largest social services providers .
The Archdiocese of Washington says that because of the Church 's opposition to same - sex marriage , it would have to suspend its social services to the poor , the homeless and others rather than provide employee benefits to same - sex married couples or allow them to adopt .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Senator Bernie Sanders said on Sunday he will not vote to reconfirm Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve , in a preview of the rough treatment Bernanke may get this week on Capitol Hill .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The central bank chief will testify on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee at a hearing on his nomination to a second four - year term .
The session could be difficult , with the Fed under fire from across the political spectrum .
The open opposition of Sanders , an independent outside the political mainstream , is unlikely alone to derail Bernanke ’s renomination .
But it reflects the Fed ’s challenges .
“ I absolutely will not vote for Mr. Bernanke .
He is part of the problem , ” Sanders said on ABC ’s “ This Week ” TV program .
Bernanke “ did n’t ... do anything to prevent us from sinking into this disaster that Wall Street caused and which he was a part of , ” Sanders said , referring to last year ’s severe financial crisis and the deep recession that followed .
Under Bernanke ’s leadership , the Fed has greatly expanded its role in the economy , moving beyond its core monetary policy function to financing emergency bailouts of major financial firms in an attempt to stem the capital markets crisis .
Along the way , the Fed has drawn sharp criticism from skeptical lawmakers , some of whom are now moving to check the Fed ’s power and expose its decisions to greater scrutiny .
In a more tempered assessment of Bernanke ’s record , Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told the ABC that the Fed chief has done a good job and has made bold decisions “ that kept the economy from going into a depression . ”
But , he added , “ We need more transparency and accountability ...
The Fed needs to be looked at closely . ”
In an unusual move , Bernanke on Friday spoke out in a column in The Washington Post against attempts to strip the Fed of some of its regulatory responsibilities and to expose it to audits by a congressional watchdog .
Such steps would “ impair the prospects for economic and financial stability in the United States , ” he said .
A proposal to audit the Fed ’s monetary policy deliberations won a committee vote earlier this month over the objections of House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd is the author of a proposal to consign the Fed solely to making decisions about setting benchmark interest rates , stripping it of bank supervision and consumer protection duties .
Frank has said the audit provision in the House is likely to be revisited as legislation comes up for floor action .
Dodd has said his proposal is a starting point for debate .
More than 100 rambunctious teens turned the Westfield Trumbull into a giant mosh pit Saturday night , according to police .
Two teens were ultimately arrested for returning to the mall after being thrown out by security for allegedly bothering customers .
The fight erupted at a bus stop outside the shopping center , said police , and ultimately grew to include more than 100 young people .
Trumbull police say they had to call in Bridgeport and state police officers for backup and were forced to use a stun gun on a 17 - year - old who allegedly charged at and knocked down an officer .
The names of the two teens who were arrested were not released because of their ages .
They were charged with breach of peace and interfering with police .
The FSF is putting together a Community Team of supporters to spread the free software philosophy in blogs , online press , and through social networking sites .
If you spend some time each day reading popular blogs or mainstream press and you have a good handle on the debate around software freedom , this could be a great opportunity .
As part of the FSF Community team , you 'll be doing things like :
Responding to questions and points about free software in online media .
Working with the FSF campaigns team to respond to big news stories that impact software freedom , or stories that are chances for people to understand why free software matters .
Making sure that important stories , about topics like fully free GNU / Linux distributions , DRM , or the dangers of " cloud computing , " get as much attention as possible in the media and the widest possible reach through social networking sites .
Just to be clear , the goal here is not to get into long , drawn out flame - wars :) .
Rather , this will be an organized and respectful approach to raising awareness of free software 's importance .

There has been much news of late about space – from NASA bombing the moon to discoveries on Mars .
I am fascinating by outer space and the images we are receiving daily from our outer space vessels seems to be getting better and better .
For that reason it seemed appropriate to create a second list of stunning images of space .
Here is the original list for those interested .
As usual , click the image for a larger view .
10 Saturn from Cassini
This stunning image of Saturn was captured by the incredible Cassini spacecraft in 2006 as it passed behind the ringed gas giant in the 9th year of its mission .
Even more incredible it that the pale - blue dot of the Earth can be seen in this image just above and to the left of the bright , main rings .

9 Crab Pulsar
The Crab Pulsar , a city - sized , magnetized neutron star spinning 30 times a second , lies at the center of this remarkable image from the orbiting Chandra Observatory .
The deep x-ray image gives the first clear view of the convoluted boundaries of the Crab ’s pulsar wind nebula .
Like a cosmic dynamo the pulsar powers the x-ray emission .
With more mass than the Sun and the density of an atomic nucleus , the spinning pulsar itself is the collapsed core of a massive star .
The stellar core collapse resulted in a supernova explosion that was witnessed in the year 1054 .

7 Eta Carinae
Eta Carinae is a stellar system in the constellation Carina , about 7,500 to 8,000 light - years from the Sun .
The system contains at least two stars , one of which is a luminous blue variable star .
Its combined luminosity is about four million times that of the Sun and has an estimated system mass in excess of 100 solar masses .
6 Mercury Flyby
This dramatic NAC image was acquired about 56 minutes prior to MESSENGER ’s closest approach during the mission ’s October 6 , 2008 Mercury flyby .
You almost feel like you could reach out and touch it .

Evidence indicates that IC 4406 is likely a hollow cylinder , with its square appearance the result of our vantage point in viewing the cylinder from the side .
Were IC 4406 viewed from the top , it would likely look similar to the Ring Nebula .

NGC 290 is an open cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud , which is located in the constellation Tucana .
The photogenic cluster , pictured above , was captured recently by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope .
Open clusters of stars are younger , contain few stars , and contain a much higher fraction of blue stars than do globular clusters of stars .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Karen Cordova , a 17 - year - old high school student and part - time supermarket cashier , admits she sometimes texts friends while driving home from work late at night , lonely and bored .

The Arizona teenager knows it ’s illegal in Phoenix and dangerous .
She once almost drifted into oncoming traffic while looking at her phone .
But would a nationwide ban stop Cordova and her friends from texting in their cars ?
No way , she said .
“ Nobody is going to listen , ” Cordova said .
With momentum building in Washington for all 50 U.S. states to outlaw text messaging behind the wheel , there is evidence that the key demographic targeted by such legislation , teen drivers , will not pay much attention .
At least one major study has found that , with mobile devices now central to their lives , young people often ignore laws against using cell phones or texting in the car .
The number of text messages is up tenfold in the past three years and Americans sent an estimated 1 trillion in 2009 .
Some police agencies , while strongly in favor of such mandates , say its tough for officers to enforce them .
The California Highway Patrol has handed out nearly 163,000 tickets to drivers talking on hand - held phones since mid-2008 .
But it has issued only 1,400 texting citations since January in a state of 23 million drivers -- not for lack of trying .
“ The handheld cell phone is relatively easy for us to spot , we can see when somebody has their phone up to their ear , ” CHP spokeswoman Fran Clader said .
“ But with the texting it ’s a little bit more of a challenge to catch them in the act , because we have to see it and if they are holding it down in their lap it ’s going to be harder for us to see . ”
Already 19 states and the District of Columbia ban texting by all drivers , while 9 others prohibit it by young drivers .
TEXTING CAUSES ACCIDENTS
In July , Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer , citing a study that found texting drivers were 23 times more likely to be in an accident , introduced a bill requiring states to prohibit the practice or risk losing federal highway funds .
Since then , Senator Jay Rockefeller has offered his own bill that would achieve the ban through grants to states .
In October , during a three - day conference in Washington on distracted driving , President Barack Obama signed an executive order barring federal employees from texting behind the wheel .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said he would seek to expand that rule to bus drivers and truckers who cross state lines and called the conference “ probably the most important meeting in the history of the Department of Transportation . ”
But a much - cited study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that usage of cell phones for calls and texting in North Carolina actually ticked up slightly after the state banned them for drivers under the age of 18 .
A study by the Automobile Club of Southern California found that texting by drivers dropped after the state ’s law took effect , but it did not break down the data by age .
“ What I would say is that texting and cell phone devices have become such a component of life for teens and for young people that it ’s hard for them to differentiate between doing something normal and doing something wrong , ” said Steven Bloch , senior research associate for the Automobile Club .
The problem is not unique to the United States .
In Britain , a public service announcement on texting while driving drew worldwide attention for its extremely graphic imagery .
The spot shows three texting teen girls in a horrific head - on collision with another car , and lingers on shots of their bloodied faces shattering the windshield as a child whose parents have been killed cries for her dead mother to wake up .
In 2007 , Phoenix became one of the first U.S. cities to ban texting while driving , although Arizona still has no statewide law .
Out of a group of four high school students interviewed by Reuters in Phoenix , three admitted texting while driving and a fourth said he had stopped only after his cousin caused a serious traffic accident while sending a message .
Cordova ’s classmate , 17 - year - old Anna Hauer , says she often texts her boyfriend when she drives and doubts she or her friends would stop because of new legislation .
“ By the time they pull you over , the chances are you are going to be done with your text anyway so they can’t exactly prove that you were texting , ” she said .
Incensed at Facebook 's recent privacy changes ?
Had it up to here with your social networking virtual life ?
Kill it off with honor using the " anti- social network " Seppukoo .
The site is a rather brilliant subversion of Facebook , offering users the ritual destruction of their virtual identities complete with a customizable memorial page .
There 's even a leaderboard showing off the top users , whose scores are determined by how many others in their network decide to Seppukoo .
Named after the seppuku ritual suicide practiced by ancient Japanese samurai warriors , the site draws a parallel between restoring a samurai's honor and the " liberation of the digital body . "
It stands as a playful protest of the modern - day social networking experience as controlled by huge corporations making significant profits from users ' social graphs .
Seppukoo turns the concept on its head by turning the individual suicide ritual into " an exciting ' social ' experience . "
The site is operated by a group calling themselves Les Liens Invisibles , an " imaginary art group from Italy . "
Media artists Clemente Pestelli and Gionatan Quintini's other projects include Flickr parody Subvertr and Google Maps parody Google is not the map .
Seppukoo is an intense jab at corporate interest in social media , but perhaps all the more powerful for it .
What do you think of the site : playful and fun , or going too far ?
Would you consider virtually ending it all with a Seppukoo memorial ?

Greek stage workers are striking amid fears for their jobs Fears that Greece will be unable to pay off its debts , after a cut in its credit rating , are reflected by a deep pessimism on the streets , says Philip Pangalos in Athens .
Most ordinary
Greeks are increasingly fed up with government pledges to deal with the country 's mounting fiscal woes , the reality that tougher times lie ahead and that they will probably have to foot the bill .
But it is time to pay the piper after years of wasted opportunities and an inability to by successive Greek governments to deal with a string of looming economic problems .
The gloomy mood is palpable on the streets of Athens .
" The economic situation here is dismal and I do n't see any improvement any time soon , " says Stefanos Dallas , a 42 - year - old consultant .
" I 'm living from month to month and have resorted to borrowing money from friends and family to make ends meet .
This is not a way to live . "
' One more last chance ' Greece 's budget deficit is forecast to reach 12.7 % of GDP this year - more than four times the maximum 3 % allowed for eurozone members - while public debt levels are ballooning and are forecast to top 120 % of GDP next year .
At the same time , tax evasion is rampant and is said to cost Greece some 30bn euros ( £ 27 bn ) each year , which is more than the annual deficit , while analysts say the state pension system is facing collapse in the next decade unless urgent reforms are undertaken .
Alexandra Vovolini , the head of the Economia business media and publishing group , said : " Greeks do not like to be cornered on anything This [ essential economic reform ] is one more ' last chance ' for Greeks to realise their true potential as a modern European country and not as a Third World state . "
Not so long ago , Greece was enjoying 4 % growth - well above the eurozone average - and basking in the afterglow of a successful - but - costly Athens Olympic Games in 2004 .
But Mario , a 30 - year - old kiosk owner in the centre of Athens who did not want to give his surname , said times were now tougher for ordinary Greeks and everybody was feeling the effects .
" I see less business month - by - month , my turnover is down by about 3 % .
I work at least 12 hours every day and I still find it hard to make ends meet , " he said .
The Athens stock market plummeted this week following downgrades from international credit rating agencies .
It means it is likely to have to pay a much higher interest rate when it issues bonds next year to help finance the country 's borrowing needs and service its existing debt mountain .
Cynical Apostolos Mokos , a cafe owner in the centre of Athens , believes Greeks like him will have to pay the price for a problem that he says is ultimately down to American banks .
Anti-capitalist sentiment is mixing with general discontent " I 'm 28 years old and I do n't think I 'll ever be able to retire or get a pension as the whole pension system will have probably been abolished by the time I reach retirement age , " he says .
" As far as business is concerned , from my experience , times are tougher than in recent years and I do n't spend as freely as I used to .
At the same time , we face higher taxes on everything . "
Most ordinary Greeks concede that something has to be done for the Greek economy to get back on track .
But many are not happy about the fact that they may be squeezed even further .
And some , like our first interviewee Stefanos Dallas , are just deeply cynical about the whole situation .
" The government needs to take measures now , not tomorrow , it 's already too late , " he says .
Previous attempts to cut deficits have just meant tax rises , without any of the required austerity measures , he says .
" The government says things will change .
But I 'll believe it when I see it . "

Here is something that may shock people : we 're still maintaining systems files with RCS .
And I maintain that this is not as crazy as it sounds , once you dig under the surface , and that system administration is one of the last places where RCS is sensible some of the time .
For all their myriad benefits , the drawback of modern version control systems is that they really want to be used on whole directories ( or directory hierarchies ) .
This is generally pretty okay for source code , where you have directories that consist almost entirely of interrelated files , but system administration has lots of situations where either much of a directory 's contents will not be managed by your version control , or the files that you are managing in your VCS are not related at all apart from being in the same directory on the same system .
( /etc is the canonical example of both situations .
Yes , I know about things like etckeeper ; I honestly think that they 're uncomfortable hacks . )
For all its disadvantages ( and it has significant ones ) , RCS 's great virtue is that it is a single - file version control system , one that manages individual files instead of entire directories .
Thus , it 's both easy and mindless to put just one file in some random directory under version control .
You do n't have to set up an elaborate system or remember to carefully sidestep much of what your VCS defaults to doing ; instead you can just do ' mkdir RCS ; ci -l < file > ' and not worry about it .
( And there is the benefit of less taxonomy , in that you do n't have to decide what level of a directory hierarchy you should set up as the repository root .
Quick : do you make all of /etc a repository , or do you want separate repositories for / etc / thing1 , / etc / thing2 , and so on ? )
Sidebar : how I would get around the cluttered directory problem
What currently strikes me as the best solution is something that I saw in the Mercurial documentation recently : just tell the repository to ignore all files except those you 've explicitly added .
This basically turns your VCS into an easier to use version of RCS , where the equivalent of ' mkdir RCS ' is to initialize a repository that ignores everything by default .
This does n't deal with all of the VCS problems , but it gets you part of the way .

Barack Obama ran for president as a man of the people , standing up to Wall Street as the global economy melted down in that fateful fall of 2008 .
He pushed a tax plan to soak the rich , ripped NAFTA for hurting the middle class and tore into John McCain for supporting a bankruptcy bill that sided with wealthy bankers " at the expense of hardworking Americans . "
Obama may not have run to the left of Samuel Gompers or Cesar Chavez , but it 's not like you saw him on the campaign trail flanked by bankers from Citigroup and Goldman Sachs .
What inspired supporters who pushed him to his historic win was the sense that a genuine outsider was finally breaking into an exclusive club , that walls were being torn down , that things were , for lack of a better or more specific term , changing .
Then he got elected .
What 's taken place in the year since Obama won the presidency has turned out to be one of the most dramatic political about - faces in our history .
Elected in the midst of a crushing economic crisis brought on by a decade of orgiastic deregulation and unchecked greed , Obama had a clear mandate to rein in Wall Street and remake the entire structure of the American economy .
What he did instead was ship even his most marginally progressive campaign advisers off to various bureaucratic Siberias , while packing the key economic positions in his White House with the very people who caused the crisis in the first place .
This new team of bubble - fattened ex-bankers and laissez - faire intellectuals then proceeded to sell us all out , instituting a massive , trickle - up bailout and systematically gutting regulatory reform from the inside .
How could Obama let this happen ?
Is he just a rookie in the political big leagues , hoodwinked by Beltway old - timers ?
Or is the vacillating , ineffectual servant of banking interests we 've been seeing on TV this fall who Obama really is ?
Whatever the president 's real motives are , the extensive series of loophole - rich financial " reforms " that the Democrats are currently pushing may ultimately do more harm than good .
In fact , some parts of the new reforms border on insanity , threatening to vastly amplify Wall Street 's political power by institutionalizing the taxpayer 's role as a welfare provider for the financial - services industry .
At one point in the debate , Obama 's top economic advisers demanded the power to award future bailouts without even going to Congress for approval - and without providing taxpayers a single dime in equity on the deals .
How did we get here ?
It started just moments after the election - and almost nobody noticed .
' Just look at the timeline of the Citigroup deal , " says one leading Democratic consultant .
" Just look at it .
It 's fucking amazing .
Amazing !
And nobody said a thing about it . "
Barack Obama was still just the president - elect when it happened , but the revolting and inexcusable $ 306 billion bailout that Citigroup received was the first major act of his presidency .
In order to grasp the full horror of what took place , however , one needs to go back a few weeks before the actual bailout - to November 5th , 2008 , the day after Obama 's election .
That was the day the jubilant Obama campaign announced its transition team .
Though many of the names were familiar - former Bill Clinton chief of staff John Podesta , long - time Obama confidante Valerie Jarrett - the list was most notable for who was not on it , especially on the economic side .
Austan Goolsbee , a University of Chicago economist who had served as one of Obama 's chief advisers during the campaign , did n't make the cut .
Neither did Karen Kornbluh , who had served as Obama 's policy director and was instrumental in crafting the Democratic Party 's platform .
Both had emphasized populist themes during the campaign : Kornbluh was known for pushing Democrats to focus on the plight of the poor and middle class , while Goolsbee was an aggressive critic of Wall Street , declaring that AIG executives should receive " a Nobel Prize - for evil . "
But come November 5th , both were banished from Obama 's inner circle - and replaced with a group of Wall Street bankers .
Leading the search for the president 's new economic team was his close friend and Harvard Law classmate Michael Froman , a high - ranking executive at Citigroup .
During the campaign , Froman had emerged as one of Obama 's biggest fundraisers , bundling $ 200,000 in contributions and introducing the candidate to a host of heavy hitters - chief among them his mentor Bob Rubin , the former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs who served as Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton .
Froman had served as chief of staff to Rubin at Treasury , and had followed his boss when Rubin left the Clinton administration to serve as a senior counselor to Citigroup ( a massive new financial conglomerate created by deregulatory moves pushed through by Rubin himself ) .
Incredibly , Froman did not resign from the bank when he went to work for Obama :
He remained in the employ of Citigroup for two more months , even as he helped appoint the very people who would shape the future of his own firm .
And to help him pick Obama 's economic team , Froman brought in none other than Jamie Rubin who happens to be Bob Rubin 's son .
At the time , Jamie 's dad was still earning roughly $ 15 million a year working for Citigroup , which was in the midst of a collapse brought on in part because Rubin had pushed the bank to invest heavily in mortgage - backed CDOs and other risky instruments .
Now here 's where it gets really interesting .
It 's three weeks after the election .
You have a lame - duck president in George W. Bush - still nominally in charge , but in reality already halfway to the golf - and - O'Doul 's portion of his career and more than happy to vacate the scene .
Left to deal with the still - reeling economy are lame - duck Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , a former head of Goldman Sachs , and New York Fed chief Timothy Geithner , who served under Bob Rubin in the Clinton White House .
Running Obama 's economic team are a still - employed Citigroup executive and the son of another Citigroup executive , who himself joined Obama 's transition team that same month .
So on November 23rd , 2008 , a deal is announced in which the government will bail out Rubin 's messes at Citigroup with a massive buffet of taxpayer - funded cash and guarantees .
It is a terrible deal for the government , almost universally panned by all serious economists , an outrage to anyone who pays taxes .
Under the deal , the bank gets $ 20 billion in cash , on top of the $ 25 billion it had already received just weeks before as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
But that 's just the appetizer .
The government also agrees to charge taxpayers for up to $ 277 billion in losses on troubled Citi assets , many of them those toxic CDOs that Rubin had pushed Citi to invest in .
No Citi executives are replaced , and few restrictions are placed on their compensation .
It 's the sweetheart deal of the century , putting generations of working - stiff taxpayers on the hook to pay off Bob Rubin 's fuck - up - rich tenure at Citi .
" If you had any doubts at all about the primacy of Wall Street over Main Street , " former labor secretary Robert Reich declares when the bailout is announced , " your doubts should be laid to rest . "
It is bad enough that one of Bob Rubin 's former protégés from the Clinton years , the New York Fed chief Geithner , is intimately involved in the negotiations , which unsurprisingly leave the Federal Reserve massively exposed to future Citi losses .
But the real stunner comes only hours after the bailout deal is struck , when the Obama transition team makes a cheerful announcement : Timothy Geithner is going to be Barack Obama 's Treasury secretary !
Geithner , in other words , is hired to head the U.S. Treasury by an executive from Citigroup - Michael Froman - before the ink is even dry on a massive government giveaway to Citigroup that Geithner himself was instrumental in delivering .
In the annals of brazen political swindles , this one has to go in the all - time Fuck - the - Optics Hall of Fame .
Wall Street loved the Citi bailout and the Geithner nomination so much that the Dow immediately posted its biggest two - day jump since 1987 , rising 11.8 percent .
Citi shares jumped 58 percent in a single day , and JP Morgan Chase , Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley soared more than 20 percent , as Wall Street embraced the news that the government 's bailout generosity would not die with George W. Bush and Hank Paulson .
" Geithner assures a smooth transition between the Bush administration and that of Obama , because he 's already co-managing what 's happening now , " observed Stephen Leeb , president of Leeb Capital Management .
Left unnoticed , however , was the fact that Geithner had been hired by a sitting Citigroup executive who still had a big bonus coming despite his proximity to Obama .
In January 2009 , just over a month after the bailout , Citigroup paid Froman a year - end bonus of $ 2.25 million .
But as outrageous as it was , that payoff would prove to be chump change for the banker crowd , who were about to get everything they wanted - and more - from the new president .
The irony of Bob Rubin :
He 's an unapologetic arch - capitalist demagogue whose very career is proof that a free - market meritocracy is a myth .
Much like Alan Greenspan , a staggeringly incompetent economic forecaster who was worshipped by four decades of politicians because he once dated Barbara Walters , Rubin has been held in awe by the American political elite for nearly 20 years despite having fucked up virtually every project he ever got his hands on .
He went from running Goldman Sachs ( 1990 - 1992 ) to the Clinton White House ( 1993 - 1999 ) to Citigroup ( 1999 - 2009 ) , leaving behind a trail of historic gaffes that somehow boosted his stature every step of the way .
As Treasury secretary under Clinton , Rubin was the driving force behind two monstrous deregulatory actions that would be primary causes of last year 's financial crisis : the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act ( passed specifically to legalize the Citigroup megamerger ) and the deregulation of the derivatives market .
Having set that time bomb , Rubin left government to join Citi , which promptly expressed its gratitude by giving him $ 126 million in compensation over the next eight years ( they do n't call it bribery in this country when they give you the money post factum ) .
After urging management to amp up its risky investments in toxic vehicles , a strategy that very nearly destroyed the company , Rubin blamed Citi 's board for his screw - ups and complained that he had been underpaid to boot .
" I bet there 's not a single year where I could n't have gone somewhere else and made more , " he said .
Despite being perhaps more responsible for last year 's crash than any other single living person - his colossally stupid decisions at both the highest levels of government and the management of a private financial superpower make him unique - Rubin was the man Barack Obama chose to build his White House around .
There are four main ways to be connected to Bob Rubin : through Goldman Sachs , the Clinton administration , Citigroup and , finally , the Hamilton Project , a think tank Rubin spearheaded under the auspices of the Brookings Institute to promote his philosophy of balanced budgets , free trade and financial deregulation .
The team Obama put in place to run his economic policy after his inauguration was dominated by people who boasted connections to at least one of these four institutions - so much so that the White House now looks like a backstage party for an episode of Bob Rubin , This Is Your Life !
At Treasury , there is Geithner , who worked under Rubin in the Clinton years .
Serving as Geithner 's " counselor " - a made - up post not subject to Senate confirmation - is Lewis Alexander , the former chief economist of Citigroup , who advised Citi back in 2007 that the upcoming housing crash was nothing to worry about .
Two other top Geithner " counselors " - Gene Sperling and Lael Brainard - worked under Rubin at the National Economic Council , the key group that coordinates all economic policymaking for the White House .
As director of the NEC , meanwhile , Obama installed economic czar Larry Summers , who had served as Rubin 's protégé at Treasury .
Just below Summers is Jason Furman , who worked for Rubin in the Clinton White House and was one of the first directors of Rubin 's Hamilton Project .
The appointment of Furman - a persistent advocate of free - trade agreements like NAFTA and the author of droolingly pro-globalization reports with titles like " Walmart : A Progressive Success Story " - provided one of the first clues that Obama had only been posturing when he promised crowds of struggling Midwesterners during the campaign that he would renegotiate NAFTA , which facilitated the flight of blue - collar jobs to other countries .
" NAFTA 's shortcomings were evident when signed , and we must now amend the agreement to fix them , " Obama declared .
A few months after hiring Furman to help shape its economic policy , however , the White House quietly quashed any talk of renegotiating the trade deal .
" The president has said we will look at all of our options , but I think they can be addressed without having to reopen the agreement , " U.S. Trade Representative Ronald Kirk told reporters in a little - publicized conference call last April .
The announcement was not so surprising , given who Obama hired to serve alongside Furman at the NEC : management consultant Diana Farrell , who worked under Rubin at Goldman Sachs .
In 2003 , Farrell was the author of an infamous paper in which she argued that sending American jobs overseas might be " as beneficial to the U.S. as to the destination country , probably more so . "
Joining Summers , Furman and Farrell at the NEC is Froman , who by then had been formally appointed to a unique position :
He is not only Obama 's international finance adviser at the National Economic Council , he simultaneously serves as deputy national security adviser at the National Security Council .
The twin posts give Froman a direct line to the president , putting him in a position to coordinate Obama 's international economic policy during a crisis .
He 'll have help from David Lipton , another joint appointee to the economics and security councils who worked with Rubin at Treasury and Citigroup , and from Jacob Lew , a former Citi colleague of Rubin 's whom Obama named as deputy director at the State Department to focus on international finance .
Over at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which is supposed to regulate derivatives trading , Obama appointed Gary Gensler , a former Goldman banker who worked under Rubin in the Clinton White House .
Gensler had been instrumental in helping to pass the infamous Commodity Futures Modernization
Act of 2000 , which prevented regulation of derivative instruments like CDOs and credit - default swaps that played such a big role in cratering the economy last year .
And as head of the powerful Office of Management and Budget , Obama named Peter Orszag , who served as the first director of Rubin 's Hamilton Project .
Orszag once succinctly summed up the project 's ideology as a sort of liberal spin on trickle - down Reaganomics : " Market competition and globalization generate significant economic benefits . "
Taken together , the rash of appointments with ties to Bob Rubin may well represent the most sweeping influence by a single Wall Street insider in the history of government .
" Rather than having a team of rivals , they 've got a team of Rubins , " says Steven Clemons , director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation .
" You see that in policy choices that have resuscitated - but not reformed - Wall Street . "
While Rubin 's allies and acolytes got all the important jobs in the Obama administration , the academics and progressives got banished to semi-meaningless , even comical roles .
Kornbluh was rewarded for being the chief policy architect of Obama 's meteoric rise by being outfitted with a pith helmet and booted across the ocean to Paris , where she now serves as America 's never - again - to - be - seen - on - TV ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Goolsbee , meanwhile , was appointed as staff director of the President 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board , a kind of dumping ground for Wall Street critics who had assisted Obama during the campaign ; one top Democrat calls the panel " Siberia . "
Joining Goolsbee as chairman of the PERAB gulag is former Fed chief Paul Volcker , who back in March 2008 helped candidate Obama write a speech declaring that the deregulatory efforts of the Eighties and Nineties had " excused and even embraced an ethic of greed , corner - cutting , insider dealing , things that have always threatened the long - term stability of our economic system . "
That speech met with rapturous applause , but the commission Obama gave Volcker to manage is so toothless that it did n't even meet for the first time until last May .
The lone progressive in the White House , economist Jared Bernstein , holds the impressive - sounding title of chief economist and national policy adviser - except that the man he is advising is Joe Biden , who seems more interested in foreign policy than financial reform .
The significance of all of these appointments is n't that the Wall Street types are now in a position to provide direct favors to their former employers .
It 's that , with one or two exceptions , they collectively offer a microcosm of what the Democratic Party has come to stand for in the 21st century .
Virtually all of the Rubinites brought in to manage the economy under Obama share the same fundamental political philosophy carefully articulated for years by the Hamilton Project : Expand the safety net to protect the poor , but let Wall Street do whatever it wants .
" Bob Rubin , these guys , they 're classic limousine liberals , " says David Sirota , a former Democratic strategist .
" These are basically people who have made shitloads of money in the speculative economy , but they want to call themselves good Democrats because they 're willing to give a little more to the poor .
That 's the model for this Democratic Party :
Let the rich do their thing , but give a fraction more to everyone else . "
Even the members of Obama 's economic team who have spent most of their lives in public office have managed to make small fortunes on Wall Street .
The president 's economic czar , Larry Summers , was paid more than $ 5.2 million in 2008 alone as a managing director of the hedge fund D.E. Shaw , and pocketed an additional $ 2.7 million in speaking fees from a smorgasbord of future bailout recipients , including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup .
At Treasury , Geithner 's aide Gene Sperling earned a staggering $ 887,727 from Goldman Sachs last year for performing the punch - line - worthy service of " advice on charitable giving . "
Sperling 's fellow Treasury appointee , Mark Patterson , received $ 637,492 as a full - time lobbyist for Goldman Sachs , and another top Geithner aide , Lee Sachs , made more than $ 3 million working for a New York hedge fund called Mariner Investment Group .
The list goes on and on .
Even Obama 's chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , who has been out of government for only 30 months of his adult life , managed to collect $ 18 million during his private - sector stint with a Wall Street firm called Wasserstein - Perella .
The point is that an economic team made up exclusively of callous millionaire - assholes has absolutely zero interest in reforming the gamed system that made them rich in the first place .
" You can't expect these people to do anything other than protect Wall Street , " says Rep. Cliff Stearns , a Republican from Florida .
That thinking was clear from Obama 's first address to Congress , when he stressed the importance of getting Americans to borrow like crazy again .
" Credit is the lifeblood of the economy , " he declared , pledging " the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money . "
A president elected on a platform of change was announcing , in so many words , that he planned to change nothing fundamental when it came to the economy .
Rather than doing what FDR had done during the Great Depression and institute stringent new rules to curb financial abuses , Obama planned to institutionalize the policy , firmly established during the Bush years , of keeping a few megafirms rich at the expense of everyone else .
Obama has n't always toed the Rubin line when it comes to economic policy .
Despite being surrounded by a team that is powerfully opposed to deficit spending - balanced budgets and deficit reduction have always been central to the Rubin way of thinking - Obama came out of the gate with a huge stimulus plan designed to kick - start the economy and address the job losses brought on by the 2008 crisis .
" You have to give him credit there , " says Sen. Bernie Sanders , an advocate of using government resources to address unemployment .
" It 's a very significant piece of legislation , and $ 787 billion is a lot of money . "
But whatever jobs the stimulus has created or preserved so far - 640,329 , according to an absurdly precise and already debunked calculation by the White House - the aid that Obama has provided to real people has been dwarfed in size and scope by the taxpayer money that has been handed over to America 's financial giants .
" They spent $ 75 billion on mortgage relief , but come on - look at how much they gave Wall Street , " says a leading Democratic strategist .
Neil Barofsky , the inspector general charged with overseeing TARP , estimates that the total cost of the Wall Street bailouts could eventually reach $ 23.7 trillion .
And while the government continues to dole out big money to big banks , Obama and his team of Rubinites have done almost nothing to reform the warped financial system responsible for imploding the global economy in the first place .
The push for reform seemed to get off to a promising start .
In the House , the charge was led by Rep. Barney Frank , the outspoken chair of the House Financial Services Committee , who emerged during last year 's Bush bailouts as a sharp - tongued critic of Wall Street .
Back when Obama was still a senator , he and Frank even worked together to introduce a populist bill targeting executive compensation .
Last spring , with the economy shattered , Frank began to hold hearings on a host of reforms , crafted with significant input from the White House , that initially contained some very good elements .
There were measures to curb abusive credit - card lending , prevent banks from charging excessive fees , force publicly traded firms to conduct meaningful risk assessment and allow shareholders to vote on executive compensation .
There were even measures to crack down on risky derivatives and to bar firms like AIG from picking their own regulators .
Then the committee went to work - and the loopholes started to appear .
The most notable of these came in the proposal to regulate derivatives like credit - default swaps .
Even Gary Gensler , the former Goldmanite whom Obama put in charge of commodities regulation , was pushing to make these normally obscure investments more transparent , enabling regulators and investors to identify speculative bubbles sooner .
But in August , a month after Gensler came out in favor of reform , Geithner slapped him down by issuing a 115 - page paper called " Improvements to Regulation of Over - the - Counter Derivatives Markets " that called for a series of exemptions for " end users " - i.e. , almost all of the clients who buy derivatives from banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley .
Even more stunning , Frank 's bill included a blanket exception to the rules for currency swaps traded on foreign exchanges - the very instruments that had triggered the Long - Term Capital Management meltdown in the late 1990s .
Given that derivatives were at the heart of the financial meltdown last year , the decision to gut derivatives reform sent some legislators howling with disgust .
Sen . Maria Cantwell of Washington , who estimates that as much as 90 percent of all derivatives could remain unregulated under the new rules , went so far as to say the new laws would make things worse .
" Current law with its loopholes might actually be better than these loopholes , " she said .
An even bigger loophole could do far worse damage to the economy .
Under the original bill , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were granted the power to ban any credit swaps deemed to be " detrimental to the stability of a financial market or of participants in a financial market . "
By the time Frank 's committee was done with the bill , however , the SEC and the CFTC were left with no authority to do anything about abusive derivatives other than to send a report to Congress .
The move , in effect , would leave the kind of credit - default swaps that brought down AIG largely unregulated .
Why would leading congressional Democrats , working closely with the Obama administration , agree to leave one of the riskiest of all financial instruments unregulated , even before the issue could be debated by the House ?
" There was concern that a broad grant to ban abusive swaps would be unsettling , " Frank explained .
Unsettling to whom ?
Certainly not to you and me - but then again , actual people are not really part of the calculus when it comes to finance reform .
According to those close to the markup process , Frank 's committee inserted loopholes under pressure from " constituents " - by which they mean anyone " who can afford a lobbyist , " says Michael Greenberger , the former head of trading at the CFTC under Clinton .
This pattern would repeat itself over and over again throughout the fall .
Take the centerpiece of Obama 's reform proposal : the much - ballyhooed creation of a Consumer Finance Protection Agency to protect the little guy from abusive bank practices .
Like the derivatives bill , the debate over the CFPA ended up being dominated by horse - trading for loopholes .
In the end , Frank not only agreed to exempt some 8,000 of the nation 's 8,200 banks from oversight by the castrated - in - advance agency , leaving most consumers unprotected , he allowed the committee to pass the exemption by voice vote , meaning that congressmen could side with the banks without actually attaching their name to their " Aye . "
To win the support of conservative Democrats , Frank also backed down on another issue that seemed like a slam - dunk : a requirement that all banks offer so - called " plain vanilla " products , such as no-frills mortgages , to give consumers an alternative to deceptive , " fully loaded " deals like adjustable - rate loans .
Frank 's last - minute reversal - made in consultation with Geithner - was such a transparent giveaway to the banks that even an economics writer for Reuters , hardly a far - left source , called it " the beginning of the end of meaningful regulatory reform . "
But the real kicker came when Frank 's committee took up what is known as " resolution authority " - government - speak for " Who the hell is in charge the next time somebody at AIG or Lehman Brothers decides to vaporize the economy ? "
What the committee initially introduced bore a striking resemblance to a proposal written by Geithner earlier in the summer .
A masterpiece of legislative chicanery , the measure would have given the White House permanent and unlimited authority to execute future bailouts of megaconglomerates like Citigroup and Bear Stearns .
Democrats pushed the move as politically uncontroversial , claiming that the bill will force Wall Street to pay for any future bailouts and " does n't use taxpayer money . "
In reality , that was complete bullshit .
The way the bill was written , the FDIC would basically borrow money from the Treasury - i.e. , from ordinary taxpayers - to bail out any of the nation 's two dozen or so largest financial companies that the president deems in need of government assistance .
After the bailout is executed , the president would then levy a tax on financial firms with assets of more than $ 10 billion to repay the Treasury within 60 months - unless , that is , the president decides he does n't want to !
" They can wait indefinitely to repay , " says Rep. Brad Sherman of California , who dubbed the early version of the bill " TARP on steroids . "
The new bailout authority also mandated that future bailouts would not include an exchange of equity " in any form " - meaning that taxpayers would get nothing in return for underwriting Wall Street 's mistakes .
Even more outrageous , it specifically prohibited Congress from rejecting tax giveaways to Wall Street , as it did last year , by removing all congressional oversight of future bailouts .
In fact , the resolution authority proposed by Frank was such a slurpingly obvious blow job of Wall Street that it provoked a revolt among his own committee members , with junior Democrats waging a spirited fight that restored congressional oversight to future bailouts , requires equity for taxpayer money and caps assistance to troubled firms at $ 150 billion .
Another amendment to force companies with more than $ 50 billion in assets to pay into a rainy - day fund for bailouts passed by a resounding vote of 52 to 17 - with the " Nays " all coming from Frank and other senior Democrats loyal to the administration .
Even as amended , however , resolution authority still has the potential to be truly revolutionary legislation .
The Senate version still grants the president unlimited power over equity - free bailouts , and the amended House bill still institutionalizes a system of taxpayer support for the 20 to 25 biggest banks in the country .
It would essentially grant economic immortality to those top few megafirms , who will continually gobble up greater and greater slices of market share as money becomes cheaper and cheaper for them to borrow ( after all , who would n't lend to a company permanently backstopped by the federal government ? ) .
It would also formalize the government 's role in the global economy and turn the presidential - appointment process into an important part of every big firm 's business strategy .
" If this passes , the very first thing these companies are going to do in the future is ask themselves , ' How do we make sure that one of our executives becomes assistant Treasury secretary ? ' " says Sherman .
On the Senate side , finance reform has yet to make it through the markup process , but there 's every reason to believe that its final bill will be as watered down as the House version by the time it comes to a vote .
The original measure , drafted by chairman Christopher Dodd of the Senate Banking Committee , is surprisingly tough on Wall Street - a fact that almost everyone in town chalks up to Dodd 's desperation to shake the bad publicity he incurred by accepting a sweetheart mortgage from the notorious lender Countrywide .
" He 's got to do the shake - his - fist - at - Wall Street thing because of his , you know , problems , " says a Democratic Senate aide .
" So that 's why the bill is starting out kind of tough . "
The aide pauses .
" The question is , though , what will it end up looking like ? "
He 's right - that is the question .
Because the way it works is that all of these great - sounding reforms get whittled down bit by bit as they move through the committee markup process , until finally there 's nothing left but the exceptions .
In one example , a measure that would have forced financial companies to be more accountable to shareholders by holding elections for their entire boards every year has already been watered down to preserve the current system of staggered votes .
In other cases , this being the Senate , loopholes were inserted before the debate even began :
The Dodd bill included the exemption for foreign - currency swaps - a gift to Wall Street that only appeared in the Frank bill during the course of hearings - from the very outset .
The White House 's refusal to push for real reform stands in stark contrast to what it should be doing .
It was left to Rep. Paul Kanjorski in the House and Bernie Sanders in the Senate to propose bills to break up the so - called " too big to fail " banks .
Both measures would give Congress the power to dismantle those pseudomonopolies controlling almost the entire derivatives market ( Goldman , Citi , Chase , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America control 95 percent of the $ 290 trillion over - the - counter market ) and the consumer - lending market ( Citi , Chase , Bank of America and Wells Fargo issue one of every two mortgages , and two of every three credit cards ) .
On November 18th , in a move that demonstrates just how nervous Democrats are getting about the growing outrage over taxpayer giveaways , Barney Frank 's committee actually passed Kanjorski 's measure .
" It 's a beginning , " Kanjorski says hopefully .
" We 're on our way . "
But even if the Senate follows suit , big banks could well survive - depending on whom the president appoints to sit on the new regulatory board mandated by the measure .
An oversight body filled with executives of the type Obama has favored to date from Citi and Goldman Sachs hardly seems like a strong bet to start taking an ax to concentrated wealth .
And given the new bailout provisions that provide these megafirms a market advantage over smaller banks ( those Paul Volcker calls " too small to save " ) , the failure to break them up qualifies as a major policy decision with potentially disastrous consequences .
" They should be doing what Teddy Roosevelt did , " says Sanders .
" They should be busting the trusts . "
That probably wo n't happen anytime soon .
But at a minimum , Obama should start on the road back to sanity by making a long - overdue move : firing Geithner .
Not only are the mop - headed weenie of a Treasury secretary 's fingerprints on virtually all the gross giveaways in the new reform legislation , he 's a living symbol of the Rubinite gangrene crawling up the leg of this administration .
Putting Geithner against the wall and replacing him with an actual human being not recently employed by a Wall Street megabank would do a lot to prove that Obama was listening this past Election Day .
And while there are some who think Geithner is about to go - " he almost has to , " says one Democratic strategist - at the moment , the president is still letting Wall Street do his talking .
Morning , the National Mall , November 5th .
A year to the day after Obama named Michael Froman to his transition team , his political " opposition " has descended upon the city .
Republican teabaggers from all 50 states have showed up , a vast horde of frowning , pissed - off middle - aged white people with their idiot placards in hand , ready to do cultural battle .
They are here to protest Obama 's " socialist " health care bill - you know , the one that even a bloodsucking capitalist interest group like Big Pharma spent $ 150 million to get passed .
These teabaggers do n't know that , however .
All they know is that a big government program might end up using tax dollars to pay the medical bills of rapidly breeding Dominican immigrants .
So they hate it .
They 're also in a groove , knowing that at the polls a few days earlier , people like themselves had a big hand in ousting several Obama - allied Democrats , including a governor of New Jersey who just happened to be the former CEO of Goldman Sachs .
A sign held up by New Jersey protesters bears the warning , " If You Vote For Obamacare , We Will Corzine You . "
I approach a woman named Pat Defillipis from Toms River , New Jersey , and ask her why she 's here .
" To protest health care , " she answers .
" And then amnesty .
You know , immigration amnesty . "
I ask her if she 's aware that there 's a big hearing going on in the House today , where Barney Frank 's committee is marking up a bill to reform the financial regulatory system .
She recognizes Frank 's name , wincing , but the rest of my question leaves her staring at me like I 'm an alien .
" Do you care at all about economic regulation ? " I ask .
" There was sort of a big economic collapse last year .
Do you have any ideas about how that whole deal should be fixed ? "
" We got to slow down on spending , " she says .
" We ca n't afford it . "
" But what do we do about the rules governing Wall Street . . . "
She walks away .
She does n't give a fuck .
People like
Pat are n't aware of it , but they 're the best friends Obama has .
They hate him , sure , but they do n't hate him for any reasons that make sense .
When it comes down to it , most of them hate the president for all the usual reasons they hate " liberals " - because he uses big words , does n't believe in hell and does n't flip out at the sight of gay people holding hands .
Additionally , of course , he 's black , and was n't born in America , and is married to a woman who secretly hates our country .
These are the kinds of voters whom Obama 's gang of Wall Street advisers is counting on : idiots .
People whose votes depend not on whether the party in power delivers them jobs or protects them from economic villains , but on what cultural markers the candidate flashes on TV .
Finance reform has become to Obama what Iraq
War coffins were to Bush : something to be tucked safely out of sight .
Around the same time that finance reform was being watered down in Congress at the behest of his Treasury secretary , Obama was making a pit stop to raise money from Wall Street .
On October 20th , the president went to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York and addressed some 200 financiers and business moguls , each of whom paid the maximum allowable contribution of $ 30,400 to the Democratic Party .
But an organizer of the event , Daniel Fass , announced in advance that support for the president might be lighter than expected - bailed - out firms like JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs were expected to contribute a meager $ 91,000 to the event - because bankers were tired of being lectured about their misdeeds .
" The investment community feels very put-upon , " Fass explained .
" They feel there is no reason why they should n't earn $ 1 million to $ 200 million a year , and they do n't want to be held responsible for the global financial meltdown . "
Which makes sense .
Shit , who could blame the investment community for the meltdown ?
What kind of assholes are we to put any of this on them ?
This is the kind of person who is working for the Obama administration , which makes it unsurprising that we 're getting no real reform of the finance industry .
There 's no other way to say it : Barack Obama , a once - in - a - generation political talent whose graceful conquest of America 's racial dragons en route to the White House inspired the entire world , has for some reason allowed his presidency to be hijacked by sniveling , low - rent shitheads .
Instead of reining in Wall Street , Obama has allowed himself to be seduced by it , leaving even his erstwhile campaign adviser , ex - Fed chief Paul Volcker , concerned about a " moral hazard " creeping over his administration .
" The obvious danger is that with the passage of time , risk - taking will be encouraged and efforts at prudential restraint will be resisted , " Volcker told Congress in September , expressing concerns about all the regulatory loopholes in Frank 's bill .
" Ultimately , the possibility of further crises - even greater crises - will increase . "
What 's most troubling is that we do n't know if Obama has changed , or if the influence of Wall Street is simply a fundamental and ineradicable element of our electoral system .
What we do know is that Barack Obama pulled a bait - and - switch on us .
If it were any other politician , we would n't be surprised .
Maybe it 's our fault , for thinking he was different .
Key parts of Tony Blair 's evidence to the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War will be held in secret , sources close to the hearings revealed last night .
His conversations with President George Bush when he was prime minister , and crucial details of the decision - making process that led Britain into war , will fall under the scope of national security and the protection of Britain 's relations with the US .
But there are also suggestions by well - placed sources that anything " interesting " will also be shrouded in secrecy , leaving his public appearance containing little more than is already known .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The revelation will dash hopes that Mr Blair will finally detail in public why he committed British troops to the disastrous military invasion on the basis of flimsy intelligence .
The Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg last night condemned the move , saying if a significant proportion of Mr Blair 's evidence were held in private then the public would " rightly conclude that the inquiry is simply too weak to give us the truth " .
It followed Mr Blair 's extraordinary admission to the TV presenter Fern Britton this weekend that he would have gone to war even if he had known Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction .
He would have deployed " different arguments " to remove Saddam , Mr Blair said – undermining his long - held case that Saddam needed to be toppled because of the threat of WMD .
It will be seen as supremely ironic that Mr Blair made the confession in the cosy surroundings of a documentary about his religious beliefs , in Fern Britton Meets ... to be broadcast on BBC1 today , yet the public will be denied the chance to see any difficult questioning of how he has changed his justification for war over the past seven years .
All of the evidence held behind closed doors is expected to be redacted from the Chilcot panel 's final report on the war .
There are already concerns that Sir John Chilcot and his four fellow panellists have given the 27 witnesses who have so far appeared – mainly senior Foreign Office mandarins – an easy ride over their role in the war .

The former MI6 chief Sir John Scarlett , in evidence last week , distanced himself from the " overtly political " foreword to the September 2002 Downing Street dossier .
Yet the panel failed to ask why it was that Mr Blair and Alastair Campbell were able to amend the document he was in charge of .
Sir John will also give evidence in private .
The inquiry adjourns for the Christmas break this week .
Mr Blair will appear in public in the new year , followed by a private session .
The IoS revealed earlier this year that Mr Blair lobbied Gordon Brown , through the Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell , for the inquiry to be held in private to prevent it turning into a " show trial " .
After widespread uproar , the move was blocked and it was announced that all evidence would be public and televised .
Yet a source close to the inquiry said yesterday that the " interesting " aspects of Mr Blair 's evidence will still be heard behind closed doors .
The source said : " Anyone who thinks the public will have their day in court with Blair is wrong . "
It is thought the move arose from a mutual agreement .
Whitehall frequently uses national security as a reason to withhold documents from the public .
The Freedom of Information
Act also blocks the release of details where the effects of disclosure could damage the UK 's relations with any other state or international organisation .
A spokesman for the inquiry said : Mr Blair would be appearing " very much in public " .
He added : " We have said right from the start that he will be a key figure in the inquiry .
Mr Blair has said that he is ready and willing to give evidence in public . "
Mr Clegg said last night : " It would be wholly unacceptable for any of Blair 's testimony to be held in private , except that which could directly compromise national security .
Tony Blair 's breathtaking cynicism in stating that he would have found any old excuse to go to war simply underlines how vital it is that we hear his testimony in public .
" It is highly ironic that he is willing to speak publicly to Fern Britton but not to the inquiry set up to investigate the Iraq War . "
Another source with knowledge of the inquiry said it was clear the " heavy stuff " was being saved for behind closed doors .
Hans Blix , head of the UN weapons inspectorate in 2003 , said that Mr Blair 's confession to Fern Britton had left a " strong impression of a lack of sincerity " , adding that the WMD argument was a " figleaf " .

Americans are using less water per person now than they have since the mid-1950s , thanks to water - saving technologies and a nationwide push to safeguard dwindling supplies .
A report released Thursday , Oct. 29 , by the US Geological Survey also shows that industries as well as the general population are sucking up less water overall than in 1980 , when the nation 's thirst for water peaked .
Experts said it was particularly welcome news in the burgeoning West , where cities built in dry regions are grappling with intense disputes and ecosystem collapse tied to dwindling supplies .
" Even during a time of population growth and economic growth , we are all using less water , " said Susan Hutson , a USGS hydrologist in Memphis , and an author of the report .
" It 's exciting to see we have responded to these crises by really seeking solutions . "
California , in the third year of a withering drought , was the most water - hungry state in 2005 , the most recent year for which figures were available .
California used about 9 percent of all water extracted from lakes , rivers , and underground aquifers , followed by Texas , Idaho , and Illinois .
All told , those four states drew more than a quarter of America 's total freshwater supplies in 2005 .
Nationwide , about 80 percent of the 410 billion gallons ( 1,552 billion liters ) used each day went to produce electricity at thermoelectric power plants and to irrigate farm fields .
Occasional shortages and disputes have arisen even around the water - rich region of the US Great Lakes , which hold 95 percent of America 's fresh surface water and meet the drinking needs of 34 million people in eight states .
Last year , the states signed a compact that limits any diversions of lake water to areas outside the drainage basin , in reaction to fears of Sun Belt water grabs .
Scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have warned that climate change will exacerbate water scarcity problems around the world .
Computer models suggest a warming climate may send the Great Lakes ' levels substantially lower by century 's end .
" The pressure 's on to conserve , " said Tim Eder , director of the Great Lakes Commission , an interstate agency .
" We 're trying to position ourselves so we 'll have an abundant supply that can be used sustainably , particularly if businesses want to relocate here from places where water is expensive or unavailable . "

This is the second in a series of posts from the Last . fm engineering team covering the geekier aspects of our recent Last.fm on Xbox LIVE launch .
Part one ( “ The War Room ” ) is here .
The music streaming architecture at Last.fm is an area of our infrastructure that has been scaling steadily for some time .
The final stage of delivering streams to users fetches the raw mp3 data from a MogileFS distributed file system before passing it through our audio streaming software , which handles the actual audio serving .
There are two main considerations with this streaming system : physical disk capacity , and raw IO throughput .
The number of random IO operations a storage system can support has a big effect on how many users we can serve from it , so this number ( IOPS ) is a metric we ’re very interested in .
The disk capacity of the cluster has effectively ceased being a problem with the capacities available from newer SATA drives , so our biggest concern is having enough IO performance across the cluster to serve all our concurrent users .
To put some numbers on this , a single 7200rpm SATA drive can produce enough IOPS to serve around 300 concurrent connections .
We ’ve been using MogileFS for years at Last.fm , and it ’s served us very well .
As our content catalogue has grown , so has our userbase .
As we ’ve added storage to our streaming cluster , we ’ve also been adding IO capacity in step with that , since each disk added into the streaming cluster brings with it more IOPS .
From the early days , when our streaming machines were relatively small , we ’ve moved up to systems built around the Supermicro SC846 chassis .
These provide cost effective high - density storage , packing 24 3.5 ” SATA drives into 4U , and are ideal for growing our MogileFS pool .
Changing our approach
The arrival of Xbox users on the Last .fm scene pushed us to do some re-thinking on our approach to streaming .
For the first time , we needed a way to scale up the IO capacity of our MogileFS cluster independently of the storage capacity .
Xbox was n’t going to bring us any more content , but was going to land a lot of new streaming users on our servers .
So , enter SSDs …
Testing our first SSD based systems
We ’d been looking at SSDs with interest for some time , as IO bottlenecks are common in any infrastructure dealing with large data volumes .
We had n’t deployed them in any live capacity before though , and this was an ideal opportunity to see whether the reality lived up to the marketing !
Having looked at a number of SSD specs and read about many of the problems early adopters had encountered , we felt as though we were in a position to make an informed decision .
So , earlier this year , we managed to get hold of some test kit to try out .
Our test rig was an 8 core system with 2 X5570 CPUs and 12 Gb RAM ( a SunFire X4170 ) .
Into this , we put 2 hard disks for the OS , and 4 Intel X25 - E SSDs .
We favoured the Intel SSDs because they ’ve had fantastic reviews , and they were officially supported in the X4170 .
The X25 - E drives advertise in excess of 35,000 read IOPS , so we were excited to see what it could do , and in testing , we were n’t disappointed .
Each single SSD can support around 7000 concurrent listeners , and the serving capacity of the machine topped out at around 30,000 concurrent connections in it ’s tested configuration – here it is half way through a test run ( wider image here ) :
Spot which devices are the SSDs … ( wider image here )
At that point its network was saturated , which was causing buffering and connection issues , so with 10 GigE cards it might have been possible to push this configuration even higher .
We tested both the 32 Gb versions ( which Sun have explicitly qualified with the X4170 ) , and the 64 Gb versions ( which they have n’t ) .
We ended up opting for the 64 Gb versions , as we needed to be able to get enough content onto the SSDs for us to serve a good number of user requests , otherwise all that IO was n’t going to do us any good .
To get these performance figures , we had to tune the Linux scheduler defaults a bit :-
echo noop >
/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
echo 32 > /sys/block/sda/queue/read_ahead_kb
This is set for each SSD – by default Linux uses scheduler algorithms that are optimised for hard drives , where each seek carries a penalty , so it ’s worth reading extra data in while the drive head is in position .
There ’s basically zero seek penalty on an SSD , so those assumptions fall down .
Going into production
Once we were happy with our test results , we needed to put the new setup into production .
Doing this involved some interesting changes to our systems .
We extended MogileFS to understand the concept of “ hot ” nodes – storage nodes that are treated preferentially when servicing requests for files .
We also implemented a “ hot class ” – when a file is put into this class , MogileFS will replicate it onto our SSD based nodes .
This allows us to continually move our most popular content onto SSDs , effectively using them as a faster layer built on top of our main disk based storage pool .
We also needed to change the way MogileFS treats disk load .
By default , it looks at the percentage utilisation figure from iostat , and tries to send requests to the most lightly - loaded disk with the requested content .
This is another assumption that breaks down when you use SSDs , as they do not suffer from the same performance degradation under load that a hard drive does ; a 95 % utilised SSD can still respond many times faster than a 10 % utilised hard drive .
So , we extended the statistics that MogileFS retrieves from iostat to also include the wait time ( await ) and the service time ( svctm ) figures , so that we have better information about device performance .
Once those changes had been made , we were ready to go live .
We used the same hardware as our final test configuration ( SunFire X4170 with Intel X25 - E SSDs ) , and we are now serving over 50 % of our streaming from these machines , which have less than 10 % of our total storage capacity .
The graph below shows when we initially put these machines live .
You can see the SSD machines starting to take up load on the right of the graph – this was with a relatively small amount of initial seed content , so the offload from the main cluster was much smaller than we ’ve since seen after filling the SSDs with even more popular tracks .
Conclusions
We all had great fun with this project , and built a new layer into our streaming infrastructure that will make it easy to scale upwards .
We ’ll be feeding our MogileFS patches back to the community , so that other MogileFS users can make use of them where appropriate and improve them further .
Finally , thanks go to all the people who put effort into making this possible – all of crew at Last .
HQ , particularly Jonty for all his work on extending MogileFS , and Laurie and Adrian for lots of work testing the streaming setup .
Also thanks to Andy Williams and Nick Morgan at Sun Microsystems for getting us an evaluation system and answering lots of questions , and to Gareth Tucker and David Byrne at Intel for their help in getting us the SSDs in time .

Paul Garner , one of CM 's associate nutters on the show , would pretend to be a cab driver ( or something similar ) and present airport tannoy announcers with a piece of paper with some names written on it to read over the PA system .
These foreign - looking and unusually spelt names appear innocent enough ... until you try to pronounce them !
These are some examples - translations are provided in case it 's not clear enough !
A splendid fellow called Martin Pointon assisted Paul in these gloriously puerile acts .
Here 's what he had to say about them ...
" The way the phonetic announcements were done is as follows :
We 'd go and sit on the balcony at Terminal 3 , directly under one of the speakers as the roof is low .
Put the DAT or tape machine in our bag with the mic poking out of the top .
We 'd look for a flight that 'd arrived in the last 40 minutes from somewhere where you 'd expect mental names , then write a letter saying " could we go and pick up , etc from flight , etc " .
This way , it looked like it'd been arranged in advance as the flight arrival details were written on the note .
We also wore an ID - style badge and carried a mobile so that we looked like taxi drivers .
One of us would get the first read out and then the other do the second .
We 'd pretend to be unable to pronounce it and then hand them the bit of paper .
Long winded , but you 've heard the results yourself - well worth it .
As you know , we got rumbled doing the " My colleague just , etc " .
They actually threatened to arrest us as apparently they 'd actually had complaints over the previous weeks !
We were toying with doing it again just to see what they 'd arrest us for , but we rang Chris and all he said was , " go to Gatwick ! " .
This is the reason the last set sound so crap ' cos Gatwick is a much noisier place and the ceilings are high , so it was difficult to get near a speaker .
We also went round both terminals as the first reading was rubbish .
The lengths we had to go to ...
This is how they were spelt - it was a long time ago and we never kept the papers , but I 'm sure this is how they were spelt ...

IF YOU live in Italy and are planning to commit a moderately severe crime — perhaps beating your children , or a white - collar offence such as cooking the books , or even stabbing your neighbour — the law might soon be of little hindrance to you .
If a bill tabled in parliament this week were to become law , it would mean you could commit any of the above offences and could expect a reasonable chance of avoiding paying a penalty .
The proposed law , which is backed by Silvio Berlusconi 's conservative government , suggests that the charges against defendants would have to be dropped two years after they were laid unless , by then , the trial has been completed .
The same two - year limit would be applied to both of the appeals to which defendants ( and prosecutors ) are subsequently entitled under Italian law , meaning that the complete legal process would have to be complete within six years .
In a court system that is overloaded , underfunded and renowned for inefficiency , the chances of completing each of the three stages in less than 24 months are low .
The proposed law , which would apply to trials already being held , excludes from its provisions defendants with a criminal record , offences for which the penalty is a jail sentence of 10 years or more , and certain serious crimes such as those related to terrorism or the mafia .
But the corporate body that represents Italy 's judges and prosecutors says the law 's effects would be “ devastating ” .
It estimates that more than 100,000 trials would have to be scrapped .
In addition , the proposed law would have effects beyond Italy 's borders .
It would apply , for example , to copyright violation , bribery , the marketing of counterfeit goods and the defrauding by Italians of EU funds .
One of the trials it would halt stems from the 2003 Parmalat fraud whose victims include foreign as well as Italian bondholders .
The law sounds like madness , but not if you are Mr Berlusconi .
Last month the constitutional court overturned a law that had been introduced by his government that gave him ( and three other senior officials ) immunity from prosecution .
Italy 's prime minister is already a defendant in two trials , for tax fraud and bribery , and other investigations are ongoing .
If the bill were approved by parliament , where his coalition has a substantial majority , it would cancel both the trials and make it very likely that any charges brought against him in future would be ' timed out ' .
In any case Mr Berlusconi appears not to be taking any chances .
On Wednesday , one of his MPs tabled another bill that would restore the immunity that all Italy 's national lawmakers enjoyed until 1993 .
Either or both of the proposed laws could run into stiff resistance if referred to the constitutional court .
But their introduction makes it ever more likely that the rest of Mr Berlusconi 's time in government will be dominated ( as was his previous spell ) by his legal struggles .
All this will prove to be an unhelpful distraction from more important matters , such as trying to get Italy out of recession and to deliver much - needed economic and social reforms .
Mr Berlusconi's supporters argue that introducing time limits will promote swifter justice .
Maurizio Gasparri , the leader of his party in the Senate and the bill 's main sponsor , suggests that “ if the magistrates worked harder , trials would be quicker ” .
But he acknowledges that they also need better resources and says that funding for the courts will be increased in the 2010 budget .
Even if the government were to deliver on that promise , it will take years to undo the decades of neglect to which Italian justice has been subject .
In the meantime , if Mr Gasparri and his leader have their way , Italy would become an even more lawless society than it is already .
Anti-socialist Bachmann got $ 250 K in federal farm subsidies
Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) — so fond of accusing the Obama administration of foisting socialism on an unwilling America — has apparently been the recipient of about a quarter of million bucks in government handouts .
Liberal site Truthdig links to an Environmental Working Group analysis of federal agricultural subsidies and found that the Bachmann family farm , managed by her father - in - law until his recent death , received $ 251,000 in farm payments between 1995 and 2006 .
Bachmann ’s financial disclosure forms indicate her stake in the Wisconsin farm is worth up to $ 250,000 .
Her income from the farm has grown from $ 2,000 a year a few years back to as much as $ 50,000 for 2008 .
Truthdig calls her a " Welfare Queen " :
Bachmann 's family farm received $ 251,973 in federal subsidies between 1995 and 2006 .
The farm had been managed by Bachmann 's recently deceased father - in - law and took in roughly $ 20,000 in 2006 and $ 28,000 in 2005 , with the bulk of the subsidies going to dairy and corn .
Both dairy and corn are heavily subsidized — or " socialized " — businesses in America ( in 2005 alone , Washington spent $ 4.8 billion propping up corn prices ) and are subject to strict government price controls .
Bachmann is n't alone in her selective socialism : EWG found that the top four districts receiving the largest ag payments are represented by conservative Republicans .
1. 3rd district of Nebraska ( Rep. Adrian Smith - Republican ) - $ 1,736,923,011 in subsidies go to 51,702 recipients .
2 . 1st district of Kansas ( Rep. Jerry Moran - Republican ) - $ 1,315,979,151 in subsidies go to 75,802 recipients .
3 . 4th district of Iowa ( Rep. Tom Latham - Republican ) - $ 1,288,622,912 in subsidies go to 35,696 recipients .
4 . 9th district of Texas ( Rep. Randy Neugebauer - Republican ) - $ 1,227,192,312 in subsidies go to 21,290 recipients .

In a speech at Camp Lejeune , N.C. , on Feb. 27 , 2009 , President Barack Obama pledged to end the combat mission in Iraq by Aug. 31 , 2010 .
And speaking more directly to the issue of permanent bases , he said , " I intend to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011 . "
The administration 's position was reinforced by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in a Sept. 4 , 2009 , interview when he was asked by an Al Jazeera reporter whether the Obama administration would stick to its pledge not to build any permanent military bases in Iraq .
" Absolutely , " Gates said .
" Unless there is some new agreement or some new negotiation , which would clearly be on Iraqi terms .
But we will not have any permanent bases in Iraq .
We have no interest in permanent bases in Iraq .
And we are now planning on withdrawing all American military forces by the end of 2011 . "
Lastly , it was a position clearly written into the National Defense Authorization Act for 2010 passed by Congress and signed by President Obama on Oct. 28 , 2009 .
Section 1221 states , " No funds appropriated pursuant to an authorization of appropriations in this Act may be obligated or expended ... to establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq . "
It 's a provision that has been included in defense authorization legislation for several years in a row , dating back to the Bush administration .
Promises kept can always be broken in the future , and we 'll revisit this one if things change -- particularly as we move closer toward the deadlines for troop removal -- but the Obama administration has not wavered from its pledge and the president signed a bill that specifically prohibits defense funds from being used to permanently station U.S. armed forces in Iraq .
We think that 's enough to move this one to Promise Kept .
Actor , philosopher , fitness and nutrition expert , and martial arts master , Bruce Lee changed the world .
Without Bruce Lee , there would be no mixed martial arts .
No Jackie Chan .
No Chuck Norris .
No “ Kill Bill . ”
And certainly the entire video game industry would not be the same without the life of Bruce Lee as inspiration .
November 27th is Bruce Lee ’s birthday .
To honor the man who changed the world with his Jeet Kune Do , we ’ve compiled this list of video game characters who are simply Bruce Lee but with a different name .
Yes , there have been video games starring Bruce Lee , but naming them would n’t be half as fun .
There are certainly more than the few we ’ve named here , but we thought you ’d enjoy this compilation nevertheless .
Without further ado , here are Nine Video Game Characters That Are Actually Bruce Lee .
Fei Long – Street Fighter Series
Fei Long is quite possibly the thinnest veil of Bruce Lee that has ever existed .
Even their names are similar .
Bruce Lee ’s name translates to “ Little Dragon ” while Fei Long ’s name translates to “ Flying Dragon . ”
Fei Long first entered into the Street Fighter tournaments in 1993 with Street Fighter II .
Capcom openly admits that he is a pastiche of the real life Bruce Lee .
Everything from his appearance , his fighting style that can be changed on the fly , his back story as an action film star and a master of his own brand of Kung Fu , down to Fei Long ’s war cries have been modeled after Bruce Lee himself .
— — — — —
Li Long – Soulcalibur Series
Check out that pose at :57 !
Li Long is another Bruce Lee in disguise .
Though the similarities are not immediately present because of their physical differences , rest assured that Li Long IS Bruce Lee .
The similarities lie in their similar choice of weapon .
Li Long first appeared in Soul Edge and later appeared in Soulcalibur III .
Being the odd man out , Li Long did not carry any bladed type of wapon .
Instead , Li Long ’s choice of weapons is the nunchaku as was Bruce Lee’s .
Players will also take notice that Li Long is the most vocal of all the warriors in the Soulcalibur series .
His “ woops ! ” and “ wa - taaahs ! ” are incredibly similar to Bruce Lee’s .
Perhaps the dead giveaway that Li Long IS Bruce Lee is when Li Long is knocked on his back , he can still roll and fight with his nunchaku similar to Bruce Lee in the film “ Fist of Fury . ”
— — — — —
Liu Kang – Mortal Kombat Series
The grueling battle ends with a victory of Li Long .
Another thinly disguised Bruce Lee is the legendary Liu Kang from the Mortal Kombat series .
Protector of the earth and Shaolin Monk , Liu Kang ’s fighting style and war cries also mimic Bruce Lee ’s to a near mirror image .
Similar to Fei Long , players can change Liu Kang ’s fighting style , a philosophy of Bruce Lee’s .
One of Liu Kang ’s fighting stances is actually called Jun Fan , which is Bruce Lee ’s birth name .
Though Liu Kang ’s appearance has changed over the years , in his original design , Liu Kang was shirtless and sported short Bruce Lee hair .
— — — — —
That Character From Rag Doll Kung Fu
Liu Kang wins .
Fatality .
Despite the fact the characters in Rag Doll Kung
Fu are entirely nameless , you all know exactly which character “ that ” character is .
He ’s Bruce Lee , damnit .
And as a matter of fact , many of the supporting fighters are ripped right from “ Enter the Dragon ” as well .
Sure , you can mix and match his body parts , but there ’s really no denying it .
Bruce Lee lives on ( in a strange , sick , and somehow awesome way ) inside the ragdoll - like kung - fu characters from Rag Doll Kung Fu .

Hitmonlee – Pokémon Series
The Bruce Lee look - alike is even sporting some sweet Bruce sunglasses in this trailer !
Coming in dead last for the Bruce Lee look - alike contest , is Hitmonlee .
He ’s a 4 ’ 11 ” , human - ish shaped , male - only fighting - style pokémon that evolves from Tyrogue .
His name is broken down to by the three syllables .
“ Hit ” meaning he ’s a fighting pokémon .
“ Mon ” is an abbreviation for “ monster . ” “ Lee ” to honor Bruce Lee. Dubious ?
Hitmonlee ’s brother pokémon is Hitmonchan ; an allusion to Jackie Chan .
— — — — —
Kim Dragon – World Heroes Series
Skip to 1:45 and you ’ll see the Sucker Punch .
Kim Dragon from World Heroes is a near picture perfect perfect representation of Bruce Lee in pixel form .
Kim Dragon is a famous martial artist from action films .
Unlike Bruce Lee , however , Kim Dragon supposedly hails from South Korea instead of China .
Humorously , you ’ll sometimes hear people referring to Kim Dragon as a Fei Long ripoff .
Silly non-Bruce Lee fans !
They say the cutest things !
— — — — —
Jann Lee – Dead or Alive Series
World Heroes 2 ( The REAL Bruce Lee would never go down to a chump like that . )
We have another fighter with the name “ Lee ” and known as “ the dragon ” in our list !
Yay !
Jann Lee from the Dead or Alive series does n’t have much for back story aside from striving to be the best fighter in the world , a similar goal to Bruce Lee .
Jann is mortal enemies with Ryu Hyabusa , and while he fights shirtless in trackpants * cough cough bruceleedidthattoo cough cough * , he wails in Bruce Lee - bird - like fashion .
Again , the visual similarities are astounding .
If you just un-anime and push down Jann ’s hair and slap on a sweet pair of sunglasses , you have yourself a computerized Bruce Lee doppelganger .

Marshall and Forest Law – Tekken Series
Jan Lee rockin’ the yellow tracksuit !
Before everyone gets all hopping mad , this entry counts as two since there are two fighters in here .
It ’s a father and son team , and they ’re both Bruce Lee .
Marshall Law , the father , is a Chinese - American fighter whose fighting style according to Tekken lore is actually Jeet Kune Do , the form of martial arts that Bruce Lee created .
Hats off to Tekken for not lazily calling it Kung Fu. Marshall ’s outfit in Tekken 2 even resembles the Bruce Lee character ’s outfit from “ Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story . ”
His appearance in the original Tekken is similar to Bruce ’s in “ Fist of Fury . ”
Forest Law is basically the same character as his father and therefore also Bruce Lee .
Still need more proof ?
Forest Law has a yellow jumpsuit similar to the one Bruce Lee made famous … and subsequently later everyone thought that Uma Thurman made it cool in “ Kill Bill Vol . 1 ”
WASHINGTON – The nation ’s top labor , civil rights and community leaders joined forces here today and put forward a bold program they say is needed to create millions of new jobs and to lift the economy from the depths of the recession .
At a gathering sponsored by the labor - backed Economic Policy Institute they made it clear that all of the organizations they represent agree on a 5 - point agenda that must be enacted if the economy is to begin working for the broad majority of Americans .
The program they are demanding includes extension of the unemployment benefits lifeline for millions ; the commitment of hundreds of millions in federal dollars to rebuild America ’s schools , roads and infrastructure , including “ green ” jobs in alternative energy and energy conservation fields ; massive aid to state and local governments to maintain vital services ; the direct creation of federally funded jobs in the “ hardest hit communities , ” both in minority and other communities that have been devastated ; and the use of remaining TARP ( bank bailout ) funds to get credit flowing to small and medium businesses that would be a direct help to Main Street , rather than Wall Street .
Richard Trumka , president of the AFL - CIO , declared , “ While the job crisis would have been even worse without President Obama ’s economic stimulus program which has saved or created 1 million jobs , the depth of the crisis demands that we do more before more people lose their homes , their health care and their hope . ”
Trumka also called for the passage of the Employee Free Choice
Act as a way to make sure good jobs are created through collective bargaining .
He also acknowledged harder - hit African American and Latino communities in the jobless numbers .
Joblessness is an American problem , he said , urging unity on the economic fight .
Janet Murguia , president of the National Council of La Raza , focused like a laser beam on why , in the interests of all workers , there must be a special effort at targeting job creation in the hardest hit minority communities .
“ More than eight months ago unemployment in the Latino communities broke 10 percent , ” she said , “ and now that it has done that across the board , we see plans for a jobs summit in December in Washington .
Bold federal action is needed in the hardest hit communities to relieve the pain and suffering there but also to keep the pain and suffering from spreading everywhere else , which it is doing now and which it will continue to do if we do n’t get targeted relief to the hardest hit . ”
Murguia fully endorsed extensions of unemployment benefits but pointed out that many of the unemployed in minority communities are currently not collecting those benefits .
Wade Henderson , president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights endorsed the concept of targeting job creation efforts to hardest hit communities and noted that such efforts will benefit not only minority , but also white workers .
“ The jobs crisis is so big that it is affecting all workers , ” he said .
“ There are white workers who are experiencing economic pain that was once experienced by minority workers living under segregation . ”
Benjamin Todd Jealous , president of the NAACP , said , “ Jobs must be seen as the first and most critical issue in this crisis .
It was lack of jobs in minority communities that made us talk about a moratorium on foreclosures in those communities four years ago .
Now this is an issue everywhere because of the jobs crisis .
“ People do n’t want to hear that they have to wait for a rejuvenated finance industry or for something else to create jobs somewhere down the line .
They need action now , and it has to get from Wall Street , not just down to Main Street , but all the way to Back Street . ”
Jealous called the long - term jobs crisis in the African American community a “ canary in the great American coal mine . ”
Jealous took on The New York Times recent story “ NAACP prods Obama on job losses . ”
“ The president gets it , ” he said .
“ The pressure is going to be on those in Congress who do n’t get it yet . ”
Deepak Bhargava , executive director of the Center for Community Change , said the federal government must create , on the neighborhood level , jobs that result in the actual improvements needed in the communities .
“ Like what the government did in the 1930 ’s , these jobs will have a long - lasting positive effect , ” he said .
Representatives of the media gathered for the event asked the leaders how they expected to muster the political support for bold job creation measures , given concern about the size of the federal deficit .
“ The labor movement has been knocking on millions of doors all over this country , ” said Trumka , “ and we ’ve never been asked about the deficit .
People ask about their jobs , health care or whether they ’ll be able to send their kids to school .
There is a very broad understanding out there that the only real way to fix the deficit problem is first to get everyone working . ”
“ Elections have a way of bringing things into focus , ” said Henderson .
“ When it comes to the 2010 elections be assured that the coalition you see being formed here will have great success in holding all those people in Congress accountable on the issue of what they did or did not do when it comes to job creation .
A pile of excuses or an attack on the president is not going to do it . ”
The press conference was also streamed live on the web and reported on the social media site , Twitter .
Whether you work at home or in an workplace , there are going to be some days when you just ca n’t make it to the gym , even when you have the willpower and power .
I ’ve been working with Men ’s Health since the summer time of 2000 , when as a graduate pupil , …
President Barack Obama is considering setting a provisional target for cutting America 's huge greenhouse gas emissions , removing the greatest single obstacle to a landmark global agreement to fight climate change .
The Observer has learnt that administration officials have been consulting international negotiators and key players on Capitol Hill about signing up to a provisional target at the UN global warming summit in Copenhagen , now less than three weeks away .
Todd Stern , the state department climate change envoy , said the administration recognised that America had to come forward with a target for cutting its emissions .
The US , which with China is responsible for 40 % of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions , is the only major developed nation yet to table an offer .
" What we are looking at is to see whether we could put down essentially a provisional number that would be contingent on our legislation , " Stern said from Copenhagen , where he was meeting Danish officials .
" We are looking at that , there are people we need to consult with . "
A provisional target – if accepted by other nations – would solve Obama 's dilemma .
The Senate will not have passed a domestic law before Copenhagen , meaning that , if he makes an offer there , it could subsequently be rejected in Washington .
But if he makes no offer , the deal is likely to crash anyway , and with it hopes of rapidly combating global warming .
Stern did not go into detail on the level of emissions cuts being considered , but it is thought likely that a provisional target would be a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 14 - 20 % by 2020 , compared with 2005 levels .
The White House and state department have also discussed the idea of putting forward a range of targets rather than a specific figure .
" I think the president has several options , " said Jonathan Lash , president of the World Resources Institute .
" One which seems to be under discussions inside the administration is to offer a range : to say " here is what we hope to be able to propose " and that range might go from what the president has always committed to since his campaign – 14 % – to the highest number in any pending legislation , which is 20 % in the Senate . "
The House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill in June that would cut US emissions by 17 % .
A proposal now before the Senate would cut emissions by 20 % , but a number of key Democratic senators have said the target is too stringent .
Even at the higher end , such figures fall short of the emissions targets adopted by other industrialised countries in Europe and Japan , and recommended by scientists to avoid the worst ravages of climate change .
Many negotiators are frustrated with America – especially given the high expectations for the Obama presidency .
" One could perhaps argue that this could have been a much higher priority and this should perhaps have been pushed before any of the other initiatives the administration has taken , particularly given the fact that there was a deadline of December for getting an agreement , " said RK Pachauri , chairman of the intergovernment panel on climate change .
Obama and other world leaders have already conceded that Copenhagen will not produce a legally binding treaty .
But the leaders are looking to the meeting to seal firm political agreement about specific action plans by the industrialised and rapidly emerging economies that can go into immediate effect .
But ensuring success at Copenhagen carries a risk that could ultimately defeat efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions , Lash warned .
Setting too strong a provisional target could provoke a backlash from Congress , which might damage efforts to pass climate change laws in the US .
" Without the US passing legislation , we can't move an overall agreement , " Lash said .
" My greatest concern is that the administration does nothing in Copenhagen , because that ultimately undercuts everybody 's efforts to achieve an international agreement . "
Democratic leaders in the Senate are growing increasingly wary about taking up a controversial climate change bill .
The Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , said that leaders would not turn to a bill until March 2010 – but even that date is in doubt because of congressional elections in November .
On Thursday , John McCain , Obama 's presidential opponent and a sponsor of past climate change legislation , said about the backers of the current bill : " Obviously , they 're going nowhere . "
Despite the paralysis in the Senate , Obama has been edging towards a concrete commitment to cutting America 's emissions .
During his summit in Beijing with China 's Hu Jintao , Obama said America would come forward with emission reductions targets so long as China offered specific measures of its own .
But the administration is mindful of a re-run of the 1990s , when the Senate voted down ratification of the Kyoto treaty by 99 - 0 , despite the US having already committed to it internationally .
Such concerns make it more likely that other nations would view favourably a more modest provisional target at Copenhagen .
Stern said there was a generally positive reaction in the international community to the idea of a provisional target .
" On the one hand , people are keen on having the United States put a number down , " Stern said .
" On the other hand , people are extraordinarily keen on getting [ US ] legislation done and do n't want us taking steps that will make that more difficult . "

Ms Summers was murdered by Brian Taylor in October 2008 Greater Manchester Police failed in its dealings with a woman who was killed by her ex-partner , a police watchdog says .
Katie Summers , 24 , was stabbed to death by Brian Taylor in October 2008 at the home she shared with their children .
Despite 11 call - outs connected to the couple , police did not recognise the risk , the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) report said .
GMP said Ms Summers ' death was " tragic " and that work was under way to improve the way it responds to domestic abuse .
Police had contact with Ms Summers , also known as Katie Boardman , five times in the four days before her death .
In total , they visited 11 times between June 2007 and 7 October 2008 .
But two days after their last visit , Taylor stabbed Ms Summers in her Farnworth home .
There was a total failure to consider the history and the increasing risk and as a result the troubled relationship continued to fester
Naseem Malik , IPCC commissioner
He had been arrested on 7 October , in connection with an unconnected incident , but was released later that night .
In February at Manchester Crown Court , Taylor , 30 , of Chorley Old Road , Bolton , pleaded guilty to murder .
He was jailed for life and must serve a minimum term of 17 years and six months .
Naseem Malik , IPCC commissioner for the North West of England , who wrote the report , said : " There were a number of failings on the part of Greater Manchester Police and individual officers and staff in their dealings with Katie Boardman . "
However , she said no single failing contributed to Ms Boardman 's death .
She added : " It can not be said that had the failings not happened Katie would be alive today . "
Ms Malik also said Ms Summers was not always forthcoming with information to the police .

Her investigation found a lack of a proper overview of incidents by individual officers , call handlers , and staff in the Public Protection Investigations Unit ( PPIU ) .
She said : " There was a total failure to consider the history and the increasing risk and as a result the troubled relationship continued to fester . "
Ms Malik has recommended one officer who dealt with Ms Summers be disciplined .
Other failings included incorrectly categorising incidents so they did not come to the attention of the PPIU .
After one incident , an officer requested a member of the Domestic Violence Unit visit Ms Summers but the request was never acted upon .
Brian Taylor was jailed for life after admitting murder in February Ms Summers ' sister , Sarah , said : " They thought she was wasting their time .
They did n't realise how scared she was .
She had good reason to be .
" It is a police officer 's job to notice when someone is in danger and when someone is scared for their life .
" I think the police really need to look at how seriously they are taking domestic violence and get more training .
They need to care more about the victim and victim 's family rather than wasting police time . "
The commissioner has made several recommendations to GMP including changing its systems in dealing with domestic violence .
GMP Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney said : " The IPCC investigation found that GMP provided an appropriate response to individual incidents but did not identify a pattern of problems .
" A domestic abuse steering group has been established to review all aspects of our response to this type of crime and all front - line staff are in the process of undertaking dedicated training on how to deal with vulnerable people . "

I ’ve been writing this fan fiction since March 2009 , and uploading each chapter to a number of forums , including TheSixthAxis .
Now , as I write the final three chapters , this fan fiction is going to be coming to TSA every Sunday .
Just as a reminder , as with all fanfictions , it ’s best if you ’ve played the entire series if you want to get the best out of this story and not run into many spoilers .
On a similar note , if you ’ve already read further ahead elsewhere , do n’t give away any of the plot in future chapters before they happen .
The story gets way better as it progresses , so hang in there too .
Disclaimer :
This story contains violent scenes that some younger readers may find disturbing .
Departure
Snake lay against the dusty gravestone , the life ’s story of the corpse buried beneath him crumbling away on a slab of rock .
This was his future .
Eventually information fades , no matter how much you hold onto it .
He held the gun in his greying hands .
Just another death .
No -one would understand , nor care .
Meryl .
Where is she now ?
Not that she ’d care for a man like David .
Not now .
He brought the gun to his mouth and felt his jaw clamp down upon its cold metal .
Eyes closed .
He was ready .
He knew what must be done .
Knowing his next breath would be his last , David swallowed , tensed every muscle in his body , took a deep breath and pulled hard on the trigger .
…
He heard the gun ’s bang echo into the blackness .
Nothing .
Just nothing .
His feeling faded , as did the sound around him .
And then it happened .
Something glistened in front of him .
It was so blurry that his quickly fading memory lost all hope of processing it .
But it became more vivid .
And he could see it .
As it drew closer to him , he could make out blurred lettering .
How was this possible ?
His hearing came back .
A beep .
An extremely loud beep .
But it was drowned out by a different sound .
The ringing of a telephone .
His vision came back to him .
His sense of touch , smell and taste all returned .
He could taste the blood in his mouth , the smell of chilled air .
Was this death ?
He touched his ear , as a familiar voice recited familiar words .
A new bodysuit ?
No , the colonel lied to him in his ear .
Snake shouted back … until it struck him …
He was back on Shadow Moses Island .
“ No … ” Snake whispered down the codec .
But before he could think , an alarm sounded .
Had he been spotted ?
Snake threw himself to the ground .
Looking up , an elevator ahead had swiftly reached ground floor .
He soon crept past very suspcting guards , and hit the control pannel .
The lift groaned into life once more and pushed him upwards into the chilling air .
Something was not right about this , and now David had time to realise .
Removing his diving gear , flashes of what was , what is and what will be appeared infront of his eyes .
The graveyard …
Had he died ?
He had felt the bullet force its way through the back of the throat and out of the other side .
He had fallen numb just as he slumped down , limp and lifeless on the slab .
But now he was here .
Back on Shadow Moses .
And those guards .
That was n’t post 2010 gear …
The genome soliders .
Events ca n’t repeat themselves can they ?
Snake reached the top floor .
A helicopter took off infront of him , leaving a snowy baron wasteland of a building ’s entrance .
The codec rang .
But Snake did n’t pick it up .
He knew the way in .
After hearing a well known “ Who ’s footprints are these ? ”
Snake was soon back in the air ducts , along with the rats who showed him the way .
It gave him a sense of comfort being in these dark tunnels .
But they soon reminded him of resting in a coffin and he persued the rats without futher thought .
His ear rang .
What a pain .
He still had blood in his mouth , and his ear now felt as though it would implode .
He opened the codec for a conversation .
Master Miller .
Snake soon felt at ease again as he fell into a running conversation with the man .
But then he remembered .
Sitting himself up inside the now claustrophobic tunnel , his hand started trembling .
This was n’t Master .
This was Liquid , one of David ’s clone brothers .
What should he do ?
The man was telling serious lies in his ear , and Snake knew the real man would be found dead in a matter of hours .
Snake made a quick decision .
“ Liquid . ”
“ I ’m sorry ? ” Master sounded insulted after Snake had interupted him .
“ I know who you are . ”
“ What the hell is going on ? ” questioned Campell .
“ Is Nastasha Romanenko there ? ”
Snake asked .
“ How did you know ?
That information was not released yet ” .
“ Campell , may I speak with you on a private line ? ”
There was a short silence .
“ I ’m sure you can share it with all of us , Snake ” Nastasha introduced herself .
“ Can I ask someone to check Master Miller ’s house .
Just to see if everything is okay ? ”
Snake spoke , with slight panic in his voice .
“ Snake , is everything okay ? ” asked Master Miller .
“ No .
No it ’s not . ” replied Snake .
US House Passes Historic Wall St. Reform Act
The US House of Representatives voted today to pass H.R. 4173 , the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 .
Sponsored by Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , this bill would protect consumers and investors , provide for financial regulatory reform , and regulate the over - the - counter derivatives markets .
Passage of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act was relatively close , with a final vote of 223-202 , and falling nearly along party lines .
The final tally can be seen on a national map at the New York Times .
No Republican voted for the reform of Wall St. , and 27 conservative Democrats joined them in voting no .
OpenCongress.org reports , “ This is comprehensive legislation to overhaul regulations in the financial sector .
It would establish a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency to regulate products like home mortgages , car loans and credit cards , give the Treasury Department new authority to place non-bank financial firms , like insurance companies into receivership and regulate the over - the - counter derivatives market . ”
They go on , “ Directs the Comptroller General to audit and report to Congress on all actions taken by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve Board ) and the Federal Reserve Banks during the current economic crisis pursuant to specified authority granted under the Federal Reserve Act . “
This is the most important financial overhaul in a long time .
According to Americans for Fairness in Lending , one of the grassroots organizations that have been fighting for its passage , “ It ’s been a long road and the legislation has gone through many different stages and overcome several daunting challenges .
Even today , damaging amendments that would have made reform impossible were defeated , leaving us with a bill we can all be proud of . ”
The New York Times reported , “ The bill ’s principal provisions establish a process for dismantling large , failing financial institutions ; set up a council to identify and regulate firms that are so big , interconnected or risky that they need heightened supervision to keep them from bringing down the whole financial system ; create a new consumer financial - protection agency to squelch unfair and abusive practices ; and for the first time , regulate over - the - counter derivatives markets .
The bill also contains provisions on executive pay , investor protection , credit ratings , hedge funds and insurance . ”
This reform effort was long overdue and many people thought it would never come .
The financial collapse last year turned a recession into a near economic catastrophe , and there have been calls for stronger regulations since this time .
Mashups Using Clojure
Turkey sits on top of the North Anatolian Fault , so earthquakes are something that happens a lot here .
This mashup was one of the first problems I tackled in Clojure , I was going to throw it away but figured it may be use to someone else or to me later on .
Kandilli observatory and earthquake research institute releases latitude , longitude and magnitude information for the the last 200 earthquakes , so I grabed the list of earthquakes from their site , and pin them on Google Maps , that way I got a nice visual representation .
The data we are interested in looks like the following , ,
Date Time Latit( N ) Long( E ) Depth ( km ) MD ML MS Region ----------
-------- -------- ------- ---------- ------------ -----------
2009.12.17 04:56:13 37.4865 35.6947 4.0 3.4 -.- -.- KOZAN
So we begin with a structure to hold the earthquakes ,
( ns eartquake ( :use clojure.contrib.str-utils ) ( :use clojure.contrib.duck-streams ) ( :use clojure.contrib.prxml ) ( : import ( java.net URL ) ( java.io BufferedReader InputStreamReader ) ) ) ( defstruct earth - quake : date : time : latitude : longitude : depth : md :ml :ms : location )
Then we need to grab the page containing the data we are interested in ,
( defn fetch - url [ address ] ( let [url ( URL. address ) ] ( with - open [ stream ( .openStream url ) ] ( let [ buf ( BufferedReader .
( InputStreamReader .
stream " windows - 1254 " ) ) ]
( apply str ( interleave ( line - seq buf ) ( repeat
ewline ) ) ) ) ) ) )
We take each line and split it into nine parts not ten because last column is variable length , and apply the struct on it , that way we get a vector of earthquake structures .
( defn parse [ data ] ( map #( apply struct earth - quake ( re-split # " \s + " % 9 ) ) ( re-split # "
+ " data ) ) )
The data portion of the page we are interested in begins just before the first earthquake with the dashes up to the closing pre tag , a simple regex will match it , and pass it to parse ,
( defn eartquakes [ ] ( let [ page ( fetch-url " http://www.koeri.boun.edu.tr/scripts/lst9.asp " ) data ( re-find #"(?s)------------
-----------
(.*? ) </ pre > " page ) ] ( parse ( data 1 ) ) ) )
We have all the data we need to build the mashup , this will be kinda reverse but I am going with the order functions are defined so when appended one after another it will be working example , markers function will build a vector of createMarker calls for each earthquake , createMarkers function is defined in Javascript which will just put a pin to a given coordinate with the string representation of the structure as the description ,
( defn markers [ earth - quakes ] ( map #( str " createMarker ( " ( : latitude % ) " , " ( : longitude % ) " , ' " ( apply str ( interleave % ( repeat " < br > " ) ) ) " ' ) ; " ) earth - quakes ) )
This will result in 200 createMarker calls , which will be placed into the resulting web page .
Following template is bare minimum that is required to show a google map with the addition of the createMarkers function ,
( defn template [ earth - quakes ] [ : html [ : head [ : meta {:http-equiv " Content - Type " : content " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " } ] [ : title " Earthquake Mashup " ] [ : script {:src ( str " http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&v=2&sensor " " =false&key=abcd " ) : type " text / javascript " } ] [ : script {: type " text/ javascript " } [ : raw ! ( str " function initialize ( ) { if ( GBrowserIsCompatible ( ) ) { var map = new GMap2( document.getElementById( \" map_canvas\ " ) ) ; map.setMapType(G_SATELLITE_MAP ) ; map.setCenter(new GLatLng( 39.3113 , 32.8038 ) , 7 ) ; map.setUIToDefault ( ) ; function createMarker ( lat , long , desc ) { var point = new GLatLng ( lat , long ) ; var marker = new GMarker ( point ) ; GEvent.addListener( marker , \" click\ " , function ( ) { marker.openInfoWindowHtml(desc ) ; } ) ; map.addOverlay( marker ) ; } " ) ( apply str ( markers earth - quakes ) ) ( str " } } " ) ] ] ] [ : body {:onload " initialize ( ) " : onunload " GUnload ( ) " } [ : div { :id " map_canvas " : style " width : 100 % ; height : 100 % " } ] ] ] )
This will switch the map to satellite view , center it roughly on the center of Turkey and place the markers on the map , all that is needed now is to spit out a html file containing all the data ,
( defn mash - up [ ] ( spit " mash.html " ( with - out - str ( prxml ( template ( eartquakes ) ) ) ) ) )
Of course it is not practical to click on a HTML file every time we want to view the data so we need a function to automatically show the spited file , this will only work on Mac OS X but I am sure there is way to achieve the same effect on other OSs .
The Pentagon has responded to the massacre at an army base in Texas by deciding to screen all United States defence services for staff who are unstable and potentially violent .
News of the urgent review broke as the Pentagon revealed that soldier suicides this year would set another record .
Last week , 13 people were killed at Fort Hood in Texas when an army psychiatrist allegedly opened fire .
Now the military has to satisfy itself that there are not other potentially dangerous service members who could repeat the gruesome massacre at Fort Hood somewhere else .
And more broadly , the Pentagon is examining how all the military services keep a watch on potential problems in their ranks .
The Army Chief of Staff , General George Casey , had announced his own internal investigation .
There were reports it would start with the Walter Reed military hospital , where alleged Fort Hood gunman army Major Nidal Hassan spent six years .
It would investigate how the military missed signs of Major Hassan 's instability and potential violence .
But that investigation now looks as though it will include all defence services .
The massacre was to have been the subject of the Senate Homeland Security committee hearing on Thursday but the White House has refused to provide any government officials as witnesses .
The White House has also taken control of the congressional briefings on the massacre , with committee chairs all told briefings would be handled by the president 's national Security Council due to the sensitive and high - profile nature of the case .
Mental illness , suicide
That case has also thrown a light on mental illness within the US military .
Today General Peter Chiarelli - the army vice chief of staff - released figures showing for the fifth year in a row suicides in the US army would set a new record .
" As of 16th November , the army has reported 140 active duty suicides , which is equivalent to our total in 2008 with a month and a half remaining in the year , " he said .
Those statistics do not reveal the whole picture because they do not include figures on people after they have left the military .
A congressional research service report last year found that the real incidence of suicide among veterans simply is not known .
But based on figures from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention , Veterans Affairs estimated that 18 veterans a day - or 6,500 a year - take their lives .
General Chiarelli says the cause of the rising suicide rate among active service members is unknown .
About one - third of the suicides are among soldiers who have not been deployed to a combat zone .
" Over the past eight months , every suicide has been briefed to me , " General Chiarelli said .
" And although we have made changes to army policy based on many of the lessons learned , we still have n't found any statistically significant causal linkage that would allow us to effectively predict human behaviour .
" The reality is , there is no simple answer .
Each suicide case is as unique as the individuals themselves . "
Preventing suicides
At the beginning of last month , the US army began what it called a comprehensive soldier fitness program .
In an era where US troops take multiple tours of duty with minimal breaks at home , Brigadier General Rhonda Cornum said there needed to be a greater emphasis on mental wellbeing .
" We have spent a lot of time historically on training physical fitness and technical excellence in the army , but not psychological fitness , " she said .
" And all three are really essential in this era of persistent conflict . "
Basic training now includes anti-stress programs as part of a broader effort to help soldiers deal with the after - effects of combat and prevent suicides .

The husband of a pregnant Egyptian woman killed in a German courtroom has described how her alleged attacker stabbed her to death in front of him .
He testified as the trial of Alex W , a 29 - year - old Russian - born German , opened in Dresden , in the same courtroom where Marwa Sherbini was killed in July .
The defendant had been there to appeal against a fine for calling Ms Sherbini a " terrorist " and an " Islamist " .
Husband Elwy Ali Okaz said he had tried to shield his wife as the attack began .
Her alleged attacker had " continued to stab her when she was already lying on the floor " , Mr Okaz said .
Elwy Ali Okaz tried to protect his pregnant wife from her attacker Mr Okaz , who identified Alex W to the court as the killer , was himself stabbed as he tried to protect his wife and also accidentally shot in the leg by a security guard who initially believed him to be the attacker .
He arrived at court on crutches , wearing a badge showing his wife 's face .
The attack caused outrage in the Muslim world , with many Muslim leaders accusing Germany of Islamophobia following the killing .
They said the country , which has the second - biggest Muslim population in Western Europe , had been too slow to condemn it .
Protection BBC Berlin correspondent Steve Rosenberg says 200 police officers were deployed at the Dresden courthouse as the trial opened , to protect the defendant .
Alex W , who is charged with murder , attempted murder and dangerous bodily harm , has been the subject of death threats .
Anyone attending the hearing had to pass through airport - style scanners , and a bullet - proof glass screen was installed in the dock , our correspondent says .
Photographers crowded round as the alleged attacker was led into the courtroom in handcuffs - his face covered by a hood , a hat , sunglasses and a scarf , our correspondent adds .
He was then fined 50 euros ( $ 75 ; £ 46 ) by the judge , Birgit Wiegand , for refusing to remove his sunglasses , although he did uncover the rest of his head .
Judge Wiegand told the court that the trial would try to get " to the bottom of the circumstances " surrounding Ms Sherbini 's death .
Prosecutors say the defendant - an unemployed Russian - born German national - was motivated by a " hatred of non-Europeans and Muslims " .
He reportedly suffers from depression .
However , court - appointed psychiatric experts said they had not found any evidence of diminished responsibility .
' Hatred '
The case began with an argument in a playground in 2008 .
Ms Sherbini , a pharmacist , is said to have asked the defendant to let her child use a playground swing he was sitting on .
He allegedly refused and instead called her abusive names .
Egyptians want the maximum possible sentence for the alleged killer
She later took the defendant to court and he was fined 780 euros ( $ 1,170 ; £ 718 ) for defamation .
But when he returned to the courtroom for the appeal on 1 July this year , prosecutors say he smuggled in an 18 cm ( 7in ) kitchen knife and stabbed Ms Sherbini at least 16 times with it .
The 31 - year - old , who was three - months pregnant with her second child , bled to death in full view of her husband and their three - year - old son .
The trial is expected to conclude by 11 November .
Axel Koehler , president of the German Central Council of Muslims , said his community expected a " strong conviction " .
" We 're following the trial with great interest , in particular because our women and girls are afraid and already feel discriminated against , " he said .
Ms Sherbini , who wore a headscarf , was dubbed " the martyr of the Hijab " .
Thousands attended her funeral in Egypt , some chanting " Death to Germany " , and there were also mass protests in Iran .
Egypt 's ambassador to Germany , Ramzi Izz al - Din Ramzi , who was at the opening of the trial , called for a " speedy sentence , a just sentence commensurate with this heinous crime " .

The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged health officials around the country Thursday to ensure swine - flu vaccine is getting to high - risk groups , after criticism erupted over distribution to some Wall Street firms .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. are among several large New York City employers that got doses of the H1N1 vaccine , which remains in short supply as the new flu virus continues to spread and manufacturers struggle to produce ample stocks of vaccine quickly .

I clean my office every couple of months .
Despite a decent filing system for paperwork , a day - of - the - month accordion folder for bills and appointments , and every good intent to organize papers and books out of piles , stuff piles up on my desk until I start to lose things .
Right now , if I want to take notes on a manuscript ( or outline a book in pen ) , I have to clear off a section my desk .
Tidiness is important to working effectively .
It 's easier to do good things if you 're not working around random debris .
As this is with my desk , so it is with code .
I can't give you a magic incantation to turning thousands of lines of spaghetti code into a well - formatted program that 's easy to read , easy to understand , easy to maintain , and easy to extend , but I can explain a couple of Perl 5 tools which will help .
Perl : : Tidy
The Perl : : Tidy module improves the formatting of messy Perl code .
There are myriad options available , but by default it 's pretty good -- so good , in fact , that my ~/. perltidyrc file contains only two lines :
-ci=4 -bl
You can run the included perltidy program from the command - line :
$ perltidy my_messy_code.pl
... or you can add a macro or plugin to your editor to tidy code for you .
Padre has a plugin called Padre : : Plugin : : PerlTidy .
I have two Vim macros :
map , pt < ESC >:%! perltidy < CR > map , ptv < ESC >:'<,'>!
perltidy < CR >
If I type , pt , Vim will run perltidy on the entire file .
If I select a region and type , ptv , Vim will run perltidy on the selection .
This is my first line of defense against poorly - formatted code .
Better formatting often helps clarify logic and logic errors .
B:: Deparse
Sometimes it 's more important to see how Perl interprets code than to suss it out for yourself , especially given complex expressions .
The core module B:: Deparse takes a program that Perl 5 has already parsed and turns it back into source code .
You can run it from the command line :
$ perl - MO=Deparse some_bad_program.pl
... or on a specific subroutine within a file :
$ perl - MO=Deparse , a_real_mess some_bad_program.pl
... or within a Perl 5 program itself :
use B:: Deparse ; my $ bdp = B:: Deparse ->new ( ) ; my $ code = $ bdp->coderef2text ( \&some_awful_function ) ; Email :: Send -> new ( { mailer => ' SMTP ' , mailer_args => [ Host => ' my.example.com ' ] })->send(<<' END_MESSAGE ') ; From : a_kind_person@my.example.com
To : mortified_perl_programmer@your.example.com
Subject : Here 's What Your Code Really Does $ code END_MESSAGE
Of course , you might not want to mail deparsed code to people instead of talking to them first -- but you can if you must .
Perl :: Critic
After you can read the code in a proper format and understand complex expressions well enough to consider rewriting them , the Perl : : Critic toolset can help you identify and avoid well - understood problems in code -- both stylistic and substantial .
The perlcritic utility runs from the command line and can identify the most egregious potential errors in a program or module :
$ perlcritic MyAwfulModule.pm my_nifty_program.pl
There are many command - line options .
I like -- top which finds the 20 worst violations .
Severity levels range from 5 ( the default ) to 1 ( the pickiest ) ; select your preferred range with -n .
You can customize P:: C policies for your project or organization and you can add other policies as you wish .
P::C policies tend to explain themselves .
That is , Perl : : Critic :: Policy :: BuiltinFunctions :: ProhibitUniversalCan has a brief discussion of why the policy exists and what to do instead .
If you take the time to explore various policy violations for a codebase and consider the arguments , you 'll learn a lot about writing effective Perl 5 code .
If you want to enforce site policies , the Test : : Perl : : Critic module is useful .
The criticism pragma is another approach worth considering .
Gabor Szabo also pointed out the Padre Perl : : Critic plugin .
All three of these utilities have options and suggestions and nuances ripe for discovery , but all three of them can provide you an immediate benefit without requiring arduous or tedious customization .
If you want to write better Perl 5 code , start here .
No one believed 10 - year - old Shane Thomas when he first told his parents aged just three that he could play the piano .
It was n't until he was seven years old that he got the chance to play one - and within two hours he was tinkling the ivories with both hands .
Shane said : “ I told Dad when I was three that I could play but nobody took me seriously .
When I ’m at school I can listen to the teacher and do my work while composing in my head .
“ I remember the melodies , then when I get home I play them on the piano and Dad records them .
I love playing piano .
When I grow up I want to be a piano composer . ”
The talented youngster ’s piano tutor , Richard Goffin - Lecar , compared Shane to the legendary 18th century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who began playing the piano aged five .
Assassin , Saboteur , the Empire ’s Secret Weapon
The Empire dominates scores of star systems across the galaxy , but not through the power of the dark side alone .
Behind the scenes , the cunning Agents of Imperial Intelligence track down and eliminate the Empire ’s enemies — from intractable Republic senators to traitorous Imperial Moffs to bloodthirsty rebels with Republic ties .
Imperial Agents must master the arts of infiltration , seduction , and assassination to advance the Empire ’s causes ; they face the opposition of a terrified galaxy and the capriciousness of their own Sith overlords .
Imperial Intelligence cultivates a notoriously vast and efficient network of informants , enabling the Agent to navigate the galaxy ’s political landscape with effortless suave .
Naturally , the Agent ’s allegiance to the Empire is without question , but great latitude exists for those so closely attuned to the Empire ’s secret agendas — Agents often harbor their own mysterious motivations as well .
Having pierced countless layers of intrigue , these spies know of conspiracies within conspiracies .
Even close contacts find it hard to predict what an Imperial Agent will do until it ’s done .
The most elite operative within Imperial Intelligence is the ‘ Cipher ’ Agent — recruited and trained to carry out the most dangerous and sensitive assignments the Empire has to offer .
Whether working undercover or carrying out assignments in broad daylight , the Cipher races along the razor ’s edge of disaster , using carefully orchestrated tactics that leave little room for error — the smallest slip - up can be catastrophic .
Each successful mission , however , shifts the galactic landscape in the Empire ’s favor , and the Agent plays a supremely critical role in securing Imperial domination .
Relations with the Sith
The upper echelons of Imperial society are reserved for the Force - sensitive Sith alone , but theirs is a world apart .
The heart of the Empire consists of millions of subjects , descendants of the original exiles who settled Dromund Kaas .
For these loyal citizens , the Imperial Agent is the exemplar of the highest level of achievement one might aspire to .
These are the people the Agent risks everything to protect .
Though there are few idealists in Imperial Intelligence , the art of professional perfection is held in deep reverence , and the Agent embodies the Imperial ideal in this respect .
So much momentum this season , and that gives us LOTS to talk about .
Physicists returned to their future on Friday .
About 10 p.m. outside Geneva , scientists at CERN , the European Center for Nuclear Research , succeeded in sending beams of protons clockwise around the 17 - mile underground magnetic racetrack known as the Large Hadron Collider , the world ’s biggest and most expensive physics experiment .
For physicists , the event was a milestone on the way back from disaster and the resumption of a 15 - year , $ 9 billion quest to investigate laws and forces that prevailed when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old .
The collider was designed to accelerate protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts apiece and smash them together in tiny fireballs in an effort to replicate and study the conditions of the Big Bang .
The first time protons circled the collider , on Sept. 10 , 2008 , the event was celebrated with Champagne and midnight pajama parties around the world .
But the festivities were cut short a few days later when an electrical connection between a pair of the collider ’s giant superconducting electromagnets vaporized .

Claim :
All the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives will be up for election in 2010 .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , November 2009 ]
I think there are a lot of people feeling that this is a good idea .
The trick is getting people out to vote .
I ca n’t believe the number of friends / family that do n’t do it .
They obviously do n’t understand how important this right is and how their country will remain free only if they exercise it .
I think there are a lot of people feeling that this is a good idea .

I ca n’t believe the number of friends / family that do n’t do it .
They obviously do n’t understand how important this right is and how their country will remain free only if they exercise it .
All I ask is that you consider the suggestion here .
The entire Congress of the United States is corrupt .
And I mean both Houses and I mean both major parties ..
I realize that a few Members of each House are trustworthy , but , as a group they are absolutely the most corrupt bunch to ever disgrace our Nation .
In November of 2010 the entire House of Representatives will stand for re-election ; all 435 of them .
One third of the Senate , a total of 33 of them , will also stand for re-election .
Vote every incumbent out .
And I mean every one of them .
No matter their Party affiliation .
Let ’s start all over in the House of Representatives with 435 people who have absolutely no experience in running that body , with no political favors owed to anyone but their own constituents .
Let ’s make them understand that they work for us .
They are answerable to us and they simply have to run that body with some common sense .
Two years later , in 2012 , vote the next third of the incumbents in the Senate out .
We can do the same thing in 2014 and , by that time we will have put all new people in that body as well .
We , the People , have got to take this Country back and we HAVE to do it peacefully .
That ’s what the Framers of our Constitution envisioned .
I am also suggesting term limits on the new bunch : 8 years for Representatives and 12 years for Senators – no exceptions .
The longer they stay in office , the more power they get , and they love it and will do anything to get re-elected .
We have term - limited the President , now let ’s term - limit the Legislators .
Please , if you love this Country , send this ( as I have done ) to absolutely everyone whose email address appears in your address book .
This thing can permeate this Country in no time .
Let ’s make it happen .
Do n’t just delete this – please pass it on and give our Country a fighting chance .
VOTE THE POWER ABUSERS OUT …….. LET’S TAKE AMERICA BACK !!!!!!!!! ”
Origins :
This 2009 e-mail exhortation urges Americans to consider the suggestion that they vote all incumbents out of the House of Representatives during the upcoming elections in November 2010 , as well as voting all incumbents out of the Senate over the next three elections ( i.e. , 2010 , 2012 , 2014 ) .
Whether voters should take up such a suggestion is a matter of opinion that has no “ true ” or “ false ” value to it , so the aspect we ’ll address here is one which a number of our readers have questioned , namely the basic premise that all the seats in the House will be up for grabs in 2010 :
Are all 435 members of the House of Representatives up for re-election in 2010 ?
Are all 435 members of the House of Representatives up for re-election in 2010 ?
I received a message about the entire House of Representatives being up for election in 2010 .
My memory may be faulty but I do n’t
remember that ever happening .
I mean , if this were so , would n’t it be in the news ?
I received an email this morning with what I believe to be an untrue statement – “ In November of 2010 the entire House of Representatives will stand for re-election ; all 435 of them . ”
Is this true ?
I do n’t recall a time where the entire House of Representatives has been up for re-election .
Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution establishes the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government , a bicameral legislature known as Congress , as described in
Section 1 of that Article :
All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives .
Section 2 specifies the term of office for members of the House of Representatives :
The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states .
Section 3 ( since modified by the 17th amendment ) specifies the term of office for members of the Senate :
The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from each state , elected by the people thereof , for six years .
The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from each state , elected by the people thereof , for six years .
Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election , they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes .
The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year , of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year , and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth year , so that one third may be chosen every second year .
In other words , members of the House of Representatives ( currently 435 in number ) serve two - year terms and come up for election every even - numbered year .
Members of the Senate ( currently 100 in number ) serve six - year terms which are staggered so that one - third come up for election every two years .
So yes , all the seats in the House of Representatives will be up for grabs in 2010 — just as they have been every two years since the first Congressional elections in 1788 .
Apparently , the U.S. government did n't have enough Goldman Sachs executives in key financial and regulatory positions , so the following happened this week :
A Goldman Sachs executive has been named the first chief operating officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission 's enforcement division .
The market watchdog says Adam Storch , vice president in Goldman Sachs ' Business Intelligence Group , is assuming the new position of managing executive of the SEC division .
The move comes as the SEC revamps its enforcement efforts following the agency 's failure to uncover Bernard Madoff 's massive fraud scheme for nearly two decades despite numerous red flags .
A Goldman executive as COO of the SEC 's enforcement division .
This is all consistent with the observation of Desmond Lachman -- previously chief emerging market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney and IMF deputy director -- regarding " Goldman Sachs 's seeming lock on high - level U.S. Treasury jobs , " which he cited as but one of the many " parallels between U.S. policymaking and what we see in emerging markets . "
In October of last year , a Goldman Sachs Vice President , Neel Kashkari , was named by former Goldman CEO and then - Treasury Secretary Hank Pauslon to oversee the $ 700 billion TARP bailout .
In January of this year , Tim Geithner hired a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist , Mark Patterson , to be his top aide and Chief of Staff .
In March , President Obama nominated Goldman Sachs executive Gary Gensler to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which regulates futures markets , even though ( or " because " )
Gensler confessed to lax regulation during the Clinton administration over the very derivative instruments that caused the financial crisis .
In April , Goldman hired as its top lobbyist Michael Paese , the top aide to Rep. Barney Frank on the House Financial Services Committee which Frank chairs .
According to ABC News in October , 2008 , Goldman " spent more than $ 43 million dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions to cultivate friends and buy influence in Washington , D.C. since 1989 " and their " bankers have been the country 's top political campaign contributors this year . "
" They are almost in a class by themselves , " said Sheila Krumholz , the executive director for the Center for Responsive Politics .
As Michael Moore has been pointing out , Goldman was the number one source of funding for the Obama 2008 presidential campaign .
The bailout of AIG -- which resulted in massive federal government monies to Goldman -- was engineered at a meeting between Paulson , Geithner and Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein .
Last year , Goldman paid top Obama economics adviser Larry Summers $ 135,000 for a one - day visit to Goldman .
Recently obtained calenders from Geithner reveal that " Goldman , Citi and JPMorgan can get Geithner on the phone several times a day if necessary , giving them an unmatched opportunity to influence policy " and " Geithner 's contacts with Blankfein alone outnumber his contacts with Sen.
Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee . "
Documents obtained by The New York Times relating to Geithner 's work before becoming Treasury Secretary " show [ ] that he forged unusually close relationships with executives of Wall Street 's giant financial institutions . "
Of course , only an irrational , raving conspiracy theorist would believe that any of those events have any connection at all to this , from today 's Washington Post :
The nation 's largest banks , preserved from failure by federal aid and romping in markets revived by federal aid , are racking up vast profits even as the broader economy struggles to emerge from recession . . .
Goldman said it earned $ 3.19 billion between July and September , nearly the most it has ever made in three months , a record it set earlier this year .
So the most profitable quarter Goldman Sachs ever had in its history was the second quarter of 2009 -- just a few months after massive amounts of taxpayer money were transferred to them and their counter - parties in order to prop up their business , while several of its key competitors were allowed to die .
The second - most profitable quarter it ever had in its history was the third quarter of 2009 .
In his seminal article in The Atlantic earlier this year , former IMF economist and current MIT Professor Simon Johnson warned ( just like former IMF official Lachman did ) that , for deeply corrupt oligarchies in which the unrestrained power and recklessness of the oligarchs spawn a financial crisis , this is what happens : " at the outset of the crisis , the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government . . .
Meanwhile , needing to squeeze someone , most emerging - market governments look first to ordinary working folk -- at least until the riots grow too large . "
Just compare Johnson 's description for what happens in corrupt oligarchies to the pictoral representation of Goldman 's profits since the September , 2008 financial crisis , from today 's Post :
Goldman employees are set to receive record bonuses this year as well .
That occurred at the same time the unemployment rate went to 9.8 % , the highest in 26 years .
Is it possible to imagine a more vivid illustration of what Johnson described ?
It 's true that the threat of worldwide economic collapse has abated , and that 's a good thing .
It 's not particularly surprising that if the Government transfers trillions of dollars to an industry , then that industry will improve .
But , as the Treasury Department 's independent and tenacious watchdog , Neil Barofsky , has been trying to warn , the surviving banks are bigger and more powerful than ever , thus maximizing our dependence on them , and the primary stated goal of the bailout ( increasing lending ) has not been achieved .
Rep .
Frank 's committee in the House yesterday passed a bill to regulate derivatives that is so filled with loopholes it may end up exempting most industry players .
That the administration continues , so brazenly , to place Goldman Sachs executives in the very government positions with the greatest power over the financial industry illustrates how little effort is devoted to hiding what is really taking place .
UPDATE : Business Insider has more details on Storch , the new COO of SEC Enforcement : He 's 29 , and has worked at Goldman Sachs for the last 5 years -- since he was 24 years old .
I 'm sure there was nobody more qualified for that position and that he 'll be an absolutely relentless and fearsome force in helping the SEC enforce applicable laws and regulations .

UPDATE II : I owe Adam Storch an apology for unfairly questioning whether he 's really the most qualified person for the position of COO in SEC enforcement .
After all , in 2002 , he was named as a Co - Winner by SUNY - Buffalo of the prestigious Intern of the Year Award , for his sterling summer work in sorting mail and fetching coffee at Deloitte & Touche ( h/t thelastnamechosen ) .
UPDATE III : The New York Times this morning has a darkly amusing article by Graham Bowley on all of this .
I can't quite tell if the humor is intentional , but either way , it 's glaring .
The article begins with this observation : " Even as the economy continues to struggle , much of Wall Street is minting money -- and looking forward again to hefty bonuses . "
With an earnestly innocent tone , it then poses this question : " Many Americans wonder how this can possibly be .
How can some banks be prospering so soon after a financial collapse , even as legions of people worry about losing their jobs and their homes ? "
Indeed , how could such a confounding thing have happened ?
This way :
It may come as a surprise that one of the most powerful forces driving the resurgence on Wall Street is not the banks but Washington .
Many of the steps that policy makers took last year to stabilize the financial system -- reducing interest rates to near zero , bolstering big banks with taxpayer money , guaranteeing billions of dollars of financial institutions ' debts -- helped set the stage for this new era of Wall Street wealth .
. .
So even as big banks fight efforts in Congress to subject their industry to greater regulation -- and to impose some restrictions on executive pay -- Wall Street has Washington to thank in part for its latest bonanza .
That is so very , very unexpected : that policies designed by former Goldman CEO Hank Paulson , ultimate Wall Street servant Tim Geithner , and the banking - owned United States Congress would redound to the personal benefit of investment banking executives but not the general public .
It 's the opposite of free market capitalism : it is the Federal Government intervening for the benefit of a tiny sliver of oligarchs who fund and own the government itself .
The NYT article details the numerous ways that Washington policies over the last year have directly maximized Goldman profits , while the AP reporter who wrote the article on Geithner 's calender records , Matt Apuzzo , told this to NPR earlier this week , in a segment entitled " Bank Execs Had Direct Line to Geithner " ( h/t Carolyn C ) :
What 's very interesting here is he seems to have this kitchen cabinet , if you will , of these three big banks that he talks to , not just when it 's something about big banks , he talks to them during the auto crisis ; he talks to them late at night ; he talks to them first thing in the morning .
There 's this great sequence of phone calls one night in the middle of the auto crisis where the secretary takes three phone calls and it's Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan , the president of the United States ; hangs up with the president and then he 's immediately back on the phone with JPMorgan .
And when you look at it in that way , you can see that those three banks have greater influence - they have a greater ability to influence policy than any other bank .
I mean , it 's really an unmatched ability to have the secretary of the Treasury 's ear when he 's right about to speak with the president , when he 's just about to go up to Capitol Hill .
As a result , explained the NYT : " A year after the crisis struck , many of the industry 's behemoths -- those institutions deemed too big to fail -- are , in fact , getting bigger , not smaller . "
MSNBC 's Dylan Ratigan yesterday had a somewhat melodramatic and oversimplified though still effective depiction of the gigantic " legalized theft " that has taken place , but because both parties are so heavily involved in all of this , are such beneficiaries of it , there is no organized outlet for what ought to be the explosive public rage , other than some GOP - exploited " tea parties " :
UPDATE IV : Just a little bit more : the top economics official at the State Department is Robert Hormats , who spent the prior 27 years at Goldman Sachs , including as the Vice Chairman of Goldman 's international arm .
As William Greider wrote this week in The Nation , Gene Spreling -- currently a top Geithner adviser ( and former top aide to Goldman CEO Robert Rubin when Rubin was Tresasury Secretary ) -- was paid close to $ 1 million last year by Goldman Sachs for consulting work .
Earlier in the week , Bloomberg documented that " [ s ] ome of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner 's closest aides , none of whom faced Senate confirmation , earned millions of dollars a year working for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Citigroup Inc. and other Wall Street firms . "
Also : " Geithner 's predecessor , Henry Paulson , brought on a coterie of non-confirmed advisers from Goldman Sachs at the end of his term . "
I do n't understand why government policy so relentlessly and lavishly redounds to the benefit of Goldman and a handful of other investment banks .
Might there be any causal connection here ?
A Paradise Valley High School music teacher whose students performed at one of President 's Barack Obama inauguration events has been put on administrative leave after taking 40 students to eat at a Hooters in downtown Phoenix .
Mary Segall , a choir director at the northeast Phoenix school , accompanied choral students at a performance at Arizona Center last week .
While there , the students ate lunch at the Hooters restaurant , said Judi Willis , spokeswoman for the district .
Segall told her principal that the restaurant , known for its busty waitresses in tight shirts and orange shorts , was the only place that could accommodate a group of that size .
She could not be reached for comment .
" We believe that there are many venues for lunch for a large group of people in the downtown Phoenix area , " Willis said .
" There could have been a choice that might have been more appropriate , given that it was a school - day event with a school employee in charge . "
Mike McNeill , vice president of marketing for Hooters USA , said he was unfamiliar with the incident and could not comment .
According to Hooters '
Web site , each restaurant aims to provide diners with " a unique , entertaining dining experience . . . delivered by attractive , vivacious Hooters Girls . "
Although parents knew students would be performing at Arizona Center , it is unclear whether they knew that their children would eat lunch at the restaurant .
" I know that it was a complete surprise to the principal , " Willis said .
Several adults who are n't employees of the district accompanied Segall and the students on the trip .
Willis said she does not know whether the adults challenged Segall 's decision .
Segall , who has taught in the district for more than 23 years , was planning to retire at the end of January before the incident .
She took the school choir and strings group to Washington , D.C. , in January to perform at the " History in the Making : A Dream and a Change Inaugural Ball . "
Willis said she does not know whether Segall will return to the district before she retires .
" I am sure that someone is covering her classes , " she said .

The Thing on the Doorstep
I [ edit ]
It is true that I have sent six bullets through the head of my best friend , and yet I hope to show by this statement that I am not his murderer .
At first I shall be called a madman — madder than the man I shot in his cell at the Arkham Sanitarium .
Later some of my readers will weigh each statement , correlate it with the known facts , and ask themselves how I could have believed otherwise than I did after facing the evidence of that horror — that thing on the doorstep .
Until then I also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales I have acted on .
Even now I ask myself whether I was misled — or whether I am not mad after all .
I do not know — but others have strange things to tell of Edward and Asenath Derby , and even the stolid police are at their wits ' ends to account for that last terrible visit .
They have tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by discharged servants , yet they know in their hearts that the truth is something infinitely more terrible and incredible .
So I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby .
Rather have I avenged him , and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might have loosed untold terrors on all mankind .
There are black zones of shadow close to our daily paths , and now and then some evil soul breaks a passage through .
When that happens , the man who knows must strike before reckoning the consequences .
I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life .
Eight years my junior , he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was eight and I was sixteen .
He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have ever known , and at seven was writing verse of a sombre , fantastic , almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him .
Perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering .
An only child , he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side .
He was never allowed out without his nurse , and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children .
All this doubtless fostered a strange secretive life in the boy , with imagination as his one avenue of freedom .
At any rate , his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre ; and his facile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age .
About that time I had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast , and I found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit .
What lay behind our joint love of shadows and marvels was , no doubt , the ancient , mouldering , and subtly fearsome town in which we live — witch - cursed , legend - haunted Arkham , whose huddled , sagging gambrel roofs and crumbling Georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the darkly muttering Miskatonic .
As time went by I turned to architecture and gave up my design of illustrating a book of Edward 's demoniac poems , yet our comradeship suffered no lessening .
Young Derby 's odd genius developed remarkably , and in his eighteenth year his collected nightmare - lyrics made a real sensation when issued under the title Azathoth and Other Horrors .
He was a close correspondent of the notorious Baudelairean poet Justin Geoffrey , who wrote The People of the Monolith and died screaming in a madhouse in 1926 after a visit to a sinister , ill - regarded village in Hungary .
In self - reliance and practical affairs , however , Derby was greatly retarded because of his coddled existence .
His health had improved , but his habits of childish dependence were fostered by over - careful parents , so that he never travelled alone , made independent decisions , or assumed responsibilities .
It was early seen that he would not be equal to a struggle in the business or professional arena , but the family fortune was so ample that this formed no tragedy .
As he grew to years of manhood he retained a deceptive aspect of boyishness .
Blond and blue - eyed , he had the fresh complexion of a child ; and his attempt to raise a moustache were discernible only with difficulty .
His voice was soft and light , and his unexercised life gave him a juvenile chubbiness rather than the paunchiness of premature middle age .
He was of good height , and his handsome face would have made him a notable gallant had not his shyness held him to seclusion and bookishness .
Derby 's parents took him abroad every summer , and he was quick to seize on the surface aspects of European thought and expression .
His Poe - like talents turned more and more toward the decadent , and other artistic sensitiveness and yearnings were half - aroused in him .
We had great discussions in those days .
I had been through Harvard , had studied in a Boston architect 's office , had married , and had finally returned to Arkham to practise my profession — settling in the family homestead in Saltonstall Street since my father had moved to Florida for his health .
Edward used to call almost every evening , till I came to regard him as one of the household .
He had a characteristic way of ringing the doorbell or sounding the knocker that grew to be a veritable code signal , so that after dinner I always listened for the familiar three brisk strokes followed by two more after a pause .
Less frequently I would visit at his house and note with envy the obscure volumes in his constantly growing library .
Derby went through Miskatonic University in Arkham since his parents would not let him board away from them .
He entered at sixteen and completed his course in three years , majoring in English and French literature and receiving high marks in everything but mathematics and the sciences .
He mingled very little with the other students , though looking enviously at the " daring " or " Bohemian " set — whose superficially " smart " language and meaningless ironic pose he aped , and whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adopt .
What he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of subterranean magical lore , for which Miskatonic 's library was and is famous .
Always a dweller on the surface of phantasy and strangeness , he now delved deep into the actual runes and riddles left by a fabulous past for the guidance or puzzlement of posterity .
He read things like the frightful Book of Eibon , the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt , and the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred , though he did not tell his parents he had seen them .
Edward was twenty when my son and only child was born , and seemed pleased when I named the newcomer Edward Derby Upton after him .
By the time he was twenty - five Edward Derby was a prodigiously learned man and a fairly well known poet and fantaisiste though his lack of contacts and responsibilities had slowed down his literary growth by making his products derivative and over - bookish .
I was perhaps his closest friend — finding him an inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical topics , while he relied on me for advice in whatever matters he did not wish to refer to his parents .
He remained single — more through shyness , inertia , and parental protectiveness than through inclination — and moved in society only to the slightest and most perfunctory extent .
When the war came both health and ingrained timidity kept him at home .
I went to Plattsburg for a commission but never got overseas .
So the years wore on .
Edward 's mother died when he was thirty four and for months he was incapacitated by some odd psychological malady .
His father took him to Europe , however , and he managed to pull out of his trouble without visible effects .
Afterward he seemed to feel a sort of grotesque exhilaration , as if of partial escape from some unseen bondage .
He began to mingle in the more " advanced " college set despite his middle age , and was present at some extremely wild doings — on one occasion paying heavy blackmail ( which he borrowed of me ) to keep his presence at a certain affair from his father 's notice .
Some of the whispered rumors about the wild Miskatonic set were extremely singular .
There was even talk of black magic and of happenings utterly beyond credibility .
II [ edit ]
Edward was thirty - eight when he met Asenath Waite .
She was , I judge , about twenty - three at the time ; and was taking a special course in mediaeval metaphysics at Miskatonic .
The daughter of a friend of mine had met her before — in the Hall School at Kingsport — and had been inclined to shun her because of her odd reputation .
She was dark , smallish , and very good - looking except for overprotuberant eyes ; but something in her expression alienated extremely sensitive people .
It was , however , largely her origin and conversation which caused average folk to avoid her .
She was one of the Innsmouth Waites , and dark legends have clustered for generations about crumbling , half - deserted Innsmouth and its people .
There are tales of horrible bargains about the year 1850 , and of a strange element " not quite human " in the ancient families of the run- down fishing port — tales such as only old - time Yankees can devise and repeat with proper awesomeness .
Asenath 's case was aggravated by the fact that she was Ephraim Waite 's daughter — the child of his old age by an unknown wife who always went veiled .
Ephraim lived in a half - decayed mansion in Washington Street , Innsmouth , and those who had seen the place ( Arkham folk avoid going to Innsmouth whenever they can ) declared that the attic windows were always boarded , and that strange sounds sometimes floated from within as evening drew on .
The old man was known to have been a prodigious magical student in his day , and legend averred that he could raise or quell storms at sea according to his whim .
I had seen him once or twice in my youth as he came to Arkham to consult forbidden tomes at the college library , and had hated his wolfish , saturnine face with its tangle of iron - grey beard .
He had died insane — under rather queer circumstances — just before his daughter ( by his will made a nominal ward of the principal ) entered the Hall School , but she had been his morbidly avid pupil and looked fiendishly like him at times .
The friend whose daughter had gone to school with Asenath Waite repeated many curious things when the news of Edward 's acquaintance with her began to spread about .
Asenath , it seemed , had posed as a kind of magician at school ; and had really seemed able to accomplish some highly baffling marvels .
She professed to be able to raise thunderstorms , though her seeming success was generally laid to some uncanny knack at prediction .
All animals markedly disliked her , and she could make any dog howl by certain motions of her right hand .
There were times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and language very singular — and very shocking — for a young girl ; when she would frighten her schoolmates with leers and winks of an inexplicable kind , and would seem to extract an obscene zestful irony from her present situation .
Most unusual , though , were the well - attested cases of her influence over other persons .
She was , beyond question , a genuine hypnotist .
By gazing peculiarly at a fellow - student she would often give the latter a distinct feeling of exchanged personality — as if the subject were placed momentarily in the magician 's body and able to stare half across the room at her real body , whose eyes blazed and protruded with an alien expression .
Asenath often made wild claims about the nature of consciousness and about its independence of the physical frame — or at least from the life - processes of the physical frame .
Her crowning rage , however , was that she was not a man ; since she believed a male brain had certain unique and far - reaching cosmic powers .
Given a man 's brain , she declared , she could not only equal but surpass her father in mastery of unknown forces .
Edward met Asenath at a gathering of " intelligentsia " held in one of the students ' rooms , and could talk of nothing else when he came to see me the next day .
He had found her full of the interests and erudition which engrossed him most , and was in addition wildly taken with her appearance .
I had never seen the young woman , and recalled casual references only faintly , but I knew who she was .
It seemed rather regrettable that Derby should become so upheaved about her ; but I said nothing to discourage him , since infatuation thrives on opposition .
He was not , he said , mentioning her to his father .
In the next few weeks I heard of very little but Asenath from young Derby .
Others now remarked Edward 's autumnal gallantry , though they agreed that he did not look even nearly his actual age , or seem at all inappropriate as an escort for his bizarre divinity .
He was only a trifle paunchy despite his indolence and self - indulgence , and his face was absolutely without lines .
Asenath , on the other hand , had the premature crow 's feet which come from the exercises of an intense will .
About this time Edward brought the girl to call on me , and I at once saw that his interest was by no means one - sided .
She eyed him continually with an almost predatory air , and I perceived that their intimacy was beyond untangling .
Soon afterward I had a visit from old Mr. Derby , whom I had always admired and respected .
He had heard the tales of his son's new friendship , and had wormed the whole truth out of " the boy . "
Edward meant to marry Asenath , and had even been looking at houses in the suburbs .
Knowing my usually great influence with his son , the father wondered if I could help to break the ill - advised affair off ; but I regretfully expressed my doubts .
This time it was not a question of Edward 's weak will but of the woman 's strong will .
The perennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental image to a new and stronger image , and nothing could be done about it .
The wedding was performed a month later — by a justice of the peace , according to the bride 's request .
Mr. Derby , at my advice , offered no opposition , and he , my wife , my son , and I attended the brief ceremony — the other guests being wild young people from the college .
Asenath had bought the old Crowninshield place in the country at the end of High Street , and they proposed to settle there after a short trip to Innsmouth , whence three servants and some books and household goods were to be brought .
It was probably not so much consideration for Edward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college , its library , and its crowd of " sophisticates , " that made Asenath settle in Arkham instead of returning permanently home .
When Edward called on me after the honeymoon I thought he looked slightly changed .
Asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped moustache , but there was more than that .
He looked soberer and more thoughtful , his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being exchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness .
I was puzzled to decide whether I liked or disliked the change .
Certainly he seemed for the moment more normally adult than ever before .
Perhaps the marriage was a good thing — might not the change of dependence form a start toward actual neutralisation , leading ultimately to responsible independence ?
He came alone , for Asenath was very busy .
She had brought a vast store of books and apparatus from Innsmouth ( Derby shuddered as he spoke the name ) , and was finishing the restoration of the Crowninshield house and grounds .
Her home — in that town — was a rather disgusting place , but certain objects in it had taught him some surprising things .
He was progressing fast in esoteric lore now that he had Asenath 's guidance .
Some of the experiments she proposed were very daring and radical — he did not feel at liberty to describe them — but he had confidence in her powers and intentions .
The three servants were very queer — an incredibly aged couple who had been with old Ephraim and referred occasionally to him and to Asenath 's dead mother in a cryptic way , and a swarthy young wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to exude a perpetual odour of fish .
III [ edit ]
For the next two years I saw less and less of Derby .
A fortnight would sometimes slip by without the familiar three - and - two strokes at the front door ; and when he did call — or when , as happened with increasing infrequency , I called on him — he was very little disposed to converse on vital topics .
He had become secretive about those occult studies which he used to describe and discuss so minutely , and preferred not to talk of his wife .
She had aged tremendously since her marriage , till now — oddly enough — she seemed the elder of the two .
Her face held the most concentratedly determined expression I had ever seen , and her whole aspect seemed to gain a vague , unplaceable repulsiveness .
My wife and son noticed it as much as I , and we all ceased gradually to call on her — for which , Edward admitted in one of his boyishly tactless moments , she was unmitigatedly grateful .
Occasionally the Derbys would go on long trips — ostensibly to Europe , though Edward sometimes hinted at obscurer destinations .
It was after the first year that people began talking about the change in Edward Derby .
It was very casual talk , for the change was purely psychological ; but it brought up some interesting points .
Now and then , it seemed Edward was observed to wear an expression and to do things wholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature .
For example — although in the old days he could not drive a car , he was now seen occasionally to dash into or out of the old Crowninshield driveway with Asenath 's powerful Packard , handling it like a master , and meeting traffic entanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to his accustomed nature .
In such cases he seemed always to be just back from some trip or just starting on one — what sort of trip , no one could guess , although he mostly favoured the Innsmouth road .
Oddly , the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing .
People said he looked too much like his wife , or like old Ephraim Waite himself , in these moments — or perhaps these moments seemed unnatural because they were so rare .
Sometimes , hours after starting out in this way , he would return listlessly sprawled on the rear seat of the car while an obviously hired chauffeur or mechanic drove .
Also , his preponderant aspect on the streets during his decreasing round of social contacts ( including , I may say , his calls on me ) was the old - time indecisive one — its irresponsible childishness even more marked than in the past .
While Asenath 's face aged , Edward — aside from those exceptional occasions — actually relaxed into a kind of exaggerated immaturity , save when a trace of the new sadness or understanding would flash across it .
It was really very puzzling .
Meanwhile the Derbys almost dropped out of the gay college circle — not through their own disgust , we heard , but because something about their present studies shocked even the most callous of the other decadents .
It was in the third year of the marriage that Edward began to hint openly to me of a certain fear and dissatisfaction .
He would let fall remarks about things " going too far , " and would talk darkly about the need of " gaining his identity . "
At first I ignored such references , but in time I began to question him guardedly , remembering what my friend 's daughter had said about Asenath 's hypnotic influence over the other girls at school — the cases where students had thought they were in her body looking across the room at themselves .
This questioning seemed to make him at once alarmed and grateful , and once he mumbled something about having a serious talk with me later .
About this time old Mr. Derby died , for which I was afterward very thankful .
Edward was badly upset , though by no means disorganized .
He had seen astonishingly little of his parent since his marriage , for Asenath had concentrated in herself all his vital sense of family linkage .
Some called him callous in his loss — especially since those jaunty and confident moods in the car began to increase .
He now wished to move back into the old family mansion , but Asenath insisted on staying in the Crowninshield house to which she had become well adjusted .
Not long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend — one of the few who had not dropped the Derbys .
She had been out to the end of High Street to call on the couple , and had seen a car shoot briskly out of the drive with Edward 's oddly confident and almost sneering face above the wheel .
Ringing the bell , she had been told by the repulsive wench that Asenath was also out ; but had chanced to look at the house in leaving .
There , at one of Edward 's library windows , she had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn face — a face whose expression of pain , defeat , and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description .
It was — incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering cast — Asenath 's ; yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad , muddled eyes of poor Edward were gazing out from it .
Edward 's calls now grew a trifle more frequent , and his hints occasionally became concrete .
What he said was not to be believed , even in centuried and legend - haunted Arkham ; but he threw out his dark lore with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear for his sanity .
He talked about terrible meetings in lonely places , of Cyclopean ruins in the heart of the Maine woods beneath which vast staircases led down to abysses of nighted secrets , of complex angles that led through invisible walls to other regions of space and time , and of hideous exchanges of personality that permitted explorations in remote and forbidden places , on other worlds , and in different space - time continua .
He would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects which utterly nonplussed me —elusively coloured and bafflingly textured objects like nothing ever heard of on earth , whose insane curves and surfaces answered no conceivable purpose , and followed no conceivable geometry .
These things , he said , came " from outside " ; and his wife knew how to get them .
Sometimes — but always in frightened and ambiguous whisper — he would suggest things about old Ephraim Waite , whom he had seen occasionally at the college library in the old days .
These adumbrations were never specific , but seemed to revolve around some especially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really dead — in a spiritual as well as corporeal sense .
At times Derby would halt abruptly in his revelations , and I wondered whether Asenath could possibly have divined his speech at a distance and cut him off through some unknown sort of telepathic mesmerism — some power of the kind she had displayed at school .
Certainly , she suspected that he told me things , for as the weeks passed she tried to stop his visits with words and glances of a most inexplicable potency .
Only with difficulty could he get to see me , for although he would pretend to be going somewhere else , some invisible force would generally clog his motions or make him forget his destination for the time being .
His visits usually came when Asenath was away — " away in her own body , " as he once oddly put it .
She always found out later — the servants watched his goings and comings — but evidently she thought it inexpedient to do anything drastic .
IV [ edit ]
Derby had been married more than three years on that August day when I got that telegram from Maine .
I had not seen him for two months , but had heard he was away " on business . "
Asenath was supposed to be with him , though watchful gossip declared there was someone upstairs in the house behind the doubly curtained windows .
They had watched the purchases made by the servants .
And now the town marshal of Chesuncook had wired of the draggled madman who stumbled out of the woods with delirious ravings and screamed to me for protection .
It was Edward — and he had been just able to recall his own name and address .
Chesuncook is close to the wildest , deepest , and least explored forest belt in Maine , and it took a whole day of feverish jolting through fantastic and forbidding scenery to get there in a car .
I found Derby in a cell at the town farm , vacillating between frenzy and apathy .
He knew me at once , and began pouring out a meaningless , half - incoherent torrent of words in my direction .
“ Dan — for God ’s sake !
The pit of the shoggoths !
Down the six thousand steps . . . the abomination of abominations . . .
I never would let her take me , and then I found myself there .
. . .
Iä ! Shub -Niggurath ! . . .
The shape rose up from the altar , and there were 500 that howled .
. . .
The Hooded Thing bleated ‘ Kamog ! Kamog !’— that was old Ephraim ’s secret name in the coven .
. . .
I was there , where she promised she would n’t take me .
. . .
A minute before I was locked in the library , and then I was there where she had gone with my body — in the place of utter blasphemy , the unholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the gate .
. . .
I saw a shoggoth — it changed shape .
. . .
I ca n’t stand it .
. . .
I wo n’t stand it .
. . .
I ’ll kill her if she ever sends me there again .
. . .
I ’ll kill that entity . . . her , him , it . . .
I ’ll kill it !
I ’ll kill it with my own hands ! ”
It took me an hour to quiet him , but he subsided at last .
The next day I got him decent clothes in the village , and set out with him for Arkham .
His fury of hysteria was spent , and he was inclined to be silent , though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car passed through Augusta — as if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant memories .
It was clear that he did not wish to go home ; and considering the fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wife — delusions undoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had been subjected — I thought it would be better if he did not .
I would , I resolved , put him up myself for a time ; no matter what unpleasantness it would make with Asenath .
Later I would help him get a divorce , for most assuredly there were mental factors which made this marriage suicidal for him .
When we struck open country again Derby 's muttering faded away , and I let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as I drove .
During our sunset dash through Portland the muttering commenced again , more distinctly than before , and as I listened I caught a stream of utterly insane drivel about Asenath .
The extent to which she had preyed on Edward 's nerves was plain , for he had woven a whole set of hallucinations around her .
His present predicament , he mumbled furtively , was only one of a long series .
She was getting hold of him , and he knew that some day she would never let go .
Even now she probably let him go only when she had to , because she could n't hold on long at a time .
She constantly took his body and went to nameless places for nameless rites , leaving him in her body and locking him upstairs — but sometimes she could n't hold on , and he would find himself suddenly in his own body again in some far - off , horrible , and perhaps unknown place .
Sometimes she'd get hold of him again and sometimes she could n't .
Often he was left stranded somewhere as I had found him — time and again he had to find his way home from frightful distances , getting somebody to drive the car after he found it .
The worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer at a time .
She wanted to be a man — to be fully human — that was why she got hold of him .
She had sensed the mixture of fine - wrought brain and weak will in him .
Some day she would crowd him out and disappear with his body — disappear to become a great magician like her father and leave him marooned in that female shell that was n’t even quite human .
Yes , he knew about the Innsmouth blood now .
There had been traffick with things from the sea — it was horrible .
. . .
And old Ephraim — he had known the secret , and when he grew old did a hideous thing to keep alive . . . he wanted to live forever . . .
Asenath would succeed — one successful demonstration had taken place already .
As Derby muttered on I turned to look at him closely , verifying the impression of change which an earlier scrutiny had given me .
Paradoxically , he seemed in better shape than usual — harder , more normally developed , and without the trace of sickly flabbiness caused by his indolent habits .
It was as if he had been really active and properly exercised for the first time in his coddled life , and I judged that Asenath 's force must have pushed him into unwonted channels of motion and alertness .
But just now his mind was in a pitiable state ; for he was mumbling wild extravagances about his wife , about black magic , about old Ephraim , and about some revelation which would convince even me .
He repeated names which I recognized from bygone browsings in forbidden volumes , and at times made me shudder with a certain thread of mythological consistency — or convincing coherence — which ran through his maundering .
Again and again he would pause , as if to gather courage for some final and terrible disclosure .
" Dan , Dan , do n't you remember him — wild eyes and the unkempt beard that never turned white ?
He glared at me once , and I never forgot it .
Now she glares that way .
And I know why !
He found it in the Necronomicon — the formula .
I do n't dare tell you the page yet , but when I do you can read and understand .
Then you will know what has engulfed me .
On , on , on , on — body to body to body — he means never to die .
The life - glow — he knows how to break the link . . . it can flicker on a while even when the body is dead .
I 'll give you hints and maybe you 'll guess .
Listen , Dan — do you know why my wife always takes such pains with that silly backhand writing ?
Have you ever seen a manuscript of old Ephraim's ?
Do you want to know why I shivered when I saw some hasty notes Asenath had jotted down ?
" Asenath — is there such a person ?
Why did they half - think there was poison in old Ephraim 's stomach ?
Why do the Gilmans whisper about the way he shrieked — like a frightened child — when he went mad and Asenath locked him up in the padded attic room where — the other — had been ?
Was it old Ephraim 's soul that was locked in ?
Who locked in whom ?
Why had he been looking for months for someone with a fine mind and a weak will ?
—
Why did he curse that his daughter was n't a son ?
Tell me , Daniel Upton — what devilish exchange was perpetrated in the house of horror where that blasphemous monster had his trusting , weak - willed half - human child at his mercy ?
Did n't he make it permanent — as she 'll do in the end with me ?
Tell me why that thing that calls itself Asenath writes differently off guard , so that you can't tell its script from — "
Then the thing happened .
Derby 's voice was rising to a thin treble scream as he raved , when suddenly it was shut off with an almost mechanical click .
I thought of those other occasions at my home when his confidences had abruptly ceased — when I had half - fancied that some obscure telepathic wave of Asenath 's mental force was intervening to keep him silent .
This , though , was something altogether different — and , I felt , infinitely more horrible .
The face beside me was twisted almost unrecognizably for a moment , while through the whole body there passed a shivering motion — as if all the bones , organs , muscles , nerves , and glands were adjusting themselves to a radically different posture , set of stresses , and general personality .
Just where the supreme horror lay , I could not for my life tell ; yet there swept over me such a swamping wave of sickness and repulsion — such a freezing , petrifying sense of utter alienage and abnormality — that my grasp of the wheel grew feeble and uncertain .
The figure beside me seemed less like a lifelong friend than like some monstrous intrusion from outer space — some damnable , utterly accursed focus of unknown and malign cosmic forces .
I had faltered only a moment , but before another moment was over my companion had seized the wheel and forced me to change places with him .
The dusk was now very thick , and the lights of Portland far behind , so I could not see much of his face .
The blaze of his eyes , though , was phenomenal ; and I knew that he must now be in that queerly energized state — so unlike his usual self — which so many people had noticed .
It seemed odd and incredible that listless Edward Derby — he who could never assert himself , and who had never learned to drive — should be ordering me about and taking the wheel of my own car , yet that was precisely what had happened .
He did not speak for some time , and in my inexplicable horror I was glad he did not .
In the lights of Biddeford and Saco I saw his firmly set mouth , and shivered at the blaze of his eyes .
The people were right — he did look damnably like his wife and like old Ephraim when in these moods .
I did not wonder that the moods were disliked — there was certainly something unnatural in them , and I felt the sinister element all the more because of the wild ravings I had been hearing .
This man , for all my lifelong knowledge of Edward Pickman Derby , was a stranger — an intrusion of some sort from the black abyss .
He did not speak until we were on a dark stretch of road , and when he did his voice seemed utterly unfamiliar .
It was deeper , firmer , and more decisive than I had ever known it to be ; while its accent and pronunciation were altogether changed — though vaguely , remotely , and rather disturbingly recalling something I could not quite place .
There was , I thought , a trace of very profound and very genuine irony in the timbre — not the flashy , meaninglessly jaunty pseudo - irony of the callow " sophisticate , " which Derby had habitually affected , but something grim , basic , pervasive , and potentially evil .
I marvelled at the self - possession so soon following the spell of panic - struck muttering .
" I hope you 'll forget my attack back there , Upton , " he was saying .
" You know what my nerves are , and I guess you can excuse such things .
I 'm enormously grateful , of course , for this lift home .
" And you must forget , too , any crazy things I may have been saying about my wife — and about things in general .
That 's what comes from overstudy in a field like mine .
My philosophy is full of bizarre concepts , and when the mind gets worn out it cooks up all sorts of imaginary concrete applications .
I shall take a rest from now on — you probably wo n't see me for some time , and you need n't blame Asenath for it .
" This trip was a bit queer , but it 's really very simple .
There are certain Indian relics in the north wood — standing stones , and all that — which mean a good deal in folklore , and Asenath and I are following that stuff up .
It was a hard search , so I seem to have gone off my head .
I must send somebody for the car when I get home .
A month 's relaxation will put me on my feet . "
I do not recall just what my own part of the conversation was , for the baffling alienage of my seatmate filled all my consciousness .
With every moment my feeling of elusive cosmic horror increased , till at length I was in a virtual delirium of longing for the end of the drive .
Derby did not offer to relinquish the wheel , and I was glad of the speed with which Portsmouth and Newburyport flashed by .
At the junction where the main highway runs inland and avoids Innsmouth , I was half - afraid my driver would take the bleak shore road that goes through that damnable place .
He did not , however , but darted rapidly past Rowley and Ipswich toward our destination .
We reached Arkham before midnight , and found the lights still on at the old Crowninshield house .
Derby left the car with a hasty repetition of his thanks , and I drove home alone with a curious feeling of relief .
It had been a terrible drive — all the more terrible because I could not quite tell why — and I did not regret Derby 's forecast of a long absence from my company .
V [ edit ]
The next two months were full of rumours .
People spoke of seeing Derby more and more in his new energized state , and Asenath was scarcely ever in to her callers .
I had only one visit from Edward , when he called briefly in Asenath 's car — duly reclaimed from wherever he had left it in Maine — to get some books he had lent me .
He was in his new state , and paused only long enough for some evasively polite remarks .
It was plain that he had nothing to discuss with me when in this condition — and I noticed that he did not even trouble to give the old three - and - two signal when ringing the doorbell .
As on that evening in the car , I felt a faint , infinitely deep horror which I could not explain ; so that his swift departure was a prodigious relief .
In mid-September Derby was away for a week , and some of the decadent college set talked knowingly of the matter — hinting at a meeting with a notorious cult - leader , lately expelled from England , who had established headquarters in New York .
For my part I could not get that strange ride from Maine out of my head .
The transformation I had witnessed had affected me profoundly , and I caught myself again and again trying to account for the thing — and for the extreme horror it had inspired in me .
But the oddest rumours were those about the sobbing in the old Crowninshield house .
The voice seemed to be a woman's , and some of the younger people thought it sounded like Asenath's .
It was heard only at rare intervals , and would sometimes be choked off as if by force .
There was talk of an investigation , but this was dispelled one day when Asenath appeared in the streets and chatted in a sprightly way with a large number of acquaintances — apologizing for her recent absence and speaking incidentally about the nervous breakdown and hysteria of a guest from Boston .
The guest was never seen , but Asenath 's appearance left nothing to be said .
And then someone complicated matters by whispering that the sobs had once or twice been in a man 's voice .
One evening in mid-October , I heard the familiar three - and - two ring at the front door .
Answering it myself , I found Edward on the steps , and saw in a moment that his personality was the old one which I had not encountered since the day of his ravings on that terrible ride from Chesuncook .
His face was twitching with a mixture of odd emotions in which fear and triumph seemed to share dominion , and he looked furtively over his shoulder as I closed the door behind him .
Following me clumsily to the study , he asked for some whiskey to steady his nerves .
I forbore to question him , but waited till he felt like beginning whatever he wanted to say .
At length he ventured some information in a choking voice .
" Asenath has gone , Dan .
We had a long talk last night while the servants were out , and I made her promise to stop preying on me .
Of course I had certain — certain occult defences I never told you about .
She had to give in , but got frightfully angry .
Just packed up and started for New York — walked right out to catch the eight - twenty in to Boston .
I suppose people will talk , but I can't help that .
You need n't mention that there was any trouble — just say she 's gone on a long research trip .
" She 's probably going to stay with one of her horrible groups of devotees .
I hope she 'll go west and get a divorce — anyhow , I 've made her promise to keep away and let me alone .
It was horrible , Dan — she was stealing my body — crowding me out — making a prisoner of me .
I lay low and pretended to let her do it , but I had to be on the watch .
I could plan if I was careful , for she can't read my mind literally , or in detail .
All she could read of my planning was a sort of general mood of rebellion — and she always thought I was helpless .
Never thought I could get the best of her . . . but I had a spell or two that worked . "
Derby looked over his shoulder and took some more whiskey .
" I paid off those damned servants this morning when they got back .
They were ugly about it , and asked questions , but they went .
They 're her kin— Innsmouth people — and were hand and glove with her .
I hope they 'll let me alone — I did n't like the way they laughed when they walked away .
I must get as many of Dad 's old servants again as I can .
I 'll move back home now .
" I suppose you think I 'm crazy , Dan — but Arkham history ought to hint at things that back up what I 've told you — and what I 'm going to tell you .
You 've seen one of the changes , too — in your car after I told you about Asenath that day coming home from Maine .
That was when she got me — drove me out of my body .
The last thing I remember was when I was all worked up trying to tell you what that she - devil is .
Then she got me , and in a flash I was back at the house — in the library where those damned servants had me locked up — and in that cursed fiend 's body that is n't even human . . .
You know it was she you must have ridden home with — that preying wolf in my body — You ought to have known the difference ! "
I shuddered as Derby paused .
Surely , I had known the difference — yet could I accept an explanation as insane as this ?
But my distracted caller was growing even wilder .
" I had to save myself — I had to , Dan !
She 'd have got me for good at Hallowmass — they hold a Sabbat up there beyond Chesuncook , and the sacrifice would have clinched things .
She 'd have got me for good — she'd have been I , and I 'd have been she — forever — too late —
My body'd have been hers for good —
She'd have been a man , and fully human , just as she wanted to be — I suppose she'd have put me out of the way — killed her own ex-body with me in it , damn her , just as she did before — just as she did , or it did before — "
Edward 's face was now atrociously distorted , and he bent it uncomfortably close to mine as his voice fell to a whisper .
" You must know what I hinted in the car — that she is n't Asenath at all , but really old Ephraim himself .
I suspected it a year and a half ago , and I know it now .
Her handwriting shows it when she goes off guard — sometimes she jots down a note in writing that 's just like her father 's manuscripts , stroke for stroke — and sometimes she says things that nobody but an old man like Ephraim could say .
He changed forms with her when he felt death coming — she was the only one he could find with the right kind of brain and a weak enough will — he got her body permanently , just as she almost got mine , and then poisoned the old body he'd put her into .
Have n't you seen old Ephraim 's soul glaring out of that she - devil 's eyes dozens of times — and out of mine when she has control of my body ? "
The whisperer was panting , and paused for breath .
I said nothing ; and when he resumed his voice was nearer normal .
This , I reflected , was a case for the asylum , but I would not be the one to send him there .
Perhaps time and freedom from Asenath would do its work .
I could see that he would never wish to dabble in morbid occultism again .
" I 'll tell you more later — I must have a long rest now .
I 'll tell you something of the forbidden horrors she led me into — something of the age - old horrors that even now are festering in out - of - the - way corners with a few monstrous priests to keep them alive .
Some people know things about the universe that nobody ought to know , and can do things that nobody ought to be able to do .
I 've been in it up to my neck , but that 's the end .
Today I 'd burn that damned Necronomicon and all the rest if I were librarian at Miskatonic .
" But she can't get me now .
I must get out of that accursed house as soon as I can , and settle down at home .
You 'll help me , I know , if I need help .
Those devilish servants , you know — and if people should get too inquisitive about Asenath .
You see , I can't give them her address . . .
Then there are certain groups of searchers — certain cults , you know — that might misunderstand our breaking up . . . some of them have damnably curious ideas and methods .
I know you 'll stand by me if anything happens — even if I have to tell you a lot that will shock you . . . "
I had Edward stay and sleep in one of the guest - chambers that night , and in the morning he seemed calmer .
We discussed certain possible arrangements for his moving back into the Derby mansion , and I hoped he would lose no time in making the change .
He did not call the next evening , but I saw him frequently during the ensuing weeks .
We talked as little as possible about strange and unpleasant things , but discussed the renovation of the old Derby house , and the travels which Edward promised to take with my son and me the following summer .
Of Asenath we said almost nothing , for I saw that the subject was a peculiarly disturbing one .
Gossip , of course , was rife ; but that was no novelty in connection with the strange menage at the old Crowninshield house .
One thing I did not like was what Derby 's banker let fall in an over - expansive mood at the Miskatonic Club — about the cheques Edward was sending regularly to a Moses and Abigail Sargent and a Eunice Babson in Innsmouth .
That looked as if those evil - faced servants were extorting some kind of tribute from him — yet he had not mentioned the matter to me .
I wished that the summer — and my son's Harvard vacation — would come , so that we could get Edward to Europe .
He was not , I soon saw , mending as rapidly as I had hoped he would ; for there was something a bit hysterical in his occasional exhilaration , while his moods of fright and depression were altogether too frequent .
The old Derby house was ready by December , yet Edward constantly put off moving .
Though he hated and seemed to fear the Crowninshield place , he was at the same time queerly enslaved by it .
He could not seem to begin dismantling things , and invented every kind of excuse to postpone action .
When I pointed this out to him he appeared unaccountably frightened .
His father 's old butler — who was there with other reacquired servants — told me one day that Edward 's occasional prowlings about the house , and especially down cellar , looked odd and unwholesome to him .
I wondered if Asenath had been writing disturbing letters , but the butler said there was no mail which could have come from her .
VI [ edit ]
It was about Christmas that Derby broke down one evening while calling on me .
I was steering the conversation toward next summer 's travels when he suddenly shrieked and leaped up from his chair with a look of shocking , uncontrollable fright — a cosmic panic and loathing such as only the nether gulfs of nightmare could bring to any sane mind .
" My brain !
My brain !
God , Dan — it 's tugging — from beyond — knocking — clawing — that she - devil — even now — Ephraim — Kamog !
Kamog !
— The pit of the shoggoths — Ia !
Shub -Niggurath !
The Goat with a Thousand Young ! . . .
" The flame — the flame — beyond body , beyond life — in the earth — oh , God ! "
I pulled him back to his chair and poured some wine down his throat as his frenzy sank to a dull apathy .
He did not resist , but kept his lips moving as if talking to himself .
Presently I realized that he was trying to talk to me , and bent my ear to his mouth to catch the feeble words .
" Again , again — she 's trying — I might have known — nothing can stop that force ; not distance nor magic , nor death — it comes and comes , mostly in the night — I can't leave — it 's horrible — oh , God , Dan , if you only knew as I do just how horrible it is . . . "
When he had slumped down into a stupor I propped him with pillows and let normal sleep overtake him .
I did not call a doctor , for I knew what would be said of his sanity , and wished to give nature a chance if I possibly could .
He waked at midnight , and I put him to bed upstairs , but he was gone by morning .
He had let himself quietly out of the house — and his butler , when called on the wire , said he was at home pacing about the library .
Edward went to pieces rapidly after that .
He did not call again , but I went daily to see him .
He would always be sitting in his library , staring at nothing and having an air of abnormal listening .
Sometimes he talked rationally , but always on trivial topics .
Any mention of his trouble , of future plans , or of Asenath would send him into a frenzy .
His butler said he had frightful seizures at night , during which he might eventually do himself harm .
I had a long talk with his doctor , banker , and lawyer , and finally took the physician with two specialist colleagues to visit him .
The spasms that resulted from the first questions were violent and pitiable — and that evening a closed car took his poor struggling body to the Arkham Sanitarium .
I was made his guardian and called on him twice weekly — almost weeping to hear his wild shrieks , awesome whispers , and dreadful , droning repetitions of such phrases as " I had to do it — I had to do it — it'll get me — it 'll get me — down there — down there in the dark — Mother !
Mother !
Dan !
Save me — save me — "
How much hope of recovery there was , no one could say , but I tried my best to be optimistic .
Edward must have a home if he emerged , so I transferred his servants to the Derby mansion , which would surely be his sane choice .
What to do about the Crowninshield place with its complex arrangements and collections of utterly inexplicable objects I could not decide , so left it momentarily untouched — telling the Derby household to go over and dust the chief rooms once a week , and ordering the furnace man to have a fire on those days .
The final nightmare came before Candlemas — heralded , in cruel irony , by a false gleam of hope .
One morning late in January the sanitarium telephoned to report that Edward 's reason had suddenly come back .
His continuous memory , they said , was badly impaired ; but sanity itself was certain .
Of course he must remain some time for observation , but there could be little doubt of the outcome .
All going well , he would surely be free in a week .
I hastened over in a flood of delight , but stood bewildered when a nurse took me to Edward 's room .
The patient rose to greet me , extending his hand with a polite smile ; but I saw in an instant that he bore the strangely energized personality which had seemed so foreign to his own nature — the competent personality I had found so vaguely horrible , and which Edward himself had once vowed was the intruding soul of his wife .
There was the same blazing vision — so like Asenath 's and old Ephraim 's — and the same firm mouth ; and when he spoke I could sense the same grim , pervasive irony in his voice — the deep irony so redolent of potential evil .
This was the person who had driven my car through the night five months before — the person I had not seen since that brief call when he had forgotten the oldtime doorbell signal and stirred such nebulous fears in me — and now he filled me with the same dim feeling of blasphemous alienage and ineffable cosmic hideousness .
He spoke affably of arrangements for release — and there was nothing for me to do but assent , despite some remarkable gaps in his recent memories .
Yet I felt that something was terribly , inexplicably wrong and abnormal .
There were horrors in this thing that I could not reach .
This was a sane person — but was it indeed the Edward Derby I had known ?
If not , who or what was it — and where was Edward ?
Ought it to be free or confined — or ought it to be extirpated from the face of the earth ?
There was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything the creature said — the Asenath - like eyes lent a special and baffling mockery to certain words about the early liberty earned by an especially close confinement !
I must have behaved very awkwardly , and was glad to beat a retreat .
All that day and the next I racked my brain over the problem .
What had happened ?
What sort of mind looked out through those alien eyes in Edward 's face ?
I could think of nothing but this dimly terrible enigma , and gave up all efforts to perform my usual work .
The second morning the hospital called up to say that the recovered patient was unchanged , and by evening I was close to a nervous collapse — a state I admit , though others will vow it coloured my subsequent vision .
I have nothing to say on this point except that no madness of mine could account for all the evidence .
VII [ edit ]
It was in the night — after that second evening — that stark , utter horror burst over me and weighted my spirit with a black , clutching panic from which it can never shake free .
It began with a telephone call just before midnight .
I was the only one up , and sleepily took down the receiver in the library .
No one seemed to be on the wire , and I was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end .
Was someone trying under great difficulties to talk ?
As I listened I thought I heard a sort of half - liquid bubbling noise — " glub . . . glub . . . glub " — which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate , unintelligible word and syllable divisions .
I called " Who is it ? "
But the only answer was " glub . . . glub . . . glub - glub . "
I could only assume that the noise was mechanical ; but fancying that it might be a case of a broken instrument able to receive but not to send , I added , " I can't hear you .
Better hang up and try Information . "
Immediately I heard the receiver go on the hook at the other end .
This , I say , was just about midnight .
When the call was traced afterward it was found to come from the old Crowninshield house , though it was fully half a week from the housemaid 's day to be there .
I shall only hint what was found at that house — the upheaval in a remote cellar storeroom , the tracks , the dirt , the hastily rifled wardrobe , the baffling marks on the telephone , the clumsily used stationery , and the detestable stench lingering over everything .
The police , poor fools , have their smug little theories , and are still searching for those sinister discharged servants — who have dropped out of sight amidst the present furore .
They speak of a ghoulish revenge for things that were done , and say I was included because I was Edward 's best friend and adviser .
Idiots !
Do they fancy those brutish clowns could have forged that handwriting ?
Do they fancy they could have brought what later came ?
Are they blind to the changes in that body that was Edward's ?
As for me , I now believe all that Edward Derby ever told me .
There are horrors beyond life 's edge that we do not suspect , and once in a while man 's evil prying calls them just within our range .
Ephraim — Asenath — that devil called them in , and they engulfed Edward as they are engulfing me .
Can I be sure that I am safe ?
Those powers survive the life of the physical form .
The next day — in the afternoon , when I pulled out of my prostration and was able to walk and talk coherently — I went to the madhouse and shot him dead for Edward 's and the world 's sake , but can I be sure till he is cremated ?
They are keeping the body for some silly autopsies by different doctors — but I say he must be cremated .
He must be cremated — he who was not Edward Derby when I shot him .
I shall go mad if he is not , for I may be the next .
But my will is not weak — and I shall not let it be undermined by the terrors I know are seething around it .
One life — Ephraim , Asenath , and Edward — who now ?
I will not be driven out of my body . . .
I will not change souls with that bullet - ridden lich in the madhouse !
But let me try to tell coherently of that final horror .
I will not speak of what the police persistently ignored — the tales of that dwarfed , grotesque , malodorous thing met by at least three wayfarers in High Street just before two o'clock , and the nature of the single footprints in certain places .
I will say only that just about two the doorbell and knocker waked me — doorbell and knocker both , applied alternately and uncertainly in a kind of weak desperation , and each trying to keep Edward 's old signal of three - and - two strokes .
Roused from sound sleep , my mind leaped into a turmoil .
Derby at the door — and remembering the old code !
That new personality had not remembered it . . . was Edward suddenly back in his rightful state ?
Why was he here in such evident stress and haste ?
Had he been released ahead of time , or had he escaped ?
Perhaps , I thought as I flung on a robe and bounded downstairs , his return to his own self had brought raving and violence , revoking his discharge and driving him to a desperate dash for freedom .
Whatever had happened , he was good old Edward again , and I would help him !
When I opened the door into the elm- arched blackness a gust of insufferably foetid wind almost flung me prostrate .
I choked in nausea , and for a second scarcely saw the dwarfed , humped figure on the steps .
The summons had been Edward's , but who was this foul , stunted parody ?
Where had Edward had time to go ?
His ring had sounded only a second before the door opened .
The caller had on one of Edward 's overcoats — its bottom almost touching the ground , and its sleeves rolled back yet still covering the hands .
On the head was a slouch hat pulled low , while a black silk muffler concealed the face .
As I stepped unsteadily forward , the figure made a semi- liquid sound like that I had heard over the telephone — " glub . . . glub . . . " — and thrust at me a large , closely written paper impaled on the end of a long pencil .
Still reeling from the morbid and unaccountable foetor , I seized the paper and tried to read it in the light from the doorway .
Beyond question , it was in Edward 's script .
But why had he written when he was close enough to ring — and why was the script so awkward , coarse and shaky ?
I could make out nothing in the dim half light , so edged back into the hall , the dwarf figure clumping mechanically after but pausing on the inner door 's threshold .
The odour of this singular messenger was really appalling , and I hoped ( not in vain , thank God ! ) that my wife would not wake and confront it .
Then , as I read the paper , I felt my knees give under me and my vision go black .
I was lying on the floor when I came to , that accursed sheet still clutched in my fear - rigid hand .
This is what it said .
" Dan — go to the sanitarium and kill it .
Exterminate it .
It is n't Edward Derby any more .
She got me — it 's Asenath — and she has been dead three months and a half .
I lied when I said she had gone away .
I killed her .
I had to .
It was sudden , but we were alone and I was in my right body .
I saw a candlestick and smashed her head in .
She would have got me for good at Hallowmass .
" I buried her in the farther cellar storeroom under some old boxes and cleaned up all the traces .
The servants suspected next morning , but they have such secrets that they dare not tell the police .
I sent them off , but God knows what they — and others of the cult — will do .
" I thought for a while I was all right , and then I felt the tugging at my brain .
I knew what it was — I ought to have remembered .
A soul like hers — or Ephraim 's — is half detached , and keeps right on after death as long as the body lasts .
She was getting me — making me change bodies with her — seizing my body and putting me in that corpse of hers buried in the cellar .
" I knew what was coming — that 's why I snapped and had to go to the asylum .
Then it came — I found myself choked in the dark — in Asenath 's rotting carcass down there in the cellar under the boxes where I put it .
And I knew she must be in my body at the sanitarium — permanently , for it was after Hallowmass , and the sacrifice would work even without her being there — sane , and ready for release as a menace to the world .
I was desperate , and in spite of everything I clawed my way out .
" I 'm too far gone to talk — I could n't manage to telephone — but I can still write .
I 'll get fixed up somehow and bring this last word and warning .
Kill that fiend if you value the peace and comfort of the world .
See that it is cremated .
If you do n't , it will live on and on , body to body forever , and I can't tell you what it will do .
Keep clear of black magic , Dan , it 's the devil 's business .
Goodbye — you 've been a great friend .
Tell the police whatever they 'll believe — and I 'm damnably sorry to drag all this on you .
I 'll be at peace before long — this thing wo n't hold together much more .
Hope you can read this .
And kill that thing — kill it .
Yours — Ed . "
It was only afterward that I read the last half of this paper , for I had fainted at the end of the third paragraph .
I fainted again when I saw and smelled what cluttered up the threshold where the warm air had struck it .
The messenger would not move or have consciousness any more .
The butler , tougher - fibred than I , did not faint at what met him in the hall in the morning .
Instead , he telephoned the police .
When they came I had been taken upstairs to bed , but the — other mass — lay where it had collapsed in the night .
The men put handkerchiefs to their noses .
What they finally found inside Edward 's oddly - assorted clothes was mostly liquescent horror .
There were bones , too — and a crushed - in skull .
Some dental work positively identified the skull as Asenath's .
THE BIGGER - THAN -TV MOVIE --
Most digital still cameras today can also capture video big enough to fill a standard TV screen ( 640 by 480 pixels ) and smooth enough to simulate standard TV motion ( 30 frames a second ) .
But Canon 's PowerShot S80 model goes one step further : it can capture videos at even higher resolution ( 1024 x 768 pixels ) .
Why on earth would you need a video picture of higher resolution than the TV itself ?
Three reasons .
First , your videos will look better on high - definition sets .
Second , the videos fill much more of your computer screen when played there .
And finally , that 's so much resolution , you can isolate a single frame and grab it as a still photograph .
TV À LA CARTE --
It 's always seemed crazy that TV companies would spend $ 1 million an episode writing and producing a program that is shown only once .
Yet the obvious solution -- making past shows available for purchase on the Internet -- gave TV executives nightmares of teenage download pirates run amok .
It took Apple to persuade them to dip a little toe into the Internet waters .
ABC took the first plunge , offering iPod owners five shows ' worth of archives for a perfectly pitched price of $ 2 each -- and no commercials .
NBC came next with a broader menu of shows .
The concept was a hit , the floodgates have opened , and the era of downloadable , reasonably priced , lightly copy - protected TV episodes is finally upon us .
THE OUTER - BUTTON FLIP PHONE --
First came the cellphone with a hinge ( the flip phone ) .
Then came the flip phone with an external screen , so you could see who was calling .
Problem was , this arrangement deprived you of the option to dismiss the call or send it to voice mail .
If you opened the flip phone to get to the Ignore button , you 'd answer the call -- unless you 'd turned off the " opening phone answers the call " feature , in which case you lost one great convenience of having a flip phone to begin with .
The solution ?
Add buttons on the outside of the phone .
When a call comes in to the LG VX8100 , for example , its external screen identifies the caller -- and the small buttons just below it are labeled Ignore ( let it ring until voice mail picks up ) or Dismiss ( send it directly and immediately to voice mail ) .
You get the best of all cellular worlds , without ever having to open the phone .
THE FREE DOMAIN NAME --
A domain name is what comes before the " .com " in a Web address -- like NYTimes.com , verizonwireless.com or MarryMeBritney.com .
Getting your own personal dot - com name has its privileges -- for example , your e-mail address can be You@YourNameHere.com -- but it costs money and requires some expertise .
