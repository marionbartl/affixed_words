Breaking : PSPgo dismemberment reveals battery placement chicanery !
You remember when Sony said that the PSPgo battery would be untouchable in an effort to curb piracy ?
Well , it turns out that the battery can be removed , but that Sony thought it could simply slap a warranty - voiding sticker over the thing to try and dissuade people , rather than employ some sort of competent security .
That 's about the only reason I can think of for Sony doing this , effectively ending the warranty of anybody who feels the need to replace their PSPgo battery .
The battery itself is not soldered in place , which makes this sticker a rather lazy ( and likely ineffective ) way of discouraging homebrewers from screwing with the machine 's innards .
Not to mention the fact that iFixit believes patient pirates will be able to slip the battery out while leaving the sticker intact .
In other news , the PSPgo has no metal framework whatsoever , meaning that its entire structural integrity is provided by a thin plastic shell .
The original PSP never exactly felt durable , but you can expect this one to require as much care as a baby with brittle bone disease .
One wonders how much this $ 250 device actually costs to make .
Still , that battery thing is hilarious .
Just whacking a sticker on the thing ?
Come on , Sony -- even the constant , irritating firmware updating is a better idea than this , and that idea was sh*t .

September 18 , 2009 – STRATFORD , Canada – Hemp is not pot !
This simple botanical fact may soon become painfully clear to some would - be stoners who have been stealing hemp from a farmer ’s field in Stratford .
There ’s a crucial difference between hemp and marijuana : smoking pot makes you high , whereas smoking hemp will do nothing at best , or make you violently ill at worst .
So Stratford Ontario police have issued a warning to anyone planning a hemp heist :
“ If you ’ve already stolen hemp , do not attempt to smoke it , because its potential side - effects include splitting headaches and nausea , or just utter disappointment ” said Insp. Sam Theocharis . ”
“ Our biggest concern is from a public - safety standpoint .
Hemp is not meant for ingestion and the user will become violently ill and may very well require hospital care . ”
Police have also notified Stratford General Hospital and made them aware of the possibility that people may arrive at the emergency unit suffering the ill effects of hemp ingestion , said Theocharis .
Police have also notified the producer of the crop .
“ This situation also goes beyond the health risk to people taking the plant , ” said Theocharis .
“ Most notably , this is a legally produced crop and people taking the plant are stealing .
In Canada , it is also an offence to have hemp or to sell it if you are not legally licensed to do so . ”
Hemp and marijuana are both members of the cannabis family and look similar .
Theocharis said the most significant difference in the presence of THC ( tetrahydrocannabino ) in marijuana .
THC is the chemical that provides the “ high ” associated with marijuana .
Legally grown hemp must contain less that 0.3 per cent THC .
Hemp growing has been legal in Canada for 11 years , since the crop can be used to make fabrics , textiles , paints , paper and other products .
Confusion arises because hemp and marijuana are both members of the cannabis family and can be easily mistaken for one another .
The majority of the hemp thefts have occurred at a field just south of the Stratford Festival Marketplace Mall , where it is being grown legally .
Police spotted several people lurking behind the mall and carrying empty duffelbags Thursday night .
Police alerted the owner of the field , who warned of the potential dangers of smoking hemp .
Stratford police are urging anyone who has mistaken hemp for pot to discard it immediately and not share it with anyone .

Dime Mag has a great piece titled “ The Top 10 Guys That Need to Break Out This Season “ .
For the story photo on the site they chose none other than Luol Deng .
Of Deng they write :
After signing a monster deal before last season , Deng played in only 49 games and had his worst season across the board since his rookie year .
While Derrick Rose may be the man in Chicago , Deng was certainly paid as such .
And if the Bulls want to do some damage this year , they ’re going to need to have Deng step up – especially with the departure of Ben Gordon .
Deng has some fierce battles ahead of him .
He will undoubtedly have to play through pain .
He ’ll have to adapt to Derrick Rose and figure out how to prosper in the offense .
It ca n’t just be mid-range Js anymore .
He has to run .
Cut .
Get to the basket .
He ’ll have to play against teams that have figured him out and “ have a book ” on him .
This was obvious last year to even the most novice of basketball fans : teams know what they want to do against Deng .
And it works .
Deng is likely the X - factor in the determination of how far the Bulls go once they reach the playoffs .
If he can comeback and average 18 on 50 % shooting while getting back his lateral quickness as a defender , the Bulls may get past round one .
If it ’s the Deng of last year , or an unhealthy Deng ( 69 games missed over past 2 seasons ) than we might be left to wonder where all the points are going to come from .
You want to forget about the departure of BG ?
Luol Deng has to score the ball .
Bulls fans can look forward to 2010 , to be sure .
But Deng has an albatross of a contract .
If he does not come back to form and excel , he will be movable only in the Ben Wallace / Larry Hughes salary - dump type deals .
The resignation of Van Jones was a " loss for the country , " according to Gov. Howard Dean .
" I think he was brought down , " Dean told Fox News ' Chris Wallace .
John Amato :
Howard Dean said he spoke to Van Jones and said ...
Well , he was told by the people waving clip boards around that he was signing something else and I think that 's too bad .
Digby writes :
I would hope that these leftist extremists like Color of Change will think twice before they go after an upstanding company like FOX News because the lesson here is that somebody is going to pay a big price for doing it .
In fact , it probably would pay to keep a close eye on the FOX gasbags from now on to get an idea of which groups or individuals have offended the network and get rid of them before anyone has a chance to make a public stink .
It would save everyone a lot of time and trouble .
We have members in the Republican party like the Michelle Bachmann 's that say and do insane things all day long , but they just get a pat on the back from the media and say thank you , may I have another .
The Washington Post actually let a little truth slip into their article about the FOX witch hunt .

Hannibal Lecter , The Silence of the Lambs ( book ) " You 'd like to quantify me , Officer Starling .
You 're so ambitious , are n't you ?
Do you know what you look like to me , with your good bag and your cheap shoes ?
You look like a rube . "
Only a fool tries Perp Sweating a brainy killer .
He knows all the tricks of psychology , and will turn the tables .
The creeper starts out with a few seemingly - innocent questions about the interrogator 's life or even appearance —
" Why did you go into law enforcement instead of medicine like you wanted ? " or " Why are n't you married ? "
Then , the supposed loon asks more armor piercing questions , which turn into comments , which turn into deconstructions , which turn into declarations about how the interrogator has failed in different ways .
Pretty soon , the loon is doing all the interrogating and all the answering , with the poor ' interrogator ' doing nothing but nodding their assent and crying .

In the climax , the prisoner 's probing becomes a full - blown breaking lecture .
This method of ' interrogating the interrogator ' is a subtype known as a Hannibal Lecture .
The theme of the lecture is always the same : their captor is a sad , pathetic failure who is only holding the prisoner captive to give themselves delusions of adequacy .
Frequently , the captor must admit they are Not So Different morally .
A Deconstruction or subversion may involve the killer trying this on the interrogator , only to find that the interrogator is Too Dumb to Fool and does n't understand why he 's supposed to feel bad about whatever the killer said .
Either that , or the interrogator simply does n't care about the killer 's opinion .
Incidentally , professional interrogators for police and other investigative agencies are trained never to answer questions .
Ever .
The main protagonist of The Closer is one of the few interrogators on TV who is faithful to this basic precept .
Movie Nazis tend to respond with " Ve are askink ze qvestions here ! "

Berserk : Something of a recurring situation .
In the very first episode of the manga , Guts enters a bar and attacks some soldiers of the wicked Baron of Koka Castle , leaving one alive to tell his master that the Black Swordsman has come to fight him .
The mayor of the town , fearing that Guts 's transgression will cause the Baron to punish the townspeople as well , has Guts locked up so he can turn him over to the Baron .
When the mayor drops in on Guts 's torture to ask whether he has any idea how much danger he 's put the town in , or what kind of fiend the Baron is , Guts replies that he already knows : the Baron is a monster who eats human flesh .
He also knows that the mayor sends the Baron women and children as offerings , taunting him for not really caring about his people or the greater good , just about sacrificing others to save his own skin .
This accusation hits the mark so perfectly that the old man seems to almost have a heart attack , drawing a smirk from Guts , though this provokes the mayor to have Guts tortured so severely that he can barely move afterward .
In the Golden Age Arc , Griffith gets imprisoned by the King of Midland as punishment for deflowering Princess Charlotte .
While personally administering lashes , the King reproaches Griffith for betraying his trust and rants about what a thankless job it's been trying to keep his kingdom from falling apart ; his only comfort is his daughter , and Griffith would take even that away from him .
Up to this point Griffith had taken his beating stoically , but then he turns the tables : he 's figured out that the real reason the King has been so overprotective of Charlotte is that he secretly feels incestuous attraction towards his own daughter .
King or not , he 's just a repressed , dirty old man who 's jealous that Griffith got to her first .
Confronted with the Awful Truth about his own feelings , the king goes absolutely berserk on Griffith and descends into being The Caligula Midway through the Conviction Arc Guts gets arrested by Farnese , a Knight Templar in charge of the Holy Iron Chain Knights who holds him responsible for the mass deaths which resulted from his battles with Apostles .
With Guts tied up in her tent , Farnese gives him A Taste of the Lash and demands in the name of the Holy See that he confess his crimes .
Guts , however , picks up on how her tyrannical style of leadership and holier - than - thou attitude are her way of compensating for deep - seated insecurity .
He gives her a speech about how she 's completely out of her depth , ending with , " From where I stand , you 're the same as that idol you worship .
Completely hollow . "
This hits such a nerve that Farnese screams in rage and starts wildly whipping him , which Guts takes unflinchingly until she 's too exhausted to continue and there are bleeding wounds all over his chest .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - American companies are now sitting on record mountains of cash in an indication of deep worries about the economy ’s future .
Even though analysts forecast a return to U.S. economic growth by the third quarter , companies have yet to show any major signs of rehiring or spending .
And with consumers also hoarding cash at near record levels , a cautious stance by companies could add to worries about the sustainability of an economic recovery .
Earnings growth could be relatively flat as cash piles build , but then surge once consumers , and businesses , become more confident in the economy , analysts said .
The increased cash holdings are “ negative in that they ’re not going to lead a recovery , but would react to evidence that there ’s an improving economy , ” said Jim Awad , managing director at Zephyr Management in New York .
It provides further evidence that “ businesses are just holding back , ” said Fred Dickson , market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego , Oregon .
“ There ’s still a very high level of anxiety regarding the timing and speed and sustainability of an economic recovery . ” he said .
Standard & Poor ’s 500 companies ’ cash levels , which have stood at around $ 600 billion to $ 665 billion since 2004 , jumped to $ 700 billion in the second quarter , S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt said .
He said the amount covers the entire S&P 500 minus financials , utilities and transportation companies , which carry high cash reserves as a normal part of business .
Information technology companies held the largest amount of cash at $ 240 billion , accounting for 34 percent of all the cash holdings , followed by health care , with $ 209 billion , he said .
“ SURVIVOR ” STRATEGY
“ Companies are being very careful about spending money , ” Silverblatt said .
The positive is that companies now have a “ war chest for when they believe things are better , ” he said .
While bottom - line earnings improved in the second quarter from the first quarter , revenue did not , he noted .
Earnings for S&P 500 companies now are estimated to decline 27.8 percent from a year ago , according to Thomson Reuters .
That ’s better than the decline of 35.5 percent in the first quarter of this year .
Revenue , on the other hand , went from a 10.6 percent decline in the first quarter to a drop of 14.6 percent in the second quarter , according to Thomson Reuters data .
Companies are “ still cutting to the bone , ” said Doug Roberts , chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research.com in Shrewsbury , New Jersey .
“ The real question will be : ‘ At what point do you start looking for revenue growth ? ’ ”
Reports last week showed weak consumer sentiment in August and an unexpected decline in July retail sales , adding to worries about how much the consumer will help in a recovery .
“ Corporations are still in survival mode , cutting costs , preparing for the worst , ” Awad said .
He said they ’re likely to remain in that mode until “ it ’s clear the hopeful consensus on Wall Street about a sharp improvement in economy in the third and fourth quarters ... is accurate . ”
Economists are forecasting GDP growth in the third quarter , partly because companies need to rebuild inventories to keep their businesses running and as the holidays approach .
Meanwhile , S&P 500 companies ’ earnings are forecast to show a turnaround by the fourth quarter of this year .
Earnings for the third quarter are forecast to decline 20.7 percent , Thomson Reuters data showed .

The move could boost Liverpool 's profile in the Middle East A Saudi Arabian prince has confirmed he is looking to buy up to half of Premier League football club Liverpool .
Prince Faisal bin Fahd bin Abdullah al - Saud told the Saudi Al - Riyadh newspaper " we are looking forward to acquiring 50 % of the club 's stake " .
The price of £ 200 m to £ 350 m he is ready to pay for the stake is more than the £ 174 m US owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett paid for the whole club .
A deal to open football schools in the Middle East has also been signed .
' Sports investments '
The prince 's sports investment company F6 has confirmed it has reached a deal with Liverpool co-owner George Gillett to set up two academies in Saudi Arabia and two in North Africa .
The deal would also extend the interests of the US Nascar motorsport series in the Middle East .
" This partnership will provide a lot of investments in football , racing and sports media in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East , " an F6 statement said .
" The contracts are basically sports investments , which also include establishing football academies that will definitely help the future of Saudi sports in the future . "
Meanwhile the prince said it would be " marvellous " to seal a deal securing a 50 % at the Merseyside club , which he called one of the most famous in the world .
' Concluded soon '
Mr Hicks and Mr Gillett have been looking to reduce Liverpool 's £ 245 m debt and paid off £ 60 m in July .
That was when the loan used taken out to buy the club in February 2007 ran out and was renegotiated with banks RBS and Wachovia .
Considering what Hicks and Gillett paid it is a huge increase in the club 's value
Harry Philp , Hermes Sports Partners
" The deal will be concluded soon and its value will be between £ 200 m and £ 350 m , " the Al - Riyadh paper quoted the prince , who is also an honorary member of Saudi football club Al Hilal , as saying .
" If we finalise the deal , it will be something marvellous because Liverpool is one of the best and most famous clubs in England and the whole world . "
The Saudi interest comes after a document was leaked showing that since March 2009 the club has been seeking to attract new investors in return for a stake in the Anfield club .
In March 2009 , a prospectus drawn up by investment banks Rothschild and Merrill Lynch told potential investors that for £ 50 m they could get a minority stake in " one of the world 's most successful football clubs " .
Prince Faisal bin Fahd bin Abdullah al - Saud , who was at Anfield on Saturday for the 6 - 1 win over Hull - where he signed the deal for the academies - now appears to be seeking to invest much more than £ 50 m .
As well as the F6 sports investment vehicle he is also chairman of Saudi holding company FAMA Group Stadium on hold " Considering what Hicks and Gillett paid it is a huge increase in the club 's value to somewhere between £ 400 m and £ 700 m , " Harry Philp , managing director at sports financers and advisers Hermes Sports Partners , told the BBC .
" They had to refinance their debt with their banks recently .
Despite paying off £ 60 m of their debt recently as part of that refinancing it is still surprising , particularly considering that plans for a new stadium are on hold . "
However , a number of questions remain over any possible investment , should the Saudis take a stake .
" The Saudis will have to take 25 % of the club from each of Hicks and Gillett if they want half the club , but whether they both would be willing to sell any more of their holdings is unknown , " added Mr Philp .
Mr Hicks has promised that a new stadium will be built when the current global financial turmoil settles down .
Liverpool recently signed a sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered bank , a sign that the club 's commercial revenues are set to remain healthy over the coming seasons .
The deal begins next July and runs to the end of the 2013 / 14 season .

An interview with Australia 's only recipient of the Fields Medal , awarded every four years to two , three or four mathematicians under the age of 40 .
The Fields Medal is often described as the Nobel prize for mathematics because of the prestige it carries .
I was coming out of the staff club when I ran into a colleague going into it .
I changed direction and went in with him .
It was a pleasant dinner and by the time we all worked our way to its conclusion someone managed to say : “ But surely reason is universal . ”
“ Is it ? ”
“ Well , if you have scientists from U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. and France and Britain and Japan at a conference , they are able to arrive at conclusions in common . ”
“ True but you also have controversy in science , with scientists differing among themselves . ”
“ But they can always appeal to empirical verification to establish whose reasoning is correct through experiment , or through observation as in the case of astronomy . ”
“ But to the extent that a line of reasoning is verifiable it is extra-subjective and the way to really settle an issue is to make it extra-subjective .
Reason , however , is intra-subjective , and it remains in the realm of reason only to the extent that it is debatable . ”
“ No .
Your approach draws a fundamental distinction between science and other forums of reasoning but the scientific method is only one form of reasoning .
As a matter of fact there is no such thing as the scientific method . ”
“ There is n’t ? ”
“ No .
A lot of work has been done on this point by philosophers of religion . ”
“ But if reason is so universal in its operation and the scientific method , so to say , also falls in the domain of reason , then why do scholars agree that the earth is spherical ( pace the Flat Earth Society ) but do not agree whether God exists or not ? ”
“ Because in the latter case there are good reasons for and against and because science , so to say , is a special case of reason . ”
“ It is so special that its conclusions command an acceptance denied to reason in its other applications ? ”
“ But in its other applications too reason should command the same acceptance , ” said the colleague .
He was by now on his cup of coffee and I on my cup of tea .
“ Then why do scholars differ so sharply in other realms of reason ? ”
“ Because the correct reasoning has not yet been established . ”
“ But what constitutes correct reason .
Or better still , what is reason anyway ? ”
“ It can not be defined but surely what is reasonable is clear enough . ”
“ Perhaps to reasonable people , ” I said .
“ We are talking of reasonable people . ”
My friend would not let my obiter dictum slip by .
“ Then why do even reasonable people differ ? ”
“ Because reason has not yet fully worked out the issue . ”
“ That sounds reasonable , ” I said .
“ But could not what is considered reasonable be culture - bound ? ”
“ Give an example . ”
“ Well .
It was considered reasonable in medieval times in the Christian West that biblical authority should be accepted in matters related to the physical universe .
This was not considered reasonable in Hindu thought for instance , wherein the scope of scriptural authority was limited to matters of morality and salvation , so there is a difference of opinion here regarding the field in which reason can be applied . ”
“ But these matters as to the field in which reason could be applied can be settled by recourse to reason itself , ” the colleague said .
“ If it were , ” I said , “ why would even some scientists arrive at correct conclusions , verified by experiments , for the wrong reasons .
I have been told that this has happened in the history of science .
But then what is reason ? ”
“ It ’s a mystery , ” the colleague said .
And we left it as such .

BleachBit is now portable on Linux and Windows .
It should find its own files ( cleaners , icon , etc ) regardless of the current working directory in which it was started .
On Windows , this means you can just unzip BleachBit to a portable USB drive or run it from your desktop without installation : for more information on installing and starting in portable mode , read the documentation .
On Linux , it 's now even easier to run from the source .
( You never had to compile BleachBit , so it was also fairly easy to run from source on Linux . )

If you package BleachBit for a repository , please check your launcher .
Bleach Bit 0.6.5 uses some absolute imports instead of relative imports .
If it starts , the new imports work .
Report any bugs to the bug tracker or a comment to this blog post .
Because of the significant time it takes to prepare all the installation packages , only the following installation packages are offered for this beta :
UPDATE September 30 : BleachBit 0.6.5 has been released .
For other Linux distributions , you can try the most similar installation package above .
For example , Linux Mint 7 users can download the Ubuntu 9.04 package .
Alternatively run from source ( instructions ) , which is not very difficult because there is nothing to compile .
Check back soon for the final release with the detailed release notes and wider selection of installation packages ( as usual ) .
[ Updated 9:20 p.m. EDT 7/10/09 with responses from Google ; see the sections marked “ Update ” below ]
Yesterday Google announced that the “ My Location ” feature familiar to anyone who ’s used Google Maps on a mobile device — the little blue button that shows you your position on a map — is now available to people accessing Google Maps from their laptop or desktop computers as well ( as long as they ’re using the latest versions of the Firefox or Chrome browsers ) .
But there ’s a problem :
Users are reporting in large numbers today that the My Location feature is erratic , placing them in the wrong city and occasionally on the wrong continent .
Behind this phenomenon , it turns out , is a story about competing ideas on the best way to endow Web - based applications like mapping programs with an awareness of their location — and about the race between companies like Google , Microsoft , and Boston ’s Skyhook Wireless to control the way location information is fed to these applications .
Skyhook ’s CEO , Ted Morgan , gave me his perspective on the Google Maps development in an interview this morning .
( See below for our Q&A . )
You might think that all browsers would handle location - finding in the same way .
And that ’s the ideal — the Cambridge , MA - based World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) has a draft Geolocation API ( application programming interface ) specification that spells out how browsers should pass the details about a computer ’s location from the computer itself to the Web applications running inside the browser .
But as Morgan explains , the W3C standard does n’t specify where or how the browser should get this information from the computer — which leaves room open for competing approaches , and potentially for back - room deals .
Several years ago , Skyhook developed a browser plugin called Loki that taps into a computer ’s Wi-Fi chip , takes a reading of all nearby Wi-Fi access points , and uses Skyhook ’s proprietary database of access point locations around the world to triangulate the device ’s location .
The Apple iPhone uses this Skyhook technology whenever its Safari browser or its built - in Google Maps application request location data .
But when Google rolled out the “ My Location ” feature for laptop and desktop computers , the company decided to use its own geolocation algorithms rather than Skyhook’s .
That was possible because the Mozilla Foundation built Google ’s algorithms into the latest version of its open - source browser , Firefox 3.5 , which was released on June 30 .
( Google also built the algorithms , not surprisingly , into its own Chrome browser . )
Google ’s geolocation technology is similar in principle to Skyhook ’s — it also depends largely on information about nearby Wi-Fi access points — but the accuracy of the locations actually produced by the new “ My Location ” feature seems to vary wildly , as users have been discovering over the last day and half .
Judging from posts on Twitter , the Google system is placing some people thousands of miles away from their actual locations .
An unusual number of people , for example , report that the My Location feature shows them as being in downtown Austin , TX , even if they ’re half a continent away .
“ Google Maps ’ new ‘ Show My Location ’ feature puts me in the middle of Austin , TX .
I ’m actually downtown Manhattan , ’ PhoneTag.com co-founder Mark Dillon tweeted today .
While Austin may be the center of the tech world for some South by Southwest addicts , it clearly has n’t experienced any actual jump in population since Thursday .
The problem , according to Skyhook CEO Ted Morgan , lies in the way Google collects the data behind its Wi-Fi - based positioning system .
For information about the locations of access points , Google relies on crowdsourcing — it quietly gathers local readings every time someone uses a Google app on an iPhone or a Blackberry , or some other mobile device .
Crowdsourcing is an inherently sloppy approach , according to Morgan .
Skyhook ’s own approach is to send Wi-Fi-sensing vehicles down every highway , street , and alley , methodically establishing the position and strength of every access point they pass ( most are broadband routers owned by local businesses and residents ) .
Morgan says
Skyhook has also developed ways of correcting for the fact that access points sometimes move — for example , when someone relocates their home from Austin to Manhattan .
[ UPDATE : Google offers a different reason for the inaccuracies .
Reached by e-mail this evening , Google communications officer Elaine Filadelfo said users having issues with accuracy “ are likely users who are not using Wi -Fi , for which we can generally provide a more accurate location .
Without Wi -Fi , we base location on IP address , which can be inaccurate depending on your ISP and its location . ” ]
Morgan would like to give every developer working on location - aware Web applications the opportunity to tap into Skyhook ’s more accurate database through Loki .
The problem is that … Next Page »

Trending on Xconomy
If there is one thing that ’s constant in web promotion and SEO , its that search results change .
After a few “ Google dances , ” all rookie webmasters should learn to never get complacent about SERP positions because links can fade and new algorithms can make old strategies irrelevant .
Remember , if you ’re standing still , you ’re actually sinking .
In the last few years , there ’s been a subtle - but - distinct trend toward cutting out the noise of an often corrupt and noisy web Democracy , and that trend is rewarding authority sites and recognizable web brands with the titles of aristocracy in a new online Republic .
Brand and Authority – The Aristocracy
A particular SEO vulnerability allowed for relatively unknown domains to rank for specific keyword phrases by excessively optimizing for the terms .
Deep links were relatively powerful , and just a few anchor - text / title matches could promote a site to the front page for just one of its URLs .
Super - specialized URLs could overpower the broader obscurity of a site .
This was really easy to accomplish just two years ago when I started publishing online and it gave me a good start financially to explore refining my efforts .
But to counter - act this , Google has been placing more emphases on the sites with signs of activity and overall authority .
Not every SEO really has passion for the writing and coding they promote , and a pure profit - motive frequently delivers a poor experience to the surfer .
We can be fairly certain that Google is constantly in the process of expanding the number of variables they ’re considering and evaluating how they are ranked , but we can really only speculate on what exactly the important variables of the month are .
The most common guesses would assign high value to the following variables , in no particular order :
Frequency of Content Updates
Typical Rate of Link Acquisition
Value and Source of Links
Homepage Pagerank
Engagement Signals ( Bounce rate , comments , time on page )
Non-hyper - linked brand mentions
“ Depth ” of content ( more unique words , images , videos , PDFs )
Feed Subscriptions
Exclusive Subject / Niche Focus
We do know that Google is doing its best to collect all of this data , but we do n’t know exactly how its being used and what relative weight is assigned to each of the factors that are considered .
And while small , ultra - specialized sites are still fairly successful , it only seems to work well now if the entire domain is dedicated to a singular purpose .
If you ’re branching out beyond one topic , your site will need to show more popularity in all of them before the specialized keywords connect .
In short , you ca n’t half ass your link - bait and focus on generating links for your best sales pages .
Google followed its customers – The People Have Spoken
This trend toward brand and authority is n’t something Google decided to push the internet toward .
It was a movement pioneered by the searchers themselves .
People were adding “ wikipedia , ” “ youtube , ” and “ myspace ” to a huge number of search queries and Google has no choice but to give searchers what they want .
If you only learn one thing about SEO , learn this : Google has to deliver the best search results to stay in business – everything else is made possible because searchers like the service .
So while the internet version 2.0 promised to strengthen the web ’s democracy by giving everyone a voice and a vote , we actually ended up with something more like an aristocratic republic .
Webmasters ( property owners ) get a vote relative to the value of their properties , but commenters and social - sphere contributors have mostly been filtered out of the search engine voting process .
Do n’t act surprised now , when was the last time you heard someone talk about the “ Democracy of the Web ? ”
Collectively , some social sites may have a significant vote left , but the vast majority have opted out with the wide use of the nofollow attribute on outbound links .
And do n’t act sad either , if you ’re interested enough in SEO to read this far in you probably wanted to vote twice or ten times yourself .
As blogs and bookmarking sites were the most easily abused by SEOs , these were the democratic votes that had to be filtered out .
Unfortunately for proponents of a more egalitarian web , the average surfer has never had less influence on how the information of the web is stored by search engines .
As political analysts rave about the democratizing effect of the web in Iran and China , they have n’t talked much about how the web itself is recoiling and backing away from that very democracy .
Long Live the Republic ?
Where direct democracy is susceptible to fraud and absurd or extreme whims ( remember when searching for “ failure ” took you to Bush ’s biography ? ) , a Republic concentrates more power in fewer hands .
“ Power bloggers , ” mainstream news outlets , and “ power - Diggers ” get to vote on behalf of their followers .
This may theoretically lead to a circle of self - reference and a “ shallow web . ”
Unchecked and taken to the extreme , much of the diversity and sporadic innovation that marked the web ’s early days could become less common as established interests protect their spheres - of - authority .
Instead of mass movements and a herd - mentality , you ’re liable to end up with conspiracies among the powerful and cartels designed to preserve control and influence .
In fact , the lack of an industry aristocracy may have been a reason why web publishers have been under - represented in American politics .
Other economic sectors form cartel - like associations in order to co-ordinate lobbying efforts and industry standards : as much as it interferes with innovation and competition , it does provide member businesses with political advantages like favorable regulation and even state funded subsidies .
The temptation to consolidate for political advantage must be strong :
With banks and auto - makers gorging themselves at the trough , Silicone Valley has never been hungrier .
The Democracy is done – and we ’ll probably have a few years or decades under the Republic before its unwanted effects become extreme enough to spin another revolution around the wheel of adaptation .
The trend is still pulling toward a more stable web product with a higher minimum - quality threshold , and there ’s probably more push toward that until we simply find ourselves completely bored with its predictability .
Will Google Caffeine be the first step toward reversing the trend ?
Although the current sandbox results suggest many of the penalties and filters have been relaxed , it seems counter - intuitive that they ’d release a more SEO - friendly search just a few months after the July / August 2009 update took an iron fist to all sorts of link schemes and keyword strategies .
Until it goes live , we wo n’t really know if they ’re intentionally left out or not applied until release .
Of course , the internet is n’t a country and Google is n’t the government of it :
The parallels are just strong .
As popular as the Google brand is in search and online services , they ’re not immune to competition like a public bureaucracy is .
If we do n’t like the Republic of Google , we ’re free to surf and draw traffic from any other site out there – and that ’s the option that could restore our Internet Democracy at any moment we wanted to .
In the meantime , I ’ll keep voting for the Republic every time I cash an Adwords check , or send an IM on G - chat , or analyze my traffic in Analytics , or study surfing trends .. or study advertising trends with the Adwords Keyword Tool .. or .. well , I think you get the idea .
Citing a myriad of perceived ‘ threats ’ across the globe , National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair revealed a long - secret piece of information today , that the United States is spending roughly $ 75 billion a year on “ intelligence activities . ”
The number revealed by Blair includes not only the $ 47.5 billion spent by America ’s 16 different spy agencies , but also the money spent by the military on intelligence activity as well .
Blair insisted that “ this whole distinction between military and non-military intelligence is no longer relevant . ”
In his report ( PDF ) , Blair pointed to the “ threat ” posed by Iran ’s civilian nuclear program , the threat posed by North Korea , and the various threats posed by insurgencies across the globe .
He also expressed concern about China ’s quest for natural resources overseas and Russia ’s attempt to exert influence regionally .
Blair also ranked highly the need to add to the intelligence community ’s power online , claiming however that “ for the first time we have a good understanding of the world that we ’re in . ”
Slackware for x86_64 - multilib packages & build instructions =============================================================
Slackware for the x86_64 architecture ( or Slackware 64 for short ) is a pure 64 - bit Operating System , but by design it is " multilib - ready " .
This means , that is it is possible to add a layer of software that will allow you to run 32 bit software without changes to either Slackware64 or these 32 bit packages .
Furthermore , the multilib - enabled Slackware64 can compile 32 bit binaries , if you add the right software to it .
This README contains instructions on how to use the packages in this directory to create a multilib Slackware64 .
A more extensive documentation is available on the Slackware Documentation Wiki , http://docs.slackware.com/slackware:multilib
where you will also find the main mirror locations for downloading these packages .
The exciting thing about Slackware64 , is that you do not have to compile all these basic 32 - bit packages from scratch .
You simply take them from the 32 - bit Slackware package tree !
Further down , I will explain how you can take a 32 - bit Slackware package ( say , the " mesa " package ) and strip / re-package its content into a " mesa- compat32 " package that you can install onto your 64 - bit Slackware computer straight away .
Enabling multilib =================
Fast - track ( examples assume slackware64 - 14.2 ... change to your needs ) .
All of the following commands should be executed as the ' root ' user : * In the location where you found this README , download the subdirectory with the name that corresponds to the Slackware version you are running .
For Slackware64 14.2 for instance , you would run the following command : # lftp - c ' open http://slackware.com/~alien/multilib/ ; mirror - c -e 14.2 ' and then change into the new " 14.2 " directory which has been created on your computer : # cd 14.2 * First , you will upgrade your 64 bit Slackware gcc and glibc packages to their multilib versions by running the command : # upgradepkg -- reinstall -- install - new *.t?z in the directory you just changed to ( the " 14.2 " directory in our case ) .
This will upgrade gcc and glibc packages , and also install a new package called " compat32 - tools " .
*
You are now going to install 32 - bit compatibility packages to support all the 32 - bit programs you may want to run ( roughly 60 MB of packages , not all that much really ! ) .
These packages are located in the subdirectory called " slackware64-compat32 " which you also downloaded with the " lftp " command shown above .
Run this command : # upgradepkg -- install - new slackware64- compat32/*-compat32/*.t?z *
This procedure will also work if you already had a multilib setup and have upgraded your Slackware to a newer release ( new compat32 packages will be installed and existing ones will be upgraded ) .
* Done !
You need to reboot because of the glibc upgrade .
In more detail :
The following packages are replacements for - not additions to - standard Slackware packages .
You use the " upgradepkg " program to upgrade to my multilib versions of gcc and glibc .
You will need these in order to run , and build , 32 - bit software on your 64 - bit Slackware computer : ==Slackware64 13.0== *

There is one more package ( compat32 - tools ) ; you install it using the " installpkg " program : * The compat32 - tools package is a " 32 - bit toolkit " ( containing scripts that facilitate the creation of 32 bit packages ) : - compat32-tools-3.7-noarch-18alien.tgz *
The above packages cover the essentials for getting ready to run and compile 32 - bit software on Slackware64 .
But in order to be able to actually run software , you need a " layer " of additional 32 - bit support libraries as well .
These libraries are taken from standard Slackware 32 - bit packages using the scripts that are part of my " compat32 - tools " package .
*
You use the " massconvert32.sh " script for this conversion ; Suppose you have downloaded a local copy of 32 - bit Slackware , and it is available in the directory : /home/ftp/pub/slackware/slackware-14.2
then you would run the command : # massconvert32.sh - i /home/ftp/pub/slackware/slackware-14.2/slackware " and the result is a number of subdirectories in your current directory , containing " compat32 " packages which you can install directly ( they will not conflict with your 64 - bit packages ) .
*
You can also instruct the " massconvert32.sh " script to download everything you need from an external Slackware mirror , if you do not have ( or do not want to download ) a complete local copy of Slackware : # massconvert32.sh -u http://slackware.mirrors.tds.net/pub/slackware/slackware-14.2/slackware " *
Or if you are lazy you can just download the " slackware64-compat32 " directory in which I provide all these converted packages for you .
It is a subdirectory of the directory that contains the multilib gcc and glibc packages .
Adding 32 - bit programs
======================
The scripts in the " compat32 - tools " package need some explanation .
The package installs a detailed ' README ' in the /usr / doc / compat32 - tools -*/ directory that will help you on your way .
Basically , you get three scripts to run : - /etc/profile.d/32dev.sh
This is the same script that also comes with Slamd64 and which configures an environment that you need for compiling 32 - bit software ( by preferring the 32 - bit compilers and libraries over their 64 - bit versions ) - /usr/sbin/convertpkg-compat32
This script takes a 32 - bit Slackware package and converts it to a ' - compat32 ' package that you can install ( using " installpkg " ) on Slackware64 , alongside a 64 - bit version of the same software .
- /usr/sbin/massconvert32.sh
This script contains an internal list of essential 32 - bit Slackware packages .
It uses the previously mentioned " convertpkg - compat32 " script to grab every package on its internal package list , and converts them into ' - compat32 ' packages .
You will end up with about 60 MB of packages that you must install next , using the command " upgradepkg -- install - new " .
These ' compat32 ' packages create a 32 - bit compatibility layer on top of Slackware64 .
The " massconvert32.sh " script can either download these 32 - bit packages from an external Slackware mirror , or else it can use a local Slackware mirror if you have one in your LAN .
Optionally you can specify an output directory for the newly created packages ; by default they will be created in your current directory .
Running 32 - bit programs
=======================
Running a 32 - bit program is easy after the above system preparation - just download , install and start it .
You may find that you still miss a 32 - bit Slackware library ; in that case , use the " convertpkg - compat32 " script to convert the original 32 - bit Slackware package and install the resulting 32 bit compatibility package on Slackware64 .
Compiling 32 - bit programs
=========================
In case you need to compile a 32 - bit program ( wine and grub are two examples of open source programs that are 32 - bit only ) you first configure your shell environment by running the command : .
/etc/profile.d/32dev.sh
Note the ' dot ' in front of the filename - that is actually part of the commandline !
It will change or create several environment variables so that 32 - bit versions of binaries are preferred .
Once you are done compiling 32 - bit software , you should logout of your root shell in order to get rid of the modified build environment .
In this changed environment , you will be able to use standard SlackBuilds to build 32 - bit packages for Slackware64 .
There 's a couple of things to keep in mind : ( 1 ) You have to define the ARCH variable as ' i486 ' because even on your ' x 86_64 ' computer you are compiling a 32 - bit program !
This is related to the triplet of ' $ ARCH - slackware - linux ' which is normally used in the ' configure ' command .
( a ) As an exception , you will have to compile the ' wine ' package with ' ARCH=x86_64 ' because you will install this package directly on your multilib computer without converting to a ' compat32 ' package .
( 2 ) If you want to install this 32 - bit package on Slackware 64 - multilib , you will have to convert it to a ' compat32 ' package : # convertpkg - compat32 - i / path/to/your/fresh/foo-VERSION-i486-BUILD.tgz # upgradepkg -- install - new /tmp/foo-compat32-VERSION-x86_64-BUILDcompat32.txz
Keeping your multilib up - to - date ================================
If you use slackpkg to keep your Slackware uptodate , then you may benefit from adding slackpkg +
( http://slakfinder.org/slackpkg+.html), an extension to slackpkg which allows you to manage package updates , not just for Slackware , but also for 3rd party repositories which adhere to the Slackware repository format .
The Multilib repository is compatible with slackpkg+ , and its configuration file has instructions on how to enable multilib repository support .
If you do not use slackpkg , then your best option is to keep a local mirror of the multilib repository for your Slackware version , and regularly run : # cd / path/to/multilib/slackware_version_dir/ # upgradepkg -- install - new *.t?z # upgradepkg -- install - new slackware64-compat32/*-compat32/*.t?z
If you do use slackpkg but do not want to add slackpkg + then you need to do the above but also take precautions so that slackpkg does not remove or replace the multilib packages .

A lot of thanks should go to Fred Emmott , who created Slamd64 , the original unofficial 64 - bit fork of Slackware .
Although Slackware64 was not based on Fred 's work , I still learnt most of what I know about setting up the 32 - bit part of a multilib Linux from his writings that are found in Slamd64 .
Cross Linux From Scratch .
The CLFS Wiki ( http://trac.cross-lfs.org/wiki/read#ReadtheCrossLinuxFromScratchBookOnline) is a ' must - read ' if you want to understand how to port Linux to a new architecture .
I took several ideas , concepts and patches from them when creating Slackware 64 from scratch , and again when I created my multilib gcc / glibc packages from scratch ( my README on this multilib - from - scratch is available in the ./ source directory ) .
Have fun !

Howard Kurtz is still playing water carrier for the Bush administration and their WMD lies used to justify invading Iraq and when called out for it by Daniel Ellsberg who says he 'll name names as to who in the Bush administration knew better what does he do ?
Why try to change the subject of course !
Ellsberg is the subject of a new documentary The Most Dangerous Man in America : Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers which debuts this week in New York , Los Angeles and at the Toronto Film Festival .
KURTZ : Do you think that the Obama administration is getting as much pressure from the press as it should , particularly compared to previous administrations , say the Bush administration ?
ELLSBERG : None .
No administration has gotten the pressure that it should from the press on this point .
We got into Iraq with as much deceptions as occurred in Vietnam , a generation earlier .
A performance by the press no better than we saw of pressing behind the lies of the administration than we got during the Johnson administration when I was in ; nor did we get a single person within the administration , the Bush administration now , who saw that the adventure into Iraq was going to hurt our counter - terrorism efforts , hurt our security , and was violating the Constitution in terms of treaties .
Another example would be treaties on torture and our domestic laws on torture .
People who saw that clearly , not one of them leaked to Congress , or to the press .
( CROSS TALK ) KURTZ : Obviously , there were conflicting opinions and conflicting evidence , for example on WMDs .
But let me come back to this .
ELLSBERG : No , pardon me .
KURTZ : Go ahead .
ELLSBERG : When it came to lying -- when it came to lying about the nature of the evidence that the evidence was unequivocal , that was as much of a lie as saying that evidence of the attack on August 4th , on our destroyers , was unequivocal .
Yes , there was -- KURTZ :
You 're comparing the Bush 's building of the case to go to war in Iraq , with Lyndon Johnson 's Tonkin Gulf war incident , just to be clear .
ELLSBERG : I am , indeed .
It 's exactly the same in the performance not only by the president , but by all of the people who knew that it was a disaster .
And I could name names there , if you want .
THE UNITED NATIONS Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has a mandate to encourage “ free , fair , inclusive and transparent elections . ’’
But according to the mission ’s number - two official , former US diplomat Peter Galbraith of Cambridge , the United Nations is prepared to accede to fraudulent vote counts in last month ’s presidential election .
This is deeply wrong .
As President Obama faces a decision on whether to send more troops to Afghanistan , the flagrant cheating in favor of President Hamid Karzai , a US ally , is a grim sign that political reconciliation is a long way off .
Galbraith favored a tough stance against fraud , and rightly so .
In one polling center Karzai got 4,054 of 4,054 votes cast .
In Kandahar province , where 25,000 people voted , more than 250,000 votes were recorded for Karzai .
So Galbraith prodded the Afghan election commission - six of whose seven members are Karzai loyalists - to throw out transparently bogus results from about 1,000 of 6,500 polling stations and to recount ballots from as many as 5,000 others .
Had the commission done so , Karzai likely would face a runoff against his main challenger , former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah .
Galbraith returned home to New England after his boss , UN official Kai Eide of Norway , insisted that the mission allow the Afghan election commission to proceed with a pro forma recount of votes from only 10 to 15 percent of polling stations - not the sweeping exclusion of obviously bogus ballots that Galbraith sought .
The foreseeable outcome of the United Nations ’ capitulation will be a first - round victory for Karzai .
Eide may believe he is helping Afghans avoid political turmoil while also deflecting charges of foreign interference in Afghan affairs .
But a fraudulent re-election of Karzai will only increase popular discontent with his government , exacerbate ethnic enmities , and undermine international support for Afghanistan ’s fight against the Taliban .
President Obama should do what Galbraith wanted the UN mission to do : forcefully condemn Karzai ’s massive fraud and press hard for a clean vote .
Peace and stability will never come from an Afghan government that keeps itself in power through fraud .

The fossilised remains of sharks and other marine animals have also been found in Angola , lodged in the rocks where there used to be sea
By Louise Redvers
BBC News , Luanda
In the past , most people who went to Angola were searching for oil , diamonds or landmines .
Now , the country is also proving a big draw for fossil hunters - known in the scientific community as palaeontologists - who have described Angola as a " museum in the ground " .
Angola was closed off for many years because of its three - decade long civil war , which only ended in 2002 , so few scientists have had the chance to visit .
We believe there are more dinosaurs to be found , we just need the facilities and means to dig for them
Octavio Mateus
New Lisbon University
Those getting the chance now are not leaving disappointed .
Louis Jacobs , of the Southern Methodist University in Dallas , says : " Angola is the final frontier for palaeontology .
Due to the war , there has been little research carried out ... but now we are getting in finally and there is so much to find .
" In some areas there are literally fossils sticking out of the rocks , it is like a museum in the ground . "
Fossil - hunter heaven Louis Jacobs is part of the " PaleoAngola " project whose biggest find to date was in 2005 , when five bones from the front - left leg of a sauropod dinosaur were discovered on a cliff at Iembe , around 65 km ( 40 miles ) north of the capital , Luanda .
Fossils just stick out of the rocks in some parts of Angola Since then , the majority of the skulls and skeletons uncovered by the team have been from turtles , sharks , plesiosaurs and mosasaurs , of which there is even an angolasauras species .
Plesiosaurs and mosasaurs are not technically terrestrial dinosaurs at all but marine reptiles related to lizards and snakes .
Yet according to Octavio Mateus , from the Lisbon 's New University , the bones of the sauropod are just the beginning .
" We believe there are more dinosaurs to be found , we just need the facilities and means to dig for them , " he says .
" Angola is amazing for fossils .
Some of the places here are the best in the world in terms of fossil [ remains ] , we keep finding new animals so it is always exciting to be here . "
As well as unearthing interesting fossils , the study of palaeontology is also about understanding how the Earth was transformed tens of millions of years ago .
For example , when South America split from Africa and the southern Atlantic was formed .
" Fossils can date how animals migrated from one place to another and how continents moved through time , " Mr Mateus says .
" From [ studying ] fossils we can work out when terrestrial animals were no longer able to cross from Africa to South America and when marine animals were present , " he says .
Asteroid impact
The rocks are also a reference point for the time when creatures like dinosaurs were thought to have been made extinct .
Fossilised rock sits below ancient black lava , that once flowed into open waters
The scientific community largely accepts the theory that a massive asteroid hit the Earth 68 million years ago , slamming into the sea somewhere near Mexico .
" You can see where lava has flown into wet sand and then to where it has flown over dry land .
That gives us an indication of when different things were happening millions of years ago , " Mr Mateus explains .
The PaleoAngola project , with funding from the National Geographical Society and the Petroleum Research Foundation of America , is also working in collaboration with universities in Luanda , Lubango and in Maastricht in the Netherlands .
The Angola digs have focussed on Iembe and also at the coast of Bentiaba , in the southern desert province of Namibe , on the border with Namibia .
" As well as doing this research , the idea is to train Angolan scientists so in the long - term they can run the show , " Louis Jacobs , a former head of Kenya 's National Palentology Museum , says .
" Angola should be able to use its own unique resources in museums to teach future generations about their country and the world .
" And who knows , in the much longer term , it could prove to be a tourist attraction . "

Microsoft plans to issue two emergency patches next week that fix vulnerabilities in the Internet Explorer browser and Visual Studio developer suite that allow attackers to remotely execute malware .
The patches , which will be delivered on Tuesday , will be only the third time Microsoft has issued an out - of - band security patch in the past 25 months .
That suggests the updates are serious enough to warrant the extra fuss .
Typically , the company issues patches on the second Tuesday of each month to allow administrators time to plan for and test the updates .
In an advanced notice published late Friday , the company gave few details about the vulnerability .
The patch for IE is rated " critical , " the highest severity designation on Microsoft 's four - notch scale .
The update for Visual Studio is rated one notch lower , at " important . "
Both fixes will require machines to be rebooted .
" While this release is to address a single , overall issue , in order to provide the broadest protections possible to customers , we ’ll be releasing two separate security bulletins , " a Microsoft spokesman said in a statement .
It went on to say : " While we ca n’t go into specifics about the issue prior to release , we can say that the Visual Studio bulletin will address an issue that can affect certain types of applications .
The Internet Explorer bulletin will provide defense - in - depth changes to Internet Explorer to help provide additional protections for the issues addressed by the Visual Studio bulletin .
The Internet Explorer update will also address vulnerabilities rated as Critical that are unrelated to the Visual Studio bulletin that were privately and responsibly reported . "
Earlier this week , Brian Krebs 's Security Fix blog reported Microsoft intended to issue an out - of - band patch that was related to a vulnerability designated MS09 - 032 , which Microsoft fixed 10 days ago .
The report said an additional patch may be needed because the first one repaired only a subset of the vulnerable code .
Attacks targeting MS09 -032 have been underway since early this month .
People who have installed the patch for that vulnerability remain protected from those attacks , Microsoft 's statement said .
The underlying bug was discovered by researchers Ryan Smith and Alex Wheeler and reported to Microsoft in April or May of 2008 .
< strke >
On the same day
The day after Microsoft plans to issue the emergency fix , Smith and two other researchers plan to deliver this talk at the Black Hat security conference detailing " a nuanced and precarious trust layer between " components in technologies including javascript , . NET , and browser plugins . "
A preview of the talk is available here . ®

DOSE :
70 mg oral DMT ( powder / crystals )
BODY WEIGHT : 220 lb
This record is an account of my first true breakthrough experience with Dimethyltryptamine extracted from Mimosa Hostilis root bark aka Jerema . 
My first DMT extraction involved shredding 1 kilogram of the root bark in a coffee grinder which yielded an off pink - purple mulch with fine powder collecting on the bottom .
This material was basified to 12 PH using Sodium Hydroxide from Roebics Crystal Drain cleaner .
Red Devil lye had been taken off the market and this was the only available substitute I could find ( Roebic appears to now be off the market as well ) .
The bark material was allowed to sit in the solution for 10 hours .
Afterward 5 extractions of non-polar Mineral Spirits were taken from the bark / sodium hydroxide solution .
A ratio of 1:10 of Mineral Spirits were added to the bark solution then shaken viperously for 5 minutes .
The two layers of non-polar and polar solvent solutions were left to sit for 30 minutes to separate .
After the solution was separated using a Turkey baser it was added to a large glass bowl .
All 5 extractions were completed in this same procedure .
Each extraction was added together leaving me with roughly 700 - 800 ml of dark yellow liquid .
This liquid was then added to a 1 gallon bag and 3 - 4 times the amount in water was poured into it .
The layer of non-polar solvent was then separated from the polar water solvent .
A scissor was used to cut a bottom corner of the bag to allow the water layer to drain out .
Just as the water finished draining the bag was immediately placed over another glass bowl so the non-polar solvent could flow into it .
This procedure was repeated 4 times to make sure all sodium hydroxide ( water soluble ) was removed from the non-polar solvent .
The yellow liquid material was then poured into a large glass baking pan and allowed to evaporate .
After a week or so the solvent had completely evaporated leaving an orange lucent wax substance which upon scraping up yielded a light sienna type tar .
Initial trials of smoking this substance resulted in a very painful and unsettling smoke using a glass pipe .
50 mg of so created definite altered consciousness , perception , and visual distortion .
However , my lung capacity prevented me from smoking any more of this orange brown material .
I still had 4 kilograms of Mimosa Hostilis bark sitting in the freezer .
After my disappointing extraction results I dismissed it as a source for crude DMT .
I figured the tar may be a great substitute for drinking the foul Ayahuasca tea , but was not an acceptable source of smokeable DMT .
The irony being after about 1 year I was cleaning out my freezer and stumbled upon one 2 kilo bag of Mimosa Hostilis bark and a second bag of finely ground 2 kg bark .
I had thought about selling it or making several Ayahuasca teas which Ive never tried due to certain medications I m taking .
Either way I figured Id condense the solution down to something more storage friendly or at least make a few bucks off of it .
I then decided selling year old mimosa bark isnt fair to the buyer and decided Id do the same extraction process I had tried 1 year prior .
I had gone through the same exact series of extractions using the polar and non-polar separations which I had utilized 1 year earlier .
However , I chose to evaporate the substance in a different setting .
Instead of evaporating outside , I stuck the dishes in a slow ventilation area in the garage .
I used two baking glass dishes because I had twice the mineral spirit material to work with .
I basically left the dishes in those cupboards for about two months .
I should note that during those two months it was the coldest time of year between december and february .
Temperatures in the garage regularly experienced highs of 50 degrees and lows of 30 degrees .
I had actually forgotten about the trays for a month when I went onto an entheogen forum and began looking into tryptamines .
This jolted my memory and I remembered about the trays I had forgotten .
That night I went into the garage and pulled both trays out of the cupboard .
To my surprise I noticed white bumps scattered throughout them .
They were such a pure white I almost mistaken them for some sort of freak fungal infection .
Upon further inspection I noticed these bumps looked like finely defined crystalline structures .
There was still liquid within the dishes so I poured it into a glass bowl and stuck the remaining solution into the freezer for 48 hours .
The white crystals were stuck to the dishes , there were dozens of them on average the size of a penny to a quarter .
These crystal structures were all circular and seemed to form in separate clumps .
I scraped these up and placed them on a glass plate to dry .
In the meantime after 48 hours I checked on the glass bowl in the freezer .
Upon pulling out the bowl I noticed an immediate fuzzy film all over the sides of the bowl where the non-polar solution was present .
It looked exactly like yellow pollen with thousands of tiny yellow balls clinging to the sides of the glass dish .
The remaining liquid was poured out and this material was collected using a razor blade .
This soupy bright yellow material was then placed on a glass dish and allowed to dry .
The remaining liquid was placed back into the glass dishes and allowed to evaporate outside under much faster circumstances .
What I ended up with were three separate grades of DMT .
The white crystalline bumps  as I call them seemed to be very pure DMT .
I didnt need a microscope to see the complex arrangements within the material I collected .
It turned out to be several grams which filled ¾ of a baggy which most buttons used for clothing accessories are sold within .
My theory is the slow evaporation coupled with the numerous freezing nights seemed to concentrate the chemical slowly over time .
It gradually precipitated out of the solution and yielded the most pure product .
The second extract was the yellow powder which was precipitated out of the freezer technique .
It was much more consistent in its distribution over the glass bowl .
Instead of seeing bumps of DMT I saw a thin 1/8th inch layer of yellow pollen type substance coat the entire bowl .
This material I should mention was partially extracted with Xylene .
This is supposed to extract Yuremamine or  jungle DMT .
This material was separated in the initial extraction phase to see if this chemical would truly be extracted .
I also used Mineral Spirits with a couple of the ' pulls . '
I saw no reddish or other bizarre colorations with the extract which Ive read have been reported .
I do believe there is some other alkaloid , possibly with MAOI characteristics which makes the Xylene extract more intense .
This yellow substance proved to be a more powerful experience then the pure crystalline bumps 
I had discovered from the initial solution .
The evaporated waxy brown - orange material from the third final extract seems to be residual alkaloids which contain some leftover DMT .
Ive found it way to hard to smoke and have therefore saved it in the freezer as a possible future Ayahuasca analogue .
The first dose of DMT I administered was the initial crystalline white substance which I gave to a co-worker .
Upon initial feedback he had stated it was very clean and visual  but would not comment further .
This irritated me because I had basically used him as a guinea pig and these were the only words he could provide on the experience .
Ive noticed after repeatedly smoking DMT that memory is quite fleeting and absent .
It seems as though the brain cannot or does not want to process high doses of this compound .
The mind seems to shut down in an attempt to possibly retain any tangible essence of accessable reality .
I think the experience itself might be so profound the brain shuts itself off in order to cope with the effects which are too intense for the normal state of consciousness to bear .
It could well be a psychological barrier which the mind upholds in order to tolerate a rapidly disintegrating state of both the ego and the body .
I vaguely remember my first experience with the first crystalline white DMT I had smoked .
I remember up - taking the compound in around 3 large tokes out of a glass pipe .
I would estimate I smoked around 60 milligrams or so of the substance .
I held the lighter about 1 inch from the pipe and let it sit for 10 seconds or so .
I then inhaled the vapor and repeated this practice three times without ever exhaling .
I had held the vapor for around 40 seconds over the course of the three hits .
I could feel the effects after roughly 20 seconds .
By the exhalation of the third hit I was experiencing an incredible glowing vibration which overwhelmed my entire body .
It had no reference point and I felt as though my entire body was an integrated force .
The force was emanating from the center of my brain .
I could simultaneously experience every cell within my body which seemed to originate within the top of my mind .
Typing this now completely sober I can feel the pulse of the experience emanating from my brain .
Residual memory is my best guess .
The imprint of the experience seems to alter the ability to remember it .
The only way I can remember the experience is to recount some of its most mild and subdued effects .
I think of past life regression of the consciousness .
In order to articulate such a bizarre experience into words my brain must restore itself to that point of origin .
Even then words are completely inadequate .
This is what I feel distinguishes DMT from other psychedelics of which I have consumed hundreds if not thousands of times .
When I recall a memory of an acid trip , psilocybin trip , or mescaline trip , they all feel subjective and alienated from my mind .
They are nothing more then remnant thoughts , proud , but distant from my current conscious state of mind .
They are like the alleyway of a distant exuberant and fascinating exploration into an inner-city complex to which I dont occupy .
My mind recounts the memory and experience but keeps it disconnected because it is not integrated into my everyday existence .
These psychedelics are but a lone and narrow road which my psyche may pursue every once and awhile on whim .
DMT is a far different beast .
It is right there in my thoughts , my dreams , my reality .
I feel it every second I m alive as I m typing this , coursing through my veins .
It is of me and part of me .
I sense it has and always will be within me till the day I die and beyond .
I only get this experience with other tryptamines or phenethylamines when I consume them .
They feel like a temporary portal into the astral realms of my subconscious .
Whenever I think about DMT or even envision its effects on my mind I enter a sort of binding resonance with reality .
Typing this and thinking of this substance I feel as though it is effecting me now and always has been .
It is part of the complex chemical soup of my own pineal gland .
When I listen to my body it tells me what the mind is too hypersensitive to understand emotionally , unless it cuts itself off from primal sensation .
The pineal gland is the manufacturing center for DMT .
It occupies the most valuable real - estate inside the brain around its center .
My question , why did we evolve to protect this gland and hold it in the most sacred place within the brain ?
It occupies the most substantial Chakra point or  Crown Chakra . 
It is right above the cerebral pineal fluid sack which surrounds the human brain .
This suggests it is in direct proximity to upload information of possible visual and psychic nature into this organ .
The ancient Sumerians were aware of this gland , along with the french philosopher descrates , and the Egyptians .
Many of the ancient 's inscriptions and cuneiforms show what looks like a pinecone adorning scepters and other religious and sacred objects .
They understood the ' pinecone ' pineal gland was the vessel into incredible spiritual revelations and knowledge .
Reality is nothing more then concentrated energy condensed down to a specific 3rd dimensional vibration at an extremely slow rate .
When I focus hard enough I feel this vibration , it is most prominent when under altered states of consciousness .
Under this mild focused awareness I feel what my body truly is and always was .
Surprisingly , it feels like a weak DMT trip within a competent and coherent state of mind .
A constant vibrational glow within my physical body at probably slightly above my heart rate .
This beat probably corresponds with the Shumman frequency .
My body beats at the same resonance as the Earths .
I feel this when I m having deep thoughts about my experiences with DMT under extreme meditation .
When I imagine its presence over my psyche then I begin to feel the greater sense that I am just a beat or pulse within a greater planetary organism .
The feeling is so completely organic and fluid , I almost have panic attacks at times .
As though my heart is beating rhythmically with a force out of my control .
This pales in comparison to the yellow powdered freezer precipitated DMT I smoked .
That experience was much more profound and terrifying .
The irony being the terror tantalized me , making me titillated and disturbed .
The substantial thing is , I remember every single aspect in specific detail .
It is more vivid then my most vivid memories of my entire 27 years of life on this planet .
My first sexual encounter , my childhood trauma of being lost in Disneyland Anaheim , CA for 12 hours ( terrorized by costumed Mickey Mouse and Goofy ) , and even my first experience waking up from a 2 day coma of GHB overdose which I recovered from after my vitals flat lined .
The experience I had is the most vivid memory I have ever had in my entire life .
It is more real then this reality .
So pristine in all aspects , I know it was real .
Not of this dimension , within that plane , but of another higher 4th dimensional place .
This place was so vivid I know without a doubt it could not have been a hallucination or vision unless the very nature of the reality I have spent my entire life is a perpetual hallucination or vision .
This current and physical reality feels more synthetic then the chemically intertwined oneness DMT took me into within 5 minutes .
In that span of time I entered a plane of space which was so foreign and alien to my existence , it destroyed my faith in the very material existence of this reality .
It also had detrimental consequences on my belief in death and birth , which at that time simultaneously occurred in the same space .
This showed me there is no birth and no death .
It is the illusion of this subjective perception of the whole consciousness creating a new memory for itself .
Think about any memory youve ever had , it starts and it ends very abruptly after only a mater of seconds .
This is the microcosm of a fleeting experience juxtaposed onto the greater movie which is the story of your life .
All we see is the movie in action , we 're never aware of what happens before or afterward in this realm .
We dont anticipate the planning , the script being written , the actors being cast .
We dont foreshadow the credits role because we simply turn off the TV prior .
We dont ask why the set is disassembled , the costumes auctioned off , the copyrights challenged in court .
We only see the parts that we want to see !
These parts are recorded in a montage fashion over the span and course of our waking reality .
That description is the difference between this reality and the reality of DMT .
It shows me the past , present , and future simultaneously in one conscious state .
This is about the simplest way I can articulate what I think this compound does and is capable of on the mind .
Transporting consciousness to a state of omnipresence  which our primal brain is simply too preoccupied with the present to assimilate .
I dont want to provide the impression that I m enlightened or endowed with esoteric knowledge the general populace is lacking , because I m not .
Im a polysubstance abuser , an alcoholic , suffer from ADHD , and chronic depression .
I am far from enlightened .
And that is the magic of DMT .
I dont have to be endowed with talents beyond the normal scope of humanity .
I dont need to have mastered Ayuradic or Vedic forms of meditation .
I care little for puloty or Yoga .
I tried them but I simply found I love to endure pain .
I have always been attracted to bodybuilding .
A great Euphemism for life .
I destroy my body only to build it up stronger then it was before .
I love pain because I feel that through this venue only there can I grow .
The Roman Empires Debouched hedonism has shown the excesses of pleasure leads to spiritual downfall .
DMT is a painful experience in very high doses .
It , or any other psychedelics , are not meant for most of the population as Huxley warned .
Leary made the mistake of hoping the greater populace would see some relevance to these substances without understanding humanity has an innate and outright detesting of the unknown .
DMT is the ultimate unknown and perhaps understandably the most cautious psychedelic which one should approach .
In many respects I am glad this substance is scheduled because I do not feel most of humanity is ready to allow their brain to accept an experience so outside of their immediate surroundings .
The majority of humanity is simply not ready for this experience .
This is why I feel it must be left in the hands of the brave and adventurous beings who are willing to risk their own sanity in order to explore the ultimate unknown , the human brain .
I prefer Huxleys mentality in that Psychedelics should be reserved for a select few , but who decides that curriculum , standard , and access ?
I believe these few discover this on their own because something has always driven them to this information .
They have always known these entheogens were meant to lead them to something beyond themselves .
This is precisely why I am here typing this information for you to read .
The curiosity which has brought you to this information is a testiment to your willingness to attempt to understand these alternate realities .
The other route is Leary whos blatant publication of this alternative ' psychatropic medication ' helped inhibit psychiatric research of entheogens back by decades .
Advocating mass use of such powerful tools is incredibly foolish and I find premature coming from an M.D. who was caught up in the wave of popularity he had received from his association with these compounds .
His Ego destroyed psychedelics in mainstream research , this is why they are chemically designed to destroy the Ego .
To prevent mass human awareness of their eye opening properties .
From personal observation , most of us are not physiologically hardwired or capable to cope with the changes these substances induce .
I theorize these plant alkaloid compositions are a deterrent to animals developing higher organized states .
In these states these animals possessed greater potential to destroy the plant in question .
Keep the animal disoriented and confused and it will not desire to pass this information to its siblings .
Alkaloids are a defense mechanism simultaneously terrifying and expanding reality .
To most animals , this would be perceived as a toxin within the brain , with no benefit to their immediate survival .
Hence the plant is saved from being eaten and preserves itself in order to reproduce .
Why then do humans consciously consume the toxic plants other animals disregard ?
The more one advocates and ordains these chemical godheads the more it fuels the ego .
This is most prevelant in western society , where such chemicals give the distributor a sense of superiority by having access to a divine substance which only a few are granted .
This is the trick organized religion has used for thousands of years .
It 's controllers profess to contain a knowledge and wisdom from an external source ( usually god ) which gives these priests , bishops , and shamans spiritual control over the population .
Yes , primitive Shamans are just a prototype of Bishops , Priests , and disciples which Western society adopted without the heavy cultural indoctrination of psychedelic compounds .
Shamans along with priests and religious leaders fall into the trap of ego .
This is why I feel these plants place a premium on debilitating that aspect of the human mind .
The ego is what influences these teachers to withhold the knowledge and horde it for themselves .
They pass it down selectively to only a few who they feel worthy enough to possess it .
This is the ego in motion .
These elitists are revered and worshiped for this wisdom and held in elevated status .
They use these substances to wow their populations .
If one wishes to understand this very simply then ask the question  Who Benefits ?
When one asks this question he / she will see very clearly who has profited from the circumstances I have described .
Priests are the updated - Shamans of the modern world .
They are there to impress their followers with the possibility of access to greater truth and knowledge .
In return they receive money , adoration , and power .
As long as they tightly hold onto this knowledge they have no fear in it reaching the masses .
This is the detriment the ego has caused on our culture and its access to higher spiritual truths .
These spiritual keepers  hold the highest status and prestige of the group they occupy , containing knowledge and insight denied to the general populace .
This is say akin to the highest degrees of the freemasons who have restrained the knowledge of ancient levitation , occult ritual magic , and esoteric wisdom .
This wisdom held desperately because the few in power use the many followers ignorance to glorify and exonerate their status at the expense of their ' Sheeps  lack of hindsight .
The wolf is always herding his flock inevitablly into slaughter .
What I find interesting about DMT is its ability to completely shatter my sense of ego and any feelings of superiority be it intellectual or physical I may think I possess .
No other entheogen has done this and told me in ways I dont understand that I am not what I think I am or ever was .
Other chemicals may take me into another dimension of reality but never take me to another reality .
This is exactly what is happening to my psyche while on DMT vs. other entheogens .
They take my ego to another plane where to the outsider it seems limited but is merely bypassed .
DMT takes my ego to another place so foreign and alien in nature it ceases to exist in this dimension altogether .
Such a shattering event occurs over the course of less then five minutes before I m back within the place from which I left .
For reference purposes
Ill describe the only other substances which has created ego death to such a drastic degree as DMT .
It is Salvia Divinorum or  Diviners Sage . 
Personally I disregard Salvia and have never found any spiritual or transcendent tangible benefit from the several times Ive smoked it .
It feels alien , similar to DMT , but not integrated into my being .
It has the same sterility and muteness feeling I get from DMT .
But it lacks a sense of the only word I can describe as soul .
Whereas DMT feels cosmic and infinite , Salvia feels personal , internal , and entrapping to my consciousnesses point of reference .
The intensity and duration of DMT and Salvia are both startlingly similar .
Both begin within 20 - 30 seconds and effects end completely within 15 minutes .
Both are profound and easily the two most intense experiences Ive ever had in my life .
They seem to replicate the same alien plane of existence , however , the effects are drastically different from one another .
At 1 minute into both experiences I loose complete control over my body , time has no meaning or ever did .
I could be dead or living and it wouldnt mater because those states of being hold no real effect over the conscious state which my mind is occupying .
I believe it is this point my consciousness has left 3rd dimensional dense space and accessed a lighter 4th dimensional realm .
Here anything goes , and nothing in the context of this 3rd dimensional space holds any relevance .
It s gone , there is no physical body as there is no need for one .
Consciousness doesnt seem to need a body .
In this state the body was merely a vessel to experience the consciousness which was always pervasive in all things .
This is right where the similarities completely end .
DMT connects me with an all encompassing force which is present in all mater within the universe .
I am one with the infinite , the cosmic consciousness of a dozen different dimensions which all exist simultaneously .
The salvia experience is most similar to a blackout of my consciousness .
I go deep within my most primordial state .
My mind is not able to articulate any point of reference to this reality yet all of my motor skills are fully intact .
I know this happens to most people that smoke Salvia because Ive watched hundreds of videos of kids trying it on youtube .
About 30 seconds in I can see the point where these people stop laughing and hit that alternate reality .
In this state they cannot express it , but they are usually terrified , confused , and gripped with emotion which the body cannot and doesnt externally demonstrate to the observer .
I believe much of this has to due with setting , as Salvia is often a first and only time occurrence due to the experience it generates .
What I find unsettling about Salvia is it seems to take any remnant of whatever consciousness I can make reference of and unzip it .
My mind is torn in two separate places as the drug takes it in one direction but my mind wants to go in the other .
It s an utter contradiction of planes of my psyche .
I call it the zipper effect .
I am unzipped and splitting apart , being pulled instantly in two separate directions without any control .
I wouldnt mind this state of being if I felt as though I somehow benefited from it or utilized it .
Maybe it is just me , but I can never seem to feel as though this introspective substance is connecting me to anything meaningful or psychologically usable .
I believe Salvia and DMT are accessing the same dimensional space .
The salvia taking me to an infinite introspective collapse of the ego and reality where I am self contained .
The DMT taking me to infinite cosmic possibility where I am integrated into all matter and am all mater within the universe simultaneously .
The micro and the Macro expressing themselves in different conscious states , yet always of the same source .
I think my primitive mammalian brain is more attracted to the DMT because of its constant role in human metabolism and biological function .
The brain craves this substance which interestingly is one of the only to be up - taken so readily by the cerebral pineal fluid of the blood brain barrier .
Much more easily then complex Carbohydrates or proteins which must be broken down into Glucose for the brain to utilize their properties .
Salvia is not an alkaloid and is not as easily recognizable by the human body .
This is why I believe I have a dislike of the substance .
My brain seems to utilize DMT because it knows through millions of years of evolution how to best incorporate it into my mind and body .
The salvia is foreign and new , a novelty .
Perhaps through the same evolutionary process it too will generate the missing link to the subconscious .
I theorize the human brain is nt yet fully integrated within the individuality of conscious thought it occupies to understand the extreme interpersonal plane Salvia invokes .
We are social animals , bound and interconnected with other members of our species .
We have never been alone , isolated , and ostracized to the point where one can evolve long enough to deprive itself of the collective heard .
It is impossible to understand conscious singularity , because as social primates , we will always depend on other animals of the same species in order to survive .
This is why I feel salvia is inaccessible in the current human state .
Were not quite ready to leave any and all reference or attachment to the collective consciousness which binds all of us together .
We are essentially a Borg mind , 100th Monkey effect in full force and always have been to further the evolution of our species .
Our planet is within its current state of disarray , chaos , and schizogenesis due to the collective state humanity has created .
The DMT is the embodiment of collective consciousness .
It destroys my ego so that I can see the destruction my ego has caused upon myself and others .
It is built in hardware within the human pineal gland , tissue , and blood .
Designed for what I feel is to destroy ego and connect us in a state of being where we are not influenced by crude emotional states , cultural biases , and petty selfish gains .
This is why I believe the drug is so sterile and neutral in nature .
It doesnt sugar coat things with an amphetamine high like the phethylamine mescaline .
Nor does it dilute and denigrate the nervous system as does the debilitating effects of alcohol .
In the end this stuff is a conduit into  God consciousness . 
The irony being that state has always been here , always was here , always will be here .
We are simply too preoccupied with our miniscule and trivial pursuits to acknowledge it .
We are the ones we were waiting for !!!
Im using Salvia as a reference material because it is far more prevalent and accessible in its current legal state then DMT .
More readers then not have probably encountered Salvia but not DMT , therefore , I felt a description of its similarity to DMT may familiarize one with what they may possibly expect from DMT in terms of magnitude , duration , and intensity .
At this point I should discuss the breakthrough experience I had .
I have no recollection of the day or time of this event .
Those facts feel irrelevant to what I encountered during that brief 10 minute period .
I wish I could accurately provide a date and time in order to sequentially document this event more accurately .
For myself , the experience is so profound and overwhelming that it is impossible for me to collect my thoughts into a cohesive state shortly after the event had subsided .
I need months to process the experience and gather innate data which the DMT is feeding my body .
I can feel minimal amounts of DMT activating throughout my body at this moment .
The memory of the intense experience lingers .
It never leaves the back of my mind .
It doesnt feel proper to attempt to define the most profound experience of my life within hours of when it happened .
From a scientific standpoint this is the most relevant approach to documenting the effects of DMT .
From a physiological and psychological standpoint its very premature and the experience is shortchanged by the immediate effects vs. the longer standing repercussions .
I feel as though I am denying myself and others the full magnitude of the DMT experience by pigeon holing it down to a time and place .
This feels irrelevant in the greater scheme of the chemical and its role within the human body .
It is always with me and always will be with me .
What I chronicle is merely a peak release of this compound which I have coordinated in order for it to direct me to a state of consciousness I need at that time and space .
I dont smoke DMT on a whim , it tells my body and my brain when I need to smoke it .
I dont feel as though I control when , how , or why I need to smoke an incredibly powerful , disturbing , and outright shattering experience .
In fact most of my very neutral DMT experiences are bordering on unpleasant .
The realm I am taken to is so outside of the jurisdiction and imagination of my conscious brain it is down right terrifying yet complete nirvana at the same simultaneous moment .
Such a foreign place is not dared treaded upon without a degree of psychological preparation .
This is why Salvia is usually a one hit wonder for most people .
They cannot fathom the place , assimilate it , and interpret it with their current conscious state without deep preparation and forewarning .
Going from here  to there  in 20 seconds is too much for most people and they will instinctively resist rather then embrace and let themselves go into this experience .
So onto the trip or whatever one wants to call it .
It was no trip , I hate that term yet it is so accessible and immediately identifiable I need to use it to create a reference point .
It was a journey .
A trip is short and ends abruptly in the schism of the relevance of time .
A trip could be 1 hour or 20 hours .
Every other psychedelic experience Ive used is a trip ,  because of these traits .
DMT is not a trip but a journey .
It lasts less then any other entheogen Ive ever encountered but takes me to a place through a cosmic forest of thoughts and ideas over the longest duration I can fathom .
I go to a timeless place without any reference to any time or physical sensation .
I dont exist , I am merely consciousness expressing itself in the most primal state identifiable by the brains ability to detect it .
What I recall is the recollection of a meaningless night , time and place .
It is to the best of my memory and ability the account of the DMT experience I had that night .
The settings were familiar and felt completely reassuring within my surroundings .
There was no sense of fear or hesitation within this chemical being  for which I was about to envelope .
I loaded around 60 - 80 milligrams of the yellowish DMT extract which was partially obtained using Xylene .
Ive heard this substance extracts a form of DMT which is very negative in nature .
I dont feel that sense .
It has more to do with the situation , setting , and expectations then the actual chemical makeup which is simply a byproduct of the experience itself as a precursor which is only realized after the entire experience has occurred .
After the substance was loaded into the glass pipe , I took a blow torch and held it roughly two inches away from the glass pipe .
I lit the flame then slowly let the spiraling smoke swirl around within the glass pipe .
I used my index finger to close off the top chamber hole to allow the smoke to concentrate .
After around 30 seconds I began to slowly inhale the substance into my lungs .
During this entire time the lighter was continually burning and the substance was continually vaporizing into smoke .
Within one long 30 second hit I managed to consume the entire amount of DMT .
It was held in my lungs for another 30 seconds or so before I exhaled .
Before I let the chemical out of my lungs I began to feel the effects .
An immediate sense of disorientation clouded my conscious state .
I was instantly inundated with thoughts of panic and anxiety .
This feeling seemed to be a natural response to the profound changes which were rapidly organizing within my peripheral view .
Before I could think another thought my brain was blasted with intense clarity .
Rich reds and warm spectrum colors exploded into my view .
I saw all matter as nothing more then an atomic reddish field of wild vibration which was pulsing within everything that my eyes could absorb .
Reality was a vibrating pulsation of bead type atoms  almost like the static on a channel - less television screen .
I saw everything for what it truly was .
Everything in mater became nothing more then a pulsing vibrating collection of trillions of circles making up this reality .
Reality became an illusion as though my body felt distanced from any reference to it .
Reality was just a pulse within the cosmic vibration of the infinite cosmic consciousness .
I was that cosmic consciousness and it began to dissolve my physical body and ego simultaneously .
I felt the disillusion from my body was necessary to provide my consciousness with the capacity to enter hyper dimensional space .
I was beginning to loose the ability to control my arms and legs .
They felt like silly putty as they squirmed around like an octopus recoiling while trying to reassure itself that it still possessed the instinctual ability to move .
An immediate detachment of my body was stirring within my mind .
It wanted to keep itself aligned with anything with which it could recognize , but it could not .
I wanted to stay in the locality within my physical body .
When I say  I  what I mean is the consciousness that expresses itself within my body .
Leaving this hive consciousness which my brain had been so accustomed to , was frightening .
At this point  I was catapulted out of this reality and dimensional plane .
There was a simultaneous blackout which probably lasted more then a split second in real time .
It felt as though it had occurred over several minutes .
The events above happened over what I would guess were 30 seconds to 1 minute .
Immediately  I was now in a new hive mind which felt more real then anything Ive ever felt in this reality .
My vocabulary and articulation are obviously severely lacking to accurately describe the next transpiring of events .
I cannot verbalize it using any vocabulary known .
No word can provide or define what I went through .
I will say it was the most REAL  experience Ive ever had in my entire 27 years of conscious thought .
The reason being , none of it was verbal .
Everything was visual , all communication visual , all thought visual .
Everything was visual as it felt to be the most efficient and least misinterpreted means of experience and communication in this place .
I now know why millions of people have extraterrestrial abductions .
I know for a fact many of these people are having these abductions .
The thing is their body never leaves this reality in order to have those experiences .
Their consciousness is being absorbed by extradimensional beings .
Im not talking Terence Mckenna style jeweled elves bumping around squeamishly .
The beings that I contacted were far more Earnest , sterile , and objective .
To such a degree , they are the embodiment of science in its physical manifestation of laws , discourse , control , and theoretical ideology .
I was a lab rat on a silver luminous table observed by these completely neutral beings .
Basically I had been transported from my physical 3rd dimensional body and simultaneously placed into a bizarre 4th dimensional headspace .
I had no body in this realm .
I was an etheric being lying down on a table .
My body was translucent as if a form of penetrating light through the skin displaying every skeletal structure , blood vessel and cell within my body .
This was all light , illuminating itself and manifesting into what my detached brain must have generated as a holographic human body .
My brain was still there , it was simply connected to another place through the DMT molecule .
This connection of an unidentifiable , alien state , is the source for such confusion which my brain could not clarify into anything remotely recognizable .
I specifically remember these 3 beings as though I was looking at them before this computer screen .
It is as if they are a part of me , a part I dont understand or can connect with because they occupy a place I cannot normally feel , see , or detect .
I felt so trapped at this point .
 How on earth are these beings here around me and everyone else and nobody has any sense of their presence ?
What I m guessing is these beings are operating on a different frequency then our own .
Weve got hundreds of radio stations penetrating the sky , but only hear one station at a time .
DMT is like an antenna which attracts other dimensions and draws them to this one .
Thus allowing the individual to access and tune in to these frequencies which were otherwise scrambled and not able to be processed by the brain .
These beings spoke to me telepathically .
When I state telepathic I mean whatever they wanted me to know they gave it to me .
It wasnt like a beam or thought within the mind .
I simply knew what they wanted me to know without seeing or thinking anything .
It was an emotional state in which I could feel what they wanted to tell me .
Through their instant transmission , I knew exactly what they wanted and required of me .
It was so much more efficient and straightforward then verbal communication .
Feeling evoked immediate internal communication and knowledge .
I simultaneously knew what , who , and why they and I were there .
They directed thoughts through feelings  into my mind which I immediately recognized .
This didnt require any philosophical or intellectual decoding or interpretation .
I simply knew exactly what they were thinking because they could somehow transfer their intentions through imagery which I couldnt see but directly felt .
I remember exactly to the very finest detail what these beings looked like in physicality .
The environment itself felt like something straight out of Ridley Scotts alien . 
There was a bizarre static type environment with predominate browns , blacks , and grays .
It felt very organic with interconnecting insectoid coils and wormlike tubing networks lining the walls and background .
It seemed to be a ship or interstellar vessel .
I was in a circular room which was occupied by three beings which were standing in front of me .
They were overlooking my etheric body which was laid upright onto a silver elongated slab .
These entities were very skinny .
Their body I recall vaguely because I was too preoccupied with their face .
It was blackish is if they were all wearing a black jumpsuit or covering .
The face was the most disturbing aspect .
All three had grey metallic faces .
These were nothing like the Zeta - Reticluan Alien grays with large black almond eyes many people describe .
Although I could see how the two entities could be mistaken by a person in such a frightened state .
Their face was smooth , grey , and metallic .
They had no eyes , ears , or mouth .
The face was one complete solid vessel .
I felt as though it was a mask of some type .
It was as if they were using a certain costume and mask in which I could identify , while denying their true nature from my vision .
Their metallic mask had subtle features imprinted within it .
There were what appeared residual elements of a stubby nose , the inlay of what was once eyes , and small slits which resembled babies lips .
I felt as though these beings had evolved so drastically they no longer had need for the five senses .
They no longer needed eyes , ears , lips , etc to express themselves .
They were expression personified in my own thought of what I visualized they were physically .
Everything they did or said was by vibration and emotion in the only way I could seem to understand it .
They were the grays as many people have described .
But they were not aliens , and they were not insectoid .
These elements were simply infused into the environment which gave the impression that these beings possessed those traits .
These beings were me in a different space and a different dimension .
The alien nature of the circumstances initially prevented me from realizing this .
I felt as though I was from one radio station and they from another .
The DMT , therefore , must be the antenna connecting different aspects of the same consciousness .
These stations can communicate by crossing paths and sharing data from different dimensional frequencies .
This may sound delusional , but this reality we live within is the true delusion .
The matrix is real , but our bodies are being used as a vessel to experience 3rd dimensional space .
This 3rd dimensional information is then uploaded  by other dimensional beings who cannot experience this one .
I only know this because the DMT told me and quite blatantly showed me how this process works .
Before my trips with DMT , I would have thought this information was coming from a psychotic schizophrenic .
I now know better .
I remember what they had constantly expressed almost a dozen times over the course of the consolidation process .
I say consolidation because these beings WERE ME  in another dimension .
They cared not for how I got there or why I was there .
They simply knew I was coming and anticipated my arrival .
It is as if they were a more advanced part of myself which I was completely ignorant of knowing .
I was them and they were me .
I was like the reptilian brain that they were studying from the distant recesses of there own .
They were like the more evolved Neo-Cortex attempting to understand the lizard brain .
I believe this alternative realm feels very reptilian and insectoid in nature .
It feels this way because we are accessing a dimension which displays the information these beings wish to take from us .
They appear this way , look this way , and behave in this way .
They need to acquire this reptilian form , in order to access the information they take from our psyche .
They are visible as a mirror reflection of what they are seeking .
Just as I am accessing a mirror reflection of the higher dimensional state which I am seeking .
This knowledge Transphere feels like the way in which they can de - evolve to become like me and I can evolve to become like them .
It is as if ' They ' and ' I ' are both assimilating and experiencing a distant past and future of ourselves , simultaneously , in order to better integrate the two .
 They  and  I both wanted to have a mutual exchange .
I felt as though the trauma I experienced was far less severe then what they had .
I believe this is why so many people have negative extraterrestrial experiences .
They feel as though these beings are taking something  from them and not returning it .
I believe this is true to an extent .
When I was sitting in that chair these beings downloaded me .
The matrix is completely real , only much more etheric and less mechanized then Hollywood would have you believe .
These three beings downloaded me , took my consciousness , and Xeroxed it , storing it into an essence with which I felt they could somehow benefit from this information in the future .
They copied my life memories , experiences , and dreams .
Then stored this information in order to ' get high ' from it and experience it much like I utilize DMT to get high .
It is so bizarre yet true .
My memories are a portal gateway from which DMT transmits them to these beings .
They then utilize these fragments into knowledge in order to get high by assimilating the information the DMT is feeding them .
This is the same process occuring within me as their knowledge infuses itself into me .
Getting me high with the same data transmitted in a different dimension and state .
To put it quite blatently it is a spiritual mind orgy of energy .
The perceived negativity I felt , lies within the fact , that I knew they took more from me then they gave to me .
When I was downloaded I squirmed in my chair .
I could feel an invisible force penetrate my body and my mind .
This force pulled  my essence into a place which appeared higher  and less dense then my own .
They beamed me , probed me , and copied me , and yet I never left the chair .
These events all occured from an invisible force .
There was no ' beam me up scotty ' computer generated particles .
It was all simultaneous without any visual sense of it's presence .
This experience was rapid because it was happening on the tail end of the peak of the experience .
These beings knew they did not have much time and I felt an urgency within their discourse .
At the point I was squirming , I felt my body again .
The peak was weaning after the 5 minute mark .
I then rapidly descended back into my body as my consciousness began to fill out  the various portions of it .
I first felt my brain and its awareness of the current surroundings .
This awareness then spread down into the center of my body and proceeded toward my arms then legs .
I rapidly felt a decent back into current consciousness .
There was no tunnel or white light or anything of that nature .
I was just simultaneously brought back to this dimensional state in the same simultaneous manner I had left it .
Intense distortions of space and time were present .
No true hallucinations after this point were experienced .
In fact , the only true hallucinations Ive ever had are under the effects of DMT .
Ive heard Atropine or Datura based alkaloids can cause this , but this seems most accurately a delirium state and not a true alternate dimensional plane .
After about five to ten minutes of experiencing what I would describe as a peak 1,000 microgram acid type 100 milligram psilocybin combo trip , I was back to complete baseline .
I could describe the effects outside of the peak but they feel like any other tryptamine based hallucinogen in high doses .
My interest is in the extra-dimensional states with which the consciousness seems to direct itself .
If I were to look at myself from the DMT hyperdimensioanal state I would be very disturbed .
The trauma of entering the DMT plane is far less excruciating then leaving it .
This is probably why many people who experience a sublime heaven - like near death state dont want to come back .
Because after experiencing the most brilliant aspects of DMT hyperspace this 3rd dimensional reality seems very primitive , traumatizing , and incredibly unnerving , given the atrocities the psyche knows exist within it .
I feel like DMT is the reason I have sought out alternate dimensions .
I find this current reality to be a very schizophrenic reality .
In this place everything is chaotic , wrong , and wicked .
Where the most corrupt and narcissistic individuals make the most money , rule the most territory , and control the greatest Spiritual knowledge .
Where religious and shamanic priests herd their subjects in perpetually mundane and spiritually - fetal existence .
Where finance governs the social interest of the masses while disregarding ethical integrity in the name of personal profiteering .
I hate this place because I know that once I m coming down from DMT I m back within my own selfish , corrupt , and decadent actions .
The DMT shows me my deficiencies in a blatantly neutral and simple fashion .
Much like its incredibly simple chemical compilation within the human mind .
It tells me that I am part of what has created the very fabric of reality within which I occupy .
Instinctually I know this , but the DMT shows me this through providing me with nirvana and then letting me materialize back into ' this awefull place .
' When Im back here I become part of the collective consciousness that is the human race .
I look at the very state of this reality I have helped generate .
The very place I occupy I have collectively created with my fellow humans .
And for this , I am deeply disappointed with myself and others .
We have so much potential which has been circumvented by selfish interest .
Humanity simply does n't care about spirituality anymore .
It does n't want to have these experiences .
It only wants what instantly impacts it for it 's own physical gain .
What this shows me is a warning to the Homo Sapien species .
This entity must learn to re-connect itself with the organic or it is doomed to self - destruction through artificially integrated expression .
This artificial expression is the next step in evolution physically .
What we will loose in the process is the very nature of our organic ' soul . '
It will be lost among implants , cybernetic grafts , and RFID integration .
This will all happen because of the ego and it 's persistance to revel in it 's own brilliance .
My ultimate theory is that DMT is a transport molecule which periodically impacts a few individuals experiencing its profound revelations .
Through it I see who and what I really am .
It gives me all the means by which to understand my higher spiritual self .
It is integral to my being , because it governs the very nature of my brains impulses on a minute vibration .
Humanity must realize the reality it occupies is nothing more then a conglomeration of individual consciousness expressing itself on a subjective basis .
This is the beauty of DMT .
What it has told me is that we are all one .
It displays itself in plants , animals , and fungi to demonstrate it is all pervasive and all encompassing .
This substance is the binding force which links all elements of this reality together .
It shows me I am not the ultimate egocentric being I think I am .
I am just a piece of a greater cosmic brain .
I am a thought within the singularity that is God.
DMT is my ethereal connection to God through a simplistic chemical transportation outlet .
To summarize , DMT is a portal into God consciousness .
An etheric highway grid were conscious thought , ideas , and wisdom freely traverses in order to better evolve the all pervasive essence which is everything .
This is the most simplistic and accurate depiction I have ever conceived when trying to attempt to understand who , what , and where I am .
This experience was so profound I remember it cosmos-second by cosmos - second like the instant I was born .
The next closest memory I have is my first sexual encounter at 17 years old , which is fuzzy and only contains minute by minute bits and pieces .
That is the effect this experience had on me .
I just started reading Rick Strauss mans  DMT : The Spirit Molecule .
It is profound that western science is starting to discover what I feel DMT has been telling me and guiding me toward since conception all along .
This shows how the Patrilineal religions , which have destroyed and dominated western beliefs and conscious expansion , are beginning to disintegrate .
I have to disagree with Rich Straussman in regards to referencing DMT as a Spirit Molecule .
From my experience it is not a spirit molecule .
DMT is the  Transport Molecule . 
The spirit is and always was there because it is all things in all dimensions simultaneously .
DMT allows the subjective elements of spirit to enter physical form at roughly 49 days after conception .
You and I are those subjective elements of the omnipresence  which is all things .
We come here to experience .
At the moment of death DMT allows for our part of spirit to leave this dimension and reintegrate with the collective whole .
All of the memory , thoughts , and life we lived are brought with the spirit as it adds to the  God Consciousness . 
This is evolution .
Not on a physical scale , but on an etheric spiritual scale .
This report is a tribute to what my most startling DMT trip created within my mind .
It shook me so hard and swayed me so much , I know that DMT is  the doorway to God . 
I theorize this is why so much of organized religion believes
God is with us , around us , envelopes us , and will always be .
This is DMT , a portal or bridge way from God to God ,  they to you and  I . 
We are all the subjective thoughts of the God singularity which pervades all matter , DMT has shown me this .
Its simply God hasnt quite figured out how to integrate its subjective thoughts in order to link all of the various dimensions it occupies .
DMT is a tool to help connect these places .
This makes it what I refer to as a transport molecule . 
Found within us , outside of us , and beyond us .
I now know this reality is but a dream of the divine being from which my thoughts are registering in physical space .
All of this is a complete and utter illusion .
We collectively create this illusion and we create the very reality of the illusion within which we live .
If I were to summarize everything I explained in this report it would come down to this one sentence .. YOU ARE THE ONE YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR !!
You are everything that is and always will make possible .
In Russia they drive in solid gold covered Porsche cars .
More than 40 pounds of the pure gold was used while decorating this particular car .

apache.org incident report for 8/28/2009
Last week we posted about the security breach that caused us to temporarily suspend some services .
All services have now been restored .
We have analyzed the events that led to the breach , and continued to work on improving the security of our systems .
NOTE : At no time were any Apache Software Foundation code repositories , downloads , or users put at risk by this intrusion .
However , we believe that providing a detailed account of what happened will make the internet a better place , by allowing others to learn from our mistakes .
What Happened ?
Our initial running theory was correct -- the server that hosted the apachecon.com ( dv35.apachecon.com ) website had been compromised .
The machine was running CentOS , and we suspect they may have used the recent local root exploits patched in RHSA - 2009 - 1222 to escalate their privileges on this machine .
The attackers fully compromised this machine , including gaining root privileges , and destroyed most of the logs , making it difficult for us to confirm the details of everything that happened on the machine .
This machine is owned by the ApacheCon conference production company , not by the Apache Software Foundation .
However , members of the ASF infrastructure team had accounts on this machine , including one used to create backups .
The attackers attempted unsuccessfully to use passwords from the compromised ApacheCon host to log on to our production webservers .
Later , using the SSH Key of the backup account , they were able to access people.apache.org ( minotaur.apache.org ) .
This account was an unprivileged user , used to create backups from the ApacheCon host .
minotaur.apache.org runs FreeBSD 7 - STABLE , and acts as the staging machine for our mirror network .
It is our primary shell account server , and provides many other services for Apache developers .
None of our Subversion ( version control ) data is kept on this machine , and there was never any risk to any Apache source code .
Once the attackers had gained shell access , they added CGI scripts to the document root folders of several of our websites .
A regular , scheduled rsync process copied these scripts to our production web server , eos.apache.org , where they became externally visible .
The CGI scripts were used to obtain remote shells , with information sent using HTTP POST commands .
Our download pages are dynamically generated , to enable us to present users with a local mirror of our software .
This means that all of our domains have ExecCGI enabled , making it harder for us to protect against an attack of this nature .
After discovering the CGI scripts , the infrastructure team decided to shutdown any servers that could potentially have been affected .
This included people .
apache.org , and both the EU and US website servers .
All website traffic was redirected to a known - good server , and a temporary security message was put in place to let people know we were aware of an issue .
One by one , we brought the potentially - affected servers up , in single user mode , using our out of band access .
It quickly became clear that aurora .apache.org , the EU website server , had not been affected .
Although the CGI scripts had been rsync'd to that machine , they had never been run .
This machine was not included in the DNS rotation at the time of the attack .
aurora.apache.org runs Solaris 10 , and we were able to restore the box to a known - good configuration by cloning and promoting a ZFS snapshot from a day before the CGI scripts were synced over .
Doing so enabled us to bring the EU server back online , and to rapidly restore our main websites .
Thereafter , we continued to analyze the cause of the breach , the method of access , and which , if any , other machines had been compromised .
Shortly after bringing up aurora .
apache.org we determined that the most likely route of the breach was the backup routine from dv35.apachecon.com .
We grabbed all the available logs from dv35.apachecon.com , and promptly shut it down .
Analysis continued on minotaur.apache.org and eos.apache.org ( our US server ) , until we were confident that all remants of the attackers had been removed .
As each server was declared clean , it was brought back online .
What worked ?
The use of ZFS snapshots enabled us to restore the EU production web server to a known - good state .
Redundant services in two locations allowed us to run services from an alternate location while continuing to work on the affected servers and services .
A non-uniform set of compromised machines ( Linux / CentOS i386 , FreeBSD - 7 amd_64 , and Solaris 10 on sparc ) made it difficult for the attackers to escalate privileges on multiple machines .
What did n't work ?
The use of SSH keys facilitated this attack .
In hindsight , our implementation left a lot to be desired -- we did not restrict SSH keys appropriately , and we were unaware of their misuse .
The rsync setup , which uses people .
apache.org to manage the deployment of our websites , enabled the attackers to get their files onto the US mirror , undetected .
The ability to run CGI scripts in any virtual host , when most of our websites do not need this functionality , made us unneccesarily vulnerable to an attack of this nature .
The lack of logs from the ApacheCon host prevents us from conclusively determining the full course of action taken by the attacker .
All but one log file were deleted by the attacker , and logs were not kept off the machine .
What changes we are making now ?
Requiring all users with elevated privileges to use OPIE for sudo on certain machines .
We already require this in some places , but will expand its use as necessary .
Recreating and using new SSH keys , one per host , for backups .
Also enforcing use of the from= " " and command= " " strings in the authorized keys file on the destination backup server .
In tandem with access restrictions which only allow connections from machines that are actually backing up data , this will prevent 3rd party machines from being able to establish an SSH connection .
The command= " " string in the authorized_keys file is now explicit , and only allows one way rsync traffic , due to the paths and flags used .
New keys have been generated for all hosts , with a minimum key length of at least 4096 bits .
The VM that hosted the old apachecon.com site remains powered down , awaiting further detailed analysis .
The apachecon.com website has been re-deployed on a new VM , with a new provider and different operating system .
We are looking at disabling CGI support on most of our website systems .
This has led to the creation of a new httpd module that will handle things like mirror locations for downloads .
The method by which most of our public facing websites are deployed to our production servers will also change , becoming a much more automated process .
We hope to have switched over to a SvnSubPub / SvnWcSub based system within the next few weeks .
We will re-implement measures such as IP banning after several failed logins , on all machines .
A proposal has been made to introduce centralized logging .
This would include all system logs , and possibly also services such as smtpd and httpd .
As a result of this intrusion we are making several changes , to help further secure our infrastructure from such issues in the future .
These changes include the following :

TORONTO - Dozens of filmmakers , artists and activists , including actress Jane Fonda and musician David Byrne , have signed on to a campaign denouncing the Toronto International Film Festival for celebrating the films of Tel Aviv and Israeli culture .
A core group of largely Toronto - based Jewish filmmakers is accusing the festival of playing into " the Israeli propaganda machine " with its inaugural " City to City " program , which it says excludes Palestinian voices from the 10 - film program .
" The most disturbing part about this is there was no consultation with the community , there was also no sensitivity to the way that this issue affects many people in the community , " said filmmaker Kathy Wazana .
" In terms of what we would want ( the festival ) to do is to respond ... perhaps ( with ) some apology to the people who have been offended by this , or ( make ) some commitment to future consultation with community before deciding on programs that focus on issues that are hot topics . "
She said the group is not advocating a boycott and has no plans to demonstrate during the 10 - day festival , which is expected to draw a host of A - list celebrities including George Clooney , Oprah Winfrey and Penelope Cruz .
The group is circulating a letter of protest and has drawn support from more than 50 artists around the world including American writer Alice Walker , Canadian writer and activist Naomi Klein , U.K. filmmaker Ken Loach and American actor Danny Glover .
" Looking at modern , sophisticated Tel Aviv without also considering the city 's past and the realities of Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza strip would be like rhapsodizing about the beauty and elegant lifestyles in white - only Cape Town or Johannesburg during apartheid without acknowledging the corresponding black townships of Khayelitsha and Soweto , " the letter states .
The letter goes on to accuse the festival of being unduly influenced by the Israeli government 's year - long Brand Israel campaign , which it says is geared towards sanitizing Israel 's controversial political and military history .
It also links the Royal Ontario Museum 's Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit to the Brand Israel campaign .
Festival co-director Cameron Bailey responded with a statement defending the program , although he acknowledged , " Tel Aviv is not a simple choice and that the city remains contested ground . "
" As a festival that values debate and the exchange of cultures , we will continue to screen the best films we can find from around the world , " said Bailey , adding that the " City to City " program was conceived and curated independently without pressure from any outside sources .
" This is our contribution to expanding our audiences ' experience of this art form and the worlds it represents . "
The filmmakers ' protest elicited strong reaction from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre for Holocaust Studies and the UJA Federation of Greater Toronto , which both came out in strong support of the " City to City " program .
In a letter to UJA members dated Wednesday , Toronto chairman David Koschitzky urges them to attend the films that are part of the spotlight on Tel Aviv and to encourage friends of all cultural backgrounds to do the same .
" Together we can ensure that our community continues our unwavering support for Israel , " Koschitzky writes in an email blast to 25,000 Toronto members .
The controversy follows a decision by Toronto - based filmmaker John Greyson to pull his film " Covered " from the festival in protest last week .
In a letter to festival organizers , he said it was a difficult decision to make and raised questions about " City to City 's " origins , funding , programming and sponsors .
" To my mind , this is n't the right year to celebrate Brand Israel , or to demonstrate an ostrich - like indifference to the realities ( cinematic and otherwise ) of the region , " said Greyson , who is helping to organize a screening this month for the Toronto Palestinian Film Festival .
" ( The festival ) has emphatically taken sides and in the process , forced every filmmaker and audience member who opposes the occupation to cross a type of picket line . "
Wazana stressed that the protest was not directed at the work of Israeli filmmakers involved in the festival spotlight and said the campaign is drawing wide and diverse support from artists around the world .
" We 're not just a small group here in Toronto who are outraged by this , " she said , noting that the collection of signatures was ongoing .
" The international film and media arts community is also very much opposed to this . "
The Toronto film festival runs Sept. 10 through 19 .

Lou Dobbs continues to plan for a post CNN career by using his radio show to audition for a job on Fox News .
Today Dobbs defended Glenn Beck calling Obama a racist , and attacked Color of Change for boycotting Glenn Beck ’s advertisers .
Dobbs said that Beck has guts .
Beck may have guts , but he does n’t have advertisers .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Dobbs said , “ They did n’t mention any of the good things like going after Glenn Beck .
See it was Van Jones ’ group that got the bright idea to go after his sponsors because Glenn Beck said some things that he did n’t like .
Is n’t that impressive ?
I did n’t hear Howard Dean get all excited about that , trampling all over the First Amendment trying to coerce sponsors of Glenn Beck just because he had the guts to say what he meant . ”

Dobbs later said , “ And there ’s Van Jones saying well , you know , you said something I did n’t like , so what are we going to , we ’ll just attack your sponsors .
That did n’t work out so shiny for him did it ?
By the way , I ’ve got to say hats off to Glenn Beck for having the guts to stand up to this morass of mediocrity , and pure , pure ideology . ”
It is very amusing the way Dobbs glosses over what Beck actually said .
Beck claimed that Obama has problems with white people and that he is a racist .
He did n’t say something that Van Jones did n’t like .
He said something that his advertisers did n’t like , and the advertisers have the First Amendment right to take their sponsorship dollars elsewhere .
Beck ’s First Amendment rights are not violated by the boycott .
Dobbs has embarked on a suck up to Beck campaign .
Dobbs is clearly trying to cement himself as Beck like and pick up some of his audience .
I also think old Lou is trying to get in the good graces of Fox News in case he ever finds himself out of a job .
Dobbs also may be jealous and wishing that some group would boycott his show , but Dobbs has such a small viewership any he says could go completely unnoticed .
In an age when football is a multi-million pound global business I often struggle to relate to the game and its protagonists , who have become remote celebrity figures with little in common with the people who pay handsomely to watch them .
But every now and again a story comes along that unlocks something emotional deep inside me , the sort that really makes me feel as though I can empathise with a footballer once more .
This is one of them .
League One Stockport drew 2 - 2 at Yeovil on Saturday .
It was a result which took both teams on to six points so far in the season and was in many ways unremarkable .
What made it significant was that both the Stockport goals were scored by Hatters forward Carl Baker , taking his tally to nine goals for the season and making him the highest scorer in the country this season .
Just days earlier Stockport manager Gary Ablett had the unenviable task of breaking the news to Baker that the player 's elder brother Michael had lost his battle against leukaemia .
Baker was under no pressure to play on Saturday but called Ablett on Thursday evening to say that he wanted to be part of the team .
Baker , shown here wearing the Hatters pre-season kit , scored twice on Saturday days after the death of his brother
After putting Stockport in front with his 22nd minute penalty he raced to the dugout and collected a T - shirt he had prepared in advance .
It said ' For u Mike ' and Baker held it aloft while all of his team - mates , goalkeeper included , rushed to join him .
At the end of the game Baker was sent over to the away supporters by Ablett .
A couple of hundred had made the long trek south to Huish Park and they presented the striker with a card that everyone in the away end had signed .
Baker was hugged by many of them and I 'm told that it was a genuinely emotional moment .
For me , it is an example of what football is really all about .
Baker 's brother had been in attendance at Stockport 's last home game and I could only imagine how difficult it must have been for Carl to retain his focus and concentration for last Saturday 's match .
Perhaps it provided a distraction for Carl , who has been in brilliant form this season ; a real bag of tricks playing just behind the main striker .
Perhaps he felt that if he played he might score and would then have the opportunity to make a public demonstration of his feelings for his older brother .
To make matters even worse , Baker 's younger brother also has leukaemia and it is obviously an extremely difficult time for the whole family .
I 'm told that Baker is a typical scouser , a little bit cheeky , a very bubbly character and fun to be around .
Now 26 , he came into the professional game relatively late having joined Morecambe in 2007 .
It means that he appreciates every single day he spends as a professional player .
In my experience professionals who have previously worked in a ' normal ' job often have a greater appreciation of the privilege of being paid to play the game .
Stockport brought him to Edgeley Park in July 2008 for a figure in the region of £ 200,000 - a lot of money in the lower leagues .
He is clearly at the right club .
The Hatters are currently in administration but they have gone above and beyond what could be expected to raise the profile of Leukaemia Research .
The club 's players wore a cerise pink and black striped shirt for their pre-season friendlies .
It has a historical connection as they are the colours Stockport wore in 1900 , but the Leukaemia Research logo was featured on them .
The shirts are now being auctioned off to raise money for the charity and are fetching £ 200 a piece .
The players and staff at the club have pitched in to buy one for £ 500 .
With Stockport in administration they are n't a particularly attractive proposition for business investment so every unused advertising board at Edgeley Park is currently filled with one for Leukaemia Research .
When a board is eventually sold the club , despite their financial travails , are donating 30 % of the fee to Leukaemia Research .
The club decided to raise money for the charity as a Baker and several other staff at the club have relations suffering from blood cancer diseases .
As someone at Stockport told me : " We might have done a lot wrong at the club but we have got this just about right . "
I could n't agree more .
Thousands of words are written every weekend about the latest flare - up in the Premier League , the hottest transfer rumour or the latest takeover talk .
But I cannot help but feel that Baker 's courage , his bond with the Hatters supporters and Stockport 's willingness to embrace such a worthy cause chimes with what made me first fall in love with football .
And I wish all of them well .

Halloween !
Time to scare the kiddies with graphic depictions of recently murdered NFL quarterbacks !
That 's what one amusement park figures , at least before the inevitable boycott .
Let 's work up our righteous indignation .

Kings Island in Ohio gave a local news station a sneak preview of their annual Halloween Haunt , and they brought back pictures of a haunted graveyard filled with " celebrity skeletons " like Michael Jackson and Ted Kennedy .
And that display up there .
Yep , that 's a skeleton holding a Titans helmet , with the top blown off .
A gun rests at the foot of the couch .
The two skeletons assume the positions that Steve McNair and Sahel Kazemi were found in after their murder - suicide .

The shitstorm formed early on this one , stoked by Cincinnati area talk radio .
Kings Island might have thought they caught this before it went national , but they did n't count on Clay Travis :
When reached by FanHouse , a spokesperson for Kings Island , Don Helbig , said the following , " There will not be a scene at our Halloween event that features Steve McNair or anyone that resembles him . "
With video and pictures of the skeletons circulating online , Helbig at first declined to acknowledge that they had ever existed .
" There was no reference to Steve McNair at all .
No jersey , nothing . "
Upon being informed that the pictures and video were already online , Helbig again insisted that the skeletons would not be featured on Friday when the event opens .
Pressed as to when the skeletons were removed from the park , Helbig stuck to his talking points .
" Our event does not open until Friday , " he said , " We meant him no disrespect . "

Even for Rush Limbaugh , this rant is obscene beyond description :
Limbaugh is not only holding Obama accountable for some kids beating up another kid on a bus , but now wants to racially segregate buses so white kids can escape the ' black menace ' .
How on earth does he know whether the attack was racially motivated or not ?
Incidentally , an eyewitness claimed the attack had nothing to do with the student 's race .
And even if it was , does this indicate a nation wide movement of black kids beating up wide kids ?
This is race - baiting at its worst .

I know it has been a while since I posted , and I ’m sorry to say this is n’t a terribly deep or interesting one .
I like the value - supply package on hackage .
It takes ( essentially ) an infinite list of things and arranges them into an infinite tree randomly … but a particularly useful kind of random .
The first one you look at just happens to be the first element of the list , the second one you look at comes from the second element , etc .
This sort of magic is n’t useful for its magic , it ’s just useful because you can use something like Int and not run out of bits too soon .
All I ever use it for is unique labels in computations that would be made too strict by the state monad .
As a contrived example of such a computation :
allocateLabel :: State Label Label labelList :: State Label [ Label ] labelList = liftM2 ( :) allocateLabel labelList bad :: State Label [ ( Label , Label ) ] bad = lift M2 zip labelList labelList
The problem is that we do n’t know what label to start with on the second labelList in bad … we never finish using them up in the first one .
But if all you care about is uniqueness of labels , rather than their order , this computation is easily definable as a function of a Supply from value - supply :
labelList :: Supply Label -> [ Label ] labelList sup = let ( a , b ) = split2 sup in supply Value a : labelList b good :: Supply Label -> [ ( Label , Label ) ] good sup = let ( a , b ) = split2 sup in zip ( labelList a ) ( labelList b )
Great .
Only problem is , we can only make Supplys from the IO monad .
As it should be , since the supply uses a nasty form of nondeterminism to assign elements to its trees .
But , if all you care about is uniqueness , which is the case for me more often than not , you can squash IO out of the interface ( not the implementation , unfortunately ) .
Like this :
runSupply :: ( forall a . Eq a =>
Supply a -> b ) -> b runSupply f = f ( unsafePerformIO ( newSupply 0 succ ) )
In my opinion , this is the best possible interface for such a thing .
Value - supply is only to be used when all you care about is uniqueness , not ordering or the precise values .
Well , this interface encodes that exactly .
When you use this function , all you are allowed to care about is uniqueness , any other concern is hidden behind the type system .
It is also impossible to confuse indices from different supplies .
And this is a perfectly well - behaved function .
You could demonstrate that by giving a pure implementation of Supply [ Bool ] ( which just traces the path to the given leaf from the root ) .
The unsafe business is merely an optimization ( and for some use cases , like labelList above , a very potent one ) .
Hooray .
I get my favorite evil module , with all of its evil safely contained in a jar that they call a box for some reason .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration will scrap the controversial missile defense shield program in Eastern Europe , a senior administration official confirmed to CNN Thursday .
The U.S. has been testing the ability of ground - based interceptor missiles to hit long - range ballistic missiles .
The comment followed similar statements from officials in Poland and the Czech Republic -- where key elements of the system were to be located -- but was the first confirmation from an American official .
Vice President Joe Biden earlier refused to confirm to CNN that the George W. Bush - era plan was being shelved .
But he did explain the logic of doing so , saying Iran -- a key concern for the United States -- was not a threat .
" I think we are fully capable and secure dealing with any present or future potential Iranian threat , " he told CNN's Chris Lawrence in Baghdad , where he is on a brief trip .
" The whole purpose of this exercise we are undertaking is to diminish the prospect of the Iranians destabilizing that region in the world .
I am less concerned -- much less concerned -- about the Iranian potential .
They have no potential at this moment , they have no capacity to launch a missile at the United States of America , " he said .
Biden said he is " deeply " involved in the review of the missile defense program .

The Bush administration had cited the perceived nuclear threat from Iran as one of the key reasons it wanted to install the missile shield in eastern Europe .
The U.S. reversal is likely to please Russia , which had fiercely opposed the plans .
Is the U.S. right to scrap plans for a missile defense shield in Europe ?
Sound Off below
A U.S. delegation held high - level meetings Thursday in both Poland and the Czech Republic to discuss the missile defense system .
While the outcome of the meetings was n't clear , officials in both countries confirmed the system would be scrapped .
Czech Prime minister Jan Fischer said in a statement that U.S. President Barack Obama told him in a Wednesday phone call that the United States was shelving its plans .
Fischer did not say what reason Obama gave him for reconsidering .
A spokeswoman at the Polish Ministry of Defense also said the program had been suspended .
" This is catastrophic for Poland , " said the spokeswoman , who declined to be named in line with ministry policy .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Gen. James E. Cartwright , who is vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , are scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday morning .
The Defense Department has not announced what will be discussed , but Cartwright is the point man for the missile defense shield program .
Poland and the Czech Republic had based much of their future security policy on getting the missile defenses from the United States .
The countries share deep concerns of a future military threat from the east -- namely , Russia -- and may now look for other defense assurances from their NATO allies .
" At the NATO summit in April , we adopted a resolution focusing on building a defense system against real , existing threats , i.e. short - range and medium - range missiles , " Fischer said .
" We expect that the United States will continue cooperating with the Czech Republic on concluding the relevant agreements on our mutual ( research and development ) and military collaboration , including the financing of specific projects . "
By contrast , Russia may view the move as a diplomatic victory after complaining about the program consistently for years .
There was no comment Thursday morning from Russian officials .
But the issue has been a sore point in relations between Washington and Moscow , with Russia believing the shield would ultimately erode its own strategic nuclear deterrent .
With the program scrapped , it opens the way for Russia to join with the United States in taking a harder line on Iran , CNN Correspondent Matthew Chance reported from Moscow .
The United States proposed the plans under then - President George W. Bush , but since taking over this year , the Obama administration has been reviewing whether to move ahead with them .
The missile shield issue came up in July during a meeting between Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow .
Obama maintained that Russia had nothing to fear from such a system , which would be designed to intercept a solitary missile from Iran or North Korea , as opposed to " a mighty Russian arsenal . "
CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux in Washington and Per Nyberg in London , England , contributed to this report .

Homeopathy : The Test - programme summary
Homeopathy was pioneered over 200 years ago .
Practitioners and patients are convinced it has the power to heal .
Today , some of the most famous and influential people in the world , including pop stars , politicians , footballers and even Prince Charles , all use homeopathic remedies .
Yet according to traditional science , they are wasting their money .
" Unusual claims require unusually good proof "
The Challenge
Sceptic James Randi is so convinced that homeopathy will not work , that he has offered $ 1 m to anyone who can provide convincing evidence of its effects .
For the first time in the programme 's history , Horizon conducts its own scientific experiment , to try and win his money .
If they succeed , they will not only be $ 1 m richer - they will also force scientists to rethink some of their fundamental beliefs .
Homeopathy and conventional science
The basic principle of homeopathy is that like cures like : that an ailment can be cured by small quantities of substances which produce the same symptoms .
For example , it is believed that onions , which produce streaming , itchy eyes , can be used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever .
However , many of the ingredients of homeopathic cures are poisonous if taken in large enough quantities .
So homeopaths dilute the substances they are using in water or alcohol .
This is where scientists become sceptical - because homeopathic solutions are diluted so many times they are unlikely to contain any of the original ingredients at all .
Yet many of the people who take homeopathic medicines are convinced that they work .
Has science missed something , or could there be a more conventional explanation ?
The Placebo Effect
The placebo effect is a well - documented medical phenomenon .
Often , a patient taking pills will feel better , regardless of what the pills contain , simply because they believe the pills will work .
Doctors studying the placebo effect have noticed that large pills work better than small pills , and that coloured pills work better than white ones .
Could the beneficial effects of homeopathy be entirely due to the placebo effect ?
If so , then homeopathy ought not to work on babies or animals , who have no knowledge that they are taking a medicine .
Yet many people are convinced that it does .
Can science prove that homeopathy works ?
In 1988 , Jacques Benveniste was studying how allergies affected the body .
He focussed on a type of blood cell known as a basophil , which activates when it comes into contact with a substance you 're allergic to .
As part of his research , Benveniste experimented with very dilute solutions .
To his surprise , his research showed that even when the allergic substance was diluted down to homeopathic quantities , it could still trigger a reaction in the basophils .
Was this the scientific proof that homeopathic medicines could have a measurable effect on the body ?
The memory of water
In an attempt to explain his results , Benveniste suggested a startling new theory .
He proposed that water had the power to ' remember ' substances that had been dissolved in it .
This startling new idea would force scientists to rethink many fundamental ideas about how liquids behave .
Unsurprisingly , the scientific community greeted this idea with scepticism .
The then editor of Nature , Sir John Maddox , agreed to publish Benveniste 's paper - but on one condition .
Benveniste must open his laboratory to a team of independent referees , who would evaluate his techniques .
" Scientists are human beings .
Like anyone else , they can fool themselves "
Enter James Randi
When Maddox named his team , he took everyone by surprise .
Included on the team was a man who was not a professional scientist : magician and paranormal investigator James Randi .
Randi and the team watched Benveniste 's team repeat the experiment .
They went to extraordinary lengths to ensure that none of the scientists involved knew which samples were the homeopathic solutions , and which ones were the controls - even taping the sample codes to the ceiling for the duration of the experiment .
This time , Benveniste 's results were inconclusive , and the scientific community remained unconvinced by Benveniste 's memory of water theory .
Homeopathy undergoes more tests
Since the Benveniste case , more scientists have claimed to see measurable effects of homeopathic medicines .
In one of the most convincing tests to date , Dr. David Reilly conducted clinical trials on patients suffering from hay fever .
Using hundreds of patients , Reilly was able to show a noticeable improvement in patients taking a homeopathic remedy over those in the control group .
Tests on different allergies produced similar results .
Yet the scientific community called these results into question because they could not explain how the homeopathic medicines could have worked .
Then Professor Madeleine Ennis attended a conference in which a French researcher claimed to be able to show that water had a memory .
Ennis was unimpressed - so the researcher challenged her to try the experiment for herself .
When she did so , she was astonished to find that her results agreed .
Horizon takes up the challenge
Although many researchers now offered proof that the effects of homeopathy can be measured , none have yet applied for James Randi 's million dollar prize .
For the first time in the programme 's history , Horizon decided to conduct their own scientific experiment .
The programme gathered a team of scientists from among the most respected institutes in the country .
The Vice - President of the Royal Society , Professor John Enderby oversaw the experiment , and James Randi flew in from the United States to watch .
As with Benveniste 's original experiment , Randi insisted that strict precautions be taken to ensure that none of the experimenters knew whether they were dealing with homeopathic solutions , or with pure water Two independent scientists performed tests to see whether their samples produced a biological effect .
Only when the experiment was over was it revealed which samples were real .
To Randi 's relief , the experiment was a total failure .
The scientists were no better at deciding which samples were homeopathic than pure chance would have been .

Down at the bottom of Switzerland 's deepest lake is one of the country 's murkiest secrets .
For here is disturbing evidence of Switzerland 's little - known Second World War defence effort .
It poses a potentially devastating threat to the Alpine nation , 70 years after the conflict .
The placid waters of Lake Thun spread out for 11 miles beneath Faulensee village .
Some 700 feet beneath the surface more than 9,000 tons of Swiss army munitions lie dumped on its watery floor .
The ordnance includes artillery shells , hand grenades , and explosives that were meant to defend Switzerland against a Nazi invasion that never happened .
After the war , the army began a 20 - year process of getting rid of its vast munitions stockpile by dumping most of it into four Alpine lakes , all of which are used to supply drinking water to the surrounding population .
Lake
Thun , in the central Swiss canton of Bern , took the brunt of the disposal programme , which ended in 1964 .
The huge pile of underwater ordnance remained out of sight and minds until about a decade ago when local fishermen began to notice abnormalities in the reproductive organs of the lake 's whitefish – one of their chief sources of income .
More recently the fishermen , who have seen their catches diminish by some 80 per cent over the past three decades , have been pulling bits of dumped munitions out of the lake with the few fish they still manage to net .
Last month a rusting hand grenade was hauled to the surface .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Today , a tiny part of this underwater arms dump has been raised to the surface and is , of all things , a tourist attraction .
The huge and immaculately polished Second World War guns would fit a battleship , yet they are hidden behind the walls of four innocent looking barns in an idyllic mountain village .
As secret weapons they once formed part of the Swiss Army 's elaborate wartime defence system .
This summer , however , the massive 10.5 cm guns , the barns that camouflage their presence , and the network of tunnels linking them underneath Faulensee have been developed as a tourist attraction and thrown open to the public .
" The Faulensee artillery battery is of national and historic importance , " says the brochure advertising the site as a " unique " Second World War experience .
Yet the promotional leaflet makes no mention of the rest of the arms .
Switzerland 's environmentalist Green Party , which holds only a handful of seats in a national parliament dominated by the right - wing Swiss People 's Party , is appalled that nothing has been done to remove the munitions :
" It is scandalous that this potentially lethal rubbish is still there , " said Christine Haesler , the leader of the Greens in Bern Canton .
" We have been fighting a fruitless battle with the Swiss military for years to try to get the munitions removed , but the army insists that the remains are not dangerous and that their disposal would be too expensive , " she added .
The Swiss are not the only people with an underwater munitions problem .
The countries surrounding the Baltic are still trying to deal with the threat posed by 300,000 tons of German wartime munitions that Britain the United States and the then Soviet Union dumped in the sea after the Second World War .
Tengis Borisov , a Russian environmental researcher recently warned that the munitions meant that the Baltic faced a disaster " on a scale comparable with Chernobyl " .
In Switzerland , however , controversy over the issue of dumped ordnance appears to have been studiously avoided .
Four years ago , Ursula Haller , a Thun MP and member of the country 's small citizens ' democratic party BDP , tabled a parliamentary motion calling for the munitions to be removed from the lakes .
She argued that as the ordnance was bound to corrode , toxic substances would leak into the lake and pollute , the water supply and the fish .
However , the Swiss defence ministry examined the problem and decided that it would not only be too costly but also too dangerous to attempt to remove the ordnance by the preferred method , which involves freezing the munitions and raising them sealed in block of ice .
Various studies were conducted , by the Swiss water board and the country 's fisheries department .
Yet all of them insisted that there was no evidence that the dumped munitions were leaking toxins .
One study even concluded that the sediment covering the munitions was sealing them off more and more each year and that the threat posed was diminishing as a result .
A fisheries department study found that Lake Thun 's plankton was the cause of the deformed gonads in the lake 's whitefish .
However the study was unable to establish what was affecting the plankton and suggested that further investigation was necessary .
Meanwhile fishermen and restaurant owners around Lake
Thun argue that the whitefish are quite edible because they have been scientifically tested and because those who eat them do n't in any case consume the deformed intestines .
A special commission from Switzerland 's parliament rejected Mrs Haller 's motion by seven votes to five in 2006 .
Although the Swiss water board argues that the lake waters must be kept under regular observation and that more studies need to be carried out , the issue now appears to have been quietly forgotten by all but the country 's Green Party .

Debunking long - held myths is always a gratifying exercise , but never is that more true than when said myths have done our favorite operating system harm .
It was with great glee , then , that Linux Girl came across not one but two myth - debunking conversations on the blogs in recent days .
A recent report from the Linux Foundation , for example , showed conclusively once and for all that the image of kernel hackers as basement - dwelling nerds who still live with their parents is just plain false .
' It Is Good for Business '
In fact , more than 70 percent of work on the kernel today is done by developers who are being paid for their efforts , the report found .
" I hope this finally kills off the ' GPL is bad for business ' myth , " wrote chrb on Slashdot , where more than 250 comments greeted the findings .
" Every one of those companies is paying for work on the kernel because it is good for their business .
Red Hat , IBM , Novell , etc. are n't charities -- they sponsor Linux development because it expands their markets and brings in profits . "
The findings ring true , Chris Travers , a Slashdot blogger who works on the LedgerSMB project , told LinuxInsider .
" Every FOSS developer I have known has been a professional programmer , " he said .
' A Staple of Anti-Linux FUD '
Others cheered the news for other reasons .
" Painting Linux devs as a bunch of amateurs who are accountable to no one has been a staple of anti-Linux FUD campaigns for years , " Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack added .
" It 's nice to have a quick means of refuting that form of misinformation . "
Speaking of hackers , we were distressed to see reports last week that the noted Ruby hacker " why the lucky stiff " -- more commonly known as " _why " -- has apparently disappeared from the Internet without a trace !
If any readers learn more about the situation , we 'd love to hear from you in the comments .
Netbook Returns a ' Non -Issue '
Meanwhile , on to myth - debunking No. 2 , which is perhaps even more gratifying than No. 1 was .
Specifically , after months of claims that Linux netbooks get returned far more often than Windows ones do -- claims that were reiterated just recently by Microsoft COO Kevin Turner in a speech at Microsoft 's annual financial analysts ' meeting --
Dell came out and said that it just is n't true .
In fact , Linux returns are about the same as those for Windows netbooks , Dell senior product marketing manager Todd Finch reportedly said at OpenSource World , according to a report in The Register .
Further , the matter is " non-issue , " Finch reportedly said .
' Linux Is Mainstream '
Not only that , but " they are making something of nothing , " he said of Microsoft 's returns claims .
YESSSSSSSSSSS !!
The resounding shouts of joy could be heard throughout the blogs -- DesktopLinux , Slashdot , LXer and Digg , to name just a few .
" People keep trying to explain what has become now pretty obvious : Linux is mainstream , " wrote jotaeleemeese on Slashdot , for example .
" It is high time companies and people interested in computing wake up to this simple reality . "
' Nice of Dell '
It would n't have been entirely surprising if Microsoft 's claims were true " simply due to user expectations , " but " it is interesting at least for Dell that they are n't , " Travers said .
" This suggests once again that Linux is competitive on the netbook and is a valid option , despite Microsoft 's attempts to suggest otherwise . "
Indeed , " it 's nice of Dell to set the record straight , even if it probably means annoying one of their largest suppliers , " Mack told LinuxInsider .
Some distros might have higher returns due to bad marketing or inadequate product testing , Travers pointed out , but " this is n't an issue confined to Linux .
" A couple years ago I bought my wife a laptop with Vista , and it just did n't work right until I got a recent version of Fedora installed , " he recalled .
" My wife was ready to return the thing before I made the switch for her .
So similar problems can affect Windows as well . "
Hidden by Design
Dell may have fewer problems with Linux netbooks than other retailers do because " it is pretty much impossible to accidentally get Linux at Dell , " Slashdot blogger hairyfeet told LinuxInsider .
" If you do n't specifically know what Linux is and go out of your way to find it at Dell , you simply will never run into it , " hairyfeet explained .
" Is it on the front page ?
Nope , not there .
First page for netbooks ?
Nope , not there either .
In fact , you 'll navigate a maze of ' recommends Windows xx ' before you come across the Linux offerings . "
Dell is smart to use such a strategy , hairyfeet asserted : " This cuts down on returns , since only someone who knows what Linux is AND wants it will actually buy Linux from Dell . "
' Network of Shills '
Then again , it 's also difficult to overstate Microsoft 's marketing prowess .
" The hard part in competing with a monopoly is the scale of lies , " blogger Robert Pogson told LinuxInsider .
" If a lie is told often enough , or if it is a big enough lie , people believe it . "
Microsoft runs a " network of shills " that spreads " outrageous lies that that other OS is faster , better , smoother , ' more intuitive ' and more reliable , " Pogson asserted .
" They will show huge uptake of M $ 's products induced by payoffs and claim folks are choosing a superior product .
They will show stock not sold as sales while hiding prices by bundling . "
' Just a Hair on the Camel of Lies '
Regarding netbooks , " killing the true netbook by persuading OEMs to upsell and spreading FUD about returns is just a hair on the camel of lies that M$ induces on a scale usually only seen coming from ministries of propaganda in totalitarian regimes , " Pogson added .
" M$ has no monopoly on truth , " he concluded .
" The netbook was the largest and most successful advertising campaign that GNU / Linux ever had , with many millions of users and all their associates realizing that there is another way to do things and that lies are lies even when widely believed . "
Claim : C++ designer Bjarne Stroustrup admitted in an interview that he developed the language solely to create high - paying jobs for programmers .
FALSE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , August 2009 ]
I just ran across a “ leaked ” interview with programming language C++ author Bjarne Stroustrup where he clames to have developed C++ for the express intent of creating a demand for programmers after IBM swamped the market with C programers in the 90’s .
Basically I am asking if there is any truth to this .
If so this guy duped an entire industry .
Origins : Many long - time Internet veterans recall that certain computer - related debates were practically guaranteed to overwhelm any discussion groups in which they arose .
It did n’t matter if the setting was a newsgroup for Monty Python fans or a mailing list devoted to breeding cats — any mention or comparison of computer hardware ( IBM vs. DEC vs. Sun ) , platforms ( PC vs. Mac ) , or operating systems ( Unix vs. VMS , Windows vs. Linux ) was likely to trigger a frenzy of partisan assertions and rebuttals that could take weeks to play out .
Some of these topics are now a bit passé , but IT professionals have never been at a loss for contentious subjects to hash over .
This predilection was
encapsulated in a transcript of a January 1998 interview with Dr. Bjarne
Stroustrup , the Danish - born computer scientist who was the designer and original implementer of the C++ programming language and is currently the College of Engineering Chair Professor in Computer Science at Texas A&M University .
In that interview , purportedly given to a writer for IEEE ’s Computer magazine , Dr. Stroustrup supposedly admitted his motive for designing C++ was to create “ a language so complicated , so difficult to learn , that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with programmers , ” and that C++ was “ only supposed to be a joke ” which he “ never thought people would take seriously . ”
That shocking portion of the interview never saw the light of day ( at least through regular channels ) because , it was said , the magazine ’s “ editor decided to suppress its contents , ‘ for the good of the industry ' ” :
On the 1st of January , 1998 , Bjarne Stroustrup gave an interview to the IEEE ’s ‘ Computer ’ magazine .
On the 1st of January , 1998 , Bjarne Stroustrup gave an interview to the IEEE ’s ‘ Computer ’ magazine .
Naturally , the editors thought he would be giving a retrospective view of seven years of object - oriented design , using the language he created .
By the end of the interview , the interviewer got more than he had bargained for and , subsequently , the editor decided to suppress its contents , ‘ for the good of the industry ’ but , as with many of these things , there was a leak .
Here is a complete transcript of what was was said , unedited , and unrehearsed , so it is n’t as neat as planned interviews .
Interviewer :
Well , it ’s been a few years since you changed the world of software design , how does it feel , looking back ?
Stroustrup : Actually , I was thinking about those days , just before you arrived .
Do you remember ?
Everyone was writing ‘ C ’ and , the trouble was , they were pretty damn good at it ..
Universities got pretty good at teaching it , too .
They were turning out competent — I stress the word ‘ competent ’ — graduates at a phenomenal rate .
That ’s what caused the problem .
Interviewer : Problem ?
Stroustrup : Yes , problem .
Remember when everyone wrote COBOL ?
Interviewer : Of course .
I did , too .
Stroustrup : Well , in the beginning , these guys were like demi-gods .
Their salaries were high , and they were treated like royalty .
Interviewer :
Those were the days , eh? Stroustrup : Right .
So what happened ?
IBM got sick of it , and invested millions in training programmers , till they were a dime a dozen .
Interviewer :
That ’s why I got out .
Salaries dropped within a year , to the point where being a journalist actually paid better .
Stroustrup : Exactly .
Well , the same happened with ‘ C’ programmers .
Interviewer : I see , but what ’s the point ?
Stroustrup : Well , one day , when I was sitting in my office , I thought of this little scheme , which would redress the balance a little .
I thought ‘ I wonder what would happen , if there were a language so complicated , so difficult to learn , that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with programmers ?
Actually , I got some of the ideas from X10 , you know , X windows .
That was such a bitch of a graphics system , that it only just ran on those Sun 3/60 things ..
They had all the ingredients for what I wanted .
A really ridiculously complex syntax , obscure functions , and pseudo - OO structure .
Even now , nobody writes raw X - windows code .
Motif is the only way to go if you want to retain your sanity .
Interviewer : You ’re kidding ?
Stroustrup : Not a bit of it .
In fact , there was another problem ..
Unix was written in ‘ C’ , which meant that any ‘ C ’ programmer could very easily become a systems programmer .
Remember what a mainframe systems programmer used to earn ?
Interviewer :
You bet I do , that ’s what I used to do .
Stroustrup : OK , so this new language had to divorce itself from Unix , by hiding all the system calls that bound the two together so nicely .
This would enable guys who only knew about DOS to earn a decent living too .
Interviewer : I do n’t believe you said that … Stroustrup :
Well , it ’s been long enough , now , and I believe most people have figured out for themselves that C++ is a waste of time but , I must say , it ’s taken them a lot longer than I thought it would .
Interviewer :
So how exactly did you do it ?
Stroustrup :
It was only supposed to be a joke , I never thought people would take the book seriously .
Anyone with half a brain can see that object - oriented programming is counter - intuitive , illogical and inefficient .
Interviewer : What ?
Stroustrup :
And as for ‘ re - useable code ’ — when did you ever hear of a company re-using its code ?
Interviewer : Well , never , actually , but … Stroustrup :
There you are then .
Mind you , a few tried , in the early days .
There was this Oregon company — Mentor Graphics , I think they were called — really caught a cold trying to rewrite everything in C++ in about ’ 90 or ’ 91 .
I felt sorry for them really , but I thought people would learn from their mistakes ..
Interviewer : Obviously , they did n’t ?
Stroustrup : Not in the slightest .
Trouble is , most companies hush - up all their major blunders , and explaining a $ 30 million loss to the shareholders would have been difficult ..
Give them their due , though , they made it work in the end .
Interviewer :
They did ?
Well , there you are then , it proves O - O works .
Stroustrup : Well , almost .
The executable was so huge , it took five minutes to load , on an HP workstation , with 128 MB of RAM .
Then it ran like treacle .
Actually , I thought this would be a major stumbling - block , and I ’d get found out within a week , but nobody cared .
Sun and HP were only too glad to sell enormously powerful boxes , with huge resources just to run trivial programs .
You know , when we had our first C++ compiler , at AT&T , I compiled ‘ Hello World ’ , and could n’t believe the size of the executable .
2.1MB Interviewer : What ?
Well , compilers have come a long way , since then .
Stroustrup : They have ?
Try it on the latest version of g++ — you wo n’t get much change out of half a megabyte .
Also , there are several quite recent examples for you , from all over the world .
British Telecom had a major disaster on their hands but , luckily , managed to scrap the whole thing and start again .
They were luckier than Australian Telecom .
Now I hear that Siemens is building a dinosaur , and getting more and more worried as the size of the hardware gets bigger , to accommodate the executables .
Is n’t multiple inheritance a joy ?
Interviewer : Yes , but C++ is basically a sound language .
Stroustrup :
You really believe that , do n’t you ?
Have you ever sat down and worked on a C++ project ?
Here ’s what happens :
First , I ’ve put in enough pitfalls to make sure that only the most trivial projects will work first time .
Take operator overloading .
At the end of the project , almost every module has it , usually , because guys feel they really should do it , as it was in their training course .
The same operator then means something totally different in every module .
Try pulling that lot together , when you have a hundred or so modules .
And as for data hiding .
God , I sometimes can’t help laughing when I hear about the problems companies have making their modules talk to each other .
I think the word ‘ synergistic ’ was specially invented to twist the knife in a project manager ’s ribs .
Interviewer : I have to say , I ’m beginning to be quite appalled at all this .
You say you did it to raise programmers ’ salaries ?
That ’s obscene .
Stroustrup : Not really .
Everyone has a choice .
I did n’t expect the thing to get so much out of hand .
Anyway , I basically succeeded .
C++ is dying off now , but programmers still get high salaries — especially those poor devils who have to maintain all this crap .
You do realise , it ’s impossible to maintain a large C++ software module if you did n’t actually write it ?
Interviewer : How come ?
Stroustrup :
You are out of touch , are n’t you ?
Remember the typedef ?
Interviewer : Yes , of course ..
Stroustrup : Remember how long it took to grope through the header files only to find that ‘ RoofRaised ’ was a double precision number ?
Well , imagine how long it takes to find all the implicit typedefs in all the Classes in a major project .
Interviewer :
So how do you reckon you ’ve succeeded ?
Stroustrup : Remember the length of the average - sized ‘ C’ project ?
About 6 months .
Not nearly long enough for a guy with a wife and kids to earn enough to have a decent standard of living .
Take the same project , design it in C++ and what do you get ?
I ’ll tell you .
One to two years .
Is n’t that great ?
All that job security , just through one mistake of judgment .
And another thing .
The universities have n’t been teaching ‘ C ’ for such a long time , there ’s now a shortage of decent ‘ C’ programmers .
Especially those who know anything about Unix systems programming .
How many guys would know what to do with ‘ malloc ’ , when they ’ve used ‘ new ’ all these years — and never bothered to check the return code .
In fact , most C++ programmers throw away their return codes .
Whatever happened to good ol ’ ‘ - 1 ’?
At least you knew you had an error , without bogging the thing down in all that ‘ throw ’ ‘ catch ’ ‘ try ’ stuff .
Interviewer : But , surely , inheritance does save a lot of time ?
Stroustrup : Does it ?
Have you ever noticed the difference between a ‘ C ’ project plan , and a C++ project plan ?
The planning stage for a C++ project is three times as long .
Precisely to make sure that everything which should be inherited is , and what should n’t is n’t .
Then , they still get it wrong .
Whoever heard of memory leaks in a ‘ C’ program ?
Now finding them is a major industry .
Most companies give up , and send the product out , knowing it leaks like a sieve , simply to avoid the expense of tracking them all down .
Interviewer :
There are tools … Stroustrup : Most of which were written in C ++.
Interviewer :
If we publish this , you ’ll probably get lynched , you do realise that ?
Stroustrup : I doubt it .
As I said , C++ is way past its peak now , and no company in its right mind would start a C++ project without a pilot trial .
That should convince them that it ’s the road to disaster .
If not , they deserve all they get ..
You know , I tried to convince Dennis Ritchie to rewrite Unix in C ++..
Interviewer : Oh my God .
What did he say ?
Stroustrup :
Well , luckily , he has a good sense of humor .
I think both he and Brian figured out what I was doing , in the early days , but never let on .
He said he ’d help me write a C++ version of DOS , if I was interested ..
Interviewer : Were you ?
Stroustrup : Actually , I did write DOS in C++ , I ’ll give you a demo when we ’re through .
I have it running on a Sparc 20 in the computer room .
Goes like a rocket on 4 CPU ’s , and only takes up 70 megs of disk .
Interviewer :
What ’s it like on a PC ?
Stroustrup : Now you ’re kidding .
Have n’t you ever seen Windows ’ 95 ?
I think of that as my biggest success .
Nearly blew the game before I was ready , though ..
Interviewer :
You know , that idea of a Unix ++ has really got me thinking .
Somewhere out there , there ’s a guy going to try it .
Stroustrup : Not after they read this interview ..
Interviewer : I ’m sorry , but I do n’t see us being able to publish any of this .
Stroustrup :
But it ’s the story of the century .
I only want to be remembered by my fellow programmers , for what I ’ve done for them .
You know how much a C++ guy can get these days ?
Interviewer : Last I heard , a really top guy is worth $ 70 – $ 80 an hour .
Stroustrup : See ?
And I bet he earns it .
Keeping track of all the gotchas I put into C++ is no easy job .
And , as I said before , every C++ programmer feels bound by some mystic promise to use every damn element of the language on every project .
Actually , that really annoys me sometimes , eve .
I almost like the language after all this time .
Interviewer :
You mean you did n’t before ?
Stroustrup : Hated it .
It even looks clumsy , do n’t you agree ?
But when the book royalties started to come in … well , you get the picture .
Interviewer : Just a minute .
What about references ?
You must admit , you improved on ‘ C ’ pointers .
Stroustrup : Hmm .
I ’ve always wondered about that .
Originally , I thought I had .
Then , one day I was discussing this with a guy who ’d written C++ from the beginning .
He said he could never remember whether his variables were referenced or dereferenced , so he always used pointers .
He said the little asterisk always reminded him ..
Interviewer : Well , at this point , I usually say ‘ thank you very much ’ but it hardly seems adequate .
Stroustrup : Promise me you ’ll publish this .
My conscience is getting the better of me these days .
Interviewer : I ’ll let you know , but I think I know what my editor will say .
Stroustrup : Who ’d believe it anyway ?
Although , can you send me a copy of that tape ?
Interviewer : I can do that .
The “ leaked ” Stroustrup interview was just a bit of inventive fiction that satirized a number of topics familiar to programmers , but the parody hit so close to home that many readers did ( and still do ) mistake it as genuine .
The faux interview gained such widespread currency , in fact , that it prompted Computer to conduct a real interview with Dr. Stroustrup , which it published in its June 1998 issue prefaced with the following statement :
In Design and Evolution of C++ , Bjarne Stroustrup argued that “ a programming language is really a very tiny part of the world , and as such , it ought not be taken too seriously .
Keep a sense of proportion and most importantly keep a sense of humor .
Among major programming languages , C++ is the richest source of puns and jokes .
That is no accident . ”

For the past few months , a hoax interview between Stroustrup and Computer has been making the rounds in cyberspace .
While we regret the incident , it offers us a welcome opportunity to have the father of C++ share his insights on Standard C++ and software development in general .
We can also attest to his continued sense of proportion and humor — he suggests that the fictitious interview would have been a much funnier parody had he written it himself .

About a month ago the Jerusalem municipality decided to open a parking lot in the city , a normal affair anywhere in the world but tensions arose when they decided to open it on Saturday , the Jewish holy day , and allowed it to be open for business on Saturdays thereafter .
Ultra-Orthodox Jews , or Haredim took offense to this as a desecration to the holy day when observant Jews are not allowed to do any work including such things as turning on and off light switches .
Animosity between the city and the Haredim had already been high when the city arrested a Haredi woman who was accused of starving her child , a son of 4 who was only 15 pounds .
The case of the parking lot has gotten much attention in the media , with scenes of wailing , robed men in beards and big Russian hats yelling at Police and throwing stones at cars .
Anne Barker of ABC was asked to cover the riots and the demonstrations against the parking lot , but it seems she did not bargain for the kind of abuse and degradation she was about face .
In a harrowing account , Barker reports how she was verbally assaulted , showered with spit , and kicked by a mob of Haredi protesters ,
As a journalist I ’ve covered more than my share of protests .
Political protests in Canberra .
Unions protesting for better conditions .
Angry , loud protests against governments , or against perceived abuses of human rights .
I ’ve been at violent rallies in East Timor .
I ’ve had rocks and metal darts thrown my way .
I ’ve come up against riot police .
But I have to admit no protest – indeed no story in my career – has distressed me in the way I was distressed at a protest in Jerusalem on Saturday involving several hundred ultra-Orthodox Jews .
This particular protest has been going on for weeks .
Orthodox Jews are angry at the local council ’s decision to open a municipal carpark on Saturdays – or Shabbat , the day of rest for Jews .
It ’s a day when Jews are not supposed to do anything resembling work , which can include something as simple as flicking a switch , turning on a light or driving .
So even opening a simple carpark to accommodate the increasing number of tourists visiting Jerusalem ’s Old City is highly offensive to Orthodox Jews because it ’s seen as a desecration of the Shabbat , by encouraging people to drive .
I was aware that earlier protests had erupted into violence on previous weekends – Orthodox Jews throwing rocks at police , or setting rubbish bins alight , even throwing dirty nappies or rotting rubbish at anyone they perceive to be desecrating the Shabbat .
But I never expected their anger would be directed at me .
I was mindful I would need to dress conservatively and keep out of harm ’s way .
But I made my mistake when I parked the car and started walking towards the protest , not fully sure which street was which .
By the time I realised I ’d come up the wrong street it was too late .
I suddenly found myself in the thick of the protest – in the midst of hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews in their long coats and sable - fur hats .
They might be supremely religious , but their behaviour – to me – was far from charitable or benevolent .
As the protest became noisier and the crowd began yelling , I took my recorder and microphone out of my bag to record the sound .
Suddenly the crowd turned on me , screaming in my face .
Dozens of angry men began spitting on me .
Spit like rain
I found myself herded against a brick wall as they kept on spitting – on my face , my hair , my clothes , my arms .
It was like rain , coming at me from all directions – hitting my recorder , my bag , my shoes , even my glasses .
Big gobs of spit landed on me like heavy raindrops .
I could even smell it as it fell on my face .
Somewhere behind me – I did n’t see him – a man on a stairway either kicked me in the head or knocked something heavy against me .
I was n’t even sure why the mob was angry with me .
Was it because I was a journalist ?
Or a woman ?
Because I was n’t Jewish in an Orthodox area ?
Was I not dressed conservatively enough ?
In fact , I was later told , it was because using a tape - recorder is itself a desecration of the Shabbat even though I ’m not Jewish and do n’t observe the Sabbath .
It was lucky that I do n’t speak Yiddish .
At least I was spared the knowledge of whatever filth they were screaming at me .
As I tried to get away I found myself up against the line of riot police blocking the crowd from going any further .
Reassurance
Israeli police in their flak jackets and helmets , with rifles and shields , were yelling just as loudly back at the protesting crowd .
I found them something of a reassurance against the angry , spitting mob .
I was allowed through , away from the main protest , although there were still Orthodox Jews on the other side , some of whom also yelled at me , in English , to take my recorder away .
Normally I should have stayed on the sidelines to watch the protest develop .
But when you ’ve suffered the humiliation and degradation of being spat on so many times – and you ’re covered in other people ’s spit – it ’s not easy to put it to the back of your mind and get on with the job .
I left down a side street and walked the long way back to the car , struggling to hold back the tears .
The bill was expected to be ready when lawmakers returned next week .

“ Because of Senator Kennedy ’s recent passing , Senator Kerry ’s August hip surgery , and the intensive work on healthcare legislation particularly on the Finance Committee where Sen .
Kerry serves , Majority Leader Reid has agreed to provide some additional time to work on the final details of our bill , and to reach out to colleagues and important stakeholders , ” Sens. Boxer ( D - Calif . ) and Kerry ( D - Mass . ) said in a joint statement .
Boxer is the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , the panel that has primary jurisdiction over the bill .
Kerry has been a longtime proponent of capping carbon dioxide .
He has used his gavel as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to examine how rising global temperatures could destabilize certain regions .
Sen. Reid ( D - Nev. ) had asked the committees with oversight on climate - related issues to have bills ready by the end of September .
The delay announced by Boxer and Kerry could make it more difficult for Reid and other Democratic leaders to work out a compromise bill that can muster the 60 votes needed to proceed in the Senate by the end of the year .
“ They are working diligently to craft a well - balanced bill and Senator Reid fully expects the Senate to have ample time to consider this comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation before the end of the year , ” Reid spokesman Jim Manley said in a statement Monday .
Champagne producers agreed to pick 32 % fewer grapes this year , leaving billions of grapes to rot on the ground , in a move to counter fizzling bubbly sales around the world amid the economic downturn .
The result of the slashed harvest and other reductions will be a 44 % cut in the number of bottles produced this year by makers such as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA -- the world 's biggest Champagne producer .
It is one of the starkest signs yet of how cutbacks in consumer spending are affecting this segment of the luxury - goods market .
Grape growers and bottlers of the wine in the Champagne region of France have n't significantly cut the volume of usable grapes since 1955 , when a bumper harvest was reduced .
Champagne buyers " are definitely being more price oriented , " said Jill Pienta , assistant manager at Randolph Wine Cellars in Chicago .
She said some of her customers were switching to cheaper , non-Champagne sparkling wines , such as Pierre Delize Blanc de Blancs , priced at $ 8 a bottle .
Global Champagne sales are expected to drop to as low as 260 million bottles this year from a high of 339 million bottles in 2007 .
In 2008 , as the recession set in , sales slipped to 322 million bottles , the first decline since 2000 .

When Paris hosted the Exposition Universelle in 1900 , it unveiled its vision for the future of transport .
Below ground , the city ’s stylish new Metro made its debut , while above ground was something more avant garde .
The trottoir roulant was a moving walkway that circled the fair in a 3 - kilometre loop , its articulated wooden segments “ gliding around like a wooden serpent with its tail in its mouth ” , according to one reporter .
Nearly 7 million visitors hopped on .
A few even brought folding chairs , which proved useful when one woman gave birth in transit .
Her child was promptly christened Trottoir Roulant Benost .
A new kind of traveller had been born .
BY 1902 , New Yorkers had finally had enough of the rush - hour crush on the Brooklyn Bridge .
Mass transit lines converged at both sides of the East river , disgorging thousands of travellers onto already packed streetcars or teeming sidewalks .
It was a “ daily torture ” , wrote one disgruntled commuter .
For Bridge Commissioner Gustav Lindenthal there was an obvious solution : a high - speed moving walkway across the bridge .
The first moving walkway had been unveiled eight years earlier at the Chicago World ’s Fair and had proved a huge success at subsequent expositions in Berlin and Paris .
Chicago ’s walkway , the brainchild of engineer Max Schmidt , consisted of three rings , the first stationary , the second moving at 4 kilometres per hour and the third at 8 km/h , an arrangement that allowed walkers to adjust to each speed before moving to …
( CNN ) --
It has been 20 years since filmmaker Michael Moore took on General Motors in " Roger and Me . "
He 's still sticking it to big business for what he sees as the deliberate shafting of the little guy .
Filmmaker Michael Moore says Wall Street created a " invisible virtual casino " with people 's money .
His new film , " Capitalism : A Love Story , " opened Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles , California , and opens nationwide next week .
Moore talked with CNN's Larry King about whether capitalism is key to the American dream or the cause of an American nightmare .
The following is an edited version of the interview .
Larry King :
You describe this movie as the culmination of all the films you 've made .
Does that mean this is it ?
Michael Moore : No. I hope not .
It means that , for 20 years , as you said , I 've been doing this .
I started out by showing people what General Motors was up to and how this was a company that was making a lot of bad decisions and it was n't good for the company nor for the country .
That was 20 years ago .
And since then , I 've covered a number of issues and different things .
But it all seems to come back to this one issue of " follow the money . "
Who 's got the money ?
And whoever has the money has the power .
And right now , in America , tonight , Larry , the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined .
King :
You 're in that 1 percent , though ?
Moore : I do n't think I 'm in that 1 percent , but I make documentary films .
But I mean , obviously , I do well because my films have done well .
But , you know , even if I were , I think it 's my responsibility -- my moral duty that if I 've done well , that I have to make sure that everybody else .
King : Does well too or has a chance ?
Moore : Well , has at least a chance but that -- and that the pie is divided fairly amongst the people and not just a few people get the majority of the loot and everybody else has to struggle for the crumbs .
King :
Are you saying capitalism is a failure ?
Moore : Yes .
Capitalism .
Yes .
Well , I do n't have to say it .
Capitalism , in the last year , has proven that it 's failed .
All the basic tenets of what we 've talked about the free market , about free enterprise and competition just completely fell apart .
As soon as they lost , essentially , our money , they came running to the federal government for a bailout -- for welfare , for socialism .
And I thought the basic principle of capitalism was that it's a sink - or - swim situation .
And those who do well , the cream rises to the top and , you know , those who invest their money wrongly or , you know , do n't run their business the right way , then they do n't do well .
Watch Moore talk about corporate greed
And if you run your business the wrong way , where does it say that you or I or anybody watching this has to bail them out ?
I understand why everybody seemed to get behind it , because a lot of people were afraid , because these people down on Wall Street had taken our money and made bets with it .
I mean , they essentially created this invisible virtual casino with people 's money -- people 's pension funds , people 's 401 ( k ) s .
They took this money and they made bets .
And then they made bets on the bets .
And then they took out insurance policies on the bets .
And then they took out insurance against the insurance -- the credit default swaps .
King :
You started filming before Lehman Brothers went belly up .
Moore : Yes .
King :
The stock market tanked .
Now , how did the events , as it occurred , affect the movie ?
Did it change gears ?
Moore :
It did n't change in terms of what I was looking at , but it did , obviously , offer probably the best example of why this is a system that is really corrupt at its core -- corrupt because it does n't , it is n't run with democratic -- small " d " -- democratic principles .
There 's no democracy in our economy .
You and I and the people watching have no say in how this economy is run .
The upper 1 percent , the people down on Wall Street , the corporate executives , they 're the people that control this economy .
King :
And they do n't want to see the economy do well ?
They do n't want to see people ...
Moore :
Oh , they sure do .
King :
Do n't they want people to make money so they can buy the products ?
I mean it 's silly if they want people unemployed ?
Moore : Oddly enough , yes .
King : Why ?
Moore : I 'll tell you why .
Because your employees are your biggest expense .
And , as you 've noticed in the last few months , as the unemployment rate has gone up , so has the Dow Jones .
Now , you 'd think , you know , that Wall Street would respond with " Oh , my God , unemployment is going up , you know , this is bad for business . "
But the reality is , is that Wall Street likes that .
They like it when companies fire people because immediately the bottom line is going to show a larger profit .
King :
Are you saying the investor is more important than the employee ?
Moore : Yes .
The investor -- and the investor , these days , they want the short - term , quick profit and they want it now .
But in the long - term , here 's what happened .
When I was on this show 20 years ago , 20 years ago this week , I was here with " Roger and Me " .
King : I remember .
Moore : And General Motors , that year , made a profit of $ 4 billion .
And yet they had just laid off another 30,000 people .
Now , why would you lay people off when you 're making a record profit of $ 4 billion ?
I mean that was totally insane .
But they thought , well , you know , we can make a bigger profit .
Maybe we can make $ 4.2 billion if we move those jobs to Mexico .
And so they 're always , you know , we can make a little bit more money if we do this .
By firing those workers , Larry , they got rid of the very people who buy their cars .
All About Michael Moore
The title of this post is one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite movies – Fight Club .
The quote is from Tyler Durden , ( and without telling you too much in case you have n’t seen the movie ) who is anti-establishment and anti-consumerism … making it one of those movies that every person who feels the same should see just for his quotes alone !
I have quoted another line from the movie in my Money Quote Friday series a while back – “ You are not your khakis “ … so you can see what kind of guy he is – a lot like me in a lot of ways .
I guess that is why I identify with the movie so well , as I too do n’t believe that what you own or buy makes you who you are or can make you happy .
It ’s just stuff !
Even if you can pay cash for everything you own and not pay on credit , you still have to store , clean , move , maintain , repair , and replace your “ stuff ” eventually , so it gets you either / or both ways !
Tyler Durden
But back to the title of the post – “ Things you own end up owning you “ .
To me , this means that your stuff can own you in a few different ways , depending on your personal situation :
Your stuff can force you to live in a place you would prefer not to , just for a high - paying job .
Your stuff can make you keep a job you do n’t like , just for the money to pay the bills .
Your stuff can make you send your kids to a specific school , when maybe they would be better off at a different one .
Your stuff could make you pay for a storage facility or continuously move to bigger houses , just to keep a roof over it .
Your stuff could make you take on a second job just to impress your friends .
Your stuff could require you to work well into your retirement years .
Your stuff might cost so much every month that you cannot take your family on a vacation or send your kids to summer camp .
I could go on and on , but I think you get the gist of it , right ?
Even if you have the money to buy something in the first place , guess where that money normally comes from ?
Work .
And the more stuff you have , the more money you need to make and / or continue to make to support your lifestyle .
I am not innocent of this behavior ; far from it .
I used to live high on the hog too , even though it was a lifestyle built on a pyramid of debt and minimum payments just waiting to collapse .
And now , even though I make way more than I did when I was 25 years old , I spend less – on housing , on cars , on clothes , on stereo equipment , on my entire lifestyle .
I have a nice place to live , I have a car to drive , I have clothes on my back , and I have food on the table .
No need for much more , especially since it allows me to work for myself in a small , remote mountain town .
But because of the changes , I do still have a little extra money to take vacations or make special purchases when I need to without going into debt .
I learned from my mistakes , and I am hopeful that my mistakes can help you learn too before your stuff ends up owning you like it did me .
After all , it ’s just stuff – and this is life we are talking about .
You get one shot – do it right .
It took me years to figure that out … hope you get it faster than I did !

To protect the depositors , the FDIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with First Citizens Bank and Trust Company , Inc. , Columbia , South Carolina , to assume all of the deposits of Georgian Bank .
The five branches of Georgian Bank will reopen on Monday as branches of First Citizens Bank .
Depositors of Georgian Bank will automatically become depositors of First Citizens Bank .
Deposits will continue to be insured by the FDIC , so there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance coverage .

This evening and over the weekend , depositors of Georgian Bank can access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards .
Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed .
Loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual .

In addition to assuming all of the deposits of the failed bank , First Citizens Bank agreed to purchase essentially all of the assets .
The FDIC and First Citizens Bank entered into a loss - share transaction on approximately $ 2 billion of Georgian Bank 's assets .
First Citizens
Bank will share in the losses on the asset pools covered under the loss - share agreement .
The loss - sharing arrangement is projected to maximize returns on the assets covered by keeping them in the private sector .
The agreement also is expected to minimize disruptions for loan customers .

The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) will be $ 892 million .
First Citizens
Bank 's acquisition of all the deposits was the " least costly " resolution for the FDIC 's DIF compared to alternatives .
Georgian Bank is the 95th FDIC - insured institution to fail in the nation this year , and the nineteenth in Georgia .
The last FDIC - insured institution closed in the state was First Coweta , Newnan , on August 21 , 2009 .
# # #
Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 to restore public confidence in the nation 's banking system .
The FDIC insures deposits at the nation 's 8,195 banks and savings associations and it promotes the safety and soundness of these institutions by identifying , monitoring and addressing risks to which they are exposed .
The FDIC receives no federal tax dollars – insured financial institutions fund its operations .
FDIC press releases and other information are available on the Internet at www.fdic.gov, by subscription electronically ( go to www.fdic.gov/about/subscriptions/index.html) and may also be obtained through the FDIC's Public Information Center ( 877-275-3342 or 703-562-2200 ) .

I recently submitted a post compiling a dirty A2M List .
However the purpose of that post was strictly to compile a list for fans of the genre , not to justify Dirty A2 M or have a debate with those who dislike it .
In order to divert that inevitable “ debate ” from my sacred list project ( and because I ’m genuinely interested in the debate ) , I am posting this separate defense of Dirty A2M .
I ’ve done my best to address all the objections I ’ve ever heard to the genre .
See if you agree or disagree .
Ass to Mouth has become really popular lately , and I must admit I am a fan .
But it has always sort of perplexed me why nearly all A2 M is clean , how directors cut out any dirty misshaps that occur from their final videos , and how porn stars even boast about how they take massive enemas before hand , etc .
Is n't the whole point of A2 M that it
is ( or could be ) dirty ?
Here ’s the major objections I ’ve heard to Dirty ( or shall we simply say , No Enema ) Ass to Mouth .
1 ) “ I like Ass to Mouth , but seeing any brown stuff grosses me out . ”
This is the most common , but also the most perplexing objection to A2M .
Of course everyone is entitled to their tastes .
However , what is the stimulation of Ass to Mouth if it is n't dirtyness ( or at least the possibility thereof ) ?
I ca n’t think of any reason other than “ potential dirtyness ” for having so many videos devoted directly to the act of pulling a cock out of a girls mouth and directly into her ( or another girl ’s ) mouth .
Can you ?
2 ) “ Dirty Ass to Mouth is not sexual , its like a shoe fetish ”
All porn ( especially anything in the Anal Genre ) has some element of “ Fetishness ” to it .
Generally , the distinction that is made between true hardcore fetish and just deviant sex is that true fetish is more focused on the fetishistic act ( ie .
Tieing someone up , or whipping them , or worshiping their feet , etc. ) than on the actual sex .
In contrast , Extreme or deviant sex is focused on sex , but just in its more extreme forms or combinations .
Many European Scat videos ( Sperrgebeit , Tatort Toilet , Grau Zone , SG , X Models , etc. )
undoubtedly fall into the fetish category because they do n’t contain sex , or at least not very much and not as the center of the action .
Dirty ATM by contrast would feature rough and tumble anal as its focus and core , and the dirtyness would be but one feature .
I think this distinction is the reason than many Dirty A2 M fans find Euro Scat stuff rather boring .
It just is n’t sexual in the least .
Incidentally , this also answers the oft - cited slippery slope conundrum , ( i.e. “ if we allow dirty A2 M then we ’ll soon be overwhelmed with hardcore scat , snuff films , etc. ) .
This is ludicrous , those things are non-sexual and fetishistic by their very nature , Dirty A2 M is not .
Thus the audiences that would be attracted to them are entirely different .
3 ) “ Dirty A2 M is degrading towards the porn starlets who would do it . ”
This is essentially nonsense .
I do n’t say this because I believe porn can never be degrading .
Quite to the contrary , I think its possible to take a perfectly defensible decision that all porn ( sex for money ) is inherently degrading to who -ever is taking the money .
However , once you reject this argument , and come to the conclusion that sex between two consenting adults is not degrading ( even if it is 4 women and one man , or all anal , or “ rough , ” or featuring A2M ) then I do n’t see how you can distinguish dirty A2 M from this conclusion .
Dirty A2 M is no more degrading than any of the other “ extreme ” forms of porn that we regularly see in video store .
4 ) “ There are n’t any girls out there who would do it dirty A2 M ” Well , I suppose I should let the porn starlets themselves answer this one .
However , history seems to indicate that there are indeed people willing to do this .
25 Years ago , Anal was virtually unheard of and few self - respecting starlets would do it ( because the market did n’t ask them to ) .
10 Years ago A2M was unheard of and nobody would do it ( because they could get no significant premium for it ) .
5 ( or even 2 ) years ago things like double anal , squirting , and drinking cum out of ass holes was virtually unheard of .
Now there are lots of titles devoted to it .
My point is just that if there is enough demand , and if , therefore , porn producers are willing to offer a high enough salary , then I suspect that many of the hottest starlets in the business ( present or up - and - coming ) would not hesitate to do Dirty A2M .
5 ) “ Dirty A2 M is Illegal in the USA , anyone who produced it would be prosecuted . ”
This is a debatable point considering that movies like Assault That Ass 1 feature it prominently .
However , let ’s assume for a second that a movie specifically titled “ Shit Sucking Ass To Mouth Whores : Every Dick is Brown ” might get the fed ’s attention .
I see two ways around this problem .
The first is to include the dirty A2 M in less noticeable sections like DVD out - takes , hidden sections , and websites ( outlined in a previous post .
The second , and more interesting option however , would be to include videos that do n’t promise “ dirtyness ” so much as “ Naturalness . ”
Code words could include No Enema A2M , No Cuts A2 M , etc .
See more on this below .
6 ) “ There ’s no large market for Dirty A2 M , just look at the Scat Fetish in Europe , it only occupies a minor niche . ”
I think I ’ve already pretty much dealt with this issue .
But here ’s a summary .
1 ) Euro Scat stuff is actually pretty popular in Europe .
2 ) Regardless of its popularity , it is a rather non-sexual fetish , whereas Dirty A2 M focuses on real sex so it has a much wider mainstream appeal .
The A2 M titles do really well in the USA .
Their only attraction is the “ dirtyness factor . ”
People buy them hoping to get lucky by seeing an “ accident . ” ‘ nuff said .
7 ) “ It would be too expensive to produce this stuff ”
I doubt it , but even if it was anal accidents happen often enough that one could easily make money producing a compilation of what already exists in the archives of the major studios .
Although I personally am a big fan of A2M , I do n’t fool myself into thinking that American studios will get there overnight .
In all likellyhood , some of the more extreme producers will “ evolve ” there over the next few years by producing videos that highlight the " dirtyness " element without actually showing anything brown I could think of a variety of video categories / themes like this :
1 ) No Enema ATM
( Girl swears she did n't take an enema for atleast 48
hours before the scene )
2 ) ATM with really long anal toys ( REALLY LONG thai anal beads for instance ) , I think there was one Rocco scene long ago that did this .
3 ) Straight off the toilet A2M .
4 ) Straight off the toilet analingus ( human toilet paper theme )
5 ) A variation on # 3&4 , no wipe A2M .
Girl craps , does n’t wipe .
Or Guy Craps , does n’t wipe .
The list could go on and on .
The point is , none of these scenes would
need to show actual brown , and frankly they could probably even be
faked pretty easily .
But since they would be insinuating that there
was a higher likelyhood that the girl was sucking shit , they would be
much more popular than the " clean " ATM that is produced today .
Of all of them , I suspect that the “ No Enema ” genre has the most potential .
I could imagine a title like “ No Enema Anal : The way nature intended it . ”
I ’ve always thought that a cute opening for something like this would be the guys taking the girls out to a restaurant before the shoot , and as they drive down a strip the guys are like , “ what do you want ?
Chinese , Indian , Italian , Hamburgers ?
Think carefully because you ’ll be tasting it twice . ”
At any rate , I ’ve said my piece , now you are all free to condemn me as a pervert or hale me as a prophet ( or just ignore me ) .

Me , just show me people who are enthusiastic about fucking , and I 'm good .
I just think most people who are in porn for the long haul would be too concerned about their hygiene .
Especially , now .

I 'm doubting that 98 % of the girls would agree ahead of time , and most scenes I 've seen where it was obvious , even some of the nastiest girls in the business have refused the chunky chocolate nougat .

Smartycookie2 wrote : You make a good point Skronker .
Here 's what I do n't get .
There are girls who readily agree to drink cum out of their ass holes , get three dicks stuck up their ass at the same time ( ouch ! ) , have thirty men fuck their ass one after another ( double ouch ! ) , have other girls puke in their mouths ( summer Luv and catalina come to mind ) , and , most particularly , have guys pee in their mouths and then swallowing it ( Extreme Associates ( website ) and Max Hardcore did this a lot ) .
You probably know the porn business better then me Skronker , but do you really think that there is much difference in the " gross out " factor between swallowing someone elses piss and sucking a cock that 's brown from your own ass ?
And is there a big hygene ( or disease risk ) difference between eating the cum of five guys out of your friend 's ass ( see Red Light District ) and sucking a single cock that is slightly dirty from your own ass ?
I guess I just do n't see how these things are different .
Even if you do perceive a difference , what do you think about my " dirty but not always brown " prediction of No Enema A2 M as the wave of the future ?
This would seem to be a nice middle road of pushing the envelope without risking prosecution , etc .

I think there 's a difference between watersports and recycling Shoney 's buffet favorites .
There 's probably hours of BTS footage of messy anal accidents already on tape that someone could compile .
I just doubt there is enough of a market for it or you would already see it .
There must be a website somewhere with this , though .

Hey dude , I am totally in agreement with you , I am freaking bored with clinically clean anal sex and atm .
I mean what the hell is the point of atm if the cock is totally clean and sanitized ?
lol .
Honestly porn doesnt really interest me that much anymore because its all the same .
How many times can you watch some chick get fucked in the ass and do atm ?
It gets really redundant .
The shit that turns me on in videos is the unexpected .
Like the outakes to Give me Gape , that was fucking awesome .
Dirty a 2 m I hope is the next thing .
Jewel De Nyle did this already in the latest Rocco Animal Trainer .
Hopefully more will follow .
I would even settle for just dirty ass fucking .
Anyways I am only on my lunch break from work , I will reply more when I get back !
I will try to ad some dirty anal scenes I know of as well !

Oh yeah , lets not forget the other reason why dirty a 2 m is not going to take off ......... because we 're talking about eating shit here people !
I have no doubt that there are some people that if you pay them enough they 'll eat shit off of a plate .
I have no doubt that these people are totally fucked in the head too .
This is 'nt an issue of being prudish .
This is an issue of sanity , cleanliness , and frankly not demeaning someone by asking them to do something that is morally repugnant .
Let 's be honest , would you want to eat shit ?
I know I sure as hell would 'nt want to , and I would never ask someone else to do it either .
Scat , and anything associated with it , is simply the most disgusting fetish I 've ever heard of .
I 've never been an advocate of outlawing any form of adult porn , but this is the most compelling argument for government intervention I 've ever seen .

I have another thread out there that is compiling a Dirty A2 M list .
Its called " List of Dirty Anal & Dirty A2M Scenes . "
Please do post to it with all the scenes you know of .
It will prove a resource to us all .

But here ’s a summary .
1 ) Euro Scat stuff is actually pretty popular in Europe .
Believe me , Scat IS a really small niche .
At my local videostore - rather big with about 8000 dvds - there might be as much as +/- 25 dvds with scat fetish content .
And these DVDs seem to be never rent .
They are placed in the darkest corner of the shop .
I wonder , if any one rented them at all .
The same with GGG dvds , these DVDs arent as popular as you Americans think .
How come ?
Become they are crap .
The production quality - compared to US porn - is way below standard .
The girls are ugly , the guys are .
too .
Cutting is crappy and sex is weak .
Thats how it is !
So , do n't tell me scat movies are popular here .
The only reason they exist , is because it is allowed to make them .
Their sheer existence , has nothing to do with a large demand .
I 've never seen a scat movie myself , it 's disgusting .
And thats how most Germans raincoaters think of it .

Anyway , a little dirtyness , when it comes to A2 M , would be okay , i say .
But instead of A2 m , i prefer still gapes and anal toy games .

Gapes and asses are nature 's most precious gift !

Scat , and anything associated with it , is simply the most disgusting fetish I 've ever heard of .
I 've never been an advocate of outlawing any form of adult porn , but this is the most compelling argument for government intervention I 've ever seen .

Scat play , although not of much interest to me , seems mild and friendly by comparison .

For me , seeing a girl get her face slapped , or get a penis forcibly jammed in her throat until she vomits produces exactly the reaction you describe , yet that is legal and apparently very popular in the US .

Playing with and EATING shit is disgusting .
I say anyone into that fetish is more turned on by humiliation , manipulation , degradation and inflicting pain .
A person needs to be introspective and seriously wonder " why am I turned on by this ? "
I 'd suggest doing that while talking to a Psychiatrist .

With no offense intended to any of you , let me simply say that the majority of the posts so far have been rather unenlightening .
You are perfectly free to disagree with what I say , but please try to do it in an interesting , factually correct , and internally consistant way .
Here 's a few clarifications to get us back on the right track .
The first " Fact " on which my post is based is that Ass to Mouth is extremely popular in American movies .
It is rapidly gaining in acceptance , and nearly every American anal studio now produces it .
Now , your reaction to this fact could be , " I think Ass to Mouth is disgusting because of the dirtyness factor ( and I also think anal in general is rather disgusting for the same reason ) . "
If this is your reaction , then good for you , you are being internally consistant and you have every right to your opinions .
HOWEVER , based on what titles are the most popular , I assume that most of you will instead have the reaction , " Yes I like Anal and especially Ass to Mouth . "
If this is your answer , then another question immediatly pops up .
Why do you like anal ?
And why do you like Ass to Mouth scenes ?
Think about the first time you saw something like this , what was your reaction ?
In all likelyhood , it was something like " Holy Sh-t , I can't believe this girl is doing something like this . "
The possibility that the dick was coming out of an ass presented the obvious implication that it might be " dirty " and the fact that a girl was willing to suck it emphasized her " sluttiness " and made the whole scene all the more arousing .
So the potential dirtyness and the willingness of the girl to accept this were the main things that proved very attractive .
Now here 's a few more facts .
First , no matter how many enemas you take , your ass is never entirely devoid of fecal matter .
It may be so little that it can't be seen , but its still there , and thus A2 M is already , to a slight degree , Dirty , ( and I suspect that 's the attraction of it ) .
Additionally , other than transmitting germs ( similar to saliva ) and a few potential STD's ( Similar to cum and pussy secretions ) , there is nothing particularly dangerous about fecal matter .
In fact , thanks to you bone heads who do n't wash your hands after taking a crap , we live surrounded by fecal matter every day .
Did you know that 8 % of dollar bills have fecal matter on them , the 80 % of the door handles in public bathrooms have fecal matter ?
At any rate , my point is just that its not particularly harmful other than spreading the same germs that any other body fluid would also spread .
So now let 's return to Ass to Mouth .
I 've submitted the idea that the only possible attraction of it is the potential " Dirtyness . "
If you are a fan of " clean " A2 M but dislike " Dirty " A2 M , then please try to disprove me , what is your " clean " attraction to it ?
If you can't think of any , then you are already on the slippery slope .
If you like A2 M with fully enema'd butt - holes , how would you feel about A2 M with butt - holed that had n't been enema'd ?
In all likelyhood one would still not be able to see any dirtyness in many of these scenes , but statistically it would be likely that there would be a higher amount of gunk inside the butt , and thus the supposed " sluttiness " of the girl to be willing to suck it , would have to be even higher .
If " No Enema A2 M , might be OK , then how about if it might be possible to see some brown stuff on the guy 's dick in some of these scenes , just in the natural course of business .
Its really just a difference in degree from our earlier examples , and since the perceived sluttiness factor ( and thus attractiveness ) of the girl moves in lock step with the " crazy stuff " she 's willing to do , it makes since that some brown A2 M would be interesting to watch .
Yes your first reaction might be , " this is disgusting , I can't believe she 's doing this , " but you would also find yourself strangely attracted to it .
I remember having this reaction the first time I ever watched anal , many years ago .
It seemed disgusting , but also strangely attractive exectly for its very disgustingness .
Slowly it changed from disgusting and attractive to simply attractive , and so I ( and the porn industry ) have never looked back .
Its just a natural evolution .
Let me also simply end by saying that what I am advocating is not the " scat " that some of you say .
I 'm sure most of you have seen videos or pictures ( at least on the internet ) of ugly German women like Veronica Moser with their mouths full of crap .
I find this just as disgusting as you .
Why ?
Because its not sexual , not in the least .
And there is also the factor that its totally staged .
I think there is a certain fun element to saying to the girls , do n't take an enema , we 'll see what happens .
Or simply including the anal accidents when they happen instead of cutting them out .
That makes it more natural .
Or at least as natural as porn sex ever gets .
At any rate , that 's my two cents .

" Dangers of Exposure :
The greatest danger of exposure to fecal matter is the possibility of it entering your mouth and then getting into your digestive system .
While most people would never knowingly ingest this matter , not using proper hygiene after contact with fecal matter or sewage can create a path for microorganisms to enter .
Hand - to - mouth exposure to fecal matter can cause illnesses such as salmonellosis and hepatitis A. Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease whose symptoms include abdominal pain , diarrhea , nausea , and somtimes vomiting .
Hepatatis A symptoms include fever , malaise , anorexia , nausea , and abdominal discomfort , followed within a few days by jaundice .
It can be a mild illness lasting 1 – 2 weeks or a disabling disease lasting several months .
The possibility of contracting life - threatening diseases such as hepatitis B or AIDS is ex-tremely remote as neither hepatitis B nor HIV can be transmitted by the fecal - oral route . "

A few points .
1 ) These are dangers of eating someone else 's brown - ness .
2 ) These dangers are already present in current A2M .

This dvd was sick , they were groups of quite pretty girls in a garden and they were shitting in each others mouths , pissing in glasses and all drinking ..
Gross ..

i feel that your argument is purely argumentative and essentially futile as you 're are trying to reconcile what is essentially an emotional reaction with the rationale behind it .
as a general rule , the 2 are not reconcilable .
but as i am an argumentative person myself , i will try to reply to your questions .
right off the bat i will ignore any arguments over why this is not a good idea from a legal or health viewpoints .
if health was an issue then no porn should be allowed as despite everybody 's best efforts documented aids cases exist .
as far as the law goes , things are either allowed or not .
whether the law makes sense is another discussion altogether .

If you can't think of any , then you are already on the slippery slope .
the " slippery slope " combines with " excluded middle " ( " if you are not with us you are against us " ) are 2 typical tactics used in arguments and rhetorics .
for example " if legalise alcohol soon we will have to legalise heroin " .
the same way there is a range of possibilities between alcohol and heroin there is between liking anal / oral sex to a 2 m to da2 m and they are all equally valid positions .

I seriously doubt " dirty ass - to - mouth " circus acts will become the wave of the future simply because there just are n't very many women willing to do something like this .
Besides , John Ashcroft and his anti-porn gestapo would most certainly pounce all over anyone who attempts to produce such a concept .
Accidents involving leakage of feces is bound to happen during anal sex but when it becomes the focal point of the scene , it obviously takes it to another level that I 'm sure many do n't wanna cross .
Its just human nature NOT to want to play with excrement , let alone get it any where near one 's mouth .
Human waste not only has repulsive stench but it can also carry harmful viruses and bacteria , not to mention parasites .
Simply put , shit was made to be flushed down the toilet and thats where it belongs .

OK , if I may , let me redirect things a bit .
What 's apparent so far is that some of us think dirty A2 M would be hot and some of us think it would n't be .
There are also a bunch of people who are writing in about how they think hardcore scat films would be disgusting .
I agree , personally , but it is ( as some people have pointed out ) really a personal taste thing .
So instead of rejecting a discussion of personal taste in favor of vain attempts at hyper- rationality , let 's embrace it for a second to see if we can detect a discernable dividing line between " hot " and " disgusting "
So , which category ( hot or disgusting ) would the following video titles fall into ?
( imagine your favorite anal porn star doing this ) .
1 ) No enema ass to mouth sex .
This would n't have to have any brown - ness at all .
It would just be a natural production of anal sex as it has gone on for thousands of years ( before ladies started flushing themselves out with gallons of fleet enemas ) .
They 'd just show whatever happened , but in most cases there would n't be any brownness whatsoever .
2 ) Leaving Anal Accidents in films ( or including them in out - takes sections ) .
( Or , lets say compiling them into a video release ) .
In this scenareo things would n't be staged , but if it happened , it would n't be cut .
If it happened , why not see it ?
Would these really be so disgusting ?

Its not a question if we as porn fans find dirty A2 M 's appealing or repulsive , its whether most porn babes would even consider doing something like this in the first place .
Granted , there have been mishaps involving fecal leakage with many of today 's popular starlets but for the most part that 's all they were : accidents .
And as I said in my last post , if any legitimate porn producer even tried making a series based on dirty A2 M action here in the US , I 'm almost positive the DOJ would go after them on obscenity charges so this is basically a moot point .

I 'm quite sure i'm devoid of this interest , as I 'm still bereaveing the loss , of the gloriously gifted Julie Silver from my " go list "
due to a brief run in , with what merely appeared to be the tail end of the dreaded detriment .
Though a long confirmed anal fanatic , A2 M is a act that somhow loses the direct association of exactly what it is , and where it originates .
What I mean is , it simply fails to draw the reactionary boost , a more visually direct act delivers , such as the visual effect of swallowing cum .
Although an undertaking whereby she closes her mouth to gulp it down , the eyes " see " the pool of cum , then the ears concurrently , " hear " the gulp , enough so , that the intuitive connection is made , engaging the stimulus .
The other hurdle , is that as a porn enthusiast , Its now witnessed on film , more and more frequently , without ever seeing , nor actually taking the noxious risk .
Missing this dynamic , the sensory mind naturally loses whatever response , if any , it would have originally drawn .
Unless someone actively practiced this nefarious maneuver , to support the relationship in the subconscious , theres nothing to reinforce or maintain the stimulus .
Which reminds me .
I think its time to see if the ol lady , will reinforce some cum swallowing stimulus .

Do you guys really think that there are n't any girls out there who would do Au Naturale ( no Enema ) Ass to Mouth if offered the right sort of compensation package ?
I find that pretty hard to believe .
If there are girls who are willing to eat the cum of six guys strait out of their asses , there are certainly some who would do No Enema A2M .

Ok guys have been reading your forums for the last few weeks , was not going to comment , as I would rather speak with my material ( website ) rather than dialogue , however the serious lack of testosterone in this thread is starting to make me think some of you guys are taking yourselves way to serious here ..!
Firstly if your balls are that small that your afraid of a little dirt ... you should probably stick to rub n tug porn that 's about as clean as you 'll get , makes me wonder if any of you have had sex with a girl in that time of the month ?
most girls i've come across love to indulge should their man not be afraid to get dirty
Secondly , stop analysing the finer details you could get blood out of a stone if you really analysed things think about that !
Anyhow enough of that and on to the thread , the deed is done and I agree with smart cookie ( and many many others ) that it is sexy indeed , seeing a girl that will still go to great lengths ( literally ) to please a man orally straight from the " a " and with no inhibition
For you bio paranoid types worried about the transmission of disease , it 's the girls dirt , remember any thing that she is going to catch she already has so get over it , oh and I never force a girl to swallow after dirty A2 M , and though I do appreciate their brown tongue poking out as I cum on it I am happy for them to gargle some mouth wash afterwards ?
Now A 2 other girls mouth perhaps you have some weight in your argument
So where are we now ?
Some of my background on this : I am 29 , my first gf was 16 when she was introduced to anal and she was dirty 100 % of the time we did it ( admittedly it was after a night on the piss ) however call me a convert but my initial impressions were oh god my sisters bed spread ... and oh gee what is she going to think when she sees what I can see , and I also had the dilemma that I thought anal was always dirty because of this girl , however I was to learn later on that most girls are not dirty all the time , and one was actually clean all the time ( but she consumed like 100 calories per day )
I soon realised the eye is with the beholder and should a man feel uncomfortable , the woman 's emotions are sure to follow also ... should a man have balls and get on with it and enjoy it ?
sure I was surprised to learn that nearly all women were fine with the dirt , just a little encouragement needed to sooth a few doubts in their minds goes without saying
So since my first gf I realised this and continued to convince my girls into trying anal , I also did a little research and began to teach them how to cum and enjoy it in many instances more than a regular cum
For the record : anal when done on a woman 's back is the most relaxing for them and the easiest to accommodate you I have tried this with success with at least 10 different women , and never failed .
Once you 're in , come in close and hold them , do not move until you give them time to accept it .
once they are loosened up you can start to work them , your pelvis will rub their clit naturally during it and bring them to their first anal orgasm and they will have no probs about doing it with you again
But for the record , I prefer doggy I can a ) see their ass spreading as my hardon slides up the center , and b ) smell the potent scent of anal sex rising up to my nose as i work them , scent is arousing I do n't care if ur disgusted where a fucking nose plug if u can't stand it
** anyone for anal porn minus all the smoke screens and mirrors ?**
Having been blessed with a large erection ( 8 1/2 ) and a reasonably good camera eye I am in the process of compiling a messy anal website and I am not talking a trickle of chocolate sauce at the end ( giggle is that really the best you people can find ) I am talking about my shaft being covered in it like it has been around 50 % of the anal encounters i've had with women , perhaps 30 out of the 60 women I have had anal sex with have been dirty , some just the head of my erection is brown , others there is a good skid mark or thickness enveloping it all the way down to my balls however the latter is somewhat more rare and requires a women to be a ) within an hour or two of a needing the bathroom b ) an extremely fast metabolism .
Nothing creates a situation for messy anal more than a woman who eats a lot , however do n't be tricked into thinking a BBW is perfect for you , because they might have a slow metabolism which means your likely to have a clean anal session , your odds go up by 200 % if you get with someone that eats regular meals and does n't diet by starving themselves , so ?
look for a sporty type , netballers , runners , cyclists , typically lean and hi energy expenditure , eat alot , expend alot , common sense prevails
So apart from handing out suspect cards to lean women on train stations among other recruitment methods I am in the process of get a website and merchant up and running , I currently have two hours of decent footage recorded recorded on a panasonic AG - HVX200 , however it is unlikely that I will be releasing any of this independent of the website launch
Feel free to contact me with suggestions or donations , currently my preferred theme is POV doggy style , skirt lifted up from the back and plenty of lighting but this may change upon request for future recording .
Oh and lastly this wont be a cheap site be prepared to go without dinner for a few nights to get yourself a subscription :)
I 'm sure you consider this a worthwhile trade off

It 's 9 pm .
Jennifer is sitting in her living room in Washington DC .
She 's watching television .
She 's been sitting there for an hour .
Occasionally she shifts position slightly , tucking her legs under , stretching out .
Maybe someone will call later on , perhaps her boyfriend , if you stick around .
Three thousand miles away in London it is 2 am .
Rob is lying in bed , sleeping .
It 's dark but you can just see his head sticking out of the duvet .
Now and then he turns over .
In another seven hours he 'll probably get up , if you can wait that long ...
One year after it found a mass audience in America , webcam TV is hitting Britain , and people are switching off the television and turning on the computer to log on to complete strangers ' lives , filmed in real time in intimate , often mundane detail .
Webcams are tiny cameras , the size of golfballs , which you plug into the back of your computer .
Then , if you have an Internet connection , you can beam the images captured on your camera to the whole world .
The cameras and software now cost less than pounds 100 , and are soaring in popularity .
At the moment the cameras only take snapshots , every 10 , 30 or 60 seconds , so what you see when you log on to an Internet webcam site is a picture which jumpily updates , rather like closed - circuit television .
But already more sophisticated technology is becoming available , with live " streaming " images and sound .
" Personal webcams " are the major growth area ( see box , page 42 ) , and in America , where the medium is well established , certain sites enjoy enormous followings , with hundreds of thousands of viewers tuning in every day like they would to a soap opera , catching up on the lives of people they feel they know intimately .

In Britain the development of personal webcams is both similar to what happened in the States , and radically different .
At the moment most sites are amateur and experimental , and the " cammers " are often computer hobbyists trying out the latest gadget .
Typically most sites are run by men , reflecting men's massively greater use of the Internet .
But the most popular sites are the small number run by women , since most Internet surfers seem to be men in search of vicarious sexual thrills .
This disparity between supply and demand is also leading to a phenomenon well established in the States , the commercial webcam sites which purport to show the real lives of women but which are essentially credit - card operated peepshows .
Babe TV , a British pay webcam site , claims to offer an insight into the " intimate " life of 25 - year - old Kelly , who lives in a flat in Knightsbridge and works in publishing .
Kelly 's hobbies are " shopping , more shopping , clubbing , my career and showing off ! "
The site is said to be getting 500,000 visitors , or " hits " , a day .
The radical difference between Britain and America , however , is that Americans have the luxury of free local calls .
This means that they do n't pay to be on the Internet , which is essentially like being on the phone with pictures .
Because of the free calls , in America many webcam sites are " 24 - 7 " , that is , the cameras stay on all the time .
In Britain , with the occasional exception , this would simply be too expensive , without turning into a pay site , and the joy of British webcams at the moment is that they are largely free , largely amateur , and provide a fascinating and intriguing snapshot of a developing medium .
Twenty - five - year - old Colin Surrey has been mad on computers since he was a teenager .
His first was a Sinclair Spectrum .
After going to college in Sheffield , where he studied information technology , he returned to the family home , a large semi near Europe 's newest and biggest out - of - town shopping centre , Trafford Park in Lancashire .
He now works as a communications analyst .
On the day I visit him the house is overflowing with relatives there to celebrate his sister 's combined 21st birthday and engagement party .
Half of the front bay window is taken up with a poster for the Church of England 's new Alpha advertising campaign - Colin 's mother is a lay preacher and training to be a priest .
We huddle in a box bedroom where Colin keeps his home computer .
He is wary of being labelled as a sad , single computer geek , yet his enthusiasm for computers is almost palpable .
He first got on to the Internet in 1994 when he was at college .
He admits to being a " bit of an Internet addict " .
Before he got on to the webcam , he had already set up his own " page " or site , known as Wookie 's Lair , in which he indulged his passion for Manchester City and science fiction , providing information , downloadable samples of TV programmes and City goals , and links to related sites .
Wookie is his online identity .
" The name Wookie came from Star Wars .
Chewbacca was a Wookie .
In the early days of the Internet I used to go into chatrooms and an integral part of it is having a user name , and I used to sign myself in as The Wookie and now people all across the globe know me as that . "
Chatrooms are exactly what the term suggests , virtual rooms in which people chat , except they do n't speak , they use their keyboard and have a whole shorthand vocabulary to speed things up .
Some , but not all , chatrooms , are used as a way of meeting potential partners .
The Wookie Cam was a development of his using chatrooms .
Instead of just tapping away blind at a keyboard , he could direct people to his cam so that they could see what he looked like .
Although he says it started off as " a bit of a joke " , he now has one camera at home and another at work , so that he can be observed throughout his waking day .
" On a good day I 'll probably take 200 hits , on a bad day 60 or 70 , " he says .
" I do n't know if it 's because people are n't interested or it 's just a bad day .
The girl sites get 20,000 hits a day .
Male cams are not half as popular .
The average Internet user is a red - blooded male and he 's happier searching for women taking their clothes off rather than looking at someone like me staring at a monitor . "
Although not an active churchgoer himself , he is a Christian and is keen to distance himself from this sleazier end of the Internet .
He would certainly never appear naked , or semi-naked on camera .
However , it is also obvious there is a certain exhibitionist thrill .
" I do get messages saying , let 's see more of you - it tends to be women in their thirties .
The majority of calls are from blokes , asking me about the technology , but if I please some housewives into the bargain then that 's fine .
I would n't regard myself as an exhibitionist , but there is a kind of buzz once you 've been on camera and you know there are people out there and they are interested in you .
When someone sends you a message , you think , great , there are people who like you . "
Chris James runs Britain 's most popular male cam , CJ - UK .
Chris is 37 and lives in a leafy suburb of Nottingham with his boyfriend , Ady .
He works in support services for a large European retail group .
He believes chatting without seeing someone gives you a much better insight into their characters .
He met his previous boyfriend , Brian , a PhD student in clinical psychology at Florida University , in an Internet chatroom .
" You do n't judge them based on how they look , " he says .
" I did n't know what Brian looked like for six or seven weeks , but I got to know the real person through what he wrote , and then we spoke on the phone and then finally we got to know what each other looked like , which was a pleasant surprise . "
The long - distance relationship ended in February .
It had lasted a year , with Chris visiting Brian three times , and Brian visiting Chris once .
The other way they kept in touch was through the Internet .
Chris set up his own page on which the two could chat privately and because Internet use is charged at local call rates it was also much cheaper than phoning .
Keeping the relationship alive was also why he got the webcam , so Brian could see him while they talked .
Brian was also supposed to get a cam , " but somehow he never got round to it " .
Chris had previously run an online help and advice page for gay men , The Gay Advice Shop , but folded it when he could n't cope with the volume of visitors .
In the aftermath of his break - up with Brian he decided to launch himself on to the Internet public again , with a webcam page and his own chatroom based around it .
By July of this year it had turned into a major hit .
" It was quite a shock when it did take off .
Visitors started voting for me on an American webcam league table called Jasbits .
Suddenly I found myself in the top 10 and there was one week where I was online chatting every night and suddenly I found myself at number three .
It was the first European cam in the top five .
I was getting 1,500 hits a day and the danger was that my Internet service provider would start charging me commercial rates to be online , so I asked visitors not to vote for me and it went back to a more manageable level . "
Now he has about 500 visitors on weekdays and between 1,000 and 1,500 at weekends .
" Seventy per cent are from the US , 30 per cent are from Europe and of those 20 per cent are from the UK .
Initially there were very few Brits but in the past three or four months the British contingent has increased dramatically . "
Chris admits to enjoying being a webcam star .
His webcam is permanently set up in a corner of the living room .
" I used to act a lot and sing and dance and all that jazz and there 's a bit of theatre in me , and the web and the cam is a kind of performance .
To some degree it 's like a soap opera .
When we went on holiday to Turkey last week guys wrote in in their hundreds saying how much they missed us and then when we got back we had loads of e-mails wishing Ady a happy birthday .
There 's a lot of people out there who genuinely care about us and are interested in what 's happening in our lives . "
Like a TV station , Chris publishes a schedule of when he will be live and on air .
One evening a week , normally a Thursday , Ady takes the controls - " Initially Ady used to stay away from the cam but he warmed to it , I think he was tired of staring at my back all night when I was online . "
At weekends they go on the computer together , chatting with visitors .
Although not a sex site , they are not averse to stripping off if the mood takes them , and the CJ - UK Gallery features a number of favourite , revealing portraits preserved from the cam .
" I would never have sex on camera , " says Chris .
" But I would say I was a bit of an exhibitionist , and I can't deny there is an erotic frisson .
I do n't feel weird about people watching me and not knowing who I am .
You can walk down the street and sit in the pub and people watch you .
They may as well watch me when I know I 'm being watched and I 'm on my best behaviour and look good . "
When I speak to Chris he is preparing to put up photos from his holiday on to the website .
In the New Year he will review whether to continue with the site .
Answering all the e-mails is demanding and he has now made so many friends through the page that he has less time and reason to go online .
The experience of Jen on the Goddess Cam , Britain 's most popular amateur female cam , illustrates the downside of being a webcam star and a woman in an often aggressively sexual , male - dominated environment .
Jen is a single mother .
She has a six - year - old daughter , Shannen .
After a tough period on her own after her husband left two and a half years ago , she has now moved back in with her mother , the resident warden of a sheltered housing complex in a Manchester suburb .
Her younger brother is also at home - since the death of Jen 's father a year ago , the rest of the family has pulled back together .
Jen began on the Internet by using the chatrooms .
" I know it sounds sad , " she says , " but it kept me going .
It was at a point in my life where I was living on my own with Shannen .
At night after Shannen was in bed I could n't go out because it was just me , so I either sit and watch television or go online and at least have some kind of contact even if it 's not face to face . "
After a while Jen got a couple of regular chat friends .
" There were three of us , the three goddesses as we eventually called ourselves : Cindy who lives in Seattle who 's 31 , Babs in New York who 's 41 and me , the baby , 28 .
Cindy was the really cynical one .
She used to have disaster after disaster with men and she used to say , right , that 's it , I 'm having nothing more to do with men , and gradually we developed this joke set of rules , or how to be a goddess .
Basically it means being a cynical bitch : never date a man who earns less than you do because he 'll always want to borrow money , never let him see your payslip because he 'll always be wanting money .
It was our mission statement , and eventually it became the goddess site . "
Jen had always been a gadget freak , she even built a computer for her mother , which now has pride of place in the sitting room .
So when she heard about webcams in the States , she had to have one .
It is now set up in her tiny bedroom - cum - office .
As we sit there chatting , on camera , her daughter Shannen wanders in and shyly displays her expertise with her new yo - yo .
Jen gently shoos her out .
The Goddess Cam was an instant , and unnerving , hit , she continues .
" I do n't know where all these people come from .
It was a real eye - opener .
I have this counter on my page and I 'd see it jumping up and up , and I 'd think , this can't be right , so then I put web - site trackers on and you can see where people are coming from .
It 's mainly Americans , I think they 're all pervy men hoping to see a bit of flesh .
You get e-mails that say , ` Show me some skin , baby , ' to which I would never respond .
I have never taken my clothes off , all I usually do is sit here at the computer . "
As time passed she felt under greater and greater pressure to have the camera on all the time .
" I felt like I was performing .
I was getting e- mails saying wave at me and so I 'd sit there and wave and say , ` Hello , Peter in New York ' or whatever .
It got to a point where I thought I 'd better go online all the time in case such - and - such was on .
But then my phone bills got higher and higher .
It was pounds 250 a month just for the modem line and I was thinking , how am I going to pay this bill ?
I was probably addicted at one point . "
Eventually , earlier this year , she reached a turning point .
" My mother 's got a caravan in Anglesea and I used to go with her most weekends and then I got to the stage where I thought , if I go , I 'm offline Friday night , Saturday night and I 'm not back on line until Sunday night , and then I thought , hang on a minute , this is a computer . "
Jen now has a new job , working in the box office at Manchester City football club , which means she can afford to pay her phone bills .
However , she now goes online less , partly because she spends all day sitting at a computer at work anyway , and partly because she realised it was becoming a problem .
Over the next few years personal webcams are likely to become as popular in this country as they are now in the States .
Earthcam , an online directory of cam sites , has seen its worldwide database of webcams increase by 500 per cent since it launched in 1996 , and traffic to its directory doubles every year .
Although webcams may appear to be a sinister and voyeuristic intrusion , the early British cammers actually talk in terms of feeling in control .
Some critics have drawn parallels between webcams and the recent film , The Truman Show in which Jim Carrey 's character gradually realises his whole life has been one giant soap opera with secret cameras and actors manipulating his every move .
But according to Dr Gareth Palmer of Salford University , who has studied the phenomenon of " real - life " forms of television such as closed - circuit TV and docu-soaps , " The things that happen to Jim Carrey are not of his own choosing .
Webcams are about empowerment , it 's about people taking taking charge of their lives and spinning out their own narratives and saying how they got that way - and they 're happy to transmit that image . "
It 's a sentiment echoed by Charlie Charlton who runs the Charlie Cam in Liverpool , one of the few family cams , featuring his Slovak - born wife and son .
" You choose which bits of your life you allow the world to see , as we all do anyway , " he says .
" It 's a selective window into my world .
I have ultimate editorial control with a webcam , whereas if I had a film crew in here they would have ultimate control .
There 's a concept in psychiatry called Johari's Window , which is like your window on the world and is divided into four parts : the part of you which is known to yourself and others , the part which is perceived by others but hidden from yourself , the part hidden from others but known to yourself , and the part that is hidden from yourself and from others .
With a webcam I 'm the selector , I make the choice about what I show "
The risk of an asteroid rending civilization into bits is a favorite scenario in disaster movies , but it has been none too popular with the United States government .
Eleven years ago , Congress tasked NASA with detecting , tracking , and classifying large asteroids and comets that pose a threat to Earth ; these are generically termed near earth objects , or NEOs .
Since then , save for a small grant , NASA has funded the project on its own .
Now Congress has created new goals for the program and requested that they be achieved by 2020 .
The National Research Committee has put out an interim report on the NEO project , and it indicates that very little progress has been made since 2005 , primarily due to a lack of funding .
Congress kicked off the NEO - tracking project in 1998 , requiring that NASA 's equipment be able to locate and identify at least 90 percent of all NEOs one kilometer in diameter or larger .
Congress selected this size as the lower bound because it is the smallest size that might be globally catastrophic if it ran into Earth .
To guarantee a catastrophe , an asteroid would have to be even larger , perhaps 1.5 to 2 kilometers .
On impact , an asteroid of this size would create a fireball the size of a continent and a crater fifteen times the asteroid 's diameter ; if it hits the ocean , there would be an enormous tsunami .
Congress awarded NASA a $ 1.6 million grant in 1999 to put towards the NEO discovery program .
Unfortunately , this was the only funding Congress gave to NASA to pursue this goal ; nonetheless , NASA continued the project on its own , and has since successfully achieved the objective of a 90 percent track rate for 1 km NEOs .
The problem now , the NRC report asserts , is that we should n't be satisfied with this .
What NASA has accomplished so far will largely enable us to at least attempt to prevent any impacts that would ultimately cause the majority of humans that survive the initial blow to die of starvation .
However , asteroids smaller than 1 km in diameter are not sufficiently less disastrous than their larger counterparts that we can happily ignore them .
For example , the NRC report states that the body that caused the 1908 Tunguska explosion and destroyed 2,000 square kilometers of Siberian forest was only 30 - 40 meters in diameter .
This realization is what led Congress to change its mind and decide that NASA should track even smaller asteroids .
The new goal : track 90 percent of NEOs 140 meters or larger in diameter by 2020 .
The NRC report primarily takes issue with the lack of action on this goal from anyone involved : Congress has not volunteered funding for their mandate , and NASA has not allotted any of their budget to it , either .
The equipment currently in use to track NEOs can easily see the 1 km monsters , but it 's not sensitive enough to track the 140 m asteroids .
As a result , if a Tunguska - sized body were headed for Earth today , its arrival would probably be a complete surprise .
Of course , the Tunguska explosion is the only collision of this sort in recorded history , suggesting that threatening bodies that cross Earth 's path are fortunately rare .
Considering this , and the fact that the most disastrous varieties of asteroids are fairly well covered , danger is probably not imminent .
However , Congress is not doing its own deadline any favors by squaring off with NASA over funding .
The committee that produced the interim report has been asked to focus in particular with evaluating whether the established NEO discovery goals should be modified .
The report is decidedly in favor of tracking the smallest asteroids possible , given that even small NEOs have significant potential for destruction .
But for the NEO program to move forward toward any goal , Congress will have to pay up .

CHANNING TATUM and MARLON WAYANS are driving along a dirt road .
MARLON WAYANS
As I much as I love driving these top secret ultra deadly nano - missiles to somewhere or another , I 've been thinking we should join the Air Force .
CHANNING TATUM
Nah , I like being a ground soldier .
I want to actually be in the fight , not flying over it .
MARLON WAYANS
" Flying over it " ?
You hear that , United States Air Force ?
Director Stephen Sommers wants you to know he thinks you 're a bunch of pussies .
Suddenly their vehicle is attacked by a CGI JET carrying SIENNA MILLER , ARNOLD VOSLOO , and some HENCHMEN .
SIENNA MILLER
Channing , hand over the weapon or I 'll blow your brains out .
CHANNING TATUM
Sienna ?
Are you a ninja librarian now ?
Because if so , that 's hot .
MARLON WAYANS
You know this chick ?
CHANNING TATUM
I used to be engaged to her .
But then her little geek brother joined the army I let him get killed despite unwisely promising I 'd protect him .
MARLON WAYANS
Nothing you could do , war is hell .
CHANNING TATUM
Then when I got back I did n't go to his funeral .
I also did n't speak to her at all , preferring instead that she cope with the death of her brother without the consolation of her future husband .
MARLON WAYANS
...wow .
Yeah , go ahead and shoot him I guess .
CHANNING TATUM
That 's no excuse , Sienna !
You 've become totally evil and ridiculous - looking !
SIENNA MILLER

ADEWALE AKINNUOYE -AGBAJE

MARLON WAYANS
Sweet , there 's an opening for me .
CHANNING TATUM
( pointing at Ray Park )
And who 's this walking action figure ?
RACHEL NICHOLS
That 's " Snake Eyes " .
He does n't talk .
CHANNING TATUM
Because he took a mysterious vow of silence when he was in training ?
RACHEL NICHOLS
Nah , I think it 's because someone made his costume with skin - tight lips for some reason .
RAY PARK

CHANNING TATUM
So , basically , the bad guys in this franchise are so utterly ridiculous that they require an entire movie to justify their existence ?
JOSEPH GORDON -LEVITT
Yes , it 's even the movie subtitle .
By the way , I 'm Sienna 's brother , the one you thought you let die !
CHANNING TATUM
And Sienna has been working next to you for the last four years without figuring this out ?
JOSEPH GORDON -LEVITT
Correct .
CHANNING TATUM
And Cobra Commander is going to end up being the scrawny kid from 3rd Rock from the Sun ?
JOSEPH GORDON -LEVITT
Yep .
CHANNING TATUM
Yeah , I can see why they thought they 'd need an entire movie to justify that .
CHANNING escapes , but so do JOSEPH and CHRISTOPHER .
They launch NANOMITE WARHEADS at MOSCOW and WASHINGTON , D.C. Meanwhile , ADEWALE leads an assault on the UNDERWATER BASE , killing thousands of innocent henchmen that are under the influence of MIND CONTROL .
CHANNING TATUM
Wow , look at all the crazy crap going on .
This movie must have been expensive as hell .
RACHEL NICHOLS
Are you kidding ?
All we did was film a 10 - year - old boy playing with action figures and then digitally remove him .
MARLON WAYANS
Those warheads need to be shot down .
And since earlier I referenced being a pilot , this seems like the only thing in the movie I might be good at .
Unless , for some reason , you need someone to dress up like a blond white girl while looking like a hideous monster from the depths of hell .
MARLON boards a jet and then flies to MOSCOW .
MARLON WAYANS
Alright I 've targeted the missile , but there 's no way to fire my weapons !
RACHEL NICHOLS
It must use a trigger word .
Try " Fantastic " .
Do n't ask .
MARLON shoots down the missile , which does n't eat through everything after it explodes for some reason .
MARLON WAYANS
Alright , now guide me to Washington D.C. for the other one .
RACHEL NICHOLS
That 's nearly 5,000 miles away and you have fifteen minutes .
You 'd have to travel at 20,000 miles per hour .
That 's about 26 times the speed of sound .
MARLON WAYANS
Said , hook me up .
SAID TAGHMAOUI
Oh uh , localize the bandwidth thruster to balance the flux reversal .
MARLON flies to the other MISSILE and crashes into it .
The NANOMITES start eating through his METAL SHIP so he ejects and the NANOMITES decide not to eat through his METAL SUIT .
JOSEPH GORDON -LEVITT gives CHRISTOPHER a METAL MASK and injects him with MIND CONTROL NANOMITES .

Ann Albert , a 52 - year - old Berea mother of two who 's clearly unaccustomed to the spotlight , just might see a wish of hers come true .
That is , if she can get enough fairy godmothers to vote online for her before Sept. 15 .
As one of 10 finalists selected for the " Refresh Your Life " contest for people over 45 , she could be the lucky baby boomer who wins $ 20,000 to pursue a dream .
In a video on the contest Web site , she somewhat shyly spells out her idea to create a program to provide instruments and art supplies for needy youths .
" A vote for me is a vote for the children of Cleveland , to support their goals and their dreams , " she declares in the video , shot by a contest crew at familiar locations such as the Cleveland Museum of Art and Severance Hall .
The contest , sponsored by Subway , Microsoft and MSN , targeted boomers across the nation and asked them to state what they are passionate about doing in the next chapter of their lives .
The idea appealed to Albert , a former at - home mom who works as e-commerce coordinator at an online retailer , AmeriMark Direct , so she filled out the online essay .
Never dreaming she might have a shot at winning , she did n't even bother to save a copy .
She has n't had a fairy tale life so far .
Her husband , Frank , was laid off from a plastics job in 2002 and financial challenges continued after he launched his own business .
She decided to become a Realtor , but the real estate market tanked after she earned her license in 2005 .
Trying again to reinvent herself , she went back to school at age 50 for a master 's degree .
" She 's a real surprise .
She 's a quiet woman and she often speaks in whispers , " said Elizabeth Stiles , director of John Carroll University 's nonprofit administration program .
" But the more that you get to know her and talk with her , the more impressed you become . "
For years ,
Albert said , she has wanted to pursue her nonprofit idea , which she has named Cleveland Rocks for the Arts ( rocksforthearts.org ) .
She thought it might take years to build , but the prize money could jump - start it immediately .
So she 's making the media rounds , in hopes that voting for her goes viral .
Cleveland Rocks for the Arts is really needed now , she said , with the economy forcing local schools to cut back on arts programs and more parents unable to afford arts supplies .

When is rape not rape ?
When it 's a supervillain pretending to be Peter Parker and having sex with Parker 's roommate , who thinks she 's having sex with Parker himself , according to one of Marvel 's Amazing Spider - Man writers .
Part of a recent issue of Marvel 's flagship Amazing series featured villain The Chameleon taking the place of Peter Parker ( not knowing that he 's actually Spider - Man ) and seducing Parker 's roommate , Michelle Gonzales , which led fans to wonder whether this meant that Michelle had been raped :
Personally , I think it is as Michelle probably would n't have given consent to Chameleon otherwise .
But some fans of the issue on Spider - Man Crawl Space are arguing that it is n't because she gave consent .
Advertisement
Someone thought to ask the writer of the story , Fred Van Lente , who argues for the non-rape side :
My understanding of the definition of rape is that it requires force or the threat of force , so no .
Using deception to trick someone into granting consent is n't quite the same thing .
Which is not to say it is n't a horrible , evil , reprehensible thing that Chameleon did .
He is a bad man .
He insults parapelegics and dips people in acid too .
( Rich Johnston points out that , under British law , the Chameleon is technically a rapist , for what it 's worth . )

While Van Lente 's commentary was meant as a final word , fans are upset at the cognitive dissonance between his " horrible , evil , reprehensible thing " and way the story is being played out in the comic itself ...

... Or , as Daily Scans poster box_in_the_box puts it ,
HA HA HA SHE JUST NEEDED A GOOD STIFF ONE TO SET HER STRAIGHT AMIRITE ???
NEVER MIND THAT IT WAS A SUPERVILLAIN WHO RAPED HER USING PETER'S FACE , BECAUSE COMEDY !!! ...
Shit like this makes me think that whoever wrote it believes that vaginas have teeth .

This prompted Van Lente to respond again :
First off , while I believe he had the best of intentions , the poster " DrSevarius " wrote me under his real name and asked me a question I thought I was answering in private , to him .
He posted my response without my permission and without telling me beforehand it was supposed to be for public consumption .
If he had told me that , I would have , first off , made it clear that I am not a Marvel employee .
I am not a Marvel spokesperson .
I am a freelancer .
I speak only for myself .
That is just as true for the following statement as the previous one .
Also , if he had told me that , I may have been less coy about the following " Spoiler Alert " .
Anyone who cares not to have stuff that 's in ASM # 605 revealed now should avert their eyes .
Amazing Spider - Man # 605 , which went to the printer weeks ago , makes it clear that Michelle and Chameleon did nothing more than make out in the kitchen scene in # 603 .
There was no sex , and therefore no rape .
But surely the intent was to imply they had sex , considering Michelle was wearing Peter 's underwear ...?
Van Lente also promises that # 605 will show Peter 's discovery of the make out session , and his reaction .
Wonder if we 're headed towards a " very special episode " of Spider - Man that explains why it 's wrong to seduce women into making out with you and wearing your underwear while pretending to be someone else ?

Researchers at the Royal Institute of Technology ( KTH ) in Stockholm have managed to prove that fossils from animals and plants are not necessary for crude oil and natural gas to be generated .
The findings are revolutionary since this means , on the one hand , that it will be much easier to find these sources of energy and , on the other hand , that they can be found all over the globe .
“ Using our research we can even say where oil could be found in Sweden , ” says Vladimir Kutcherov , a professor at the Division of Energy Technology at KTH .
Together with two research colleagues , Vladimir Kutcherov has simulated the process involving pressure and heat that occurs naturally in the inner layers of the earth , the process that generates hydrocarbon , the primary component in oil and natural gas .
According to Vladimir Kutcherov , the findings are a clear indication that the oil supply is not about to end , which researchers and experts in the field have long feared .
He adds that there is no way that fossil oil , with the help of gravity or other forces , could have seeped down to a depth of 10.5 kilometers in the state of Texas , for example , which is rich in oil deposits .
As Vladimir Kutcherov sees it , this is further proof , alongside his own research findings , of the genesis of these energy sources – that they can be created in other ways than via fossils .
This has long been a matter of lively discussion among scientists .
“ There is no doubt that our research proves that crude oil and natural gas are generated without the involvement of fossils .
All types of bedrock can serve as reservoirs of oil , ” says Vladimir Kutcherov , who adds that this is true of land areas that have not yet been prospected for these energy sources .
But the discovery has more benefits .
The degree of accuracy in finding oil is enhanced dramatically – from 20 to 70 percent .
Since drilling for oil and natural gas is a very expensive process , the cost picture will be radically altered for petroleum companies , and in the end probably for consumers as well .
“ The savings will be in the many billions , ” says Vladimir Kutcherov .
To identify where it is worthwhile to drill for natural gas and oil , Vladimir Kutcherov has used his research to arrive at a new method .
It involves dividing the globe into a finely meshed grid .
The grid corresponds to fissures , so - called ‘ migration channels , ’ through underlying layers under the surface of the earth .
Wherever these fissures meet , it is suitable to drill .
According to Vladimir Kutcherov , these research findings are extremely important , not least as 61 percent of the world ’s energy consumption derives from crude oil and natural gas .
The next step in this research work will involve more experiments , but above all refining the method will make it easier to find places where it is suitable to drill for oil and natural gas .
Vladimir Kutcherov , Anton Kolesnikov , and Alexander Goncharov ’s research work was recently published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience .

As banks and credit unions stop accepting California IOUs , a market for the securities has sprung up on eBay and Craigslist .
Not so fast ...
California Sets Terms on IOUs as Questions Arise .
As California continues to issue " IOUs " , more controversy is brewing over their use .
On one side , IOU recipients are beginning to trade them like currency , forcing the California state treasurer 's office to issue guidelines if they are sold through eBay ( EBAY ) , Craigslist or other means .
California 's treasurer is telling recipients of the IOUs that if they sell them to third parties , they will be redeemed by the state treasurer 's office only if accompanied by a notarized bill of sale signed by their listed payee .
" We are in the process of contacting officials of eBay and Craigslist to post a notice of the policy on their sites , " the statement said .
Speculation is rising over whether California 's tax - exempt IOUs , technically registered warrants , can be bought , sold and traded .
The Securities and Exchange Commission must first determine if the IOUs are securities to regulate them , said Ernesto Lanza , general counsel to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board , adding that the board was not working directly with the commis—sion on that decision .
" It looks like it has all the hallmarks of a security , " Lanza told Reuters .
" If they are securities , I think they 're pretty clearly municipal securities . "
At least one website aims to offer a platform for selling the registered warrants .
Obed Dorceus , owner of ioumarket.com , said he sees a potential secondary market for the IOUs — and potentially other government promises to pay .
A group of the biggest U.S. banks said they would stop accepting California 's IOUs on Friday , adding pressure on the state to close its $ 26.3 billion annual budget gap .
The group of banks included Bank of America Corp. ( BAC ) , Citigroup Inc. ( C ) , Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC ) and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) , among others .
The banks had previously committed to accepting state IOUs as payment .
California plans to issue more than $ 3 billion of IOUs in July .
Ms. Mills of the CBA said some banks were concerned that there are n't processes in place to accept IOUs , and also worried about fraud issues .
She noted that not all banks have set a July 10 deadline , and that dozens of credit unions in the state will keep accepting IOUs .
Wells Fargo 's head of community banking , Lisa Stevens , said : " We 're very disappointed , as are many Californians , that California has taken the unfortunate step of issuing IOUs in lieu of payments to some businesses and individuals . "
State officials said they were disappointed by the banks ' decision .
Garin Casaleggio , a spokesman for Mr. Chiang , said : " We do n't want anybody to suffer who ca n't redeem them when they need cash . "
Big Banks Cutting Own Throats
Every one of those blood sucking banks was bailed out by taxpayers ( California taxpayers too ) and now will not take an IOU from the State of California for the citizens of California .
This is disgusting .
If you have an IOU that the big banks will not cash , I recommend closing your accounts and putting them someplace that will .
Please tell Wells Fargo , Bank of America , JP Morgan , and Citigroup to go to hell .
Addendum
However , I am willing to put myself in the shoes of a contractor with employees who needs to cash to pay his employees and subcontractors .
There is going to be one massive domino effect of defaults and business closures if people are not paid .
Contractors and state employees are legitimately owed that money for services rendered .
I am all in favor of axing jobs , whatever it takes to balance the budget .
I am not in favor of holding businesses and consumers hostage for services already rendered while it is done .
However , two wrongs do not make a right , and if I had a bank account at any of those places and they refused to honor IOUs from the state I would move my account to someplace who would .
Addendum II
It is very interesting that the big banks have reversed .
This confirms my suspicion that , despite the bailouts , the banks are intensely in pain for cash to meet their obligations , and cannot make themselves further illiquid by accepting IOUs .
As far as secondary markets , this whole situation reminds me a lot of Continentals .
Fact :
The FDA does n't allow very large or very small condoms .
Magnum XLs are only sightly bigger than normal .
In Europe , however , they are soon going to get them in 70 different sizes .
Are you a J33 or a G22 ?

Believe it or not , using a condom that is not suited for your penis increases the possibilities of breakage and slippage , which in turn increases the possibility of sexually transmitted infections , or unwanted pregnancies .
Even while they know this — as have been discovered in various studies — the FDA does n't allow for condoms that are longer , shorter , thinner , or thicker than the average .
That 's bad — not to mention effing annoying .
Advertisement
In Europe , however , men will be able to print out this measuring tool , and order exactly the size they need .
Hopefully , someone will bring these They Fit condoms to the US .
For now , however , all you can do is print and play .
And yes , I measured it .
Yes , that 's an invitation for you to the same and post your size .
No lies or fishing tales .
I will start : N21 — aaaalmost 22 . [ Theyfit — Thanks Debby ]
Scientists kicked out of contest because they are based in the West Bank , Spain 's government says
Spain has expelled a group of Israeli scientists from a state - funded solar energy competition because they are based in occupied areas of the West Bank , it said today .
The decision to expel the team from the Ariel University Centre of Samaria from Solar Decathlon Europe , an international competition involving 20 universities , has provoked angry reactions in Israel .
The team was one of 20 finalists in a competition to design solar - powered housing that is part - sponsored by the US energy department .
Spain is hosting the first European version of the event next year and claims ultimate say over who takes part .
" All the ministry has done is apply the policy of the European Union , " a housing ministry spokesman said .
" The EU does not recognise the occupation of the West Bank , which is where this university is . "
The university said it " rejects with disgust the one - sided announcement " .
It claimed the decision " contravenes international law and international charters on academic freedom " and harms 10,000 students at the university , including 500 Arabs .
It was only after the Israeli project joined the finalists , which include the University of Nottingham , that officials at Spain 's housing ministry became aware that the university was in the West Bank .
The Israelis and the US energy department were advised of the decision a week ago .
The Israeli team had described their " Stretch house " project as being inspired by the " Tent of Abraham " .
" It is adaptable according to its owner 's wishes and is able to expand and create hospitable spaces , " they said .
" In its closed state , when additional space is not required , it uses only half the energy necessary to operate a regular house . "
Pro-Palestinian groups claimed allowing the Israeli team to take part was a breach of international law .
They said the university was in the second biggest zone in Israel 's expanding West Bank presence .
" I wonder how the Solar Decathlon can accept a project submitted by an institution that has stolen our land and will build its project on our stolen land , " said Fayeq Kishawi , coordinator of a Palestinian campaign group against the settlements , in a letter to the Spanish housing minister , Beatriz Corredor .
Jewish groups have recently claimed anti-semitism is on the rise in Spain .
A decision by El Mundo newspaper to publish an interview with the British historian and holocaust denier David Irving angered the Israeli ambassador , Raphael Schutz , who claimed it showed a lack of moral and ethical judgement .
He said he been subjected to racial abuse in Madrid , where three men shouted " dirty Jew , " " Jew bastard " and " Jewish dog " at him .
A report this week by the New York - based Anti-Defamation League complained of what it claimed was a rise in anti-Semitism across Spain and , especially , in its mainstream media .
" We are deeply concerned about the mainstreaming of anti-semitism in Spain , with more public expressions and greater public acceptance of classic stereotypes , " said the league 's director , Abraham H Foxman .
" Among the major European countries , only in Spain have we seen viciously anti-Semitic cartoons in the mainstream media , and street protests where Israel is accused of genocide and Jews are vilified and compared to Nazis . "
Former World Chess Champion and Kremlin critic Garry Kasparov has been attacked by radio - controlled penis during a meeting of opposition activists .
Around 700 opponents of the Kremlin were attending Kasparov ’s address in Moscow at the weekend .
Pro-Kremlin demonstrators decided to interrupt Kasparov ’s address , designed to unite opposition political forces , by launching a rotor - assisted plastic phallus towards Mr Kasparov .
The unconventional chopper managed to stay up for at least 20 seconds before stunned security guards swiped it out of the air .
The prank was staged by " a couple of pro-Kremlin Young Russia activists " reports the Moscow Times .
Mr Kasparov was unharmed .
Kasparov laughed off the incident remarking that it was " below the belt " .
" I think we have to be thankful for the opposition 's demonstration of the level of discourse we need to anticipate , " he said .
An onlooker said the incident was a " genital reminder about who is in charge " .
Kasparov became the youngest ever World Chess Champion in 1985 but is widely known for being the first world chess champion to lose a match to a computer , when he lost to Deep Blue in 1997 .
He announced his retirement from professional chess in 2005 to devote time to politics .
He later formed the United Civil Front movement , and became a member of The Other Russia , a coalition opposing the administration of Vladimir Putin .

Guide to HTML5 Hiccups
HTML5 is the next generation of web markup , and the first web markup language created in the era of web applications .
While we view many aspects of it quite favorably , we believe the specification could benefit from a few changes and clarifications , outlined below .
Validation of XHTML and HTML
The spec should clarify that an author can use XHTML or HTML syntax , that it is a coding style preference .
It would be great if Henri could add a toggle to the validator that will check for syntax .
Something along the lines of “ Also check for XHTML syntax validity . ”
While more specific toggles ( e.g. “ Check for quoted attributes ” ) may benefit some power users , the largest benefit would be realized by providing at least a high - level “ XHTML syntax ” toggle , which could ( perhaps with progressive disclosure help text ) document what it is checking in addition , like :
quoted attributes
self - closed empty elements ( e.g. < meta /> , < link /> , < img /> , < br /> etc. )
, , , etc. ) explicit closing tags ( for non-empty elements )
named entities defined by XHTML 1.0
... etc .
We want the ability to check for stricter syntax “ at validation time ” to be conducive to more efficient authoring / development .
Every good programmer knows bugs are much more quickly caught and fixed at compile - time than at run-time .
Validation is the compile - time of HTML .
All of the above syntax checking ( and more ) is currently provided by the W3C Validator when validating XHTML 1.0 DOCTYPE documents served as text / html .
We want the option for the same ( or better ? ) level of XHTML syntax checking when validating HTML5 documents as text / html .
We do n’t think that there needs be a toggle in the language itself to indicate preferred syntax .
New elements and attributes
Heading scope
We are excited about the the ability in HTML5 to scope headings via the section element .
This proposes a significant improvement in fluidity of content reuse and eases the burden of creating mashups .
Adding New Elements
We would like to encourage spec authors to be conservative in including new tags , and only do so when they addition of the tag allows for significant gains in functionality .
For example , article and section are identical except that article allows a pubdate attribute .
We would suggest that article be dropped and section be adapted to allow an optional pubdate attribute or , even better , more explicit metadata .
Overall , we feel confident that the semantics of many of the new elements proposed by the HTML5 spec are currently in widespread use by content authors as semantic class names in currently published HTML4 and XHMTL1 documents .
However , we did note that occasionally the usage as suggested by the spec varies from the way web developers currently understand / use the element .
Content authors , confident that they understand the meaning of a tag which matches a class name they have been using for years , will likely use the element incorrectly , causing disparity between the element as specified and used in practice .
There is a worry that the spec becomes effective fiction if it does n’t document current practice accurately ( when current practice is advisable ) .
We are concerned that the footer element as defined is more restrictive than the header element .
It violates the “ Principle of least surprise ” — people will see the footer element and “ know what it ’s about ” use it for the footer of the page not footers of sections .
Content authors have followed the taxonomy of an html page to mark up templates , including class names or ids ; #header , # body , and #footer .
For example , “ footer ” is commonly used to denote a portion of the template at the bottom of the page .
Footers may well contain copyright or other meta information , but generally it is understood to simply be content which is secondary to that which is within the #body .
It may contain tertiary navigation , sections , or even headings .
Review of Data
We propose two reviews of the test data used to suggest the addition of footer and header , to better determine how content authors are currently using “ footer . ”
A distribution of how deeply nested nodes are that contain the footer class / ID .
Our hypothesis is that footer is much more frequently a very near child of the body element , which would indicate that content authors consider the footer to be a template - level element rather than a meta - data container for deeply nested sections .
On the pages tested , how frequently elements with the class / id footer contain block level elements and headings , thus effectively being inconsistent with the current specification .
Our hypothesis is that current trending seems to be leaning toward the footer being considered a content area , just slightly less important than the main body content of a section or page .
Proposed Solution
Assuming our hypotheses are deemed accurate , we propose the following .
The footer is an important element , but either its content model needs to be changed to match that of header , so that it may be used concurrently as a template level element and ( the new use ) a sub-division of section , or the name needs to be changed so that it will not seem related to how footer is currently used by content authors .
To allow for the broader use case , the content model of the footer should be :
Flow content , but with no header or footer element descendants .
The textual description of footer should be updated from :
The footer element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content .
A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it , links to related documents , copyright data , an [ d ] the like
...to...
The footer element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content .
A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it , links to related documents , tertiary navigation , copyright data , an the like , but may contain any information which is secondary to the main content in its nearest ancestor sectioning content .
If that is the body than the footer is secondary content to the document as a whole .
hgroup
We do n’t see the added value of this element and would instead add a boolean attribute to the heading element which allows content authors to specify if that particular heading should be included in the outline .
We would like the specification authors to clarify the note :
The point of hgroup is to mask an h2 …
Is the note specific to the example ?
It looks like it may apply to the hgroup element in general .
Aside
The use cases for aside are too limited to warrant its inclusion in the specification .
We were also concerned about potentially duplicating content within an aside .
Canvas
It is exciting to see Canvas stretch the boundaries of what is possible in web applications and websites .
We want universal access to the canvas element defined in the specification and implemented so we can effectively use it without damaging the accessibility of our projects .
We are happy to see the Canvas Accessibility API task force making quick progress , even while an accessibility solution is still being sought .
Within the specification , please include universal access examples , explaining how you anticipate content authors using this element to create both simpler content ( interactive charts and graphics , etc ) , as well as full fledged applications like Bespin .
The current implementations of the canvas element are similar to the state of accessibility of Flash in 1998 ; with the impressive skills of developers today , we can do better than that !
Providing universal access to the canvas element is certainly an engineering challenge , we look forward to it being a reality .
ARIA
While ARIA was not included in the version of the specification we reviewed , recent drafts propose how to integrate ARIA .
We like where this is headed and believe this issue should be resolved before Last Call to ensure adoption , implementation , and integration of ARIA into HTML5 .
Dialog
A new element < dialog > does not provide added value over current markup .
In addition , < dt > and < dd > seem like a stretch for this particular application .
Time
There are a few use cases which are not possible with an implementation of the time element as currently specified .
For example , many choose to indicate their birth month and day in a social networking site while being unwilling to divulge the year , or only divulge the year and not the month and day .
The birthday examples research documents specific sites and URLs .
An application that extracted friends birthdays to create a graph of events in the upcoming year should be able to determine the day and month , even in the absence of the exact year ( especially for recurring events ) .
The simple fix : allow the time element ’s datetime attribute to accept standard year values and month - day values , both of which are allowed by ISO8601 : YYYY and -- MM - DD respectively .
We are also imagining an application that might input Wikipedia data and output an annotated visual timeline .
For movements or trends rather than events , it would need to output rough dates and date ranges like 2001 - 2003 , rather than exact dates .
This may require extending the time element , or perhaps some compound markup that uses one or more time elements .
Details
We suggest that legend be replaced by a new element because current UA implementations require legend be part of a form or fieldset which would make the element effectively unusable for the foreseeable future .
We agree that creating new elements is undesirable but in this case , it appears to be necessary for pragmatic reasons .
Figure
We suggest that , by default , UAs render figure width no wider than the video , image , or canvas that it contains .
UAs should calculate this width and flow the legend / label content within .
We also suggest that legend be replaced by label because current UA implementations require legend be part of a form or fieldset which would make the element effectively unusable for the foreseeable future .
Progress and Meter
The only obvious difference in these two elements is that meter contains a start value .
Are they perhaps different visual displays of the same information ?
A ( type icon )
Please add a use - case which demonstrates how alt text would be included .
Changed elements and attributes
Style
We propose removing the words “ if applied ” from section 4.2.6 to avoid disparate behaviors across different UAs .
Otherwise , the specified styles must , if applied , be applied to the entire document .
We would also encourage content authors to sandbox code from unknown sources in an iframe if there are concerns about security , code integrity , or style collisions .
Are placeholder links active elements ?
If yes , we are concerned that someone could tab to a placeholder link but not be able to activate it .
Please clarify expected user agent behavior .
Small element
We support Remy ’s proposal .
We had some discussion of it being a block level element versus inline .
What DOM does it create ?
From some of our initial tests , when small is used as a block level element , some browsers break the small element into a series of inline elements .
Backwards compatibility will be essential to making this element usable for developers .
Alternatively , if the small element cannot be changed to match its new updated meaning , it should , like its companion , the big element , be dropped from the spec .
Cite
Review of Data
We propose a test to determine current usage of the cite element .
Are document authors using it to markup only titles of books and other works , or do they also use it to refer to spoken work by people , e.g .
< cite>@t</cite > < q > Plato used shadows of sock puppets .</ q >
div
We are concerned that the div element seems to be a second class citizen as implied by this note :
Note : Authors are strongly encouraged to view the div element as an element of last resort , for when no other element is suitable .
Use of the div element instead of more appropriate elements leads to poor accessibility for readers and poor maintainability for authors .
Limiting the number and complexity of new semantic elements means that div plus a class name or ARIA role will still be an appropriate way to markup content in many contexts .
Absent elements and attributes
Most of the elements removed seem appropriate , even if their loss makes some us feel rather nostalgic .
We would like the specification authors to clarify how to markup multi-dimensional tables with an example .
There is some concern about the abbr attribute on th elements going away .
We are glad to see that the headers and scope attributes remain .
The HTML5 Super Friends
If even the revelation that she 'd been raped could n't do it , one wonders if there is any situation that could lead to people feeling sympathy for Katie Price ?
Or is the mood against her so far gone that a plane could fall out of the sky , right on top of her head , and there would still be members of the British media and public muttering : " Well , she deserved it , did n't she ?
Publicity - seeking trollop .
Look at how she treated Peter Andre ! "
Something has to explain the bizarre attitude of some parts of the media regarding Price 's account of being assaulted .
Always careful to toss in a caveat ( " Anyone who 's been raped deserves sympathy " ) , too often this would segue into a ( surely irrelevant ? ) diatribe about Price 's character and behaviour , followed by baiting over her refusal to involve the police .
Irresponsible , if not downright suspicious , seemed to run the rationale .
Well , not really .
If anything , with her fear of involving the police and the courts , Price was behaving like a typical rape victim .
Does n't this , the omnipresent culture of automatic disbelief around sexual assault , serve to highlight why Price , and many other victims of rape , are so loath to come forward ?
Indeed , does n't Price 's obvious lack of faith in the legal system mirror the torment of many other rape victims , ordinary women , who fear they have little chance of being believed ?
Not that Price has done herself many PR favours lately : not by announcing the rape in OK !
magazine , talking about it ( or " not talking about it " ) on Matthew Wright 's show ( echoing Ulrikagate ) , nor even by spending so much time gyrating around the clubs of Ibiza , like some trashed Essex Barbarella .
Then again , who among us , post - split , manages to pull off the full ( classy , composed ) " Audrey Hepburn " ?
In my opinion , there has been more humanity and honesty in Price 's raddled clubbing than ( again , only my opinion , libel team ) the passive - aggressive simpering of Andre , last seen on Jonathan Ross on Friday night , puffing out his over - developed abs , like some mutant Toblerone .
All of which would ( should ) be irrelevant , except in the matter of Price 's credibility about her rape , it sadly is n't .
Indeed , the case against her ( the incessant baiting to name names and involve the police ) seems to rest almost entirely on widespread censure of her general deportment .
In recent days , I have even seen comments on websites along the lines of " even if she was raped " looking she does , behaving like she does : " Is it any real surprise ? "
And just like that , we are back in the bad old days of eye - rolling police , censorious judges , of women being more or less told they had brought sexual assault on themselves with their swigging of Babychams and wriggling in miniskirts ; that , all things considered : " Darling , you asked for it . "
All of which leads one to the conclusion that Price was absolutely right not to press charges .
Not only did the incident occur so long ago it would be impossible to prove , but she would have had her character and sexual history trashed , the whole process most probably resulting in a failed court case and ersatz " proof " that she 'd " lied " .
Basically , as seems rather too routine with rape cases , Price would have ended up a victim twice .
In this way , Price 's refusal to prosecute her alleged attacker is not just her being gobby " Jordan " , irresponsibly shooting her mouth off for attention , and then backtracking when the heat turns up .
On the contrary , by being scared and withdrawing Price has revealed herself as an Everywoman – as in , every woman who has ever been raped but does not press charges because deep down she fears she will not be believed .
These Columbine fantasists owe us a big apology
Matthew Swift , 18 , and Ross McKnight , 16 , from Denton , Manchester , have been acquitted of plotting to blow up schools and shopping centres to mark the 10th anniversary of the Columbine school massacre .
One of the defence team says the case was a farcical over - reaction and a waste of police time and public money .
For all their blather , the boys had accumulated no guns or explosives , and their fantasising was merely teenage angst , in Swift 's words , " a fantasy , not a reality " .
McKnight added that he'd been forced to take his GCSEs in custody .
Diddums .
Just because Swift and McKnight were found not guilty it does n't mean that their " fantasies " about blowing up public places and shooting all survivors were n't alarming .
It is also unfair to suggest that the authorities had any option but to take it seriously .
For all they knew , they may have had a real - life version of Lionel Shriver 's novel We Need to Talk About Kevin on their hands .
What if they had ignored Swift and McKnight , dismissed it as a teenage wind - up and then something had happened ?
Would they then have been blamed for a farcical under-reaction ?
Although not guilty , arguably certain aspects of the boys ' behaviour ( planning , preening ) fitted the profile of this kind of massacre , which , with real killers , tips over into a narcissistic desire to be noticed , to reap attention via fear and awe .
It 's a phenomenon related best in the song The Nobodies by rock performer Marilyn Manson , who may lurch around looking like a Halloween costume left to melt on the radiator , but whose music was blamed by the US right for inciting Columbine , so he 's probably entitled to have an opinion about it .
As for teenage angst and fantasising , perhaps Swift and McKnight should get with the rest of the male teens in the country and content themselves with developing a painful crush on Cheryl Cole .
Indeed , although
The X Factor contestants are routinely derided for their crazy wannabe dreams about superstardom , next to what certain other teenagers are fantasising about , they suddenly look the pinnacle of good mental health .
Although Swift and McKnight 's plotting turned out not to be genuine , it was still vile , disturbing and required thorough investigation .
They should be apologising for any police time and public money wasted , not the other way around .
Let 's hear it for Jo and the rock chicks
So Strictly Come Dancing is back .
As memories fade of John Sergeant stumbling around like a drugged heffalump , one hopes that Jo Wood wo n't be voted off any time soon , not because of her dancing ( who cares ? ) , but because she deserves a boost after husband 's Ronnie 's behaviour .
Some of us were cackling last week at news of 62 - year - old Ronnie 's drunken bust up with Ekaterina , the 20 - year - old Russian he left Jo for .
Oh dear , trouble in third - of - your - age paradise ?
Did Ekaterina glance over and realise she was sharing her life with someone who appeared to have a moulting crow stuck to his head ?
It is n't Ekaterina 's fault .
The silly girl is at a stage in life where she should be running around pop festivals getting inappropriate tattoos , not slumped backstage , attempting to keep a whining , self - absorbed rock star on the wagon .
The Wood saga highlights the reality of that much - maligned social group – rock wives .
Dismissed as feckless floozies , in truth , they work horribly hard , keeping their muso - miseries ' tummies filled , inappropriately " young " clothes washed and egos stroked , not to mention fending off endless Ekaterinas .
To do this , as Jo did , while looking great , and keeping a sense of humour , was a major accomplishment , and for this alone she deserves the Strictly crown .
As with everything in life , with " rock wives " , there are the good , the bad and the ugly .
As Ronnie is probably realising , he just let go of one of the greats .
Chicken licken
Still available for viewing on YouTube : Adeel Ayub , the disgraced former Asda worker , who decided to spend a day off at the store licking raw chickens and then replacing them on shelves , slashing staff furniture with a knife , smashing trays of eggs with bats and urinating into rubbish bins .
Would it be too presumptuous to conclude that this is a man with lurking " job satisfaction " issues ?

Before condos in Williamsburg started selling at a loss and weekend flights to L.A. dropped to under $ 200 , New York ’s cocaine dealers were supplying good times to people who indulged like the party would n’t end .
Before the recession , “ I was making deliveries every night of the week , ” says Eddie , a middle - aged man who exclusively deals cocaine .
( All names have been changed . )
At the height of his career , in early 2008 , Eddie sold eight - balls to hipsters , financiers , and Upper West Side high - school students .
“ Back then , I could afford to pick and choose .
If I did n’t know the address — forget it .
If I did n’t like their accent — forget it .
On most nights , there were more people wanting than I could get to . ”
Sammy , another coke dealer , was equally aloof .
“ On weekends , I was making twenty house calls per night , ” he says , “ And there were always 20 to 25 that got shafted . ”
Then the stock market crashed , and people started losing Sammy ’s number .
But he did n’t lose theirs .
“ It was a 646 number , ” says Nate , 26 , who works at an investment bank ; he got three calls from Sammy in one week .
( Sammy ’s contacts — five years ’ worth — are stored in a small black notebook with cross streets , physical descriptors , and even sketches corresponding to each name . )
When Nate called back , Sammy picked up right away : “ He was like , Hey Nate , it ’s me , Sammy , where ya been ? ” Last November , Nate was forced to switch jobs , and took a notable pay cut .
“ It ’s not all fun and games anymore .
I told him thanks but no thanks . ”
Damien , 27 , who quit doing coke almost two years ago , has been contacted by three different cocaine dealers , all wanting his business , since June .
“ None of my friends mess with that anymore , ” Damien says , “ It ’s like they grew up overnight when the banks died . ”
Eddie was one of the dealers who has recently contacted Damien .
When demand first dropped , Eddie took a vacation .
But when the situation failed to improve , he decided to call every name in his phone book until he ’d arranged a deal .
“ It worked , ” he says .
“ I ’ll keep doing it until it stops working .
But I do n’t like small talk .
I do n’t like having to ask them how their day was . ”
Having to reach out to customers is n’t the worst of it .
“ I see high - end guys hawking in parks now , ” says Sammy .
“ And these are guys that used to sell to Paris Hilton ’s crowd . ” For Tim C. , a longtime street dealer whose headquarters are in Washington Square Park , the problem has trickled down .
He ’s now competing with those guys who used to do deliveries only : “ They come in like they own the place , and take all my business . ”
Things have been made worse by the fact that NYU freshman and other passersby are more resistant to his pitch .
“ These kids are clean , ” Tim says .
“ It sucks .
You ’re gonna find me at the post office if this goes on for much longer . ”
Homeless man bursts into flames after being Tasered by U.S. police
Daniel
Wood burst into flames after police tried to subdue him with a Taser gun .
He had been sniffing from an aerosol can
A homeless man caught fire after U.S. police shocked him with a Taser gun , it has been revealed .
Daniel Wood , 31 , was allegedly sniffing gas from an aerosol can as he ran through traffic when he was chased by two officers in Lancaster , Ohio .
One officer caught Wood and got him on the ground , where Wood continued to resist , according to the police report .
Another officer shouted a warning , then zapped Wood with the Taser , the report said .
Wood immediately burst into flames that covered his torso .
The officers were forced to drop their weapons and beat out the flames .
Wood said : ' My complete right half of my upper body is burned .
' I have bandages from my wrist all the way up my arm and across my chest . '
He admitted he had been inhaling vapours from a chemical cleaner in an attempt to get ' high ' .
Wood had been resisting arrest by attempting to bite the officers and lashing out with his feet .
In an attempt to subdue him police fired their Tasers which emit a charge of up to 50,000 volts .
Lancaster Police chief David Bailey said : ' Clearly , this is not the way we'd hoped to get started .
A demonstration of a Taser gun being used ( file picture )
' But I 'm glad the suspect is OK , and this gives us an opportunity to review how we will do things from this point . '
Chief Bailey said his officers acted appropriately given Wood 's aggressive behaviour .
He said : ' There was no recognition on the part of these officers that this would be the result .
' They did n't know the vapour was present and would flash .
It was n't as if the suspect was doused in a chemical . '
Wood , who has been arrested more than 50 times , has been charged with resisting arrest , assaulting a police officer and abusing harmful intoxicants .
It is an all - too familiar scene of environmental destruction .
Deep in a forest , heavy machinery has felled a giant swath of trees to leave bare scrubland and a handful of stumps as forlorn memorials .
The timber has long gone and cattle now pick their way across the clearing .
But the scene of this environmental vandalism is not Indonesia or the Amazon ; it is affluent Surrey .
And those responsible are not illegal loggers , but one of Britain 's largest and most influential conservation groups .
If it has its way , a forest near you could be next for the chop .
" Scots pine , Corsican pine , Japanese larch .
There are clues in the names .
These trees are not native to southern England , " says Mike Coates , a project manager with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds .
In a controversial move , the RSPB has set its sights on England 's non-native woodlands , which it wants to demolish to find space to restore a different type of English habitat , the open and rugged heathland immortalised in the novels of Thomas Hardy .
Dominated by heather and scrubby plants , such heathland is an increasingly rare sight in England , and so is the wildlife that relies upon it .
Coates says : " Woodland is very common compared with heathland .
But re-creating heathland is so much better for wildlife than a conifer plantation .
Lots of the birds that live in the conifer forests are common and can survive elsewhere .
Heathland stuff needs heathland , and much of it is very rare . "
Restoring heathland will help birds such as the nightjar and woodlark , he said , as well as rare insects , plants and reptiles , including the elusive adder , Britain 's only venomous snake .
The RSPB has made a start on its Farnham Heath reserve in Surrey , where it has cleared some 60 hectares ( 150 acres ) of conifer forest to make way for heathland , but it has bigger plans .
Ministers are poised to decide whether the Farnham Heath experiment should be repeated nationwide , across tens of thousands of hectares of government land run by the Forestry Commission .
The RSPB is lobbying hard that it should be .
It wants the government to double the 55,000 hectares ( 135,000 acres ) of lowland heathland in England by chopping down the non-native conifers that stand in the way .
Nick Phillips , RSPB 's biodiversity policy officer , says it is a " once in a generation " opportunity to revive heathland on a large scale .
Many of the trees in question were planted after the second world war , on cleared heathland , and are due to be harvested soon .
The old heather seeds are still in the ground , he says , but will not survive much longer .
" All you 've got to do is get the trees off to expose the buried heather seeds , get some sunlight and water and , bingo , in five years you 've got a heathland .
If you replant [ conifers ] after the trees are harvested , you 've blown it .
You can't restore heathland without it being much more difficult and time consuming . "
At a time of increased awareness of climate change and the merits of protecting forests to reduce emissions , it strikes some , including the Green party , as a strange move to chop down trees in the name of protecting the natural world .
The government 's own figures suggest such a large - scale clearance could increase Britain 's carbon emissions by up to 0.1 % .
Stuart Goodall , chief executive of the Confederation of Forest Industries , calls the idea " absolutely crazy " .
He adds : " The government is highlighting the importance of combating climate change and planting trees to lock up carbon , and here we have a proposal to chop trees down , release carbon and lose jobs , all for an environmental benefit that you can get from better management of existing heathland .
It just does n't add up . "
British companies have come to rely on the regular supply of softwood from the conifer forests , he says , which is used for construction , furniture and wood products such as fencing and pallets .
" The forestry sector is small and we can struggle to get our voice heard .
We are an easy target for the RSPB to pick on . "
He adds : " It is a fallacy to think that certain types of trees have no biodiversity benefit .
It 's just that conservation bodies do n't like them .
But plenty of local people like walking in these woods . "
Coates is unrepentant .
" It should be the right tree in the right place .
A field of barley is a field of grass , but it 's not a meadow ; it 's a crop .
In the same way , these are areas of land dominated by trees , but they are not woods , they are crops . "
Heathland restoration will help Britain to adapt to global warming , he says , by providing habitats for species such as the Dartford warbler to spread north with rising temperatures .
At the centre of the debate is the Forestry Commission , which is drawing up several policy options for ministers to choose from this autumn on the back of a summer consultation exercise .
Dominic Driver , of the commission , says that between 6,000 and 30,000 hectares ( 15,000 and 75,000 acres ) of conifer forest are likely to be removed over the next 10 to 15 years .
Privately - owned forests could also be converted , with the help of government grants .
Driver says lost trees will be replaced somehow .
" We can't have deforestation in the UK . "

How do our choices of amusements affect our behavior and , therefore , society ?
Whenever newer , more violent video games are released , some commentators inevitably call for government regulation because of studies linking video games and violence .
This became an issue at the beginning of this year when some officials argued for federal labeling guidelines .
Some time ago , I heard part of a radio program in which the host and her guests discussed how music , movies , and video games affect people 's behavior .
I did n't get to listen to the entire program , but there were a couple of things said during the part I listened to that I found interesting .
First , the host asked whether the fact that someone is committing crimes vicariously in video games — for example , taking on the role of a criminal in Grand Theft Auto — impacts their real - world behavior .
Second , one of the guests questioned whether the physical activity people are getting by playing Nintendo Wii is really doing much good for their health .
Legislation concerning what children and adults do with their free time is often supported by " expert " analysis along these lines .
Thus , attempts to regulate video games will have important implications for our safety and liberty .
The effect of video games on crime is not as obvious as it is often suggested .
The same guest mentioned that the perpetrators of the 1999 Columbine school shootings were avid video game players and reported that , according to rumors , one of them had practiced for the raid by creating a mock - up of their school using a map editor from one of their favorite first - person shooters .
Statistically , people who play violent video games are also those who are more likely to commit heinous crimes than others , and some experts infer from this correlation that violent video games encourage violence .
On its face , the connection seems clear .
However , whether there is a real , causal relationship between video games and violence , or whether that relationship is correlation , is a deeper and more complex issue .
For example , another plausible explanation is that the people who are likely to commit crimes are also likely to be attracted to violent video games .
Therefore , what we observe is simply correlation , with both phenomena being explained by a common third factor .
The hypothesis that video games cause crime is further complicated by the idea that violent video games might actually serve as a substitute for violent crime — that is , people who are likely to commit violent crimes might be able to get their violence " fix " by playing video games instead of committing crimes .
Regulating video games would thus treat a symptom of the disease , but not the disease itself .
Moreover , if video games are indeed a substitute for real - life violence , regulating the games might even make violence worse .
Studies of the relationship between pornography and rape suggest that this thesis is more plausible than it might seem at first .
Separate empirical studies by Winai Wongsurat and Todd Kendall have shown that increased access to pornography actually leads to reductions in the rates of divorce and rape .
Wongsurawat cites the availability of PO boxes , which increase access to pornographic magazines but do not have an independent effect on crime , to identify the effect of pornography on sex crimes and divorce .
Kendall looks specifically at the diffusion of internet pornography and shows that access to the internet and ( presumably ) internet pornography is associated with reductions in sex crime .
Kendall 's hypothesis that this is a causal relationship is strengthened by the fact that the effect is strongest for crimes committed by the group whose consumption of pornography is most likely to be affected by access to the internet : young males who live with their parents .
I am not aware of any studies that use similar methods to analyze the effect of video games on crime .
However , if people are going to advocate restrictions on liberty , the burden of proof is on them to demonstrate that their hypothesized relationship is real and widespread enough to cause concern .
For even if it is shown that violent video games lead to more crime , the case for government intervention is complicated by measurement issues , concerns over personal liberty and personal privacy , and the tendency for regulation to lead to ever more regulation .
Taking an " I - know - it - when - I - see - it " approach to identifying unacceptable video game violence — much like the standards currently used to define pornography — would introduce substantial uncertainty into production decisions , because there are no objective standards that define " acceptable " and " unacceptable . "
Politically made rules are also subject to political manipulation and a cat - and - mouse game of regulate - and - evade played by the regulators and the regulated .
This will wastefully consume resources and lead to further encroachments on individual freedom as standards are contested .
Attempts to regulate cultural goods like video games may involve far more than considerations of personal liberties alone .
Regulations that restrict access to pornography , for example , may actually increase the social problems they are intended to correct .
Regulations restricting access to violent video games could do the same .
EFF and a coalition of other consumer and privacy groups called on Congress today to protect Americans ' privacy from invasive online behavioral tracking and targeting .
In letters sent to the House Energy and Commerce Committee and two subcommittees , the groups delivered a legislative primer :
" Tracking people ’s every move online is an invasion of privacy .
It ’s like being followed by an invisible stalker – individuals are n’t aware that it ’s happening , who is tracking them , and how the information will be used .
They ’re not asked for their consent and have no meaningful control over the collection and use of their information , often by third - parties with which they have no relationships . "
These third - parties – companies like Omniture , Double Click , AdBrite – can can combine online activity across the Web with offline data , creating detailed profiles and serving ads based on users ' behavior .
As people increasingly use the Internet for health , financial , and other services , deeply personal information becomes available to advertisers .
Another reason to be concerned about behavioral tracking is the threat of inappropriate data collection by the government , which often gets private information about ordinary citizens from private companies .
Limiting commercial tracking of our online activities may also help protect against this threat .
Self - regulation by advertisers is not enough – legislation is needed to protect consumers .
The coalition 's recommendations outline what these laws need to ensure : that sensitive information is not collected or used for behavioral tracking and targeting , that websites and ad networks can't collect or use data for more than 24 hours without the consumer opting in , and that the data can't be used to affect anyone 's credit , employment , or insurance .
The recommendations appear all the more urgent in light of worrying new revelations from earlier this month on the leakage of private and personal information from social networking sites to advertising and tracking companies .
( More on this in a post next week . )
We hope that Congress pays close attention to these issues and recommendations .

Wann kommt der " Peak - Debt " ?
Rainer Sommer
Wurde nach der seit den 1970er Jahren erfolgten gigantischen Aufschuldung nun ein Wendepunkt erreicht ab dem die globalen Schulden zurückgehen und die Weltwirtschaft nur noch stagniert ?
Zweifellos ist die ökonomischen Zukunft der
Welt ebenso ungeklärt wie beängstigend : Während einige den baldigen Untergang des globalen Finanzsystems voraussagen ( Die Peta - Finanzbombe ) , sehen die Finanzmärkte die Krise offenbar bereits für überwunden an und sind zur normalen Tagesordnung übergegangen .
Lässt man die aktuelle Hysterie jedoch einmal beiseite und wirft einen Blick auf die langfristigen Entwicklungen , dann drängt sich dem Autor dieser Zeilen eine Frage auf , die erstaunlicherweise sonst kaum gestellt wird :
Gibt es so etwas wie einen „ Peak - Debt “ , einen Punkt , an dem die weltweite Gesamtverschuldung ihr Maximum erreicht und daraufhin wieder absinkt ?
Wurde dieser historische Wendepunkt vielleicht sogar bereits erreicht oder nur noch durch eine massive Ausweitung der öffentlichen Schulden hinausgeschoben , und was wären die Konsequenzen ?
Der Begriff „ Peak - Debt “ , der einfach mit „ Schuldenmaximum “ übersetzt werden könnte , würde dann eine Zäsur von historischen Dimensionen darstellen und den Beginn einer neuen weltwirtschaftlichen Phase mit unbekannten Qualitäten einläuten .
Er lehnt sich an den heftig umstrittenen Begriff des „ Peak - Oil “ an , der den Zeitpunkt angibt , an dem die weltweite Ölproduktion ihr absolutes Maximum erreichen soll .
In Bezug auf Finanzschulden wird dieser Begriff gelegentlich bei der Analyse individueller Kredithistorien verwendet und benennt den Zeitpunkt mit dem maximalen Schuldenstand eines Unternehmens oder einer Privatperson .
Für Nationalstaaten entspricht „ Peak - Debt “ analog dazu einem oberen Wendepunkt in der Summe aus öffentlichen und privaten Schulden , die der volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnung zu entnehmen ist .
Summiert man die Schuldenbilanzen der einzelnen Länder , erhält man folglich eine einzige Ziffer für die Gesamtverschuldung der Welt , deren oberer Wendepunkt eben mit Peak - Debt bezeichnet werden könnte .
Sollte dieser Punkt mit dem Ausbruch oder in Folge der Weltfinanzkrise erreicht werden , hätte der darauffolgende , weltweite Schuldenabbau wohl eine düstere Stagnationsphase zur Folge , die mit einschneidenden Veränderungen im Alltag der Menschen verbunden wäre .
Die Situation ist eigentlich ähnlich klar wie bei Peak - Oil :
Da es für niemanden möglich ist , immer neue Schulden anzuhäufen und sie ungestört nicht zurückzuzahlen , müsste auch für die gesamte
Welt gelegentlich ein Tag der Abrechnung kommen , ab dem nicht mehr weiter Aufgeschuldet werden kann , sondern getilgt werden muss .
Ebenso beim Öl : Da es im Boden nur eine begrenzte Menge an Öl gibt , kann die Produktion nicht unendlich lange gesteigert werden sondern muss irgendwann ihr Maximum erreichen , was für die US - amerikanische Ölproduktion übrigens Anfang der 1970er Jahre der Fall war .
Doch beim
Öl beispielsweise ist ungewiss , wie viel tatsächlich noch im Boden liegt und welche Methoden künftig angewandt werden können , um bislang unzugängliche Reserven zu nutzen .
Noch dazu werden die Öl - Reserven üblicherweise in Abhängigkeit vom Ölpreis angegeben und nur jene gezählt , die zum aktuellen Ölpreis profitabel gefördert werden können .
Folglich wachsen mit einem steigendem Ölpreis auch die ausgewiesenen Reserven , und umgekehrt , so dass die Streitereien auch unter den Experten längst kein Ende kennen .
Noch schwieriger dürften die Dinge bei einem Peak - Debt liegen , das in noch weit komplexere Zusammenhänge eingebettet ist .
So ist beispielsweise nicht klar , welche Schuldenniveaus langfristig tatsächlich tragfähig sind oder wie sehr zusätzliche Schulden vielleicht zu zusätzlichem Wachstum führen und so vielleicht bezahlbar werden Immerhin wird die aggregierte Verschuldung eines Landes üblicherweise in Relation zum BIP berechnet , so dass die Schuldenquote abgebaut werden kann , wenn das Wirtschaftswachstum den Schuldenzuwachs übersteigt .
Darüber hinaus zeigt die Geschichte der Menschheit die Tendenz , dass übermäßige Verschuldung oft zu Aufständen und Revolutionen führt , denen meistens zuerst die Gläubiger zum Opfer fallen .
Zudem bleibt die Methode der Inflationierung mit darauffolgender Währungsreform , bei der zumeist zumindest die öffentlichen Schulden auf Kosten der Gläubiger zuerst entwertet und dann wegreformiert werden .
Auf globaler Ebene hat man es überdies mit einer Reihe von gleichzeitig ablaufenden und teilweise gegenläufigen Schuldendynamiken zu tun , was die Sinnhaftigkeit einer Gesamtsumme ein wenig einschränkt .
Letztlich sollte man auch nicht vergessen , dass alle diese Schulden irgendwo als Vermögen verbucht sind , so dass man den Peak - Debt auch unter dem Aspekt der Ungleichheit der Vermögensverteilung betrachten könnte .
Allerdings ist es für einzelne Staaten durchaus nicht ungewöhnlich , nach einer starken Schuldenexpansion gezwungen zu sein , die Schulden in einem langwierigen und einige Opfer fordernden Prozess abzubauen .
Peak - Debt bei einzelnen Ländern
Was geschieht wenn ein großes Industrieland einen Peak - Debt erreicht , zeigt etwa das Beispiel Japans , dessen Gesamtverschuldung im Jahr 1998 mit 345 Prozent des BIP einen Höhepunkt erreicht hatte .
In der Folge hatte die Regierung ihren Schuldenanteil zwar von damals rund 80 Prozent auf mehr als 170 Prozent verdoppelt , insgesamt wurden die Schulden seither jedoch auf 283 Prozent des BIP reduziert .
Dafür hatten Unternehmen und Konsumenten massive Sparmaßnahmen ergreifen und ihre Schulden auf 113 Prozent des BIP mehr als halbieren müssen , so dass die private Verschuldung inzwischen hinter die Staatsschulden zurückgefallen ist .
Wenn nun ein einzelnes Land von einer derartigen Schuldenkrise betroffen ist , wird es üblicherweise gezwungen , sich über innere Sparmaßnahmen und den Außenhandel zu sanieren .
Denn da die heimische Währung in diesen Fällen gemeinhin entwertet wird , können ausländische Güter kaum noch bezahlt werden und die einheimische Produktion gewinnt am Weltmarkt an Konkurrenzfähigkeit .
So kann der den Sparmaßnahmen zum Opfer gefallene privaten Konsum teilweise durch Export ersetzen werden , was etwa Schweden und Argentinien nach ihren Schuldenkrisen relativ rasch aus der Krise geholfen hat .
Zwar hat auch Japan die Auswirkungen seiner schweren Finanzkrise durch Exporte lindern können , doch wurde hier der Weg gewählt , den privaten Konsum stark durch zunehmend unproduktive öffentliche Investitionen zu substituieren .
Das hat offenbar dazu beigetragen , dass Japans strukturelle Probleme nur noch weiter verschärft wurden und der Staat seiner Verschuldungsgrenze inzwischen gefährlich nahe gekommen sein dürfte .
Folgen des letzten globalen Peak - Debt
Betrachtet man nun die globalen Entwicklungen , dann dürfte die Welt den letzten Peak - Debt am Ende des 2 .
Weltkriegs erlebt haben .
Damals hatte die
Welt eine mehr als zehnjährige Weltwirtschaftskrise und einen Weltkrieg hinter sich , der etwa die öffentlichen Schulden der USA auf rund 120 Prozent des BIP getrieben hatte .
Nirgendwo in der
Welt sah es viel besser aus .
Allerdings hatten viele Menschen härteste Zeiten durchgemacht und wollten nun nichts anderes , als sich in Frieden mit Arbeit einen bescheidenen Wohlstand zu erarbeiten , zumindest lauten so die Mythen über die Aufbaugeneration .
Jedenfalls bot die weitgehende Zerstörung der
Welt enorm viel Raum für Aufbauarbeit , die auch durch eine Währungsreform ermöglicht wurde , bei der das britische Pfund seine Position als Weltleitwährung verlor und durch den US - Dollar ersetzt wurde .
Mit der Vereinbarung von Bretton Woods wurde der Dollar als Leitwährung etabliert , an den alle anderen Währungen durch fixe Wechselkurse gebunden waren .
Gleichzeitig verpflichtete sich die US Notenbank Fed ihre Dollars stets zu einem festgelegten Wechselkurs in Gold zu tauschen , allerdings galt diese Umtauschverpflichtung nur gegenüber anderen Notenbanken .
Diese Verpflichtung konnte die Fed überdies nur deshalb eingehen , weil die USA schon in den 1930er Jahren den Besitz von Gold verboten und die Vorräte eingezogen hatte .
Außerdem waren den USA mit dem Sieg im 2 .
Weltkrieg auch die Goldvorräte Japans in die Hände gefallen , die dieses zuvor in einem beispiellosen Raubzug quer durch Asien angehäuft hatte .
Gesamtschulden der USA in Relation zum BIP .
Grafik : Fed
Weltweit waren die Notenbanken nun zudem verpflichtet , abhängig von ihrem Geldumlauf Reserven in Gold oder ausländischen Währungen zu halten , was die Zentralbanken zur Beschränkung der umlaufenden Kredite zwang .
So lange die USA Exportüberschüsse erzielten und die heimische Inflation unter Kontrolle halten konnten , funktionierte das System auf globaler Ebene dann auch sehr gut .
Die Schulden gingen weltweit stetig zurück und dennoch stieg der Lebensstandard wenigstens in den Industrieländern deutlich an und Länder wie Deutschland und Japan erlebten sogar ein „ Wirtschaftswunder “ .
Anzeichen für einen historischen Wendepunkt
Um 1970 dürften die globale Verschuldung zwar ihren Tiefpunkt erreicht haben , nachdem Japan und Deutschland in den 1960er Jahren aber zu führenden Exportnationen aufgestiegen waren und die USA den Vietnamkrieg über eine weltweite Inflation finanzieren wollten , erwies sich das System als viel zu starr und unflexibel .
Als die Spannungen 1971 / 72 zunehmend unerträglich wurden , hat man das System von Bretton Woods sang - und klanglos zu Grabe getragen .
Seither bestimmen die Finanzmärkte die Wechselkurse der westlichen Währungen und die systemimmanenten Kreditbeschränkungen entfielen .
In der Folge setzte eine weltweite Kreditexpansion ein , die in mehreren Wellen bis heute andauert und die Gesamtverschuldungsniveaus vieler Länder inzwischen weit über den Peak - Debt von 1945 hinausgetragen hat .
Nun mehren sich freilich die Anzeichen für einen historischen Wendepunkt , an dem die Welt nach dem jahrzehntelangen Schuldenaufbau nun in eine Phase des globalen Schuldenabbaus übergehen könnte .
Immerhin hat der Finanzcrash gezeigt , dass es jedenfalls den Finanzmärkten nicht möglich ist , das „ Leverage “ unbegrenzt zu steigern .
Und so besteht selbst an der Wall Street nun kein Zweifel , dass die Verschuldung im Finanzsektor nun einige Zeit lang werde zurückgehen müssen .
Tatsächlich erscheint das globale „ Deleveraging “ an den Finanzmärkten inzwischen zwar gebremst , aber nach wie vor in Gang zu sein , wobei selbst Wall - Street - Analysten dies noch für einige weitere Jahre prognostizieren .
Für die Realwirtschaft , also für die Unternehmen und die Konsumenten , dürfte der Finanzcrash zwei gegenläufige Schuldendynamiken initiiert haben .
Zum einen kommt durch die Krise generell Sand ins wirtschaftliche Gefüge .
Durch rückgängige Einkommen / Umsätze entstehen zwangsläufig viele Liquiditätslücken , die durch neue Kredite gedeckt werden müssen , um die bestehenden Verpflichtungen zu erfüllen .
Umgekehrt verschärfen die Banken die Kreditstandards und sicherlich sinkt auch die Neigung der Unternehmen zu investieren bzw .
jene der Konsumenten , auf Kredit zu konsumieren , was die private Kreditnachfrage drastisch reduziert haben dürfte .
Insgesamt sollten die kontraktiven Elemente also bei weitem überwiegen , insbesondere da in der Industrie große Überkapazitäten bestehen und die Konsumenten im führenden Industrieland USA offenbar bereits an ihre Verschuldungsobergrenze gestoßen sind .
Ob die bislang noch kaum verschuldeten Konsumenten in den Emerging Markets ihr verbliebenes Verschuldungspotential nun so weit ausnutzen , um die absehbare Stagnation in den reichen Ländern aufzufangen , darf angesichts der generell sehr geringen Einkommen in diesen Ländern und vor allem der vermutlich mangelnden Finanzierungsbereitschaft der dortigen Banken bezweifelt werden .
Jedenfalls ist klar , dass seit 2007 / 2008 einzig die öffentliche Verschuldung dafür verantwortlich ist , wenn die weltweite Gesamtverschuldung auch zuletzt noch angestiegen ist .
Die Rekorddefizite , die in den führenden Industrieländern in diesem Jahr erreicht werden , gelten aber überall als vorübergehend und einmalig und können wohl kaum noch Jahre lang aufrechterhalten werden , da die Finanzierungsbereitschaft der Finanzmärkte bei weiter ansteigenden Defiziten wohl rasch an ihre Grenzen stoßen dürfte .
Spätestens dann wäre nach mehr als 60 Jahren ein neuer Peak - Debt mit unabsehbaren Folgen erreicht .
Denn sicherlich würde es dann kaum einem Land möglich sein , die Schuldenkrise über den Außenhandel zu bewältigen .
Ebenso erscheint unmöglich , sich durch starkes Wirtschaftswachstum von den Schulden zu befreien .
In dieser Situation wären nicht nur flächendeckende Einkommensverluste zu erwarten , weil dann künftig ja der stärkste Wachstumsantrieb der letzten drei Jahrzehnte entfiele , nämlich die stetig und immer schneller anwachsende Verschuldung .
Dementsprechend könnte ein globaler Schuldenabbau selbstverstärkend in eine lange andauernde und extrem zerstörerische Abwärtsspirale münden .
Vielleicht bleibt es aber auch bei einem nur kurzen Rückgang , dem rasch wieder die nächste Kreditexpansion folgen könnte .

The money will help Bletchley Park become a world heritage centre
Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire , the top secret code - breaking hub of World War II , has been awarded nearly £ 500,000 of lottery funds .
The development money from the Heritage Lottery Fund will help the historic site become a world heritage and educational centre .
It is the first step towards a target of £ 10 m to completely revamp the site .
The home of the code - breakers has been open to the public since 1994 but is in an advanced state of dilapidation .
Without their dedication , our nation 's history might have been a very different one

Some of Britain 's best brains spent the war cracking enemy codes at Bletchley Park , with many historians agreeing that their efforts shortened the war by two years .
The codebreakers ' success allowed the Allies to know in advance what German forces were planning .
Interest in Bletchley has been growing , with nearly 100,000 visitors so far this year .
Carole Souter , from the Heritage Lottery Fund , said : " Bletchley Park is an extraordinary part of the UK 's heritage .
" We ... recognise the importance of preserving the site as a tribute to the men and women who worked there with quiet and tireless dedication during World War II .
" Without their dedication , our nation 's history might have been a very different one . "
Wetsuit Helps Bald Penguin to Aviod Sunburn
Ralph , a nine - year - old Humboldt penguin wears a custom - made wetsuit that might just save his life .
Ok , so it ’s not designed by Armani or Versace but it ’s good enough to protect Ralph from the harmful rays of the sun .
Unfortunately for him , Ralph lost all of his feathers in just one day , instead of five weeks , as it usually happens , so the caretakers at Marwell Wildlife Center had to find a way to protect his sensitive pink skin from sunburns .
They came up with the original idea of converting the leg of a human wetsuit into a penguin wetsuit .
It did n’t seem to bother Ralph and the other penguins , although curious at first , accepted Ralph into the group .

NEW YORK --
Facing the prospect of spending at least 3 ½ years behind bars , one - time Super Bowl star Plaxico Burress on Thursday accepted a plea bargain with a two - year prison sentence for a firearm charge .
The charge stemmed from an incident in which Burress accidentally shot himself in the thigh at a Manhattan nightclub .
The former New York Giants wide receiver pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal possession of a weapon , a lesser charge than he had faced .
He will be sentenced Sept. 22 , and lawyer Benjamin Brafman said he expects Burress to begin serving his sentence immediately after .
Burress got into a black SUV without speaking to reporters outside a Manhattan courthouse , but Brafman said , " After an agonizing period of discussion , Plaxico decided that he wanted to do this , to put this behind him as quickly as possible . "

Burress was indicted earlier this month on two counts of criminal possession of a weapon and one count of reckless endangerment .
He faced a minimum sentence of 3 ½ years if convicted at trial .
Hours after Burress ' court appearance , the NFL announced that commissioner Roger Goodell has suspended the receiver and said Burress is ineligible to sign with any team until he completes his prison term .
After that , Burress may sign with an NFL team without further review .
Goodell , who met with Burress and his representatives last week , decided the case did n't need to be reviewed again later because he already had decided to suspend Burress for one season , sources told ESPN senior NFL analyst Chris Mortensen .
If Burress had entered a not - guilty plea Thursday , Goodell would have suspended him for the upcoming season , sources told Mortensen .
The guilty plea ends months of haggling between Brafman and the Manhattan district attorney 's office .
The case went to a grand jury after negotiations broke down , apparently because District Attorney Robert Morgenthau was insisting that Burress serve at least two years in prison .
Morgenthau did not comment on Burress ' guilty plea .
During the last few days a new Radiohead song was mysteriously released onto the Internet .
The track is called " These Are My Twisted Words " and until today it was unclear where it had come from .
Now , thanks to a post on the band 's blog , it seems the boys could 've had it planned all along , as they are now linking to the song on Mininova .
Radiohead are no strangers to BitTorrent after the well - documented pay - what - you - like “ In Rainbows ” album unofficially racked up many thousands of downloads using the protocol .
Late last week the band ’s BitTorrent link was revitalized after a new Radiohead track leaked onto the Internet .
After this advance release of “ These Are My Twisted Words , ” rumors began to grow that Radiohead themselves might be behind the ‘ leak ’ .
Speculation grew on the back of comments made by Thom Yorke of the band to The Believer : “ We ’ve actually got a good plan , but I ca n’t tell you what it is , because someone will rip it off .
But we ’ve got this great idea for putting things out ” .
Today , on the band ’s Dead Air Space blog , Jonny Greenwood ( lead guitar and keyboard ) seems to solve the mystery :
So here ’s a new song , called ‘ These Are My Twisted Words ’ .
We ’ve been recording for a while , and this was one of the first we finished .
We ’re pretty proud of it .
There ’s other stuff in various states of completion , but this is one we ’ve been practicing , and which we ’ll probably play at this summer ’s concerts .
Hope you like it .
At the bottom of the post are two links to downloads , one directly from Waste and the other the original torrent uploaded to Mininova a few days ago .
In fact , it was uploaded twice .
An enthusiastic commenter on Mininova exclaims : “ OMFG !
This torrent is being redirected from the radiohead official store , so there ’s no album , just this song finished , this is very edgy , i mean thom yorke is way ahead from any other artist , at least we know he ’s not doing his music to get some profit , at least not anymore , this is history being made , again , GREAT ! ”
Sounds like the first of many happy listeners .
Mininova is happy with Radiohead ’s move also .
The site ’s co-founder Erik Dubbelboer told TorrentFreak : “ It ’s great to see that artists use Mininova to distribute and promote their content for free .
We encourage everyone to do this , which is why we provide our Content Distribution service . ”
Radiohead uploaded the torrent the old fashioned way though , seeding it themselves .
Apparently they are well aware of the latest developments in the BitTorrent community , as they used the newly founded OpenBitTorrent tracker .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Scientists have discovered a new species of giant rat in a remote rainforest in Papua New Guinea .
The newly discovered rat is similar in size and weight to this one found by scientists in 2007 .
Measuring 82 centimeters ( 32.2 inches ) from nose to tail and weighing around 1.5 kilograms ( 3.3 pounds ) , the species is thought to be one of the largest rats ever to be found .
The discovery was made by a team from the BBC Natural History Unit inside the crater of Mount Bosavi -- an extinct volcano in the Southern Highlands province of Papua New Guinea .
" This is one of the world 's largest rats .
It 's a true rat , the same kind you find in the city sewers , " said Kristofer Helgen , a biologist from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History , who was part of the expedition team .
Initial examinations of the rat -- provisionally named the Bosavi woolly rat -- suggest that it belongs to the Mallomys -- a genus of rodents in the muridae family which are the largest living species of rodent .
In 2007 , a similar species of giant rat was found in the Foja Mountains in the Papua province of Indonesia in New Guinea Island .
The team of scientists which made the new discovery included experts on bats , birds , mammals and reptiles found a number of new species .
George McGavin , a Research Associate at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and The Department of Zoology of Oxford University told CNN : " It 's hard to be sure exactly how many new species we have found , but it is more than 30 .
" To find new species of insects in this region is n't uncommon , but we found sixteen new frog species , one new bat species and at least three new fish , and this giant bloody rat -- the size of a cat .
Amazing ! "
McGavin said the inside of the crater -- which he says measures around three kilometers in diameter -- was spectacular .
" The animals inside this crater were unafraid of humans , pretty much because they had n't seen them very much , " McGavin said .
Most local inhabitants , McGavin explained , tend to hunt outside the crater .
" They do n't really go into the crater to hunt because it 's such a trek up and back down from it . "
The newly discovered rats are n't the world 's largest rodent species .
Native to South America , capybaras -- which look more like hairy pigs than rats -- weigh in at around 55 kilograms and can be up to 1.5 meters long .
McGavin and the team spent six weeks in the region investigating species .
During that time it became abundantly clear to the team just how endangered these habitats are .
" What we are trying to do , " said McGavin , " is highlight the fact that these habitats are terribly threatened .
In fact , only 20 miles away from where we were the wood was being extracted . "
Research published in the journal Biotropica in June 2008 estimated that over a quarter of Papua New Guinea 's forests had been either destroyed or damaged between 1972 and 2002 .
" Humans ca n't seem to agree on anything , but we should at least agree that forest habitats like this one should be conserved ; not only because 80 percent of the world 's species live in forests , but if we are going to avoid the worst affects of global warming we 've got to keep these forests , " McGavin said .
Next March , the team is traveling to Bhutan in search of more new species .

Despite feminists ' reputation , and contra my own individual reputation cultivated over five years of public opinion - making as a blogger , I am not a man-hater .
If I played by misogynists ' rules , specifically the one that dictates it only takes one woman doing one mean or duplicitous or disrespectful or unlawful or otherwise bad thing to justify hatred of all women , I would have plenty of justification for hating men , if I were inclined to do that sort of thing .
Most of my threatening hate mail comes from men .
The most unrelentingly trouble - making trolls at my blog , Shakesville , have always been men .
I 've been cat - called and cow - called from moving vehicles countless times , subjected to other forms of street harassment and sexually harassed at work , always by men .
I have been sexually assaulted – if one includes rape , attempted rape , unsolicited touching of breasts , buttocks and / or genitals , nonconsensual frottage on public transportation and flashing – by dozens of people during my lifetime , some known to me , some strangers , all men .
But I do n't hate men , because I play by different rules .
In fact , there are men in this world whom I love quite a lot .
There are also individual men in this world I would say I probably hate , or something close – men who I hold in unfathomable contempt .
But it is not because they are men .
No , I do n't hate men .
It would , however , be fair to say that I do n't easily trust them .
My mistrust is not , as one might expect , primarily a result of the violent acts done on my body , nor the vicious humiliations done to my dignity .
It is , instead , born of the multitude of mundane betrayals that mark my every relationship with a man : the casual rape joke , the use of a female slur , the careless demonising of the feminine in everyday conversation , the accusations of overreaction , the eye rolling and exasperated sighs in response to polite requests to please not use misogynist epithets in my presence or to please use non-gendered language ( " humankind " ) .
There are the insidious assumptions guiding our interactions – the supposition that I will regard being exceptionalised as a compliment ( " you 're not like those other women " ) , and the presumption that I am an ally against certain kinds of women .
Surely , we 're all in agreement that Britney Spears is a dirty slut who deserves nothing but a steady stream of misogynist vitriol whenever her name is mentioned , right ?
Always the subtle pressure to abandon my principles to trash this woman or that woman , as if I 'll never twig to the reality that there 's always a justification for unleashing the misogyny , for hating a woman in ways reserved only for women .
I am exhorted to join in the cruel revelry , and when I refuse , suddenly the target is on my back .
And so it goes .
There are the jokes about women , about wives , about mothers , about raising daughters , about female bosses .
They are told in my presence by men who are meant to care about me , just to get a rise out of me , as though I am meant to find funny a reminder of my second - class status .
I am meant to ignore that this is a bullying tactic , that the men telling these jokes derive their amusement specifically from knowing they upset me , piss me off , hurt me .
They tell them and I can laugh , and they can thus feel superior , or I can not laugh , and they can thus feel superior .
Heads they win , tails I lose .
I am used as a prop in an ongoing game of patriarchal posturing , and then I am meant to believe it is true when some of the men who enjoy this sport , in which I am their pawn , tell me : " I love you . "
I love you , my daughter .
I love you , my niece .
I love you , my friend .
I am meant to trust these words .
There are the occasions that men – intellectual men , clever men , engaged men – insist on playing devil 's advocate , desirous of a debate on some aspect of feminist theory or reproductive rights or some other subject generally filed under the heading Women 's Issues .
These intellectual , clever , engaged men want to endlessly probe my argument for weaknesses , wrestle over details , argue just for fun .
And they wonder , these intellectual , clever , engaged men , why my voice keeps rising and why my face is flushed and why , after an hour of fighting my corner , hot tears burn the corners of my eyes .
Why do you have to take this stuff so personally ?
ask the intellectual , clever , and engaged men , who have never considered that the content of the abstract exercise that 's so much fun for them is the stuff of my life .
There is the perplexity at my fury that my life experience is not considered more relevant than the opinionated pronouncements of men who make a pastime of informal observation , as if womanhood were an exotic locale which provides magnificent fodder for the amateur ethnographer .
And there is the haughty dismissal of my assertion that being on the outside looking in does n't make one more objective .
It merely provides a different perspective .
There are the persistent , tiresome pronouncements of similitude between men's and women 's experiences , the belligerent insistence that handsome men are objectified by women , too , that women pinch men's butts sometimes , too , that men are expected to look a certain way at work , too , that women rape , too , and other equivalencies that conveniently and stupidly ignore institutional inequities that mean X rarely equals Y .
And there are the long - suffering groans that meet any attempt to contextualise sexism and refute the idea that such indignities , grim though they all may be , are not necessarily equally oppressive .
There are the stereotypes – oh , the abundant stereotypes – about women , not me , of course , but other women , those women with their bad driving and their relentless shopping habits and their PMS and their disgusting vanity and their inability to stop talking and their disinterest in Important
Things and their trying to trap men and their getting pregnant on purpose and their false rape accusations and their being bitches , sluts , whores , cunts .
And I am expected to nod in agreement , and I am nudged and admonished to agree .
I am expected to say these things are not true of me , but are true of women ( am I seceding from the union ? ) .
I am expected to put my stamp of token approval on the stereotypes .
Yes , it 's true .
Between you and me , it 's all true .
That 's what is wanted from me .
Abdication of my principles and pride , in service to a patriarchal system that will only use my collusion to further subjugate me .
This is a thing that is asked of me by men who purport to care for me .
There is the unwillingness to listen , a ferociously stubborn not getting it on so many things , so many important things .
And the obdurate refusal to believe , to internalise , that my outrage is not manufactured and my injury not make - believe – an inflexible rejection of the possibility that my pain is authentic , in favour of the consolatory belief that I am angry because I 'm a feminist ( rather than the truth : that I 'm a feminist because I 'm angry ) .
And there is the denial about engaging in misogyny , even when it 's evident , even when it 's pointed out gently , softly , indulgently , carefully , with goodwill and the presumption that it was not intentional .
There is the firm , fixed , unyielding denial – because it is better and easier to imply that I 'm stupid or crazy or hysterical , that I have imagined being insulted by someone about whom I care ( just for the fun of it ! ) , than it is to just admit a bloody mistake and say , simply : I 'm sorry .
Not every man does all of these things , or even most of them , and certainly not all the time .
But it only takes one , randomly and occasionally , exploding in a shower of cartoon stars like an unexpected punch in the nose , to send me staggering sideways , wondering what just happened .
Well .
I certainly did n't see that coming .
These things are not the habits of deliberately cruel men .
They are , in fact , the habits of the men in this world I love quite a lot .
All of whom have given me reason to mistrust them , to use my distrust as a self - protection mechanism , as an essential tool to get through every day , because I never know when I might next get knocked off - kilter with something that puts me in the position , once again , of choosing between my dignity and the serenity of our relationship .
It can come out of nowhere , and usually does .
Which leaves me mistrustful by both necessity and design .
Not fearful , just resigned – and on my guard .
More vulnerability than that allows for the possibility of wounds that do not heal .
Wounds to our relationship , the sort of irreparable damage that leaves one unable to look in the eye someone that you loved once upon a time .
This , then , is the terrible bargain we have regretfully struck :
Men are allowed the easy comfort of their unexamined privilege , but my regard will always be shot through with a steely , anxious bolt of caution .
A shitty bargain all around , really .
But there it is .
There are men who will read this post and think , huffily , dismissively , that a person of colour could write a post very much like this one about white people , about me .
That 's absolutely right .
So could a lesbian , a gay man , a bisexual , an asexual .
So could a trans or intersex person ( which hardly makes a comprehensive list ) .
I 'm OK with that .
I do n't feel hated .
I feel mistrusted – and I understand it .
I respect it .
It means , for me , I must be vigilant and make myself trustworthy .
Every day .
I hope those men will hear me when I say , again , I do not hate you .
I mistrust you .
You can tell yourselves that 's a problem with me , some inherent flaw , some evidence that I am fucked up and broken and weird .
You can choose to believe that the women in your lives are nothing like me .
Or you can be vigilant and make yourselves trustworthy .
Every day .
Just in case they 're more like me than you think .
Postscript
This piece was originally published at Shakesville on 14 August .
In the interceding days , it has been widely linked and extensively discussed and has spawned dozens of posts by other writers on intersectional topics such as transphobia , fat hatred , disablism and racism , among others .
It has also been uncommonly quoted – and , rather than one good line or passage being repeatedly singled out , as is typical , nearly every part of this piece has been excerpted somewhere , each paragraph meaningful to different people for different reasons , countless individual experiences rarely shared , seldom discussed .
At the request of readers who wanted this conversation to be ongoing , we 've had three follow - up threads at Shakesville so far , and I 've received an enormous amount of email in response , the vast majority of it from women thanking me for writing it and sharing with me the sometimes funny , sometimes infuriating , and sometimes genuinely tragic details of their own terrible bargains struck with partners , fathers , brothers , friends , bosses .
I 've also received emails from men , most of it also grateful and complimentary , though some of it critical – and most of that from readers who fundamentally misunderstood that I was writing about men who are important to me .
That 's not , of course , an incidental fact .
It is the centrepiece of the essay , which I wrote in response to a need that took its shape in the comment threads of Shakesville and in my conversations with female friends , formed by frequent references , sometimes oblique and slightly embarrassed , sometimes blunt and angry , to women 's upsetting interactions with the men in their lives about whom they care .
The subject is one of the most popular themes of emails I get from women : I 'm paying more attention to the things my male partner / father / brother / male best friend says , and I 'm challenging him more , and I am scared that if I said everything I wanted to say , our relationship would explode into a million pieces .
It is a discussion that feminist women talk around a lot , but never quite have in detail , that men we love express misogyny , and that it is alienating , functionally undermining the intimacy of the relationship and , sometimes , the entire relationship itself .
It 's so much easier to talk about misogyny emanating from men who do n't care about us , and about whom we do n't care .
This is a much more difficult subject , one I had been trying to find a way to broach in a meaningful way for awhile .
To miss the point that it 's not about " men " , but about individual and specific men with whom individual and specific women have individual and specific relationships , is to miss the point entirely .
It 's not about " misogyny " , but about how misogyny functions in intimate and familiar relationships .
In wanted relationships .
Or , as the case may be , in unwanted but nonetheless existing relationships , from which extricating oneself is difficult , complicated or biologically impossible .
And in some cases imminent : Women have told me stories of showing the piece to a partner only to have him react in a way that confirmed their worst fears .
I have been asked how my husband reacted to the piece .
He reacted by proudly tweeting it , emailing me to tell me he loved it and pointing to the places in which he saw himself , things he 's done , things we 've talked about .
It 's not like we 've never argued , or that I 've never had to explain where I 'm coming from , but the thing he 's always had going for him is that he does n't want to hurt me .
( A sentiment I return , naturally . )
And so he 's been willing to hear me out when I say :
What you 're doing is hurting me .
If he had n't been , our relationship would n't exist .
If I could n't say " this behaviour hurts me " and have that matter , I could n't feel safe .
If I can't trust you to care when I tell you you 've hurt me , how can I trust you at all ?
That 's the terror underlying this terrible bargain , the secret we do n't speak .
Or did n't , until I made a little noise and a cacophony of voices rose .
Recortan temas de historia ; primero y sexto grados llegan sin ejemplares de matemáticas
[ email protected ]
Los libros de texto que hoy reciben alumnos de primaria contienen “ graves retrocesos y errores ” , advertidos por especialistas a la Secretaría de Educación Pública ( SEP ) , dependencia que al final consideró “ una necesidad imperiosa ” entregarlos a tiempo aunque sean “ perfectibles ” .
En materia de historia , Olac Fuentes Molinar , investigador de la Universidad Pedagógica Nacional y ex subsecretario de Educación Básica , menciona que el plan de estudios es “ muy extraño ” porque “ se trataba de articular una historia de México con la humanidad , que abordaba la Conquista , la Colonia ” .
Sin embargo , el académico afirmó que el tema fue recortado porque no llega ni a la Conquista .
Desde su perspectiva , la Reforma Integral de la Educación Básica es “ caótica ” , presenta excesos de información , solicita al padre de familia muchos materiales en tiempos de crisis económica , tiene inadecuaciones al lenguaje de los niños y pide , entre otros puntos , que se domine la lectura en el primer grado .
Por otra parte , en el área de matemáticas los expertos lograron detener la impresión de los libros de primero y sexto grados debido a que hay “ errores básicos ” .
Los alumnos de estos niveles recibirán únicamente un “ Cuaderno de Trabajo ” .
En las evaluaciones sobre enseñanza de matemáticas que la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico ( OCDE ) realiza entre sus países miembros , México ha quedado en los últimos lugares de desempeño .
Respecto a otras inexactitudes , los especialistas sugirieron que para reparar los errores en los libros de Geografía , Ciencias Naturales y Español se envíe una fe de erratas a los maestros .
Sobre el tema , el titular de la SEP , Alonso Lujambio , admite “ pequeñas fallas , pero no es la característica de los libros ” y asegura que estará atento a “ las propuestas y a las críticas ” .
En este contexto , sólo 25 % de los 123 mil 856 aspirantes a ocupar una plaza de profesor en las escuelas públicas del país logró una calificación “ aceptable ” en el Examen Nacional de Conocimientos y Habilidades Docentes .
Del resto , 71 % “ requiere nivelación ” y 4 % obtuvo un resultado “ no aceptable ” , según la SEP .
De los 5 mil 29 candidatos “ no aceptados ” , hay 3 mil 552 que han dado clases durante los últimos 10 años , informó la Secretaría de Educación .
Más de 25 millones de alumnos de preescolar , primaria y secundaria inician hoy el ciclo escolar 2009 - 2010 .
Afghanistan Tanklastzug - Attacke zwingt Minister Jung in die Defensive
" Großer Fehler " , " ernster Vorfall " , " eine Tragödie " : Die Bundeswehr gerät nach dem von ihr bestellten Nato - Luftangriff in Afghanistan international in die Kritik .
Auch im Inland formiert sich Protest wegen der Attacke mit vielen Toten - die Opposition sieht eine Mitschuld bei Verteidigungsminister Jung .
It ’s not just biblical texts that believers must complain about .
It is God himself .
Biblical literature is clear on this point : it is connatural to a believer to criticize God .
That ’s what Moses and the prophets do .
That ’s what David and his fellow psalmists do .
That ’s what Job does .
That ’s what Jesus does from the cross , in the words of Psalm 22 : “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
It is right and good and a joyful thing to complain and criticize whenever there is a gap between the truth we associate with God and the facts on the ground .
Truth of redemptive significance is bound to be counterfactual .
God , therefore , is bound to be counterfactual .
To be sure , the world is full of people who have no need of redemption .
They are the wealthy .
They will never have a need to criticize God or the way things are .
Many status - quo people call themselves liberals .
Others self - identify as conservatives .
It does n’t matter .
They have bought into a “ live and let die ” philosophy .
A “ live and let die ” philosophy is forbidden to the believer in the God of Moses and the believer in the God of Jesus .
That does not change the fact that such a philosophy is , beyond an arbitrary circle we draw around ourselves and the ones we care about , the default position of all human beings .
What matters is the context in which complaints and criticism occur .
Do I make the criticism because I expect God or scripture to answer my questions and I will not rest until I find my rest in God and his Word ?
Or because I 've decided that God and his Word are something I need to protect myself against , because I 've found a higher standard of truth by which to judge them both ?
If the latter , I have not ceased to be a believer .
I have probably become a truer believer than before , in the strong sense of Eric Hoffer .
I simply believe in something other than the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
I simply believe in something other than the God who called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees ( Gen 12 ) , endangered and then rescued Isaac ( Gen 21 ) , and wrestled with Jacob ( Gen 32 ) .
It is also possible for a believer to reject a part of scripture definitively , and still remain a believer .
As I remember it – I heard it from Käsemann himself – the great NT exegete Ernst Käsemann once stood up in an official context of his church and argued with great passion on behalf of removing Romans 13 from Scripture .
Of course Romans 13 remains a part of Scripture , but no one criticized Käsemann for his speech .
Who would ?
Everyone knew he had lost his beloved daughter in Argentina in the dark days in which a military junta tortured and “ disappeared ” their political opponents .
Including Käsemann ’s daughter .
Put yourself in the professor ’s shoes .
Walk in his boots .
Now read Romans 13 .
Because he was a believer , I submit , he railed against that text .
Playing around with some Calla Lilies this week and came up with this shot and a few others , I have finally got the urge to shoot again after a long winter and basketball season , I forgot how much I enjoyed it .
I am hoping to get a break in the weather , it is up to almost 50 today and tomorrow is supposed to be even warmer , but alas we are expecting a couple snow or rain systems to push thru this week and bring us back to winter .
But I am feeling better because it wo n’t be long before I am outside and shooting again , so I should be able to post alot more images than I have lately , thanks for stopping by and taking a look .

US and Cuba in high - level talks
Relations between the US and Cuba have been frosty for decades A senior American diplomat held high - level talks with the Cuban government during a visit to Havana earlier this month , US officials have confirmed .
It was the highest - level contact between the two sides in years .
State department official Bisa Williams held the talks with Cuba 's deputy foreign minister .
The decades - old US trade embargo on Cuba remains , but there has been an easing of tension since US President Barack Obama came to power in January .
Earlier this month , Ms Williams , the deputy assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs , was part of a US delegation that went to Havana to discuss the possible resumption of direct postal services between the two nations .
Direct services were suspended in 1963 and currently post must go through third countries , meaning it can take several weeks to arrive .
Ms Williams stayed on in Cuba after the postal service discussions for five more days , says the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana .
US diplomats say she also held separate meetings with a number of dissidents on the island .
Travel eased US President Barack Obama earlier this month extended the 47 - year - old trade embargo against Cuba .
Mr Obama has indicated he would be open to dialogue with Cuba 's leaders .
But he has said that , like previous American presidents , he will only consider a full lifting of the embargo once Cuba 's communist government makes significant moves such as the holding of democratic elections .
However , in a sign of thawing relations , he has eased travel restrictions for Americans wanting to visit Cuba and the two countries are holding direct talks on immigration .
Cuba 's President Raul Castro has said he is prepared to negotiate with the Obama administration , providing there are no preconditions .
His brother , former President Fidel Castro , also last week praised Mr Obama for his commitment to tackling climate change .
But our correspondent says no - one is expecting any rapid breakthroughs on core issues such as ending the decades old trade embargo .
Instead both sides are looking at ways of working together on confidence building measures such as immigration and postal services and possibly anti-drug smuggling co-operation .
News of Bisa Williams extended stay suggests that this quiet diplomacy is starting to gather pace .

I 'm not sure how soon " soon " is , and I suppose it all depends on if and when the SABC sorts itself out .
Anyway , the ghost hunting team is
I 'm sure that creative editing , such as in the U.S.A .
Ghost Hunters series , will prevail and not a single sceptical point of view will feature .
Let me just add some background to my interest in
1 . They claim that their investigations are scientific .
2 . There were a lot of discrepancies in the investigations - for eg .
they use orbs as a means of detecting ghosts , but in some cases where orbs were found , they claimed that there was no paranormal activity , and I wondered why .
3 . They claim a high " strike rate " in terms of successful investigations
So , I contacted them via email and asked some questions . (
I also wanted to try and get myself invited on one of their investigations and hopefully get one or two of you - fellow sceptics - to come along too . )
They were quite prompt in their reply and , perhaps I misread them , but they did n't seem too keen on having a sceptic along .
Although they said that they welcomed observers - for reasons of transparency - they were concerned that I may not accept their findings as definitive proof and that I may " tarnish " their reputation with what I had to say on my blog .
Not that I was going to mention them by name on my blog , I was just going to talk about my experiences with some ghost hunters and about how an investigation was conducted .
Perhaps I still may get lucky and be invited after I replied to their concerns this morning .
With regard to their investigations being scientific , I asked whether they thought it was scientific because they used technology .
Every single member of the team talks about having had a paranormal experience , so I felt the investigation could n't be all that scientific seeing as it was being conducted by " believers " .
I was told that in fact the team were all sceptics " in their own right " and that that 's how they conducted their investigations , but reading through their cases it 's very obvious that each investigation is approached from a believer 's point of view .
I 've gone through all the evidence they 've compiled in each investigation , most of it is photo's of orbs , EVP's and more recently , thermographic imaging - and very flimsy as evidence goes .
However , one EVP stands out - I 'll link to it as soon as I find it again - it is either an outright hoax or the clearest ghost voice I have ever heard caught on tape .
If anyone is interested in reading the correspondence between me and SPITSA , I 'll post it on this thread .
South Africans will be able to watch a local version of " Ghost Hunters " sometime soon .
I 'm not sure how soon " soon " is , and I suppose it all depends on if and when the SABC sorts itself out .

Let me just add some background to my interest in SPITSA .
I 've been looking at doing a couple of posts about the paranormal on my blog , after a discussion a while ago about ghosts - I also live near the area where the " Walkerville Ghost " is supposed to haunt a lonely stretch of road .
So I decided to go onto SPITSA 's website and have a look at some of their investigations .
There were a few things that stood out for me ... 1 . They claim that their investigations are scientific .
2 .
There were a lot of discrepancies in the investigations - for eg .
they use orbs as a means of detecting ghosts , but in some cases where orbs were found , they claimed that there was no paranormal activity , and I wondered why .3 .

His interest in the paranormal was more curiosity , setting his own objective in proving / challenging the phenomena scientifically implementing all available engineering equipment .
The remainder of SPITSA ’s staff already appears to know that the existence of the paranormal is simply unquestionable : Quote from : Tracey Johnson
Through out [ sic ] her whole life she has been passionate about matters pertaining to the afterlife .
This is a subject , which Tracey has been researching for the past 10 years .
Quote from : Gerda van der Westhuizen
As far as she can remember , she always had an interest in the paranormal field and did lots of research in this field on her own .
She investigated any possible haunting on her own until she met Tracey .
Her knowledge and personal experiences makes her an asset to the team .
Quote from : Mitch Tuba
He … started gaining interest into [ sic ] the paranormal world after some very explicit personal experiences .
His 20 years of [ sic ] working in industry mainly in the technical field has lent some value expertise to the group .
Quote from : Andre van der Westhuizen [ A ] lthough he was a bit sceptic [ sic ] about the existence of the paranormal at first , he soon realized that it was a reality and therefore decided to join SPITSA .
Quote from : Alex Kotsis
[ H ]e … himself has had some paranormal experiences in the past , which has prompted his fascination with the subject and this has lead [ sic ] him to join Spitsa .
Quote from : Alfred
He started gaining interest in the paranormal after he had a couple of experiences since the age of 6 , wich [ sic ] left him with many unanswered questions .
Quote from : Ashley Do Casal
I am based in Johannesburg but originate from Zimbabwe , I have been involved with the paranormal for about 8 + years now and have had a few experiences of my own .

I am South African and started gaining interest in the paranormal after working in a restaurant which has been declared haunted . … and the pièce de résistance … Quote from : Art Long I am a hypnotherapist , Traditional doctor , explorer and writer , originally from Australia .
Involved in naturopathy and hypnotherapy for 40 years , I also have been studying esoteric subjects and supernatural phenomena for 37 years , lecturing , and training people in psychic abilities . …
I have been fascinated by the spirituality and ancient history of South Africa since I was asked to take a curse of the Mapungubwe Museum of the University of Pretoria .
This was placed upon it after a Sangoma walked barefoot from Tzaneen to ask for the return of his ancestors and was refused .
After removing the curse , I pursued the return of the skeletal remains archaeologists had removed from Mapungubwe .
Finally enlisting the help of our then President Mbeki who vowed to make this happen and did so in November 2007 .
Since then I have been endeavouring to discover as much as possible about the lost histories and mysteries of Africa to record future generations .
SPITSA ’s findings will no doubt hold very few surprises , if any at all .
What is needed is a team of sceptics that does a parallel investigation ( or an immediate follow - up ) , and which has a channel for publicising its findings on the same cases .
But people do n’t want to know about rational explanations .
They ’d much rather be wowed by woo - woo until the novelty wears off and / or more exciting woo - woo comes along .

The mouseover texts on the members page are revealing .
You can forget joining SPITSA unless you ’re an uncritical dupe .
It seems that the person closest to a neutral , dispassionate demeanour is their “ Engineering Specialist ” :

Exactly !
I think I was a bit naive in thinking that they would do a " proper " investigation or at least have one sceptic on the team .
Anyway , below is my first set of questions and their replies .
I 'll add the comments I sent this morning below in a seperate post , I 'm not sure if they 'll reply .
MDG :
1 . You say that your investigations are scientific , why ?
Is it because you feel that you are using technology to find ghosts ?
The reason I am asking is because not one of your investigations offers up any other possibility for " supernatural " causes - for instance , faulty wiring or plumbing , or draughty areas .
Also , you 're approaching every investigation with the premise that ghosts do exist , so that 's what you set out to prove or disprove instead of looking for other possible explanations .
SPITSA :
Quote I would just like to back track here for a moment .
The whole object of our
work is not necessarily to find ghosts or paranormal activity , rather to
document any allegations of such .
Clients will mail us with reportings of
various types of activity and request an investigation .
We do not disbelieve
or try to disprove these allegations , but rather approach it from the stand
point that " if it is there " , we will document it in one form or another .
In
order to do that , we do make use of various pieces of equipment and
technology , but again , only in the pursuit of documenting these alleged
activities .
MDG :
2 . On your blog you have an article describing what ghosts are and you say that orbs are a manifestation of a haunting or presence , yet on some investigations where you have found orbs , you state that there is no paranormal activity , why ?
SPITSA :
Quote
Yes , I have to concede that the subject of " orbs " is rather vague .
There is
so much speculation around orbs and what they are , and even the opinions of
those learned in the subject vary from being nothing more than dust and or
moisture to ghostly apparitions about to manifest .
What I will say is that
we do believe that it would be incorrect to assume an investigation site
haunted , purely because of the presence of orbs .
We are certainly by no
means the experts in this field .
As time has gone on , we as a group are
slowly giving orbs less significance than ever before .
MDG :
3 . Do you offer your clients any other explanations for what they 're experiencing other than a paranormal one ?
For example , with regard to your last investigation where a person was pinned down in their sleep and choked , this person was possibly experiencing sleep paralysis .

Yes indeed .
And that is one of the reasons why we make use of certain
equipment like electromagnetic field detectors .
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity ( ES ) is a physiological disorder
characterized by symptoms directly brought on by exposure to electromagnetic
fields .
It produces neurological and allergic - type symptoms .
Symptoms may
include , but are not limited to , headache , eye irritation , dizziness ,
nausea , skin rash , facial swelling , weakness , fatigue , pain in joints and / or
muscles , buzzing / ringing in ears , skin numbness , abdominal pressure and
pain , breathing difficulty , and irregular heartbeat .
Those affected persons
may experience an abrupt onset of symptoms following exposure to a new EMF
such as fields associated with a new computer or with new fluorescent
lights , or a new home or work environment .
And what we have found is that
when people do not understand the effects of high levels of EMF and
experience such symptoms , they may often attribute such , to paranormal
activity .
Debunking is the primary function of a credible and responsible
paranormal investigator .
It defeats your purpose if you accept natural or
explainable events as paranormal phenomenon .
An often overlooked natural
cause for some reported " paranormal activity " is EMF exposure , and the
symptoms that can follow ..

Our team is made up of individuals with very specific expertise pertinent to
the very tasks they are expected to perform .
We have on our team qualified
engineers , thermographers , professionals and others .
Because of our
approach , each team member in their own right is in fact a skeptic .
The aim
of their work is to prove otherwise ..

5 . Would you consider allowing a couple of sceptics to tag along on one of your investigations to observe ?
SPITSA :

We would always be too glad to have observers present on any of our
investigations , and in fact would even encourage it from the point of view
of transparency .
Unfortunately , no matter how hard you try to present your
findings as they have happened / occurred , there will always be a small
fraction of people that will question your integrity and dispute the
validity of any evidence that is captured , citing that is very simple ( and
especially in today 's technological era ) to manufacture , fabricate and
duplicate evidence .
By doing that , we have absolutely nothing to gain other
than a bit of sensationalism , which in most cases , is easily disproved with
the net result being that once your credibility is tarnished , it becomes
almost impossible to regain it .
And then who is the laughing stock ?.

We do not charge any fee for our services .
All our work is completely

Our operating

receive generous donations from clients who have appreciated our efforts and
time .
These donations are generally used for the improvement of our
equipment and acquisition of new equipment .
I sincerely hope that your questions have been answered to your
satisfaction .
We look forward to hearing from you again and always welcome
any critics , comments and or suggestions .

Exactly !
I think I was a bit naive in thinking that they would do a " proper " investigation or at least havesceptic on the team .
Anyway , below is my first set of questions and their replies .
I 'll add the comments I sent this morning below in a seperate post , I 'm not sure if they 'll reply .
MDG:1 . You say that your investigations are scientific , why ?
Is it because you feel that you are using technology to find ghosts ?
The reason I am asking is because not one of your investigations offers up any other possibility for " supernatural " causes - for instance , faulty wiring or plumbing , or draughty areas .
Also , you 're approaching every investigation with the premise that ghosts do exist , so that 's what you set out to prove or disprove instead of looking for other possible explanations .
SPITSA : MDG:2 .
On your blog you have an article describing what ghosts are and you say that orbs are a manifestation of a haunting or presence , yet on some investigations where you have found orbs , you state that there is no paranormal activity , why ?
SPITSA : MDG:3 .
Do you offer your clients any other explanations for what they 're experiencing other than a paranormal one ?
For example , with regard to your last investigation where a person was pinned down in their sleep and choked , this person was possibly experiencing sleep paralysis .
It 's called hypnogogia and hypnopompia , something I 've personally experienced , but have never related to paranormal activity .
SPITSA : MDG:4 .
Are there any sceptics on your team ?
SPITSA : MDG:5 . Would you consider allowing a couple of sceptics to tag along on one of your investigations to observe ?

» Here are the comments on their reply ............
HI SPITSA Team ,
Thank you for your prompt reply .
I 'd just like to comment on your replies .
1. With regard to your investigations being scientific .....
From your reply it seems to me that you only go on anecdotal evidence and investigate the story , so this does n't make it a scientific investigation .
I was under the impression that an investigation would begin with eliminating all other possibilities such as electrical faults , engineering faults , and perhaps possible mental health conditions of the client , before looking at the possibility of a paranormal explanation .
Please understand that I am not saying that all your clients are mentally unstable ; even an overactive imagination could be one of many other possible explanations .
That said , doing a more thorough investigation would make it more " scientific " and lend more credence to your findings .
I also think it would be better for your client to know that what they 're experiencing may have a natural explanation instead of a supernatural one .
2.Orbs .....
As you admit , orbs cannot be relied upon as evidence of the paranormal .
It has been proven time and again to be things such as dust or moisture as you pointed out .
3.Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity ......
Like orbs , this is a phenomenon that has not been proven .
Surely if someone was experiencing ES , they would experience everywhere they go and not just in the area where paranormal activity is happening ?
We are surrounded by technology , so it does n't make sense that someone sensitive to electric fields would only experience it in a particular place .
If you are referring to geopathic stress , where " negative " waves escape from faults in the Earth , there is absolutely no evidence that these " negative " waves exist .
The only thing that could possibly escape from faults in the Earth are gases , which would be a scientific explanation and not a paranormal one .
4.Skeptics on your team ......
You say that each member of the team is a skeptic in their own right .
With all due respect , each member on your team - on your site - says that they have had a paranormal experience , therefore they can not be skeptics .
Each one is investigating as a believer in the paranormal .
A skeptic on your team would be looking at the paranormal claim and searching for every other possible explanation before saying that any findings are possibly paranormal .
5.Skeptics observing an investigation ......
Please refer to my previous points at 1 . and 4 .
I appreciate that you would welcome people to observe your investigations .
However , perhaps I 'm misreading your reply , but you seems to think that anyone ( i.e. a skeptic ) would be observing solely to " tarnish " your reputation .
This is not my intention at all .
I have read extensively , over many years , on the paranormal and my belief is that mysteries should neither be fostered nor dismissed .
Instead , they should be carefully investigated with a view toward solving them , preferably using a more scientific approach .

Quote from : WELCOME TO SPITSA Spitsa has had a phenomenal strike rate in terms of successful investigations , which means that the group has come away from investigations with undisputable evidence of paranormal activity in at least one form or more , where the evidence that was captured cannot be explained scientifically , physically or in any other logical way .
Right , now I ’m really convinced …
Here ’s a suggestion : First , look at how many of the 30 - odd “ investigations ” reported on at the SPITSA website find in favour of the paranormal .
If the fraction is high ( as I suspect it probably is ) then it may be worth approaching the SABC ( or the production company ) with this fact as well as the suggestion of extending the show ’s format so that each episode in effect consists of two halves involving the same site of alleged supernatural activity .
The first half presents SPITSA ’s investigation and findings , and the second those of a team of sceptics .
The selling point would of course be the resultant controversy , which most people love – as evidenced by the popularity of “ Reality TV . ”
I think the show should be called “ Survivor Spiritland . ”

As I said in my reply , clients should be given the natural explanation of the activity instead of a supernatural one , as that 's the explanation in 99 % of the investigations .

I had received an email last week inviting me to support the Makomati community as the sender knows that I support preservation of archaeological sites .
A bit of digging ( pardon the pun ) on my part revealed that the committee is made up of pseudoscientists and other flakes .
Two stand out - Michael Tellinger who wrote Slave Species of God , and Dr. Cyril Hromnik who thinks the Makomati site is " proof " of his theory that Indians settled in Southern Africa thousands of years before Europeans .
They assert that the Makomati site is 75 000 years old , with Adam 's Calendar as their prime piece of " evidence " .
The mind boggles .

Very good idea Luthon , except I do n’t think the Ghost hunters would agree to something like that , maybe because they know chances are that they would be proven faked in such investigations .
Pity though , because this could be a nice way to proof to the nation that they WANT to see the Supernatural in every natural occurrence !

Quite .
Maybe the reason why the S.P.I.T.S.A. team comes over as very open to the idea of paranormal happenings is to encourage people coming forward with their stories in the first place .
Imagine , for example , that you are convinced that you 've just seen a ghost .
You have the option of reporting the sighting to either a bunch of hard nosed scientists , or a group of sympathetic specialists .
Who you gonna call ?
Perhaps its a bluff .
Dare we hope ?
One thing that I 've always found especially amusing is the reported use of " technology " to locate spiritual activity .
If the technology responds with a positive reading , it means that it measured a change in something physical , right ?
It has to be , because the technology would have been invented for that purpose , and has to rely on some physical stimulus .
Therefor , whatever it measures must be of a known nature .
So the spirit must presumably either emit something physically recognizable , or cause a disturbance in something physically recognisable .
Either way , this means the spooktechnician must have knowledge of spirits ' physical nature .
This seems oxymoronic .

Well ..... I ’m not a scientist , but a person better not call or tell me about such sighting , cause I sure as hell do n’t share their sentiment .
No cure for stupidity .
Only my point of view .
I ca n’t help but to wonder if the first “ proof ” of Ghost sightings did n’t come when people started to record over and over old recordings , distorted background images ( like the Video tapes we used to know )
These only got so much easier when computers became available

» There are different types of haunting ...
1. Residual haunt - the ghost is not aware of it's surroundings and is sort of like a repetitive looped movie .
Think of it as someone repeating the same behaviour over and over again , unaware of any other people witnessing what he / she doing .
These type of ghosts cannot interact with it 's surroundings .
2.Intelligent haunt - these ghosts are capable of interacting with the living and it 's surroundings .
They will also be the type of ghost who will deliver messages .
Think of Patrick Swayze in " ghost "
3. Poltergeists - usually moves objects .
For some reason ghost hunters think these are the " cheeky " spirits of children because they 're so mischievous .
4. Demonic haunt - the kind you really do n't want - think of Amityville horror .
I do n't understand how they determine whether it 's paranormal or not , either because it 's not consistent ,
Also , cases 29 and 30 are two different locations , but give the exact same photos , videos and EVP 's as evidence in both cases .

French travellers made amends on elegance - classed third - as well as for their discretion and cleanliness .

In Sunday television interviews
Obama seeks to defuse opposition on healthcare , Afghanistan
By Patrick Martin
21 September 2009
In a Sunday morning media blitz , Barack Obama appeared on interview programs on the three major television networks and two cable channels to discuss his proposed healthcare restructuring program as well as the escalating US war in Afghanistan .
The programs were taped back - to - back on Friday afternoon , with interviewers from ABC , CBS , NBC , CNN and the Spanish - language Univision queuing up at the White House .
( The right - wing Fox television did not participate ) .
The wall - to - wall appearances , unprecedented for a US president , were arranged by the Obama administration in response to growing public concern over its most important domestic and foreign policy initiatives .
As a political event , the interviews were shallow , uninformative and extremely repetitive .
All the interviewers focused on the same three subjects — healthcare , Afghanistan , and the claim by former president Jimmy Carter that opposition to Obama is largely motivated by racism .
Obama dismissed Carter ’s claim briefly , spoke extensively on healthcare and Afghanistan , and was hardly pressed by his deferential questioners .
In a sign of the vast social gulf between multi-millionaire television hosts and ordinary working people , none of the three network interviewers — George Stephanopoulos of ABC , David Gregory of NBC , and Bob Schieffer of CBS — asked Obama a single question about the economy and the rising toll of joblessness .
John King of CNN , who did raise the subject , asked one question , accepted a perfunctory expression of concern and cautious optimism from Obama , and then moved on .
On healthcare , Obama sought to reassure working class and middle class families , as well as retirees , that their existing medical coverage would not be affected by legislation now going through Congress .
He presented the healthcare restructuring as a social advance that would expand coverage for the uninsured , downplaying his previous emphasis on cost- cutting , which is the real core of healthcare “ reform . ”
On ABC , for instance , he gave a list of four supposed principles of his healthcare agenda , starting with providing affordable health insurance for the uninsured as the first principle , followed by restrictions on insurance company practices that deny benefits to those already insured .
Then he listed , in third and fourth place , “ deficit neutrality ” and “ driving down our costs over the long - term . ”
This shift in emphasis provoked the only aggressive questioning , as several of his interviewers pushed him to define what sacrifices he would impose on the American people .
NBC ’s David Gregory asked , “ What are the hard choices that you are now asking the American people to make ?
And who are you gonna say no to — in order to get health care done ? ”
Obama made an answer that largely avoided the question .
On ABC , he claimed that among his “ core principles ” was that healthcare reform had to be good for “ middle class families ” who “ have seen a doubling of their premiums over the last decade . ”
Despite being repeatedly asked by George Stephanopoulos about slashing spending for Medicare , Obama refused to even use the word “ cut ” to describe any aspect of his policies .
This evasiveness is clearly driven by political considerations , as Obama and his advisers have concluded that constant references to cost- cutting , particularly in Medicare , have raised alarm bells among wide layers of working people and the retired .
As a result , the only change in Medicare that Obama would agree to discuss in detail — and which he raised on his own in several of the interviews — was repealing Medicare Advantage , the partial privatization of Medicare enacted under the Bush administration , which provides nearly $ 18 billion a year in subsidies to insurance company profits .
The other specific on healthcare that Obama raised in the interviews was his support for the individual mandate — a requirement that every person in the United States must purchase health insurance .
This provision , backed by fines on those who fail to do so , expresses the reactionary basis of the Obama healthcare reform , which is subordinated to the profit interests of the giant healthcare , drug and insurance companies .
Instead of establishing health care as a basic right to which every person is entitled as a social necessity , the individual mandate would compel all Americans under the age of 65 to pay tribute to private , profit - making insurance companies , unless they are so poor that they qualify for the Medicaid program .
In his CNN interview , Obama underscored his fundamentally right - wing social outlook , in response to a question about the hysterical claims that he advocates a “ government takeover ” of healthcare .
Obama said , “ You know , I ’m amused .
I ca n’t tell you how many foreign leaders who are heads of center - right governments say to me , I do n't understand why people would call you socialist , in my country , you ’d be considered a conservative . ”
On Afghanistan , the other major topic of the interviews , Obama gave a glimpse of the internal disputes raging in Washington over the clear failure of the eight - year effort by American imperialism to establish a stable puppet regime .
These divisions have been exacerbated by the sharp shift in public opinion over the past few months against the war in Afghanistan .
Obama went out of his way to rebuff suggestions that a further increase in American troop strength , on top of the 21,000 additional troops sent this year , was inevitable , presenting that decision as still an open question .
He claimed that the 21,000 troops had been sent “ to make sure that we could secure the election ” in Afghanistan , which was held August 20 and has proven to be a debacle , with widespread evidence of fraud by officials working for the incumbent president , Hamid Karzai .
He even claimed that his goal was to “ narrow ” the scope of US objectives in Afghanistan and guard against “ mission - creep . ”
In his NBC interview , Obama remarked , “ I do n’t have a deadline for withdrawal .
But I ’m certainly not somebody who believes in indefinite occupations of other countries . ”
On CNN , he was asked whether the White House had told General Stanley McChrystal , the theater commander in Afghanistan , to hold back any request for troops , as CNN had reported earlier in the weekend .
Obama denied this , as well as a suggestion that Karzai had stolen the presidential election .
“ How much fraud took place and whether that had a substantial effect on the results of the election , I think that is something that we 're going to have to wait and see in the next few weeks , ” he replied .
There have been other press reports suggesting a conflict between McChrystal and the White House over the proposal for additional troops .
McClatchy news service reported Friday evening that “ conflicting messages ” from the administration “ are drawing increasing ire from US commanders in Afghanistan and frustrating military leaders . ”
“ Three officers at the Pentagon and in Kabul told McClatchy that the McChrystal they know would resign before he ’d stand behind a faltering policy that he thought would endanger his forces or the strategy , ” the news service reported .
“ Dithering is just as destructive as 10 car bombs , ” one unnamed US official in Afghanistan told McClatchy .
The reports of conflicts between the military and the White House have led to demands by congressional Republican leaders that General McChrystal return to Washington and testify publicly before House and Senate committees , on the model of the public appearances by General David Petraeus two years ago , that led to the collapse of any pretense of Democratic congressional opposition to the war in Iraq .

An average family health insurance policy now costs more than some compact cars , and four in 10 companies will likely pass more of that expense on to workers , according to a closely watched survey of businesses released Tuesday .
The average cost of a family policy offered by employers was $ 13,375 this year , up 5 % from 2008 , the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust survey found .
By comparison , wages rose 3 % over that period , the study said .
The new numbers underscore warnings by President Obama about the growing cost of health insurance and were embraced by Democratic lawmakers who are pushing for legislation to change the nation 's health care system .
" The trends are crushing millions of businesses and American families , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said .
The annual survey of more than 2,000 companies also found that 40 % of small - business employees enrolled in individual health plans pay annual deductibles of $ 1,000 or more .
That 's almost twice the number who paid that much in 2007 .
Drew Altman , president of the Kaiser foundation , said it is the combination of higher health care costs along with the recession and other rising prices that " creates the pain level . "
Those who oppose Democratic versions of the health care legislation , such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , agree that the rising cost of insurance has become a hardship on families and businesses .
The two parties disagree on how to address the problem .
" It 's a significant issue for our members , " said Jeri Kubicki with the National Association of Manufacturers .
" They want to continue to offer this benefit .
At the same time , it 's a daunting task to try to control costs . "
Since 1999 , health insurance premiums for families rose 131 % , the report found , far more than the general rate of inflation , which increased 28 % over the same period .
Overall , health care in the United States is expected to cost $ 2.6 trillion this year , or 17 % of the nation 's economy , according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office .
Sen . Max Baucus , D - Mont. , who is leading a bipartisan group negotiating health care legislation , has promised that his bill eventually will drive down costs .
Baucus said the bill could come up for a vote this month .
As insurance costs increase , workers are also picking up a larger share , the survey found .
The average employee with family coverage paid 26 % of the premium , the study found , but 41 % of companies said they are " very likely " or " somewhat likely " to increase the amount employees pay for coverage in the next year .
Marion Cowen , insurance coordinator for H.A. Cover & Son Lumber , Co. , in Thayer , Mo. , said her company switched to a plan with a $ 1,000 deductible a few years ago .
Though Cowen expects the cost of the plan to rise about 4 % , she said she does n't think employees will pay more .
" If there 's any way they can bring the costs down , that is the big thing , " Cowen said of efforts in Washington .
" The costs just seem to be going up , up , up . "

COMPARED with the past two crisis - dominated gatherings , the atmosphere at this year 's central bankers ' meeting in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , was relaxed .
Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , whom Barack Obama nominated for a second term on August 25th , found time to go hiking and horse - riding .
The mood was one of quiet relief at the signs of economic recovery and not - so - quiet pride at central bankers ' role in saving global finance .
But below the surface lurked concern and confusion .
Many central bankers worried that the recovery would be feeble and fragile .
Few have come to terms with how fundamentally the crisis has changed both their tasks and their toolkit .
For the past decade central banking has been dominated by what could be called the “ Jackson Hole consensus ” , since many of its elements were developed during the annual summer shindig organised by the Kansas City Fed .
This consensus holds that central bankers ' prime task is to keep inflation low and stable .
It favours an inflation target as a way to anchor people 's expectations of future policy , and puts a lot of weight on the transparency and predictability of central banks ' interest - rate decisions .
The consensus was not absolute .
The Fed , for instance , has never adopted an explicit inflation target ( though it has an implicit one ) .
Some central bankers in Europe and Japan argued that monetary policy should “ lean against ” asset bubbles , whereas Fed officials thought bubbles were hard to spot , and that it was less costly to clean up by cutting rates after they burst .
No one , however , focused much on central bankers ' responsibility for broader financial stability , or thought much about the financial plumbing through which changes in short - term interest rates affect the broader economy .
Now , in the wake of the financial crisis , it is commonplace to demand that central banks must worry about the health of the financial system , not just price stability .
In many countries there are plans to give them responsibility for “ macro- prudential supervision ” , an ugly term for fretting about financial excesses .
Less well understood , though , is how much these new tasks will change the central bankers ' world .
The main tenet of the Jackson Hole consensus — that central banks earn their credibility by having a simple target which the public understands and to which they are held accountable — will be much harder to maintain .
Unlike price stability ( which can be measured by a price index ) , financial stability is hard to define , let alone measure .
Nor is it clear what tools to use .
Most central bankers reckon regulation should be the first line of defence , though it is now more widely accepted that rates might also need to rise to stem an asset bubble .
Just what regulations , though , is less clear .
Many countries plan tighter rules on liquidity and capital for systemically important firms .
But , as Stanley Fischer , governor of the Bank of Israel , pointed out to the Jackson Hole attendees , older tools such as margin requirements or maximum loan - to - value ratios could also be used .
Jean - Charles Rochet of the University of Toulouse argued that the whole focus on systemically - important institutions was misguided .
Instead , central bankers should guarantee the stability of vital markets ( such as the money market ) .
The difficulty of defining financial stability and the plethora of potential tools means central bankers will , in future , have much more discretion .
Their new mandate will also affect the old focus on inflation in ways that are , as yet , ill understood .
Mark Carney , the governor of the Bank of Canada , pointed out that rules to promote financial stability , such as higher capital charges for big banks , will affect the process through which monetary policy decisions are transmitted to the broader economy .
And using interest rates to promote financial stability means that inflation - targeting central banks may well deviate from their inflation targets for longer periods ( for instance , if asset prices are soaring but consumer prices are stable ) .
That is a sensible trade - off , but could compromise the central banks ' public credibility .
Another threat to this credibility comes from uncertainty over just how monetary policy works in a world of near - zero interest rates .
In the conference 's main paper on monetary policy , Carl Walsh , an economist at the University of California at Santa Cruz , was sceptical about the efficacy of quantitative easing and other unconventional measures .
But he argued that central bankers could boost output today by promising higher inflation in the future , which they would achieve by pledging to keep interest rates low even after the economy had begun to recover .
One way to do this would be to target a price level , rather than an inflation rate .
With a price - level target , central banks would have to follow a period of excessively low inflation with higher inflation in order to get back to the target .
But , he argued , central banks could not simultaneously promise to keep interest rates low for an “ extended ” period of time and promise to keep inflation stable ( which is exactly what the Fed is now doing ) .
Not surprisingly , Fed officials denied there was an inconsistency between keeping inflation stable and rates low for a long time .
The point , they argued , was to stop inflation expectations falling , not to push them up .
Nonetheless , some central bankers were intrigued by the idea of price - level targeting .
Mr Carney , especially , argued that it might prove a good way for central banks to retain their credibility while targeting both price and financial stability .
But many , including Mr Walsh , worried that price - level targeting would be harder to explain to the public .
Worse , a change in monetary - policy rules in the aftermath of a crisis would itself damage central bankers ' hard won credibility .
Unfortunately , this credibility will in any case be under attack .
Over the next few years achieving vaguely defined financial stability as well as avoiding both inflation and deflation will only get harder thanks to a nasty backdrop of lower trend growth and high public debt .
The Jackson Hole consensus evolved in calmer times .
Central banking is now a lot harder .
Apple has been angry with Nvidia for some time now because of the prolonged GPU failures in Mac Computers and iMacs .
Thus , Apple has finally decided to shift to ATI Radeon 4000 based graphics chips for their upcoming Mac Pro and iMac computers .
The ATI series will replace Nvidia Geforce 9400 based graphics chips .
Apple is having issues with Nvidia based onboard graphics chips due to overheating while using multimedia content or gaming .
Thus , the failure rate of Apple products has increased significantly , mostly due to burnt GPUs .
This has ignited the company to find other partners to replace the graphics chip .
AMD has announced that the upcoming Macbook Pro and iMacs will be equipped with Radeon 4000 series discrete graphics cards .
The Radeon 4000 series supports DirectX 10.1 along with OpenCL 1.0 which is supported in the new Snow Leopard Operating System .
The graphics chips also supports hardware decoding of HD media .
The new graphics cards would be ATI Radeon HD 4870 and 4850 to be used in Mac Pro and iMac respectively .
Nvidia will take a big plunge as a major partner is moving to its competitors .
However , Nvidia maintains that the heat issues will be corrected in the next generation graphics cards , and Apple partnership will again start .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
“ At what point do we run out of money ? ” President Obama was asked in May .
“ Well , we are out of money now , ” he replied .
That was when he projected the deficit to be $ 7 trillion over the next 10 years .
Now his administration admits the number likely will reach $ 9 trillion .
We sure are out of money — and the true deficit number probably is at least another $ 1 trillion bigger .
The Obama administration ’s $ 9 trillion estimate presumes that Congress will pass a carbon - cap bill and receive $ 640 billion in revenue from carbon taxes .
The deficit estimate also assumes passage of legislation that would raise taxes on international businesses by $ 200 billion .
But it is dubious whether either revenue bill will pass , as they both face opposition from some Democrats in the Senate .
The administration ’s predictions are based on the claim that there somehow will be many large spending cuts in the future .
Quite unbelievably , the White House also claims that its proposed government health care will not introduce any new fiscal burdens .
Gone with the wind is Mr. Obama ’s campaign promise to cut the deficit by cutting government spending .
As he said in the third debate , “ What I ’ve done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut . ”
It ’s rather ripe to recall that Mr. Obama was complaining that the George W. Bush administration was “ living beyond our means ” when deficits over President Bush ’s eight years totaled about $ 3 trillion .
And those $ 3 trillion should not be blamed entirely on Mr. Bush or the Republicans because the largest deficits occurred during the years when the Democrats controlled both the House and Senate .
Divvied up , a $ 10 trillion deficit comes out to more than $ 33,000 for every man , woman and child in America .
Not everyone pays federal income taxes ; when counting only taxpayers , the federal deficit burden is $ 105,000 per household .
This ransom is in addition to normal income taxes .
Eventually , tax rates will be raised to astronomical levels to fill in the deficit hole .
Mr. Obama promised change .
That ’s all Americans will have left in their pockets after his presidency .

Illustrations of the hymen in various states
This shows the names of the parts of the vulva .
The rest of the illustrations do not have labels .
This is a perfect annular hymen .
It is called annular because the hymen forms a ring around the vaginal opening .
As the hymen starts to erode from sexual or other activity , the hymen becomes less ring - like .
This is a crescentic , or lunar , hymen .
It forms a crescent shape , like a half moon , above or ( as in this case ) below the vaginal opening .
The hymen of a female with some sexual or masturbatory ( internal ) experience is apt to look something like this .
Note that it is much less ring - like than the annular hymen .
This is what the hymen of a female who has only had a small amount of sexual activity or object insertion would look like .
Health professionals who examine hymens for signs of sexual abuse are usually most interested in the posterior part of the hymen , from the 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock position .
This is normally where the hymen breaks when the vagina is first penetrated .
This is the vulva of a woman who has given birth .
The hymen is completely gone , or nearly so .
One in 2000 girls is born with an imperforate hymen .
A doctor will do surgery to create a hole in the hymen of such a newborn .
This is a rare cribriform hymen , characterized by many small holes .
This type of hymen lets menstrual and other fluids out with no problem , but sexual activity and the insertion of tampons can be problematic .
This is a rare denticular hymen , so called because it looks like a set of teeth surrounding the vaginal opening .
This is a rare fimbriated hymen , with an irregular pattern around the vaginal opening .
This rare labial hymen looks like a third set of vulvar lips .
Some girls are born with only a tiny hole in their hymens .
Surgery is also necessary for these newborns to create a larger vaginal opening .
This rarity is called a septate hymen because of the piece of hymen that makes a septum , or bridge , across the vaginal opening .
This is the rare subseptate hymen , similar to the septate hymen only not making a bridge all the way across .
Does n't this remind you of the view into your throat with the uvula hanging down ?
To learn more about hymens and how the medical community advises to examine them for signs of sexual abuse , see this site .
Mr Davis has been a harsh critic of Israel for years A Jewish - born Israeli has been elected to the governing body of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 's Fatah party .
Uri Davis , 66 , an academic who is married to a Palestinian , is an outspoken critic of what he calls Israel 's " apartheid policies " .
As the only Israeli member of the Revolutionary Council he says he wants to represent non-Arab people who support the Palestinian cause .
He called for an international campaign to boycott Israel to be toughened up .
Dr Davis said his Israeli citizenship made no difference to his election .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service " Within the conference itself the welcome was most heartfelt and enthusiastic - the Fatah movement is an open , international movement - membership is not conditional on ethnic origin , it 's conditional on agreement with the main part of the Fatah political programme , " he told the BBC News website .
Dr Davis said he did not define himself as Jewish but as " a Palestinian Hebrew national of Jewish origin , anti-Zionist , registered as Muslim and a citizen of an apartheid state - the State of Israel " .
Young leaders dominate poll Fatah : A new beginning ?
Profile : Fatah movement
He was one of around 700 Fatah members competing for 89 open seats in the body , which oversees the group 's day - to - day decision making .
Others elected to Fatah 's revolutionary council included Fadwa Barghouti , the wife of the senior Fatah figure , Marwan Barghouti , who was jailed by Israel five years ago for the murder of five people .
The old guard of Fatah retained only four of the 18 elected seats .
The rest went to younger men .

For a good ( slightly outdated ) GUI showing off CAIR , go here : http://code.google.com/p/seam-carving-gui/
What is CAIR ?
It 's a little project I started based on the works of Shai Avidan and Ariel Shair .
Their paper , described here , shows a rather easy way one can do non-linear image resizing .
This allows the image to be resized while changing its aspect ratio and keeping important features untouched .
Essentially , it removes ( or adds ) parts to an image that would be least noticed .
The doctors ' presentation can be seen in this nice YouTube video .
The Basics
Lets take this image from the Space Station ( courtesy NASA ) :
For edge detection , each pixel is converted to grayscale .
CAIR has several options for the convolution kernel , including Prewitt ( seen below ) , Sobel , Laplacian , V1 , and V^2 .
Each offers different advantages and generates different artifacts with heavy resizing .
The V - variety can generate some of the best quality .
Certainly , other types of functions could be used besides edge detection .
However , edge detection is relatively fast and fairly accurate in determining objects of interest .
The next part is to determine the energy cost of a getting to a pixel from the top row .
This is described in the paper , but essentially we take the value of the edge detection of the pixel plus the minimum energy of the three immediate pixels above it .
For example :
energy_map[ x ] [y ] = minimum ( energy_map[ x - 1 ] [ y - 1 ] ,
energy_map[x ] [ y - 1 ] ,
energy_map[x+1 ] [ y - 1 ] ) + edge [ x ] [y ]
When you scale the values down to grayscale , you get an image something like this :
From here , you can then find the least energy path by starting at the pixel with the smallest energy in the bottom row and working your way up .
Like before , you look for the pixel with the least energy of the three above you , and you go in that direction .
By making an energy image for both the vertical and horizontal , I found the two paths with least energy .
They are the red lines on the below image .
I placed them into the edge image for clarity .
The next step is to either remove those paths , or to add next to those paths .
Adding to the image is easier , as the added pixel values will just be the averages of the pixels next to them .
Removing a path can be just blending the nearby pixels .
However , this can lead to some artifacts if the image is heavily resized .
The doctors ' paper talk about some filtering in the gradient domain of the image , which is what I plan to do someday .
The order of removal is described in the paper and makes use of a transport map .
This method seems computationally heavy , since all order combinations need to be explored before an optimal order can be determined .
The transport map can be simulated with less complexity if we calculate both vertical and horizontal paths and then remove the path that has the least energy of the two .
This is implemented in the CAIR_HD ( ) function .
For now , I implemented an averaging blender for downsizing the image .
A target resolution of 800x600 was giving to CAIR .
The image it generated is on the left .
The image on the right was scaled with bicubic interpolation to 800x600 .
This example surprisingly shows the major limitations of the algorithm ( and my implementation ) .
Notice the cables running from the astronauts to the bottom right .
The resizing has greatly distorted them .
This is a limitation of the algorithm .
Weighting the cable so it is not touched would not cause this glitch .
Also , notice the cloud above the astronaut on the left .
If you look closely there is a faint line between the lighter and darker sides of the cloud .
This is a limitation of the averaging technique , and would be corrected with gradient domain removal .
Weights
As a crude example , lets try applying some weights to the image .
If we add a large negative weight to a particular area , we can cause the paths to travel through that area first .
Lets say the astronaut on the left ran over my dog , and as such I do not want him in the picture .
By biasing the area around him with a - 10,000 weight , we force the paths to go through this area first during a resize .
Likewise , applying a 10,000 weight to another region will keep it unchanged in the final image .
The areas outlined in red show the removed portions , and green the kept portions .
The latest version of the code can load a separate bitmap that has the weights encoded in it .
Obliviously , a better solution would be a GUI .
My code allows for variable amounts of weight to be applied to a pixel besides just add / remove .
Also , the weight matrix is maintained along with the image .
Now , resizing the image back down to 800x600 gives us this result :
It 's interesting to see his hand still exists gripping onto the rail .
When removing an area , its important to NOT do the averaging / blending technique .
If this is done , then the astronaut will be blending back into the image , leaving a small sliver of him after the resize .
Adding Paths
The paper appears to gloss over the procedure of adding paths back to the image .
Taken literally , the algorithm would have you choose in order the least energy seams through the source image .
See , for example , this example image where all the seams from the bottom row are shown in red :
It appears that many paths merge back together as they go up , which seems logical considering the energy of the image .
The paper describes adding paths next to theses paths in order from least energy to most .
Since so many merge when the flow upwards , this produces horrible stretching .
It appears something is missing from the paper 's description .
I managed to get it working , thanks to a few tips from Ramin Sabet , creator of Liquid Resize .
Here 's an example , where I used the weights to remove the astronaut , then add paths back into the image to get it back to its original size .
The primary difference between the paper and CAIR 's method is the addition of artificial weight to the least energy path and the new path that was added .
Then , the energy map has to be recalculated to redetermine the least energy path .
This " add weight " is a variable that can be changed to determine how CAIR will find the next least - energy path .
A large weight may cause the paths to move through an area marked for protection , while a small weight will cause CAIR to pick the same area , causing stretching .
In CAIR , I keep the artificial weights separate from the user - supplied weights to avoid polluting the user 's weights .
After each new seam , the artifical weight matrix and the user weight matrix have to be added back together for form a third matrix that is actually used in the energy calculations .
Performance
Throughout this project it has become apparent that the most performance limiting factor is how the data is handled .
Originally I used the EasyBMP objects to hold my images .
They work fine for that , but EasyBMP was never intended for such performance goals .
So , I created my own class , called the CAIR Matrix Library .
The class is templated , so all of my data types ( edge , weights , grayscale , and color images ) use the same methods .
This has worked out surprisingly well for me , considering I 'm far more at home bit shifting than objects oriented generics .
There are several ways to extract further performance from the standard algorithm .
For starters , everything does n't have to be recalculated after every path removal .
Grayscale values can be recalcuated only for the changed pixels .
With extreme care , the edge values can be recalculated for only the changed regions .
Also , with lots of thinking , portions of the energy map can be saved .
Also , large parts of the algorithm can be multi- threaded .
Grayscale , edge detection , and path adding / removing can all very easily be multi- threaded into several threads .
The energy map is quite a different beast since one thread relies on data provided by the other thread , so that code is currently limited to just two threads .
To resize the original image of 1024x678 down to 800x600 with CAIR ( ) takes about 1.6 seconds with this system .
For CAIR_HD ( ) , the same resize takes about 8.8 seconds .
Convolution Comparisons
CAIR now implements several different convolution kernels .
Below is a comparison between the Prewitt and V1 kernel .
Also available are Sobel , Laplacian , and V_SQUARED .
Prewitt
V1
Forward Energy
Later work by the doctors developed a new energy algorithm , called forward energy .
Read about it here .
The traditional energy algorithm does not account for situations where a seam removal will cause two edges to be placed next to each other , which would increase the energy of the image .
This is often seen as some sort of jaggies that develop during the resize .
The forward energy algorithm does a look - ahead of edge values when the energy map is being computed .
Code
CAIR is written in C++ and uses the EasyBMP image library for testing purposes , and the pthreads - win32 library for the multi threaded version .
CAIR should be mulit - platform , requiring only pthreads - win32 to be replaced with the pthread implementation on your platform ( my threading is simple , so there should be no problems ) .
The testing application is limited to only bitmaps .
Run the executable with no options to get a list of possible paramaters .
A simple example is this :
cair - I test.bmp -X 800 -Y 600 -C 1 -R 6 -E 1 - O resized.bmp
That command will use CAIR_HD ( ) with the V1 kernel and forward energy to resize test.bmp down to 800x600 and store the result in resized .bmp .
Source Code
Here is the single threaded version ( depreciated ) : CAIR.zip
Latest Multi - threaded versions : http://sourceforge.net/projects/c-a-i-r/
The single - threaded version will no longer be maintained unless there is high demand .
CAIR is released under the LGPLv2.1. EasyBMP uses a modified BSD license .
pthreads - win32 falls under the LGPL license .
Included is a command - line version compiled with Visual Studio 2008 and should work under any Windows machine .
The multi threaded version requires pthreadVSE2.dll to be in the same directory as the executable .

DELMAS , South Africa  Eudy Simelane was a 31 - year - old lesbian activist and one of this nation ’s best female soccer players , a tall , muscular woman who knew how to defend herself with her fists and her elbows .
She could not have been easy to kill .
Before leaving her naked body face down in a drainage ditch , her murderers stabbed her nine times , said the doctor who performed the autopsy .
Three of the deep cuts were in the upper inside of her thighs .
Those wounds as well as the bruising at the entrance of her vagina led the doctor to conclude that the assailants had tried to rape her .
In February , one of the attackers , Thato Mpithi , 23 , pleaded guilty to murder , implicating three other men before denying their involvement almost six months later .
On Tuesday , in a courtroom here in Delmas , two of the men he named were acquitted for lack of evidence , though the judge , Ratha Mokgoathleng , warned that they might someday have to answer to God .
The other man on trial , Themba Mvubu , 24 , had no reasonable explanation for his trousers ’ being stained with Ms. Simelane ’s blood .
He received a life sentence but walked from the courtroom smiling , showing no contrition and telling a reporter , “ Ach , I ’m not sorry at all . ”
He disappeared down a stairway to a holding cell as some of Ms. Simelane ’s friends shouted that they would prefer he be sliced into pieces .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A recent college graduate is suing her alma mater for $ 72,000 -- the full cost of her tuition and then some -- because she cannot find a job .
Trina Thompson has sued her alma mater , Monroe College of New York .
Trina Thompson , 27 , of the Bronx , graduated from New York 's Monroe College in April with a bachelor of business administration degree in information technology .
On July 24 , she filed suit against the college in Bronx Supreme Court , alleging that Monroe 's " Office of Career Advancement did not help me with a full - time job placement .
I am also suing them because of the stress I have been going through . "
The college responded that it offers job - search support to all its students .
In her complaint , Thompson says she seeks $ 70,000 in reimbursement for her tuition and $ 2,000 to compensate for the stress of her three - month job search .
As Thompson sees it , any reasonable employer would pounce on an applicant with her academic credentials , which include a 2.7 grade - point average and a solid attendance record .
But Monroe 's career - services department has put forth insufficient effort to help her secure employment , she claims .
" They 're supposed to say , ' I got this student , her attendance is good , her GPA is all right -- can you interview this person ? '
They 're not doing that , " she said .
Thompson said she has fulfilled her end of the job - search bargain , peppering companies listed on Monroe 's e-recruiting site with cover letters , résumés and phone calls .
But no more than two employers have responded to her outreach , and those leads have borne no fruit .
Her complaint adds , " The office of career advancement information technology counselor did not make sure their Monroe e-recruiting clients call their graduates that recently finished college for an interview to get a job placement .
They have not tried hard enough to help me . "
She suggested that Monroe 's Office of Career Advancement shows preferential treatment to students with excellent grades .
" They favor more toward students that got a 4.0 .
They help them more out with the job placement , " she said .
iReport.com : " Do n't sue your alma mater "
Monroe College released a statement saying that " while it is clear that no college , especially in this economy , can guarantee employment , Monroe College remains committed to working with all its students , including Ms. Thompson , who graduated only three months ago , to prepare them for careers and to support them during their job search . "
Thompson says she has not hired an attorney to represent her because she cannot afford one .
When she filed her complaint , she also filed a " poor person order , " which exempts her from filing fees associated with the lawsuit .
Asked whether she would advise other college graduates facing job woes to sue their alma maters , Thompson said yes .
" It does n't make any sense :
They went to school for four years , and then they come out working at McDonald 's and Payless .
That 's not what they planned . "
CNN 's Kristen Hamill contributed to this report .
All About New York City
Is the Obama administration giving up on reaching a comprehensive international climate change agreement this year ?
A statement
released on Friday by John Podesta , who headed Barack Obama's
presidential transition , is a big hint that the White House is looking
to dramatically downplay expectations .
In the statement , Podesta , the head of the Center for American
Progress , and Rajendra Pachaur
i , the chair of the UN's
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , declare , " The world 's
leading economic powers remain inactive in preventing an increase in
the serious impacts of climate change . "
The pair do not explicitly
criticize the United States and the Obama administration .
But their
statement suggests that the Obama administration has not succeeded in
leading the major global powers toward effective action :
While current impacts of climate change may not have reached
alarming proportions , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change , that will happen soon enough if we do not take early
action .
What is causing increasing concern , as the December UN climate
summit in Copenhagen draws ever nearer , is the continuing deadlock in
political action to deal with this challenge .
Podesta and Pachauri note that the commitment reached last July by
G - 8 countries - including the United States - to reduce global greenhouse
emissions by 50 percent by 2050 is not sufficient and that the ongoing
negotiations in advance of the Copenhagen conference do not " reflect
this imperative . "
The two paint a bleak picture of the road to Copenhagen :

The interim U.N. meetings over the summer leading up to Copenhagen
have not gone well .
Still unresolved are fundamental differences
between developed countries about whether the Kyoto Protocol should be
continued or be abandoned altogether for an entirely new treaty .
The
document under discussion at the U.N. is some 200 pages of
contradictory provisions from a variety of submissions from different
countries .
Practically every sentence contains bracketed language still
needing debate and revision .
The prospect of shaping this up into a
coherent document by December , with only two more interim meetings to
go , appears grim .
They conclude that the negotiations have reached an impasse , with
the developing and developed countries disagreeing about how far each
side should go to reduce emissions : " While it is true that developed
countries carry the burden of historical responsibility , and must prove
to be the first movers in mitigation , developing countries will become
bigger emitters in the future ; this intractable dynamic is proving
unconstructive . "
Looking for " a more positive track , " Podesta and Pachauri urge the
G - 20 countries meeting in Pittsburgh - nations that together produce 80
percent of global warming emissions - " to focus on a series of
mini- agreements that could be reached at or before Copenhagen . "
Their
wish list includes measures that set - up multilateral collaborations to
develop low - carbon technologies and that create financing arrangements
to assist developing countries in meeting energy - efficiency goals and
in slowing deforestation .
For enviros holding out hope for Copenhagen , the Podesta - Pachauri
statement is a major downer .
The two are dramatically depressing
expectations - and plotting out an alternative track to the Copenhagen
process .
What makes Podesta 's pessimism especially noteworthy is that
for years he was a mentor to Todd Stern ,
who is now the senior US negotiator for Copenhagen .
The two are close
friends , and it is unlikely - make that , unimaginable - that Podesta , an
experienced political player in Washington ( who was a chief of staff
for President Clinton ) , would express such a discouraging position on
Copenhagen without consulting Stern .
Given that Podesta is quite well - informed on these matters , this
appears to be a strong signal that the Obama administration - as the Senate puts off acting
on climate change legislation - is giving up on achieving any grand
accord to redress climate change this December .
It 's a stinging vote of
no confidence in Copenhagen - and a sign that Obama administration
officials , believing they cannot steer the nations of the world toward
a meaningful treaty , are looking for a Plan B .

Embarrassment about sex was once the greatest cause of British double standards .
Now children , the result of sex , fuel the hypocrisies of perfidious Albion .
According to the received wisdom of our times , we are living through a phenomenal feminist advance .
Women have stormed the bastions of male privilege and cracked , if not smashed , the glass ceiling .
But the success of women is based on exploitation of women .
The households of privileged families and a large proportion of the middle class could not function without the labour of servants fleeing the Brezhnevian tower blocks of eastern Europe , Asian slums and poverty and oppression the world over .
Our social structure would collapse were it not sustained by shadowy legions of women , living outside the law as illegal immigrants or living outside the welfare state in the black economy .
Stern left - wing writers in the 20th century told their readers that their wealth depended on the exploitation of far - flung colonies .
Lectures on how our clothes and trainers come from the sweatshops of the east remain a standard of liberal journalism today .
But the line between the rich and the poor worlds does not run between north and south or east and west but through British homes , touching the most intimate aspects of family life – the care of children and the happiness of marriages .
Small wonder there is a gap between public pronouncements and private behaviour .
The contradictions of Baroness Scotland are exemplary .
On the one hand , she is a feminist from a working - class immigrant family who has overcome the formidable prejudices of the law to become Britain 's first woman attorney - general .
On the other , she employed Loloahi Tapui from Tonga as a housekeeper for six months , even though she was here illegally .
If she were not a law officer who had " inadvertently " hired an illegal immigrant , you could say that the critics ' concentration on the baroness was sexist .
Richard Mawhinney , her barrister husband , was as responsible and as likely to benefit from the arrangement .
The second wave of feminism did not meet a significant backlash because its triumphs suited him and other upper - middle - class men very well .
The modern power marriage depends on both husband and wife bringing in high incomes throughout their careers .
Without servants , one partner , almost certainly the wife , would have to give up earning to look after the children .
As important , without servants there would be no domestic peace .
Imagine the petty , grating arguments if Patricia Scotland and Richard Mawhinney came home from demanding jobs to find that the lavatories needed to be scrubbed and the washing pulled out of the machine and ironed .
Many middle - class marriages would have cracked under the pressure of chores , had not the magic of globalisation conjured housekeepers from Poland , Russia , Sri Lanka , the Philippines and , as we now know , the scattered islands of the Tongan archipelago .
In the US , Scotland would have gone as soon as the story broke .
The discovery that an illegal immigrant is rearing the children of a public figure is the surest way to destroy a political career .
However , in Britain , last week I sensed a reluctance among the better sort of journalist to go for the kill .
A nagging feeling of " there but for the grace of God " restrained them and they neither realised nor cared that their self - interested silence allowed injustice to flourish .
British women turned their backs on live - in service because they could not abide the loss of independence .
You do not need a vivid imagination to picture the isolation of the foreigners who have replaced them .
Many illegals can barely speak English and , in any case , cannot appeal to help from the authorities for fear of being deported .
Even the feminist charity Kalayaan , which deals with migrants staying legally in Britain on domestic worker visas , reports that an eye - wateringly high number of the servants it sees are not allowed out of the house and are beaten or raped .
Prosecutions are rarer than hen 's teeth , but occasionally Kalayaan or Liberty will find a woman bold enough to bring an action against an exploitative employer .
Recently , they gave us the story of a Nigerian brought to London to work for a solicitor .
The lawyer took her passport , withheld her wages and subjected her to two years of threats and violence .
After a final battering , she ran away .
A neighbour phoned the police , who refused to investigate .
Nevertheless , Liberty managed to take her before an employment tribunal , which awarded her £ 90,000 for unpaid wages and in compensation for unfair dismissal and race discrimination .
I am not saying that such cases are commonplace , merely that they are the inevitable consequence of the black domestic economy .
I am adamant , however , that many comfortable British families do not believe that domestic workers have as much right as they do to demand maternity , holiday and sick pay from employment tribunals .
In their hearts , they see nothing wrong with firing a nanny because she is pregnant .
Bridget Anderson , of Oxford University and one of the leading authorities on migrant labour , tells me how she became a traitor to the Oxford middle class when she helped a neighbour 's au pair join a trade union .
Not only did her neighbours refuse to speak to her from that day on , they told everyone else in the street never to let her into their homes for fear of the subversive ideas she would put into their nannies ' heads .
Write like this and professional women accuse you of wanting them to stop working , which I do not want to do , or of painting them as callous bitches happy to abandon their children to the care of poor strangers , which I do not want to do either .
All I want is an honest admission that our apparently egalitarian society is kept going by the labour of the vulnerable and the voiceless and that it would be no more than decent if the incessant arguments about whether women in the City should receive seven - figure rather than six - figure bonuses were accompanied by a determination to end the suffering of the poor women on whose unreported work so much of our world depends .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. President Bill Clinton made a surprise visit to North Korea and met its reclusive leader on Tuesday to try to win freedom for two jailed American journalists in a move that could re-energize nuclear talks .
Clinton , husband of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , had what North Korea ’s KCNA news agency described as an “ exhaustive conversation ” over dinner with the ailing Kim Jong - il and top North Korean officials .
Arriving in an unmarked jet on a trip to North Korea he had hoped to take before leaving office in January 2001 , Clinton was presented with flowers by a girl dressed in traditional costume before he was led to a black limousine and driven away .
Confusion rose quickly about the delicate diplomatic negotiations he was engaged in .
The North Korean news agency said Clinton passed on a verbal message from U.S. President Barack Obama .
“ Kim Jong - il expressed thanks for this , ” KCNA said of the message .
“ He welcomed Clinton ’s visit to the DPRK ( North Korea ) and had an exhaustive conversation with him .
There was a wide - ranging exchange of views on the matters of common concern . ”
But the White House denied Clinton carried a message from Obama .
“ That ’s not true , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters in Washington .
Clinton ’s objective was to gain the release of two journalists , Euna Lee and Laura Ling of U.S. media outlet Current TV co-founded by Clinton ’s vice president Al Gore .
They were arrested on the North Korea - China border in March and accused of illegal entry .
A North Korean court sentenced both of them last month to 12 years hard labor for what it called grave crimes .
SIDE BENEFIT ?
Clinton ’s visit could have a side benefit of improving the atmosphere between the United States and North Korea that could restart talks over the isolated state ’s nuclear weapons .
North Korea ’s chief nuclear negotiator , Kim Kye-gwan , was among those greeting Clinton -- whose administration was reported to have considered bombing the North ’s Yongbyon atomic plant in the early 1990s during a prior time of tensions over Pyongyang ’s nuclear ambitions .
“ As soon as he arrives , he will be entering negotiations with the North for the release of the female journalists , ” South Korea ’s Yonhap news agency quoted a source as saying .
Many analysts predicted Pyongyang would use the journalists as leverage to wring concessions from Washington , which sought to place U.N. sanctions on the North for a May nuclear test .
The White House described Clinton ’s visit as private .
“ While this solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans is on the ground , we will have no comment .
We do not want to jeopardize the success of former President Clinton ’s mission , ” Gibbs said in a statement .
Clinton ’s trip followed months of military provocations by the impoverished North , which has turned its back on negotiations with regional powers , including the United States and China , to convince it to give up ambitions to build an atomic arsenal .
In Washington , Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said it was not clear whether Clinton had been authorized to discuss policy issues .

“ It would be nice if it ’s the foundation for a better relationship , ” Graham , a prominent member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , told NBC ’s “ Today Show . ”
Yun Duk-min of the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul said the visit held out the possibility of “ a dramatic turnaround by North Korea that could lead to a new phase of negotiations . ”
“ WRONG SIGNALS ”
It is the second time a former U.S. president has headed to the communist state to try to defuse a crisis .
Former president Jimmy Carter flew there in 1994 when tensions were running high , again over the North ’s nuclear weapons program .

Carter helped broker a deal at that time whereby Pyongyang suspended construction of a 50 - megawatt plutonium reactor in exchange for heating oil and other energy aid .
A former White House staffer to Bill Clinton said it seemed likely that Clinton would be successful .
“ The fact that he ’s there on the ground , I think means that a lot of groundwork has been done .
I ca n’t imagine that he ’s not going to leave without those two , ” the official said .
Secretary of State Clinton , flying to Kenya for a trade conference , enraged Pyongyang ’s leaders last month by likening them to unruly children seeking attention .
One analyst said that was exactly what the former president ’s visit was doing -- rewarding “ bad behavior . ”
Clinton ’s arrival coincides with mounting speculation over succession in Asia ’s only communist dynasty .
Several reports suggest that an increasingly frail - looking Kim Jong - il , 67 , has settled on his third son to take over .
“ It ’s just what they ( North Korea ’s leaders ) need , ” said B.R. Myers , an expert on the North ’s state ideology at the South ’s Dongseo University .
It allows the government to show to a domestic audience , facing deepening poverty , that the nuclear weapons program is making the outside world take it more seriously and the visit will be certain to be portrayed as tribute by the United States .
And it will confirm to North Korea that bad behavior will be rewarded further , Myers said .
“ It sends all the wrong signals . ”
Let ’s say you ’re playing poker and you need one more diamond for a flush .
The dealer turns a card , reveals a diamond and you win the hand .
Was it skill or luck ?
The answer is affecting the fates of people across the country accused of breaking anti-gambling laws -- people like Kevin Raley of Colorado .
As an engineer , Raley finds that the mathematics of poker come easily , and he ’s pretty good at keeping a blank face .
Reading other people , though , is something he ’s always working on .
“ It ’s something I ’m better at today than I was five years ago , ” said Raley .
This goes to the point that Raley , 44 , is trying to make :
The better he gets , the more he wins .

Arrested a year ago for running a $ 20 buy - in Texas Hold ‘ Em tournament at a bar in Greeley , but acquitted by a jury , Raley now hopes to convince the Colorado Supreme Court of what he says is obvious to anyone who really knows the game -- that poker hinges more on skill than chance .
Poker , especially Texas Hold ‘ Em , has exploded in popularity in recent years , with professional tournaments earning television coverage and fan followings for major players .
Most states generally tolerate poker as long as it ’s confined to games among friends in which no one makes a profit other than players .
In Colorado , it ’s illegal to participate in a game in which rake -- or a commission fee charged by the poker operator -- is taken .
It ’s also one of 37 states where a game of skill does n’t qualify as gambling , said Chuck Humphrey , a Colorado - based lawyer and expert in gambling laws .

( California law does n’t distinguish between skill and chance .
It bans some games , such as faro and monte , but does not single out poker . )
At his January trial , Raley argued that not only was poker a game of skill , but that his game had been among friends .
Prosecutors maintained that it was neither .
In a review of Raley ’s case last month , a judge said that poker relies heavily on chance .
“ A poker player may give himself a statistical advantage through skill or experience , but that player is always subject to defeat when the next card is turned , ” Weld County District Judge James Hartmann wrote .
Tim Ouellette disagrees .
Ouellette , 46 , of Greeley , was arrested along with Raley , but charges against him were dismissed after Raley ’s acquittal .
“ It ’s not like roulette or craps , where you throw the dice and you have no control over it , ” Ouellette said .

Raley is petitioning the Colorado Supreme Court to weigh in on the question of skill versus luck .
Other recent skirmishes include a South Carolina case in which five men were arrested in a 2006 raid on a game of Texas Hold ‘ Em .
They were convicted this year by a municipal court judge who said that he agreed that poker hinged on skill , but that he thought it was n’t clear whether that was relevant under state law .
The men are appealing their convictions .
In Columbia County , Pa. , a judge dismissed charges in January against a man accused of running a poker game out of his garage , ruling that he had n’t committed a crime because when skill predominates , it ’s not gambling .
But in a second Pennsylvania case , a Westmoreland County jury last month rejected a man ’s contention that the Texas Hold ‘ Em tournaments he hosted in local fire halls were legal because they were games of skill .

The recent spate of trials represents a “ radical break with the way poker cases have been handled before , ” according to I. Nelson Rose , a law professor at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa and gaming industry consultant .
Unlike with previous trials about poker , Rose says defendants are receiving financial and legal support from groups such as the Washington - based Poker Players Alliance and judges are permitting testimony about research concluding that poker depends on skill .
A central figure in several recent legal battles , including Raley ’s , is University of Denver statistics professor Bob Hannum , who studies gaming mathematics .
In games of chance , “ it does n’t matter what you try to do , ” he said .
“ You can be playing against a monkey , and the monkey will do just as well as you . ”
No so with poker , Hannum said .
Numerous studies conducted in recent years all indicate that in poker the predominant factor is skill , he said .

But do n’t tell that to Gary Norton , the district attorney in Columbia County .
“ In Texas Hold ‘ Em , there ’s one choice : Hold or fold .
That is not necessarily a skill as much as just having guts or not .
It ’s our position that this is gambling -- that there ’s a huge element of chance in the dealing of cards , ” Norton said .
Norton added that prosecution was prompted in part by the defendant ’s acceptance of tips , which made his operation the equivalent of a casino .
Until a higher court rules on the chance - skill question , Norton said , he wo n’t shy away from prosecuting similar cases , although they ’re rare .

“ Do I enjoy sitting down with my friends and playing a little poker ?
Yes , ” he said .
“ A private game of poker in a private home where the house is not taking a cut is not something I ’m going to prosecute .
But something I take very seriously is my oath to administer the law as it exists . ”
In Colorado , Raley and Ouellette and the three friends arrested with them no longer play at their favorite bar , but at a friend ’s home .
And if they succeed in their petition to the high court ?
“ Kevin and I have talked about opening up a poker room of our own , ” Ouellette said .
In the brochure or guidebook they look idyllic and fascinating .
Unspoilt beaches , ancient monuments and historic cities dripping with charm .
But the Wish You Were
Here postcard scenes of the world 's tourist sites do not show you an increasingly common sight : the band of placard - waving locals who wish you were n't .
Last week the Chilean under-secretary of the interior , Patricio Rosende , travelled more than 2,000 miles to a volcanic speck in the ocean to spend two days in heated talks with the people of Easter Island .
Those who live on the island , which is part of Chile and famed for its massive ancient stone statues , believe they are facing ecological disaster because of hordes of tourists .
But their complaints have fallen on deaf ears and lack support from those on the island who survive on visitor dollars .
Last month , protesters resorted to blocking the airport , moving tents and trucks on to the runway and demanding that the 65,000 visitors who fly in each year , some of whom choose to stay on and work , be capped .
As about 600 angry US tourists expressed their irritation after they faced the resultant flight cancellations at the airport in the Chilean capital , Santiago , the government agreed to discuss the islanders ' concerns about overcrowding , the environment and controls on commerce .
" The only thing we are looking for is an answer from the government regarding the need for greater control on who comes to Easter Island , " said the island 's mayor , Luz Zasso .
" We ask , for example , that those who arrive have a card which describes the activity they will be doing here , just like in the Galápagos Islands . "
With a population of 4,900 that has grown by 29 % since 2002 , the island is forced to deal with more than it can handle .
A similar problem led to the Pitcairn Islands , also in the Pacific , establishing immigration controls , with categories for " short - period " tourists with a maximum stay of 14 days and " long - period " tourists with a maximum stay of six months .
The Galápagos Islands already have a limit on visitors but still suffer from what some call backpacker fatigue .
Only a few weeks ago British and Ecuadorian scientists discovered that a mosquito carrying avian malaria that threatens the unique ecosystem of the islands was being brought in by tourists .
The discovery may help local environmental activists , who are hugely concerned about the future of the islands , which two years ago were added to the list of 31 endangered world heritage sites by Unesco .
The Galápagos – an archipelago in the Pacific famed for its huge number of endemic species – saw an increase in the number of visitors from 40,000 in 1990 to more than 170,000 last year , making tourism a major source of income for the islands and mainland Ecuador .
In 2007 there were 2,194 flights to the islands and an estimated 363,000 passenger days on boats .
" Few tourists realise the irony that their trip to the Galápagos is putting strain on the very unspoilt beauty they are there to see , " said Tom Hall , of the travel guide Lonely Planet .
" Tourism round the world is facing some really pressing issues .
We are seeing these few demonstrations by locals , but really if you are in a developing country and are worried about these issues you are also going to be worried about your income and about rocking the boat with your government , " he said .
" Easter Island is a little different to the Galápagos and a little more complicated .
It 's a key stopover for flights between Chile and Tahiti , and gets a lot of visitors stopping over for a few days .
It 's part of many popular round - the - world itineraries for independent travellers and flights here are usually full .
" Owing to this , it does n't have the option of restricting numbers by aiming at top - end tourists as some countries do – Botswana , for instance .
The flip side of that is there are only so many of those tourists to go around .
Then places such as Australia market themselves as independent traveller destinations and accordingly have to deal with the problems that brings .
The remoteness of Easter Island means it'll never be another Machu Picchu [ the Inca mountain city in Peru ] in terms of the numbers who visit , but it is almost entirely reliant on tourism so locals are understandably keen to draw attention to and limit any damage .
" High - volume tourism changes places , but you look at what Venice is planning – and is that fair ?
Should one of the most expensive cities in the world have the right to keep people out ? "
What Venice is planning is still very much at the discussion level , but pressure is growing on Italian authorities to take drastic action against the daily influx of visitors who crowd the city 's narrow streets and Renaissance square .
Enrico Mingardi , in charge of public transport in the city , has just proposed that tourists should have to pre-book their visits to the city and only so many would be admitted on any one day .
" There 's a need to study a project where there is a cap on the number of visitors , " he said .
" If you have a booking , you can come in ; if not , you can't .
There is a physical threshold above which we cannot go . "
Others in the city have called the plans " undemocratic " .
Alessandra Smith , a spokeswoman for the Italian State Tourist Board , said an alternative was to encourage people away from the traditional sights .
" Venice is not just St Mark 's Square , there are areas off the beaten track you can find fewer people …
Areas such as what used to be the old Jewish ghetto and quarters , or the island opposite St Mark 's Square , are very pleasant .
You can explore the old churches and the old docklands ; all those areas off the square are much quieter . "
But the truth is that there are a decreasing number of quiet spots around the world not being reached by the 903 million pairs of feet that criss - crossed the planet on their holidays in 2007 alone .
Ever since the guidebook to foreign lands became fashionable in Victorian times , tourism has risen steadily .
With China and India coming on to the world stage , too , as many more of their citizens catch the travel bug , numbers of tourists have risen steeply year on year for the past five years .
Brazil , Middle East , France , the United States , and even Armenia reported bumper figures for tourism last year .
Many blame guidebooks and travel writing for encouraging the boom , but the truth is that when Ernest Hemingway wrote The Snows of Kilimanjaro , he had no idea he would encourage more than 10,000 people to tackle the eroding sides of the Tanzanian peak .
Likewise the conquering of Everest has seen a small but devout stream of climbers leave so much litter there that the base camp was described as " the world 's highest garbage dump " by mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington .
Clear - up efforts were finally put in place after pressure from local sherpas and the Nepal Mountaineering Association encouraged the Nepalese government to impose a deposit on climbers , refundable only if they take disposable equipment back home with them .
Even the UK has not been immune to the problems , with the standing stones at Stonehenge having to be fenced off from the hands of an over - eager public to prevent damage .
Ancient monuments are often particularly vulnerable .
When the builders of the tombs of the pharaohs closed the burial places in the Valley of the Kings , they did everything they could to seal them for all eternity .
Ventilation was not a big priority , which is why Zahi Hawass , secretary general of Egypt 's Supreme Council of Antiquities , announced in August that the impact of thousands of tourists every day breathing inside the tombs was causing damage to wall carvings and paint .
The grave sites of the boy king Tutankhamun and of Queen Nefertiti and Seti I have so much humidity that fungus is growing on the walls .
The Egyptian authorities are now expected to announce plans to close at least those three tombs down to the public completely , replacing them with replicas .
Otherwise , Hawass warned , they would be gone : " The tombs which are open to visitors face severe damage to both colours and the engravings .
The levels of humidity and fungus are increasing because of the breath of visitors , and this means that the tombs could disappear in between 150 and 500 years . "
The mummy of Tutankhamun , who was made pharaoh at the age of nine , was found in an ornate sarcophagus , his face covered by a solid gold burial mask encrusted with semi-precious stones .
It was his image , and the story of his mysterious death in 1324BC at the age of 19 that helped Egypt to sell itself as a tourist destination across the world .
Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities has taken a series of measures to protect the tombs , including restrictions on visitors .
The country has come a long way in tackling environmental damage since 1995 , when it had to be dissuaded from building a motorway alongside the pyramid of Khufu at Giza , the last of the ancient seven wonders of the world still standing – although earthquakes rather than tourism saw to most of the rest .
Tourism can be seen as either a source of funds to save such sights or the curse that erases them , but at the moment , said Xavier Font of Leeds Metropolitan University 's Centre for Responsible Tourism , the right balance is far from being struck .
" Around the world , most governments can point to one project where the environment has been considered and the locals are happy , but for every one like that there will be another 10 some 20 miles down the road where the turtle habitat has been destroyed or forests ripped up .
" The problem is in the actual development itself , which has the major impact , and with construction companies building resorts and second homes they are going to sell straight on to operators .
There is little impetus to build them with any environmental conscience , when actually it is quite simple to put in measures that will reduce a building 's water and energy use .
There is a cycle of damage that tourism brings ; that 's true whether it 's Brazil or Benidorm .
Places like the Red Sea are using so much water they need a desalination plant .
So they put one in , but in the process they over - salinate that area and kill the coral .
" Much of the so - called income generated by tourism goes outside the country to big companies and operators .
The people who are crushed by tourism will be the very ones tourists think are getting the money .
The reality is the farmer may sell his land to the developer , but then the tourists move in and the price of living becomes so high the farmer can't afford to be there any more . "
Not only are we doing damage by thoughtless travelling , he said , we also use more energy and resources on holiday than we do at home .
A rise in eco-holidays and sustainable travel operators may go a little way to addressing the balance but , as more and more tourism sites round the world face backpacker fatigue , some of the world 's most famous wonders could increasingly be closed off to the public , accessible only through an image on a postcard .

The problem of truth is in a way easy to state : what truths are , and what ( if anything ) makes them true .
But this simple statement masks a great deal of controversy .
Whether there is a metaphysical problem of truth at all , and if there is , what kind of theory might address it , are all standing issues in the theory of truth .
We will see a number of distinct ways of answering these questions .
It would be impossible to survey all there is to say about truth in any coherent way .
Instead , this essay will concentrate on the main themes in the study of truth in the contemporary philosophical literature .
It will attempt to survey the key problems and theories of current interest , and show how they relate to one - another .
A number of other entries investigate many of these topics in greater depth .
Generally , discussion of the principal arguments is left to them .
The goal of this essay is only to provide an overview of the current Theories .
Many of the papers mentioned in this essay can be found in the anthologies edited by Blackburn and Simmons ( 1999 ) and Lynch ( 2001 b ) .
There are a number of book - length surveys of the topics discussed here , including Burgess and Burgess ( 2011 ) , Kirkham ( 1992 ) , and Künne ( 2003 ) .
Also , a number of the topics discussed here , and many further ones , are surveyed at more length in papers in Glanzberg ( 2018 ) .
Truth is one of the central subjects in philosophy .
It is also one of the largest .
Truth has been a topic of discussion in its own right for thousands of years .
Moreover , a huge variety of issues in philosophy relate to truth , either by relying on theses about truth , or implying theses about truth .
Much of the contemporary literature on truth takes as its starting point some ideas which were prominent in the early part of the 20th century .
There were a number of views of truth under discussion at that time , the most significant for the contemporary literature being the correspondence , coherence , and pragmatist theories of truth .
These theories all attempt to directly answer the nature question : what is the nature of truth ?
They take this question at face value : there are truths , and the question to be answered concerns their nature .
In answering this question , each theory makes the notion of truth part of a more thoroughgoing metaphysics or epistemology .
Explaining the nature of truth becomes an application of some metaphysical system , and truth inherits significant metaphysical presuppositions along the way .
The goal of this section is to characterize the ideas of the correspondence , coherence and pragmatist theories which animate the contemporary debate .
In some cases , the received forms of these theories depart from the views that were actually defended in the early 20th century .
We thus dub them the ‘ neo - classical theories ’ .
Where appropriate , we pause to indicate how the neo-classical theories emerge from their ‘ classical ’ roots in the early 20th century .
Perhaps the most important of the neo-classical theories for the contemporary literature is the correspondence theory .
Ideas that sound strikingly like a correspondence theory are no doubt very old .
They might well be found in Aristotle or Aquinas .
When we turn to the late 19th and early 20th centuries where we pick up the story of the neo-classical theories of truth , it is clear that ideas about correspondence were central to the discussions of the time .
In spite of their importance , however , it is strikingly difficult to find an accurate citation in the early 20th century for the received neo-classical view .
Furthermore , the way the correspondence theory actually emerged will provide some valuable reference points for the contemporary debate .
For these reasons , we dwell on the origins of the correspondence theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries at greater length than those of the other neo-classical views , before turning to its contemporary neo-classical form .
For an overview of the correspondence theory , see David ( 2018 ) .
The basic idea of the correspondence theory is that what we believe or say is true if it corresponds to the way things actually are – to the facts .
This idea can be seen in various forms throughout the history of philosophy .
Its modern history starts with the beginnings of analytic philosophy at the turn of the 20th century , particularly in the work of G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell .
Let us pick up the thread of this story in the years between 1898 and about 1910 .
These years are marked by Moore and Russell ’s rejection of idealism .
Yet at this point , they do not hold a correspondence theory of truth .
Indeed Moore ( 1899 ) sees the correspondence theory as a source of idealism , and rejects it .
Russell follows
Moore in this regard .
( For discussion of Moore ’s early critique of idealism , where he rejects the correspondence theory of truth , see Baldwin ( 1991 ) .
Hylton ( 1990 ) provides an extensive discussion of Russell in the context of British idealism .
An overview of these issues is given by Baldwin ( 2018 ) . )
In this period , Moore and Russell hold a version of the identity theory of truth .
They say comparatively little about it , but it is stated briefly in Moore ( 1899 ; 1902 ) and Russell ( 1904 ) .
According to the identity theory , a true proposition is identical to a fact .
Specifically , in Moore and Russell ’s hands , the theory begins with propositions , understood as the objects of beliefs and other propositional attitudes .
Propositions are what are believed , and give the contents of beliefs .
They are also , according to this theory , the primary bearers of truth .
When a proposition is true , it is identical to a fact , and a belief in that proposition is correct .
( Related ideas about the identity theory and idealism are discussed by McDowell ( 1994 ) and further developed by Hornsby ( 2001 ) . )
The identity theory Moore and Russell espoused takes truth to be a property of propositions .
Furthermore , taking up an idea familiar to readers of Moore , the property of truth is a simple unanalyzable property .
Facts are understood as simply those propositions which are true .
There are true propositions and false ones , and facts just are true propositions .
There is thus no “ difference between truth and the reality to which it is supposed to correspond ” ( Moore , 1902 , p. 21 ) .
( For further discussion of the identity theory of truth , see Baldwin ( 1991 ) , Candlish ( 1999 ) , Candlish and Damnjanovic ( 2018 ) , Cartwright ( 1987 ) , Dodd ( 2000 ) , and the entry on the identity theory of truth . )
Moore and Russell came to reject the identity theory of truth in favor of a correspondence theory , sometime around 1910 ( as we see in Moore , 1953 , which reports lectures he gave in 1910 – 1911 , and Russell , 1910 b ) .
They do so because they came to reject the existence of propositions .
Why ?
Among reasons , they came to doubt that there could be any such things as false propositions , and then concluded that there are no such things as propositions at all .
Why did Moore and Russell find false propositions problematic ?
A full answer to this question is a point of scholarship that would take us too far afield .
( Moore himself lamented that he could not “ put the objection in a clear and convincing way ” ( 1953 , p. 263 ) , but see Cartwright ( 1987 ) and David ( 2001 ) for careful and clear exploration of the arguments . )
But very roughly , the identification of facts with true propositions left them unable to see what a false proposition could be other than something which is just like a fact , though false .
If such things existed , we would have fact - like things in the world , which Moore and Russell now see as enough to make false propositions count as true .
Hence , they cannot exist , and so there are no false propositions .
As Russell ( 1956 , p. 223 ) later says , propositions seem to be at best “ curious shadowy things ” in addition to facts .
As Cartwright ( 1987 ) reminds us , it is useful to think of this argument in the context of Russell ’s slightly earlier views about propositions .
As we see clearly in Russell ( 1903 ) , for instance , he takes propositions to have constituents .
But they are not mere collections of constituents , but a ‘ unity ’ which brings the constituents together .
( We thus confront the ‘ problem of the unity of the proposition ’ . )
But what , we might ask , would be the ‘ unity ’ of a proposition that Samuel Ramey sings – with constituents Ramey and singing – except Ramey bearing the property of singing ?
If that is what the unity consists in , then we seem to have nothing other than the fact that Ramey sings .
But then we could not have genuine false propositions without having false facts .
As Cartwright also reminds us , there is some reason to doubt the cogency of this sort of argument .
But let us put the assessment of the arguments aside , and continue the story .
From the rejection of propositions a correspondence theory emerges .
The primary bearers of truth are no longer propositions , but beliefs themselves .
In a slogan :
A belief is true if and only if it corresponds to a fact .
Views like this are held by Moore ( 1953 ) and Russell ( 1910 b ; 1912 ) .
Of course , to understand such a theory , we need to understand the crucial relation of correspondence , as well as the notion of a fact to which a belief corresponds .
We now turn to these questions .
In doing so , we will leave the history , and present a somewhat more modern reconstruction of a correspondence theory .
( For more on facts and proposition in this period , see Sullivan and Johnston ( 2018 ) . )
The correspondence theory of truth is at its core an ontological thesis : a belief is true if there exists an appropriate entity – a fact – to which it corresponds .
If there is no such entity , the belief is false .
Facts , for the neo-classical correspondence theory , are entities in their own right .
Facts are generally taken to be composed of particulars and properties and relations or universals , at least .
The neo-classical correspondence theory thus only makes sense within the setting of a metaphysics that includes such facts .
Hence , it is no accident that as Moore and Russell turn away from the identity theory of truth , the metaphysics of facts takes on a much more significant role in their views .
This perhaps becomes most vivid in the later Russell ( 1956 , p. 182 ) , where the existence of facts is the “ first truism . ”
( The influence of Wittgenstein ’s ideas to appear in the Tractatus ( 1922 ) on Russell in this period was strong , and indeed , the Tractatus remains one of the important sources for the neo-classical correspondence theory .
For more recent extensive discussions of facts , see Armstrong ( 1997 ) and Neale ( 2001 ) . )
Consider , for example , the belief that Ramey sings .
Let us grant that this belief is true .
In what does its truth consist , according to the correspondence theory ?
It consists in there being a fact in the world , built from the individual Ramey , and the property of singing .
Let us denote this \( \langle\ ) Ramey , Singing \( \rangle\ ) .
This fact exists .
In contrast , the world ( we presume ) contains no fact \( \langle \ ) Ramey , Dancing \( \rangle\ ) .
The belief that Ramey sings stands in the relation of correspondence to the fact \( \langle \ ) Ramey , Singing \( \rangle\ ) , and so the belief is true .
What is the relation of correspondence ?
One of the standing objections to the classical correspondence theory is that a fully adequate explanation of correspondence proves elusive .
But for a simple belief , like that Ramey sings , we can observe that the structure of the fact \( \langle \ ) Ramey , Singing \( \rangle\ ) matches the subject - predicate form of the that - clause which reports the belief , and may well match the structure of the belief itself .
So far , we have very much the kind of view that Moore and Russell would have found congenial .
But the modern form of the correspondence theory seeks to round out the explanation of correspondence by appeal to propositions .
Indeed , it is common to base a correspondence theory of truth upon the notion of a structured proposition .
Propositions are again cast as the contents of beliefs and assertions , and propositions have structure which at least roughly corresponds to the structure of sentences .
At least , for simple beliefs like that Ramey sings , the proposition has the same subject predicate structure as the sentence .
( Proponents of structured propositions , such as Kaplan ( 1989 ) , often look to Russell ( 1903 ) for inspiration , and find unconvincing Russell ’s reasons for rejecting them . )
With facts and structured propositions in hand , an attempt may be made to explain the relation of correspondence .
Correspondence holds between a proposition and a fact when the proposition and fact have the same structure , and the same constituents at each structural position .
When they correspond , the proposition and fact thus mirror each - other .
In our simple example , we might have :
\ [ \begin{matrix} \text {proposition that} & \text {Ramey} & \text {sings} \\ & \downarrow & \downarrow \\ \text {fact} & \langle Ramey , & Singing \rangle \end{matrix} \ ]
Propositions , though structured like facts , can be true or false .
In a false case , like the proposition that Ramey dances , we would find no fact at the bottom of the corresponding diagram .
Beliefs are true or false depending on whether the propositions which are believed are .
We have sketched this view for simple propositions like the proposition that Ramey sings .
How to extend it to more complex cases , like general propositions or negative propositions , is an issue we will not delve into here .
It requires deciding whether there are complex facts , such as general facts or negative facts , or whether there is a more complex relation of correspondence between complex propositions and simple facts .
( The issue of whether there are such complex facts marks a break between Russell ( 1956 ) and Wittgenstein ( 1922 ) and the earlier views which Moore ( 1953 ) and Russell ( 1912 ) sketch . )
According to the correspondence theory as sketched here , what is key to truth is a relation between propositions and the world , which obtains when the world contains a fact that is structurally similar to the proposition .
Though this is not the theory Moore and Russell held , it weaves together ideas of theirs with a more modern take on ( structured ) propositions .
We will thus dub it the neo-classical correspondence theory .
This theory offers us a paradigm example of a correspondence theory of truth .
The leading idea of the correspondence theory is familiar .
It is a form of the older idea that true beliefs show the right kind of resemblance to what is believed .
In contrast to earlier empiricist theories , the thesis is not that one ’s ideas per se resemble what they are about .
Rather , the propositions which give the contents of one ’s true beliefs mirror reality , in virtue of entering into correspondence relations to the right pieces of it .
In this theory , it is the way the world provides us with appropriately structured entities that explains truth .
Our metaphysics thus explains the nature of truth , by providing the entities needed to enter into correspondence relations .
For more on the correspondence theory , see David ( 1994 , 2018 ) and the entry on the correspondance theory of truth .
Though initially the correspondence theory was seen by its developers as a competitor to the identity theory of truth , it was also understood as opposed to the coherence theory of truth .
We will be much briefer with the historical origins of the coherence theory than we were with the correspondence theory .
Like the correspondence theory , versions of the coherence theory can be seen throughout the history of philosophy .
( See , for instance , Walker ( 1989 ) for a discussion of its early modern lineage . )
Like the correspondence theory , it was important in the early 20th century British origins of analytic philosophy .
Particularly , the coherence theory of truth is associated with the British idealists to whom Moore and Russell were reacting .
Many idealists at that time did indeed hold coherence theories .
Let us take as an example Joachim ( 1906 ) .
( This is the theory that Russell ( 1910a ) attacks . )
Joachim says that :
Truth in its essential nature is that systematic coherence which is the character of a significant whole ( p. 76 ) .
We will not attempt a full exposition of Joachim ’s view , which would take us well beyond the discussion of truth into the details of British idealism .
But a few remarks about his theory will help to give substance to the quoted passage .
Perhaps most importantly , Joachim talks of ‘ truth ’ in the singular .
This is not merely a turn of phrase , but a reflection of his monistic idealism .
Joachim insists that what is true is the “ whole complete truth ” ( p. 90 ) .
Individual judgments or beliefs are certainly not the whole complete truth .
Such judgments are , according to Joachim , only true to a degree .
One aspect of this doctrine is a kind of holism about content , which holds that any individual belief or judgment gets its content only in virtue of being part of a system of judgments .
But even these systems are only true to a degree , measuring the extent to which they express the content of the single ‘ whole complete truth ’ .
Any real judgment we might make will only be partially true .
To flesh out Joachim ’s theory , we would have to explain what a significant whole is .
We will not attempt that , as it leads us to some of the more formidable aspects of his view , e.g. , that it is a “ process of self - fulfillment ” ( p. 77 ) .
But it is clear that Joachim takes ‘ systematic coherence ’ to be stronger than consistency .
In keeping with his holism about content , he rejects the idea that coherence is a relation between independently identified contents , and so finds it necessary to appeal to ‘ significant wholes ’ .
As with the correspondence theory , it will be useful to recast the coherence theory in a more modern form , which will abstract away from some of the difficult features of British idealism .
As with the correspondence theory , it can be put in a slogan :
A belief is true if and only if it is part of a coherent system of beliefs .
To further the contrast with the neo-classical correspondence theory , we may add that a proposition is true if it is the content of a belief in the system , or entailed by a belief in the system .
We may assume , with Joachim , that the condition of coherence will be stronger than consistency .
With the idealists generally , we might suppose that features of the believing subject will come into play .
This theory is offered as an analysis of the nature of truth , and not simply a test or criterion for truth .
Put as such , it is clearly not Joachim ’s theory ( it lacks his monism , and he rejects propositions ) , but it is a standard take on coherence in the contemporary literature .
( It is the way the coherence theory is given in Walker ( 1989 ) , for instance .
See also Young ( 2001 ) for a recent defense of a coherence theory . )
Let us take this as our neo-classical version of the coherence theory .
The contrast with the correspondence theory of truth is clear .
Far from being a matter of whether the world provides a suitable object to mirror a proposition , truth is a matter of how beliefs are related to each - other .
The coherence theory of truth enjoys two sorts of motivations .
One is primarily epistemological .
Most coherence theorists also hold a coherence theory of knowledge ; more specifically , a coherence theory of justification .
According to this theory , to be justified is to be part of a coherent system of beliefs .
An argument for this is often based on the claim that only another belief could stand in a justification relation to a belief , allowing nothing but properties of systems of belief , including coherence , to be conditions for justification .
Combining this with the thesis that a fully justified belief is true forms an argument for the coherence theory of truth .
( An argument along these lines is found in Blanshard ( 1939 ) , who holds a form of the coherence theory closely related to Joachim’s . )
The steps in this argument may be questioned by a number of contemporary epistemological views .
But the coherence theory also goes hand - in - hand with its own metaphysics as well .
The coherence theory is typically associated with idealism .
As we have already discussed , forms of it were held by British idealists such as Joachim , and later by Blanshard ( in America ) .
An idealist should see the last step in the justification argument as quite natural .
More generally , an idealist will see little ( if any ) room between a system of beliefs and the world it is about , leaving the coherence theory of truth as an extremely natural option .
It is possible to be an idealist without adopting a coherence theory .
( For instance , many scholars read Bradley as holding a version of the identity theory of truth .
See Baldwin ( 1991 ) for some discussion . )
However , it is hard to see much of a way to hold the coherence theory of truth without maintaining some form of idealism .
If there is nothing to truth beyond what is to be found in an appropriate system of beliefs , then it would seem one ’s beliefs constitute the world in a way that amounts to idealism .
( Walker ( 1989 ) argues that every coherence theorist must be an idealist , but not vice - versa . )
The neo-classical correspondence theory seeks to capture the intuition that truth is a content - to - world relation .
It captures this in the most straightforward way , by asking for an object in the world to pair up with a true proposition .
The neo-classical coherence theory , in contrast , insists that truth is not a content - to - world relation at all ; rather , it is a content - to - content , or belief - to - belief , relation .
The coherence theory requires some metaphysics which can make the world somehow reflect this , and idealism appears to be it .
( A distant descendant of the neo-classical coherence theory that does not require idealism will be discussed in section 6.5 below . )
For more on the coherence theory , see Walker ( 2018 ) and the entry on the coherence theory of truth .
A different perspective on truth was offered by the American pragmatists .
As with the neo-classical correspondence and coherence theories , the pragmatist theories go with some typical slogans .
For example , Peirce is usually understood as holding the view that :
Truth is the end of inquiry .
( See , for instance Hartshorne et al. , 1931 – 58 , § 3.432 . )
Both Peirce and James are associated with the slogan that :
Truth is satisfactory to believe .
James ( e.g. , 1907 ) understands this principle as telling us what practical value truth has .
True beliefs are guaranteed not to conflict with subsequent experience .
Likewise , Peirce ’s slogan tells us that true beliefs will remain settled at the end of prolonged inquiry .
Peirce ’s slogan is perhaps most typically associated with pragmatist views of truth , so we might take it to be our canonical neo-classical theory .
However , the contemporary literature does not seem to have firmly settled upon a received ‘ neo - classical ’ pragmatist theory .
In her reconstruction ( upon which we have relied heavily ) , Haack ( 1976 ) notes that the pragmatists ’ views on truth also make room for the idea that truth involves a kind of correspondence , insofar as the scientific method of inquiry is answerable to some independent world .
Peirce , for instance , does not reject a correspondence theory outright ; rather , he complains that it provides merely a ‘ nominal ’ or ‘ transcendental ’ definition of truth ( e.g Hartshorne et al. , 1931 – 58 , § 5.553 , § 5.572 ) , which is cut off from practical matters of experience , belief , and doubt ( § 5.416 ) .
( See Misak ( 2004 ) for an extended discussion . )
This marks an important difference between the pragmatist theories and the coherence theory we just considered .
Even so , pragmatist theories also have an affinity with coherence theories , insofar as we expect the end of inquiry to be a coherent system of beliefs .
As Haack also notes , James maintains an important verificationist idea : truth is what is verifiable .
We will see this idea re-appear in section 4 .
For more on pragmatist theories of truth , see Misak ( 2018 ) .
James ’ views are discussed further in the entry on William James .
Peirce ’s views are discussed further in the entry on Charles Sanders Peirce .
Modern forms of the classical theories survive .
Many of these modern theories , notably correspondence theories , draw on ideas developed by Tarski .
In this regard , it is important to bear in mind that his seminal work on truth ( 1935 ) is very much of a piece with other works in mathematical logic , such as his ( 1931 ) , and as much as anything this work lays the ground - work for the modern subject of model theory – a branch of mathematical logic , not the metaphysics of truth .
In this respect , Tarski ’s work provides a set of highly useful tools that may be employed in a wide range of philosophical projects .
( See Patterson ( 2012 ) for more on Tarski ’s work in its historical context . )
Tarski’s work has a number of components , which we will consider in turn .
In the classical debate on truth at the beginning of the 20th century we considered in section 1 , the issue of truth - bearers was of great significance .
For instance , Moore and Russell ’s turn to the correspondence theory was driven by their views on whether there are propositions to be the bearers of truth .
Many theories we reviewed took beliefs to be the bearers of truth .
In contrast , Tarski and much of the subsequent work on truth takes sentences to be the primary bearers of truth .
This is not an entirely novel development : Russell ( 1956 ) also takes truth to apply to sentence ( which he calls ‘ propositions ’ in that text ) .
But whereas much of the classical debate takes the issue of the primary bearers of truth to be a substantial and important metaphysical one , Tarski is quite casual about it .
His primary reason for taking sentences as truth - bearers is convenience , and he explicitly distances himself from any commitment about the philosophically contentious issues surrounding other candidate truth - bearers ( e.g. , Tarski , 1944 ) .
( Russell ( 1956 ) makes a similar suggestion that sentences are the appropriate truth - bearers “ for the purposes of logic ” ( p. 184 ) , though he still takes the classical metaphysical issues to be important . )
We will return to the issue of the primary bearers of truth in section 6.1 .
For the moment , it will be useful to simply follow Tarski ’s lead .
But it should be stressed that for this discussion , sentences are fully interpreted sentences , having meanings .
We will also assume that the sentences in question do not change their content across occasions of use , i.e. , that they display no context - dependence .
We are taking sentences to be what Quine ( 1960 ) calls ‘ eternal sentences ’ .
In some places ( e.g. , Tarski , 1944 ) , Tarski refers to his view as the ‘ semantic conception of truth ’ .
It is not entirely clear just what Tarski had in mind by this , but it is clear enough that Tarski ’s theory defines truth for sentences in terms of concepts like reference and satisfaction , which are intimately related to the basic semantic functions of names and predicates ( according to many approaches to semantics ) .
For more discussion , see Woleński ( 2001 ) .
Let us suppose we have a fixed language \ ( \mathbf { L}\ ) whose sentences are fully interpreted .
The basic question Tarski poses is what an adequate theory of truth for \( \mathbf { L}\ ) would be .
Tarski’s answer is embodied in what he calls Convention T :
An adequate theory of truth for \( \mathbf { L}\ ) must imply , for each sentence \( \phi\ ) of \( \mathbf {L}\ )
\( \ulcorner \phi \urcorner\ ) is true if and only if \( \phi\ ) .
( We have simplified Tarski ’s presentation somewhat . )
This is an adequacy condition for theories , not a theory itself .
Given the assumption that \ ( \mathbf {L}\ ) is fully interpreted , we may assume that each sentence \ ( \phi\ ) in fact has a truth value .
In light of this , Convention T guarantees that the truth predicate given by the theory will be extensionally correct , i.e. , have as its extension all and only the true sentences of \( \mathbf {L}\ ) .
Convention T draws our attention to the biconditionals of the form
\( \ulcorner \ulcorner \phi \urcorner\ ) is true if and only if \( \phi \urcorner\ ) ,
which are usually called the Tarski biconditionals for a language \( \mathbf {L}\ ) .
Tarski does not merely propose a condition of adequacy for theories of truth , he also shows how to meet it .
One of his insights is that if the language \ ( \mathbf { L}\ ) displays the right structure , then truth for \( \mathbf { L}\ ) can be defined recursively .
For instance , let us suppose that \ ( \mathbf {L}\ ) is a simple formal language , containing two atomic sentences ‘ snow is white ’ and ‘ grass is green ’ , and the sentential connectives \( \vee\ ) and \(
eg\ ) .
In spite of its simplicity , \( \mathbf {L}\ ) contains infinitely many distinct sentences .
But truth can be defined for all of them by recursion .
Base clauses : ‘ Snow is white ’ is true if and only if snow is white .
‘ Grass is green ’ is true if and only if grass is green .
Recursion clauses .
For any sentences \ ( \phi\ ) and \ ( \psi\ ) of \( \mathbf {L}\ ) : \( \ulcorner \phi \vee \psi \urcorner\ ) is true if and only if \( \ulcorner \ phi \urcorner\ ) is true or \( \ulcorner \psi \urcorner\ ) is true .
\( \ulcorner
eg \phi \urcorner\ ) is true if and only if it is not the case that \( \ulcorner \ phi \urcorner\ ) is true .
This theory satisfies Convention T .
This may look trivial , but in defining an extensionally correct truth predicate for an infinite language with four clauses , we have made a modest application of a very powerful technique .
Tarski’s techniques go further , however .
They do not stop with atomic sentences .
Tarski notes that truth for each atomic sentence can be defined in terms of two closely related notions : reference and satisfaction .
Let us consider a language \( \mathbf { L}'\ ) , just like \( \mathbf { L}\ ) except that instead of simply having two atomic sentences , \( \mathbf { L}'\ ) breaks atomic sentences into terms and predicates .
\( \mathbf {L}'\ ) contains terms ‘ snow ’ and ‘ grass ’ ( let us engage in the idealization that these are simply singular terms ) , and predicates ‘ is white ’ and ‘ is green ’ .
So \( \mathbf {L}'\ ) is like \ ( \mathbf { L}\ ) , but also contains the sentences ‘ Snow is green ’ and ‘ Grass is white ’ . )
We can define truth for atomic sentences of \ ( \mathbf { L}'\ ) in the following way .
Base clauses : ‘ Snow ’ refers to snow .
‘ Grass ’ refers to grass .
\ ( a\ ) satisfies ‘ is white ’ if and only if \ ( a\ ) is white .
\ ( a\ ) satisfies ‘ is green ’ if and only if \ ( a\ ) is green .
For any atomic sentence \( \ulcorner t\ ) is \( P \urcorner\ ) : \( \ulcorner t\ ) is \( P \urcorner\ ) is true if and only if the referent of \( \ulcorner t \urcorner\ ) satisfies \( \ulcorner P\urcorner\ ) .
One of Tarski’s key insights is that the apparatus of satisfaction allows for a recursive definition of truth for sentences with quantifiers , though we will not examine that here .
We could repeat the recursion clauses for \( \mathbf {L}\ ) to produce a full theory of truth for \( \mathbf { L}'\ ) .
Let us say that a Tarskian theory of truth is a recursive theory , built up in ways similar to the theory of truth for \( \mathbf { L}'\ ) .
Tarski goes on to demonstrate some key applications of such a theory of truth .
A Tarskian theory of truth for a language \ ( \mathbf { L}\ ) can be used to show that theories in \ ( \mathbf { L}\ ) are consistent .
This was especially important to Tarski , who was concerned the Liar paradox would make theories in languages containing a truth predicate inconsistent .
For more , see Ray ( 2018 ) and the entries on axiomatic theories of truth , the Liar paradox , and Tarski ’s truth definitions .
The correspondence theory of truth expresses the very natural idea that truth is a content - to - world or word - to - world relation : what we say or think is true or false in virtue of the way the world turns out to be .
We suggested that , against a background like the metaphysics of facts , it does so in a straightforward way .
But the idea of correspondence is certainly not specific to this framework .
Indeed , it is controversial whether a correspondence theory should rely on any particular metaphysics at all .
The basic idea of correspondence , as Tarski ( 1944 ) and others have suggested , is captured in the slogan from Aristotle ’s Metaphysics Γ 7.27 , “ to say of what is that it is , or of what is not that it is not , is true ” ( Ross , 1928 ) .
‘ What is ’ , it is natural enough to say , is a fact , but this natural turn of phrase may well not require a full - blown metaphysics of facts .
( For a discussion of Aristotle ’s views in a historical context , see Szaif ( 2018 ) . )
Yet without the metaphysics of facts , the notion of correspondence as discussed in section 1.1 loses substance .
This has led to two distinct strands in contemporary thinking about the correspondence theory .
One strand seeks to recast the correspondence theory in a way that does not rely on any particular ontology .
Another seeks to find an appropriate ontology for correspondence , either in terms of facts or other entities .
We will consider each in turn .
Tarski himself sometimes suggested that his theory was a kind of correspondence theory of truth .
Whether his own theory is a correspondence theory , and even whether it provides any substantial philosophical account of truth at all , is a matter of controversy .
( One rather drastic negative assessment from Putnam ( 1985 – 86 , p. 333 ) is that “ As a philosophical account of truth , Tarski ’s theory fails as badly as it is possible for an account to fail . ” )
But a number of philosophers ( e.g. , Davidson , 1969 ; Field , 1972 ) have seen Tarski ’s theory as providing at least the core of a correspondence theory of truth which dispenses with the metaphysics of facts .
Tarski’s theory shows how truth for a sentence is determined by certain properties of its constituents ; in particular , by properties of reference and satisfaction ( as well as by the logical constants ) .
As it is normally understood , reference is the preeminent word - to - world relation .
Satisfaction is naturally understood as a word - to - world relation as well , which relates a predicate to the things in the world that bear it .
The Tarskian recursive definition shows how truth is determined by reference and satisfaction , and so is in effect determined by the things in the world we refer to and the properties they bear .
This , one might propose , is all the correspondence we need .
It is not correspondence of sentences or propositions to facts ; rather , it is correspondence of our expressions to objects and the properties they bear , and then ways of working out the truth of claims in terms of this .
This is certainly not the neo-classical idea of correspondence .
In not positing facts , it does not posit any single object to which a true proposition or sentence might correspond .
Rather , it shows how truth might be worked out from basic word - to - world relations .
However , a number of authors have noted that Tarski ’s theory cannot by itself provide us with such an account of truth .
As we will discuss more fully in section 4.2 , Tarski ’s apparatus is in fact compatible with theories of truth that are certainly not correspondence theories .
Field ( 1972 ) , in an influential discussion and diagnosis of what is lacking in Tarski ’s account , in effect points out that whether we really have something worthy of the name ‘ correspondence ’ depends on our having notions of reference and satisfaction which genuinely establish word - to - world relations .
( Field does not use the term ‘ correspondence ’ , but does talk about e.g. , the “ connection between words and things ” ( p. 373 ) . )
By itself , Field notes , Tarski’s theory does not offer an account of reference and satisfaction at all .
Rather , it offers a number of disquotation clauses , such as :
‘ Snow ’ refers to snow .
\ ( a\ ) satisfies ‘ is white ’ if and only if \ ( a\ ) is white .
These clauses have an air of triviality ( though whether they are to be understood as trivial principles or statements of non-trivial semantic facts has been a matter of some debate ) .
With Field , we might propose to supplement clauses like these with an account of reference and satisfaction .
Such a theory should tell us what makes it the case that the word ‘ snow ’ refer to snow .
( In 1972 , Field was envisaging a physicalist account , along the lines of the causal theory of reference . )
This should inter alia guarantee that truth is really determined by word - to - world relations , so in conjunction with the Tarskian recursive definition , it could provide a correspondence theory of truth .
Such a theory clearly does not rely on a metaphysics of facts .
Indeed , it is in many ways metaphysically neutral , as it does not take a stand on the nature of particulars , or of the properties or universals that underwrite facts about satisfaction .
However , it may not be entirely devoid of metaphysical implications , as we will discuss further in section 4.1 .
Much of the subsequent discussion of Field - style approaches to correspondence has focused on the role of representation in these views .
Field ’s own ( 1972 ) discussion relies on a causal relation between terms and their referents , and a similar relation for satisfaction .
These are instances of representation relations .
According to representational views , meaningful items , like perhaps thoughts or sentences or their constituents , have their contents in virtue of standing in the right relation to the things they represent .
On many views , including Field ’s , a name stands in such a relation to its bearer , and the relation is a causal one .
The project of developing a naturalist account of the representation relation has been an important one in the philosophy of mind and language .
( See the entry on mental representation . )
But , it has implications for the theory of truth .
Representational views of content lead naturally to correspondence theories of truth .
To make this vivid , suppose you hold that sentences or beliefs stand in a representation relation to some objects .
It is natural to suppose that for true beliefs or sentences , those objects would be facts .
We then have a correspondence theory , with the correspondence relation explicated as a representation relation : a truth bearer is true if it represents a fact .
As we have discussed , many contemporary views reject facts , but one can hold a representational view of content without them .
One interpretation of Field ’s theory is just that .
The relations of reference and satisfaction are representation relations , and truth for sentences is determined compositionally in terms of those representation relations , and the nature of the objects they represent .
If we have such relations , we have the building blocks for a correspondence theory without facts .
Field ( 1972 ) anticipated a naturalist reduction of the representation via a causal theory , but any view that accepts representation relations for truth bearers or their constituents can provide a similar theory of truth .
( See Jackson ( 2006 ) and Lynch ( 2009 ) for further discussion . )
Representational views of content provide a natural way to approach the correspondence theory of truth , and likewise , anti-representational views provide a natural way to avoid the correspondence theory of truth .
This is most clear in the work of Davidson , as we will discuss more in section 6.5 .
There have been a number of correspondence theories that do make use of facts .
Some are notably different from the neo-classical theory sketched in section 1.1 .
For instance , Austin ( 1950 ) proposes a view in which each statement ( understood roughly as an utterance event ) corresponds to both a fact or situation , and a type of situation .
It is true if the former is of the latter type .
This theory , which has been developed by situation theory ( e.g. , Barwise and Perry , 1986 ) , rejects the idea that correspondence is a kind of mirroring between a fact and a proposition .
Rather , correspondence relations to Austin are entirely conventional .
( See Vision ( 2004 ) for an extended defense of an Austinian correspondence theory . )
As an ordinary language philosopher , Austin grounds his notion of fact more in linguistic usage than in an articulated metaphysics , but he defends his use of fact - talk in Austin ( 1961 b ) .
In a somewhat more Tarskian spirit , formal theories of facts or states of affairs have also been developed .
For instance , Taylor ( 1976 ) provides a recursive definition of a collection of ‘ states of affairs ’ for a given language .
Taylor ’s states of affairs seem to reflect the notion of fact at work in the neo-classical theory , though as an exercise in logic , they are officially \( n\ ) - tuples of objects and intensions .
There are more metaphysically robust notions of fact in the current literature .
For instance , Armstrong ( 1997 ) defends a metaphysics in which facts ( under the name ‘ states of affairs ’ ) are metaphysically fundamental .
The view has much in common with the neo-classical one .
Like the neo-classical view , Armstrong endorses a version of the correspondence theory .
States of affairs are truthmakers for propositions , though Armstrong argues that there may be many such truthmakers for a given proposition , and vice versa .
( Armstrong also envisages a naturalistic account of propositions as classes of equivalent belief - tokens . )
Armstrong ’s primary argument is what he calls the ‘ truthmaker argument ’ .
It begins by advancing a truthmaker principle , which holds that for any given truth , there must be a truthmaker – a “ something in the world which makes it the case , that serves as an ontological ground , for this truth ” ( p. 115 ) .
It is then argued that facts are the appropriate truthmakers .
In contrast to the approach to correspondence discussed in section 3.1 , which offered correspondence with minimal ontological implications , this view returns to the ontological basis of correspondence that was characteristic of the neo-classical theory .
For more on facts , see the entry on facts .
The truthmaker principle is often put as the schema :
If \( \phi\ ) , then there is an \ ( x\ ) such that necessarily , if \ ( x\ ) exists , then \( \phi\ ) .
( Fox ( 1987 ) proposed putting the principle this way , rather than explicitly in terms of truth . )
The truthmaker principle expresses the ontological aspect of the neo-classical correspondence theory .
Not merely must truth obtain in virtue of word - to - world relations , but there must be a thing that makes each truth true .
( For one view on this , see Merricks ( 2007 ) . )
The neo-classical correspondence theory , and Armstrong , cast facts as the appropriate truthmakers .
However , it is a non-trivial step from the truthmaker principle to the existence of facts .
There are a number of proposals in the literature for how other sorts of objects could be truthmakers ; for instance , tropes ( called ‘ moments ’ , in Mulligan et al. , 1984 ) .
Parsons ( 1999 ) argues that the truthmaker principle ( presented in a somewhat different form ) is compatible with there being only concrete particulars .
As we saw in discussing the neo-classical correspondence theory , truthmaker theories , and fact theories in particular , raise a number of issues .
One which has been discussed at length , for instance , is whether there are negative facts .
Negative facts would be the truthmakers for negated sentences .
Russell ( 1956 ) notoriously expresses ambivalence about whether there are negative facts .
Armstrong ( 1997 ) rejects them , while Beall ( 2000 ) defends them .
( For more discussion of truthmakers , see Cameron ( 2018 ) and the papers in Beebee and Dodd ( 2005 ) . )
The neo-classical theories we surveyed in section 1 made the theory of truth an application of their background metaphysics ( and in some cases epistemology ) .
In section 2 and especially in section 3 , we returned to the issue of what sorts of ontological commitments might go with the theory of truth .
There we saw a range of options , from relatively ontologically non-committal theories , to theories requiring highly specific ontologies .
There is another way in which truth relates to metaphysics .
Many ideas about realism and anti-realism are closely related to ideas about truth .
Indeed , many approaches to questions about realism and anti-realism simply make them questions about truth .
In discussing the approach to correspondence of section 3.1 , we noted that it has few ontological requirements .
It relies on there being objects of reference , and something about the world which makes for determinate satisfaction relations ; but beyond that , it is ontologically neutral .
But as we mentioned there , this is not to say that it has no metaphysical implications .
A correspondence theory of truth , of any kind , is often taken to embody a form of realism .
The key features of realism , as we will take it , are that :
The world exists objectively , independently of the ways we think about it or describe it .
Our thoughts and claims are about that world .
( Wright ( 1992 ) offers a nice statement of this way of thinking about realism . )
These theses imply that our claims are objectively true or false , depending on how the world they are about is .
The world that we represent in our thoughts or language is an objective world .
( Realism may be restricted to some subject - matter , or range of discourse , but for simplicity , we will talk about only its global form . )
It is often argued that these theses require some form of the correspondence theory of truth .
( Putnam ( 1978 , p. 18 ) notes , “ Whatever else realists say , they typically say that they believe in a ‘ correspondence theory of truth ’ . ” )
At least , they are supported by the kind of correspondence theory without facts discussed in section 3.1 , such as Field ’s proposal .
Such a theory will provide an account of objective relations of reference and satisfaction , and show how these determine the truth or falsehood of what we say about the world .
Field ’s own approach ( 1972 ) to this problem seeks a physicalist explanation of reference .
But realism is a more general idea than physicalism .
Any theory that provides objective relations of reference and satisfaction , and builds up a theory of truth from them , would give a form of realism .
( Making the objectivity of reference the key to realism is characteristic of work of Putnam , e.g. , 1978 . )
Another important mark of realism expressed in terms of truth is the property of bivalence .
As Dummett has stressed ( e.g. , 1959 ; 1976 ; 1983 ; 1991 ) , a realist should see there being a fact of the matter one way or the other about whether any given claim is correct .
Hence , one important mark of realism is that it goes together with the principle of bivalence : every truth - bearer ( sentence or proposition ) is true or false .
In much of his work , Dummett has made this the characteristic mark of realism , and often identifies realism about some subject - matter with accepting bivalence for discourse about that subject - matter .
At the very least , it captures a great deal of what is more loosely put in the statement of realism above .
Both the approaches to realism , through reference and through bivalence , make truth the primary vehicle for an account of realism .
A theory of truth which substantiates bivalence , or builds truth from a determinate reference relation , does most of the work of giving a realistic metaphysics .
It might even simply be a realistic metaphysics .
We have thus turned on its head the relation of truth to metaphysics we saw in our discussion of the neo-classical correspondence theory in section 1.1 .
There , a correspondence theory of truth was built upon a substantial metaphysics .
Here , we have seen how articulating a theory that captures the idea of correspondence can be crucial to providing a realist metaphysics .
( For another perspective on realism and truth , see Alston ( 1996 ) .
Devitt ( 1984 ) offers an opposing view to the kind we have sketched here , which rejects any characterization of realism in terms of truth or other semantic concepts . )
In light of our discussion in section 1.1.1 , we should pause to note that the connection between realism and the correspondence theory of truth is not absolute .
When Moore and Russell held the identity theory of truth , they were most certainly realists .
The right kind of metaphysics of propositions can support a realist view , as can a metaphysics of facts .
The modern form of realism we have been discussing here seeks to avoid basing itself on such particular ontological commitments , and so prefers to rely on the kind of correspondence - without - facts approach discussed in section 3.1 .
This is not to say that realism will be devoid of ontological commitments , but the commitments will flow from whichever specific claims about some subject - matter are taken to be true .
For more on realism and truth , see Fumerton ( 2002 ) and the entry on realism .
It should come as no surprise that the relation between truth and metaphysics seen by modern realists can also be exploited by anti-realists .
Many modern anti-realists see the theory of truth as the key to formulating and defending their views .
With Dummett ( e.g. , 1959 ; 1976 ; 1991 ) , we might expect the characteristic mark of anti-realism to be the rejection of bivalence .
Indeed , many contemporary forms of anti-realism may be formulated as theories of truth , and they do typically deny bivalence .
Anti-realism comes in many forms , but let us take as an example a ( somewhat crude ) form of verificationism .
Such a theory holds that a claim is correct just insofar as it is in principle verifiable , i.e. , there is a verification procedure we could in principle carry out which would yield the answer that the claim in question was verified .
So understood , verificationism is a theory of truth .
The claim is not that verification is the most important epistemic notion , but that truth just is verifiability .
As with the kind of realism we considered in section 4.1 , this view expresses its metaphysical commitments in its explanation of the nature of truth .
Truth is not , to this view , a fully objective matter , independent of us or our thoughts .
Instead , truth is constrained by our abilities to verify , and is thus constrained by our epistemic situation .
Truth is to a significant degree an epistemic matter , which is typical of many anti-realist positions .
As Dummett says , the verificationist notion of truth does not appear to support bivalence .
Any statement that reaches beyond what we can in principle verify or refute ( verify its negation ) will be a counter - example to bivalence .
Take , for instance , the claim that there is some substance , say uranium , present in some region of the universe too distant to be inspected by us within the expected lifespan of the universe .
Insofar as this really would be in principle unverifiable , we have no reason to maintain it is true or false according to the verificationist theory of truth .
Verificationism of this sort is one of a family of anti-realist views .
Another example is the view that identifies truth with warranted assertibility .
Assertibility , as well as verifiability , has been important in Dummett ’s work .
( See also works of McDowell , e.g. , 1976 and Wright , e.g. , 1976 ; 1982 ; 1992 . )
Anti-realism of the Dummettian sort is not a descendant of the coherence theory of truth per se .
But in some ways , as Dummett himself has noted , it might be construed as a descendant – perhaps very distant – of idealism .
If idealism is the most drastic form of rejection of the independence of mind and world , Dummettian anti-realism is a more modest form , which sees epistemology imprinted in the world , rather than the wholesale embedding of world into mind .
At the same time , the idea of truth as warranted assertibility or verifiability reiterates a theme from the pragmatist views of truth we surveyed in section 1.3 .
Anti-realist theories of truth , like the realist ones we discussed in section 4.1 , can generally make use of the Tarskian apparatus .
Convention T , in particular , does not discriminate between realist and anti-realist notions of truth .
Likewise , the base clauses of a Tarskian recursive theory are given as disquotation principles , which are neutral between realist and anti-realist understandings of notions like reference .
As we saw with the correspondence theory , giving a full account of the nature of truth will generally require more than the Tarskian apparatus itself .
How an anti-realist is to explain the basic concepts that go into a Tarskian theory is a delicate matter .
As Dummett and Wright have investigated in great detail , it appears that the background logic in which the theory is developed will have to be non-classical .
For more on anti-realism and truth , see Shieh ( 2018 ) and the papers in Greenough and Lynch ( 2006 ) and the entry on realism .
Many commentators see a close connection between Dummett ’s anti-realism and the pragmatists ’ views of truth , in that both put great weight on ideas of verifiability or assertibility .
Dummett himself stressed parallels between anti-realism and intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics .
Another view on truth which returns to pragmatist themes is the ‘ internal realism ’ of Putnam ( 1981 ) .
There Putnam glosses truth as what would be justified under ideal epistemic conditions .
With the pragmatists , Putnam sees the ideal conditions as something which can be approximated , echoing the idea of truth as the end of inquiry .
Putnam is cautious about calling his view anti-realism , preferring the label ‘ internal realism ’ .
But he is clear that he sees his view as opposed to realism ( ‘ metaphysical realism ’ , as he calls it ) .
Davidson ’s views on truth have also been associated with pragmatism , notably by Rorty ( 1986 ) .
Davidson has distanced himself from this interpretation ( e.g. , 1990 ) , but he does highlight connections between truth and belief and meaning .
Insofar as these are human attitudes or relate to human actions , Davidson grants there is some affinity between his views and those of some pragmatists ( especially , he says , Dewey ) .
Another view that has grown out of the literature on realism and anti-realism , and has become increasingly important in the current literature , is that of pluralism about truth .
This view , developed in work of Lynch ( e.g. 2001 b ; 2009 ) and Wright ( e.g. 1992 ; 1999 ) , proposes that there are multiple ways for truth bearers to be true .
Wright , in particular , suggests that in certain domains of discourse what we say is true in virtue of a correspondence - like relation , while in others it is its true in virtue of a kind of assertibility relation that is closer in spirit to the anti-realist views we have just discussed .
Such a proposal might suggest there are multiple concepts of truth , or that the term ‘ true ’ is itself ambiguous .
However , whether or not a pluralist view is committed to such claims has been disputed .
In particular , Lynch ( 2001 b ; 2009 ) develops a version of pluralism which takes truth to be a functional role concept .
The functional role of truth is characterized by a range of principles that articulate such features of truth as its objectivity , its role in inquiry , and related ideas we have encountered in considering various theories of truth .
( A related point about platitudes governing the concept of truth is made by Wright ( 1992 ) . )
But according to Lynch , these display the functional role of truth .
Furthermore , Lynch claims that on analogy with analytic functionalism , these principles can be seen as deriving from our pre-theoretic or ‘ folk ’ ideas about truth .
Like all functional role concepts , truth must be realized , and according to Lynch it may be realized in different ways in different settings .
Such multiple realizability has been one of the hallmarks of functional role concepts discussed in the philosophy of mind .
For instance , Lynch suggests that for ordinary claims about material objects , truth might be realized by a correspondence property ( which he links to representational views ) , while for moral claims truth might be manifest by an assertibility property along more anti-realist lines .
For more on pluralism about truth , see Pedersen and Lynch ( 2018 ) and the entry on pluralist theories of truth .
We began in section 1 with the neo-classical theories , which explained the nature of truth within wider metaphysical systems .
We then considered some alternatives in sections 2 and 3 , some of which had more modest ontological implications .
But we still saw in section 4 that substantial theories of truth tend to imply metaphysical theses , or even embody metaphysical positions .
One long - standing trend in the discussion of truth is to insist that truth really does not carry metaphysical significance at all .
It does not , as it has no significance on its own .
A number of different ideas have been advanced along these lines , under the general heading of deflationism .
Deflationist ideas appear quite early on , including a well - known argument against correspondence in Frege ( 1918 –19 ) .
However , many deflationists take their cue from an idea of Ramsey ( 1927 ) , often called the equivalence thesis :
\( \ulcorner \ulcorner \phi \urcorner\ ) is true \( \urcorner\ ) has the same meaning as \ ( \phi\ ) .
( Ramsey himself takes truth - bearers to be propositions rather than sentences .
Glanzberg ( 2003 b ) questions whether Ramsey ’s account of propositions really makes him a deflationist . )
This can be taken as the core of a theory of truth , often called the redundancy theory .
The redundancy theory holds that there is no property of truth at all , and appearances of the expression ‘ true ’ in our sentences are redundant , having no effect on what we express .
The equivalence thesis can also be understood in terms of speech acts rather than meaning :
To assert that \( \ulcorner \ phi \urcorner\ ) is true is just to assert that \( \phi\ ) .
This view was advanced by Strawson ( 1949 ; 1950 ) , though Strawson also argues that there are other important aspects of speech acts involving ‘ true ’ beyond what is asserted .
For instance , they may be acts of confirming or granting what someone else said .
( Strawson would also object to my making sentences the bearers of truth . )
In either its speech act or meaning form , the redundancy theory argues there is no property of truth .
It is commonly noted that the equivalence thesis itself is not enough to sustain the redundancy theory .
It merely holds that when truth occurs in the outermost position in a sentence , and the full sentence to which truth is predicated is quoted , then truth is eliminable .
What happens in other environments is left to be seen .
Modern developments of the redundancy theory include Grover et al. ( 1975 ) .
The equivalence principle looks familiar : it has something like the form of the Tarski biconditionals discussed in section 2.2 .
However , it is a stronger principle , which identifies the two sides of the biconditional – either their meanings or the speech acts performed with them .
The Tarski biconditionals themselves are simply material biconditionals .
A number of deflationary theories look to the Tarski biconditionals rather than the full equivalence principle .
Their key idea is that even if we do not insist on redundancy , we may still hold the following theses :
For a given language \( \mathbf {L}\ ) and every \ ( \phi\ ) in \ ( \mathbf {L}\ ) , the biconditionals \( \ulcorner \ulcorner \ phi \urcorner\ ) is true if and only if \( \phi \urcorner\ ) hold by definition ( or analytically , or trivially , or by stipulation … ) .
This is all there is to say about the concept of truth .
We will refer to views which adopt these as minimalist .
Officially , this is the name of the view of Horwich ( 1990 ) , but we will apply it somewhat more widely .
( Horwich ’s view differs in some specific respects from what is presented here , such as predicating truth of propositions , but we believe it is close enough to what is sketched here to justify the name . )
The second thesis , that the Tarski biconditionals are all there is to say about truth , captures something similar to the redundancy theory ’s view .
It comes near to saying that truth is not a property at all ; to the extent that truth is a property , there is no more to it than the disquotational pattern of the Tarski biconditionals .
As Horwich puts it , there is no substantial underlying metaphysics to truth .
And as Soames ( 1984 ) stresses , certainly nothing that could ground as far - reaching a view as realism or anti-realism .
If there is no property of truth , or no substantial property of truth , what role does our term ‘ true ’ play ?
Deflationists typically note that the truth predicate provides us with a convenient device of disquotation .
Such a device allows us to make some useful claims which we could not formulate otherwise , such as the blind ascription ‘ The next thing that Bill says will be true ’ .
( For more on blind ascriptions and their relation to deflationism , see Azzouni , 2001 . )
A predicate obeying the Tarski biconditionals can also be used to express what would otherwise be ( potentially ) infinite conjunctions or disjunctions , such as the notorious statement of Papal infallibility put ‘ Everything the Pope says is true ’ .
( Suggestions like this are found in Leeds , 1978 and Quine , 1970 . )
Recognizing these uses for a truth predicate , we might simply think of it as introduced into a language by stipulation .
The Tarski biconditionals themselves might be stipulated , as the minimalists envisage .
One could also construe the clauses of a recursive Tarskian theory as stipulated .
( There are some significant logical differences between these two options .
See Halbach ( 1999 ) and Ketland ( 1999 ) for discussion . )
Other deflationists , such as Beall ( 2005 ) or Field ( 1994 ) , might prefer to focus here on rules of inference or rules of use , rather than the Tarski biconditionals themselves .
There are also important connections between deflationist ideas about truth and certain ideas about meaning .
These are fundamental to the deflationism of Field ( 1986 ; 1994 ) , which will be discussed in section 6.3 .
For an insightful critique of deflationism , see Gupta ( 1993 ) .
For more on deflationism , see Azzouni ( 2018 ) and the entry on the deflationary theory of truth .
One of the important themes in the literature on truth is its connection to meaning , or more generally , to language .
This has proved an important application of ideas about truth , and an important issue in the study of truth itself .
This section will consider a number of issues relating truth and language .
There have been many debates in the literature over what the primary bearers of truth are .
Candidates typically include beliefs , propositions , sentences , and utterances .
We have already seen in section 1 that the classical debates on truth took this issue very seriously , and what sort of theory of truth was viable was often seen to depend on what the bearers of truth are .
In spite of the number of options under discussion , and the significance that has sometimes been placed on the choice , there is an important similarity between candidate truth - bearers .
Consider the role of truth - bearers in the correspondence theory , for instance .
We have seen versions of it which take beliefs , propositions , or interpreted sentences to be the primary bearers of truth .
But all of them rely upon the idea that their truth - bearers are meaningful , and are thereby able to say something about what the world is like .
( We might say that they are able to represent the world , but that is to use ‘ represent ’ in a wider sense than we saw in section 3.2 .
No assumptions about just what stands in relations to what objects are required to see truth - bearers as meaningful . )
It is in virtue of being meaningful that truth - bearers are able to enter into correspondence relations .
Truth - bearers are things which meaningfully make claims about what the world is like , and are true or false depending on whether the facts in the world are as described .
Exactly the same point can be made for the anti-realist theories of truth we saw in section 4.2 , though with different accounts of how truth - bearers are meaningful , and what the world contributes .
Though it is somewhat more delicate , something similar can be said for coherence theories , which usually take beliefs , or whole systems of beliefs , as the primary truth - bearers .
Though a coherence theory will hardly talk of beliefs representing the facts , it is crucial to the coherence theory that beliefs are contentful beliefs of agents , and that they can enter into coherence relations .
Noting the complications in interpreting the genuine classical coherence theories , it appears fair to note that this requires truth - bearers to be meaningful , however the background metaphysics ( presumably idealism ) understands meaning .
Though Tarski works with sentences , the same can be said of his theory .
The sentences to which Tarski’s theory applies are fully interpreted , and so also are meaningful .
They characterize the world as being some way or another , and this in turn determines whether they are true or false .
Indeed , Tarski needs there to be a fact of the matter about whether each sentence is true or false ( abstracting away from context dependence ) , to ensure that the Tarski biconditionals do their job of fixing the extension of ‘ is true ’ .
( But note that just what this fact of the matter consists in is left open by the Tarskian apparatus . )
We thus find the usual candidate truth - bearers linked in a tight circle : interpreted sentences , the propositions they express , the belief speakers might hold towards them , and the acts of assertion they might perform with them are all connected by providing something meaningful .
This makes them reasonable bearers of truth .
For this reason , it seems , contemporary debates on truth have been much less concerned with the issue of truth - bearers than were the classical ones .
Some issues remain , of course .
Different metaphysical assumptions may place primary weight on some particular node in the circle , and some metaphysical views still challenge the existence of some of the nodes .
Perhaps more importantly , different views on the nature of meaning itself might cast doubt on the coherence of some of the nodes .
Notoriously for instance , Quineans ( e.g. , Quine , 1960 ) deny the existence of intensional entities , including propositions .
Even so , it increasingly appears doubtful that attention to truth per se will bias us towards one particular primary bearer of truth .
For more on these issues , see King ( 2018 ) .
There is a related , but somewhat different point , which is important to understanding the theories we have canvassed .
The neo-classical theories of truth start with truth - bearers which are already understood to be meaningful , and explain how they get their truth values .
But along the way , they often do something more .
Take the neo-classical correspondence theory , for instance .
This theory , in effect , starts with a view of how propositions are meaningful .
They are so in virtue of having constituents in the world , which are brought together in the right way .
There are many complications about the nature of meaning , but at a minimum , this tells us what the truth conditions associated with a proposition are .
The theory then explains how such truth conditions can lead to the truth value true , by the right fact existing .
Many theories of truth are like the neo-classical correspondence theory in being as much theories of how truth - bearers are meaningful as of how their truth values are fixed .
Again , abstracting from some complications about meaning , this makes them theories both of truth conditions and truth values .
The Tarskian theory of truth can be construed this way too .
This can be seen both in the way the Tarski biconditionals are understood , and how a recursive theory of truth is understood .
As we explained Convention T in section 2.2 , the primary role of a Tarski biconditional of the form \( \ulcorner \ulcorner \ phi \urcorner\ ) is true if and only if \( \phi \urcorner\ ) is to fix whether \ ( \phi\ ) is in the extension of ‘ is true ’ or not .
But it can also be seen as stating the truth conditions of \ ( \phi\ ) .
Both rely on the fact that the unquoted occurrence of \ ( \phi\ ) is an occurrence of an interpreted sentence , which has a truth value , but also provides its truth conditions upon occasions of use .
Likewise , the base clauses of the recursive definition of truth , those for reference and satisfaction , are taken to state the relevant semantic properties of constituents of an interpreted sentence .
In discussing Tarski ’s theory of truth in section 2 , we focused on how these determine the truth value of a sentence .
But they also show us the truth conditions of a sentence are determined by these semantic properties .
For instance , for a simple sentence like ‘ Snow is white ’ , the theory tells us that the sentence is true if the referent of ‘ Snow ’ satisfies ‘ white ’ .
This can be understood as telling us that the truth conditions of ‘ Snow is white ’ are those conditions in which the referent of ‘ Snow ’ satisfies the predicate ‘ is white ’ .
As we saw in sections 3 and 4 , the Tarskian apparatus is often seen as needing some kind of supplementation to provide a full theory of truth .
A full theory of truth conditions will likewise rest on how the Tarskian apparatus is put to use .
In particular , just what kinds of conditions those in which the referent of ‘ snow ’ satisfies the predicate ‘ is white ’ are will depend on whether we opt for realist or anti-realist theories .
The realist option will simply look for the conditions under which the stuff snow bears the property of whiteness ; the anti-realist option will look to the conditions under which it can be verified , or asserted with warrant , that snow is white .
There is a broad family of theories of truth which are theories of truth conditions as well as truth values .
This family includes the correspondence theory in all its forms – classical and modern .
Yet this family is much wider than the correspondence theory , and wider than realist theories of truth more generally .
Indeed , virtually all the theories of truth that make contributions to the realism / anti-realism debate are theories of truth conditions .
In a slogan , for many approaches to truth , a theory of truth is a theory of truth conditions .
Any theory that provides a substantial account of truth conditions can offer a simple account of truth values : a truth - bearer provides truth conditions , and it is true if and only if the actual way things are is among them .
Because of this , any such theory will imply a strong , but very particular , biconditional , close in form to the Tarski biconditionals .
It can be made most vivid if we think of propositions as sets of truth conditions .
Let \( p\ ) be a proposition , i.e. , a set of truth conditions , and let \( a\ ) be the ‘ actual world ’ , the condition that actually obtains .
Then we can almost trivially see :
\ ( p\ ) is true if and only if \ ( a \in p\ ) .
This is presumably necessary .
But it is important to observe that it is in one respect crucially different from the genuine Tarski biconditionals .
It makes no use of a non-quoted sentence , or in fact any sentence at all .
It does not have the disquotational character of the Tarski biconditionals .
Though this may look like a principle that deflationists should applaud , it is not .
Rather , it shows that deflationists cannot really hold a truth - conditional view of content at all .
If they do , then they inter alia have a non-deflationary theory of truth , simply by linking truth value to truth conditions through the above biconditional .
It is typical of thoroughgoing deflationist theories to present a non-truth - conditional theory of the contents of sentences : a non-truth - conditional account of what makes truth - bearers meaningful .
We take it this is what is offered , for instance , by the use theory of propositions in Horwich ( 1990 ) .
It is certainly one of the leading ideas of Field ( 1986 ; 1994 ) , which explore how a conceptual role account of content would ground a deflationist view of truth .
Once one has a non-truth - conditional account of content , it is then possible to add a deflationist truth predicate , and use this to give purely deflationist statements of truth conditions .
But the starting point must be a non-truth - conditional view of what makes truth - bearers meaningful .
Both deflationists and anti-realists start with something other than correspondence truth conditions .
But whereas an anti-realist will propose a different theory of truth conditions , a deflationists will start with an account of content which is not a theory of truth conditions at all .
The deflationist will then propose that the truth predicate , given by the Tarski biconditionals , is an additional device , not for understanding content , but for disquotation .
It is a useful device , as we discussed in section 5.3 , but it has nothing to do with content .
To a deflationist , the meaningfulness of truth - bearers has nothing to do with truth .
It has been an influential idea , since the seminal work of Davidson ( e.g. , 1967 ) , to see a Tarskian theory of truth as a theory of meaning .
At least , as we have seen , a Tarskian theory can be seen as showing how the truth conditions of a sentence are determined by the semantic properties of its parts .
More generally , as we see in much of the work of Davidson and of Dummett ( e.g. , 1959 ; 1976 ; 1983 ; 1991 ) , giving a theory of truth conditions can be understood as a crucial part of giving a theory of meaning .
Thus , any theory of truth that falls into the broad category of those which are theories of truth conditions can be seen as part of a theory of meaning .
( For more discussion of these issues , see Higginbotham ( 1986 ; 1989 ) and the exchange between Higginbotham ( 1992 ) and Soames ( 1992 ) . )
A number of commentators on Tarski ( e.g. , Etchemendy , 1988 ; Soames , 1984 ) have observed that the Tarskian apparatus needs to be understood in a particular way to make it suitable for giving a theory of meaning .
Tarski’s work is often taken to show how to define a truth predicate .
If it is so used , then whether or not a sentence is true becomes , in essence , a truth of mathematics .
Presumably what truth conditions sentences of a natural language have is a contingent matter , so a truth predicate defined in this way cannot be used to give a theory of meaning for them .
But the Tarskian apparatus need not be used just to explicitly define truth .
The recursive characterization of truth can be used to state the semantic properties of sentences and their constituents , as a theory of meaning should .
In such an application , truth is not taken to be explicitly defined , but rather the truth conditions of sentences are taken to be described .
( See Heck , 1997 for more discussion . )
Inspired by Quine ( e.g. , 1960 ) , Davidson himself is well known for taking a different approach to using a theory of truth as a theory of meaning than is implicit in Field ( 1972 ) .
Whereas a Field - inspired representational approach is based on a causal account of reference , Davidson ( e.g. , 1973 ) proposes a process of radical interpretation in which an interpreter builds a Tarskian theory to interpret a speaker as holding beliefs which are consistent , coherent , and largely true .
This led Davidson ( e.g. 1986 ) to argue that most of our beliefs are true – a conclusion that squares well with the coherence theory of truth .
This is a weaker claim than the neo-classical coherence theory would make .
It does not insist that all the members of any coherent set of beliefs are true , or that truth simply consists in being a member of such a coherent set .
But all the same , the conclusion that most of our beliefs are true , because their contents are to be understood through a process of radical interpretation which will make them a coherent and rational system , has a clear affinity with the neo-classical coherence theory .
In Davidson ( 1986 ) , he thought his view of truth had enough affinity with the neo-classical coherence theory to warrant being called a coherence theory of truth , while at the same time he saw the role of Tarskian apparatus as warranting the claim that his view was also compatible with a kind of correspondence theory of truth .
In later work , however , Davidson reconsidered this position .
In fact , already in Davidson ( 1977 ) he had expressed doubt about any understanding of the role of Tarski ’s theory in radical interpretation that involves the kind of representational apparatus relied on by Field ( 1972 ) , as we discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2 .
In the “ Afterthoughts ” to Davidson ( 1986 ) , he also concluded that his view departs too far from the neo-classical coherence theory to be named one .
What is important is rather the role of radical interpretation in the theory of content , and its leading to the idea that belief is veridical .
These are indeed points connected to coherence , but not to the coherence theory of truth per se .
They also comprise a strong form of anti-representationalism .
Thus , though he does not advance a coherence theory of truth , he does advance a theory that stands in opposition to the representational variants of the correspondence theory we discussed in section 3.2 .
For more on Davidson , see Glanzberg ( 2013 ) and the entry on Donald Davidson .
The relation between truth and meaning is not the only place where truth and language relate closely .
Another is the idea , also much - stressed in the writings of Dummett ( e.g. , 1959 ) , of the relation between truth and assertion .
Again , it fits into a platitude :
Truth is the aim of assertion .
A person making an assertion , the platitude holds , aims to say something true .
It is easy to cast this platitude in a way that appears false .
Surely , many speakers do not aim to say something true .
Any speaker who lies does not .
Any speaker whose aim is to flatter , or to deceive , aims at something other than truth .
The motivation for the truth - assertion platitude is rather different .
It looks at assertion as a practice , in which certain rules are constitutive .
As is often noted , the natural parallel here is with games , like chess or baseball , which are defined by certain rules .
The platitude holds that it is constitutive of the practice of making assertions that assertions aim at truth .
An assertion by its nature presents what it is saying as true , and any assertion which fails to be true is ipso facto liable to criticism , whether or not the person making the assertion themself wished to have said something true or to have lied .
Dummett ’s original discussion of this idea was partially a criticism of deflationism ( in particular , of views of Strawson , 1950 ) .
The idea that we fully explain the concept of truth by way of the Tarski biconditionals is challenged by the claim that the truth - assertion platitude is fundamental to truth .
As Dummett there put it , what is left out by the Tarski biconditionals , and captured by the truth - assertion platitude , is the point of the concept of truth , or what the concept is used for .
( For further discussion , see Glanzberg , 2003a and Wright , 1992 . )
Whether or not assertion has such constitutive rules is , of course , controversial .
But among those who accept that it does , the place of truth in the constitutive rules is itself controversial .
The leading alternative , defended by Williamson ( 1996 ) , is that knowledge , not truth , is fundamental to the constitutive rules of assertion .
Williamson defends an account of assertion based on the rule that one must assert only what one knows .
For more on truth and assertion , see the papers in Brown and Cappelen ( 2011 ) and the entry on assertion .
According to a new review of neuroscientific research , coercive interrogation techniques used during the Bush administration to extract information from terrorist suspects are likely to have been unsuccessful and may have had many unintended negative effects on the suspect 's memory and brain functions .
A new article , published by Cell Press on September 21st in the journal , Trends in Cognitive Science , reviews scientific evidence demonstrating that repeated and extreme stress and anxiety have a detrimental influence on brain functions related to memory .
Memos released by the US Department of Justice in April of 2009 detailing coercive interrogation techniques suggest that prolonged periods of shock , stress , anxiety , disorientation and lack of control are more effective than standard interrogatory techniques in making subjects reveal truthful information from memory .
" This is based on the assumption that subjects will be motivated to reveal veridical information to end interrogation , and that extreme stress , shock and anxiety do not impact memory " says review author , Professor Shane O'Mara from the Institute of Neuroscience at Trinity College in Dublin , Ireland .
" However , this model of the impact of extreme stress on memory and the brain is utterly unsupported by scientific evidence . "
Psychological studies suggest that during extreme stress and anxiety , the captive will be conditioned to associate speaking with periods of safety .
For the captor , when the captive speaks , the objective of gaining information will have been obtained and there will be relief from the unsavory task of administering these conditions of stress .
Therefore , it is difficult or impossible to determine during the interrogation whether the captive is revealing truthful information or just talking to escape the torture .
Research has also shown that extreme stress has a deleterious effect on the frontal lobe and is associated with the production of false memories .
Neurochemical studies have revealed that the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex , brain regions integral to the process of memory , are rich in receptors for hormones that are activated by stress and sleep deprivation and which have been shown to have deleterious effects on memory .
" To briefly summarize a vast , complex literature , prolonged and extreme stress inhibits the biological processes believed to support memory in the brain , " says O'Mara .
" For example , studies of extreme stress with Special Forces Soldiers have found that recall of previously - learned information was impaired after stress occurred . "
Waterboarding in particular is an extreme stressor and has the potential to elicit widespread stress - induced changes in the brain .
" Given our current cognitive neurobiological knowledge , it is unlikely that coercive interrogations involving extreme stress will facilitate release of truthful information from long term memory , " concludes Professor O'Mara .
" On the contrary , these techniques cause severe , repeated and prolonged stress , which compromises brain tissue supporting both memory and decision making . "

Israel plans to demolish Bustan area in O. Jerusalem Palestinian Information Center July 23 , 2009
OCCUPIED JERUSALEM -
The Ir Amim organization said Thursday in a report quoted by the Hebrew media that the Israeli occupation authority ( IOA ) is preparing a plan to demolish the whole Bustan neighborhood in occupied Jerusalem and build in its place a Jewish historical park .
The report added that the Israeli municipality in Jerusalem intends to allow only Israeli settlers to build in the vicinity of the neighborhood .
The report said that the IOA gave 14 Palestinian real estates to Jewish parties without obtaining any approval from the legal advisor of the Israeli government .

Taser has built an arsenal of weapons that are meant to save lives , by giving police officers the ability to subdue resistant suspects without shooting or bludgeoning them .
But since their inception , the less - lethal weapons have drawn criticism .
Reports of minivan moms and mouthy grandmothers getting jolts from the devices still make headlines .
And occasionally , people die within hours of being incapacitated .
Such was the case with Robert Dziekanski , a Polish immigrant who died after getting several jolts from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Vancouver International Airport .
Despite those incidents , the company continuously develops new models , and each is a bit more powerful than its predecessor .
Taser claims its products have been used on humans nearly 1.4 million times , and that they do not cause damage to the heart , or change its rhythm .
This summer , the company launched the X3 , its latest and greatest people - zapper .
The new device can be fired three times without reloading , delivering brutal five - second pulses of electricity to incapacitate whoever has been struck by its flying darts .
Taser also released an electronic shotgun cartridge that can shock people for up to 20 seconds .
To find out how the less - lethal weapons are made , we sent photographer Pat Shannahan of Wired.com on a tour of Taser International headquarters in Scottsdale , Arizona .

This foyer may look like the entrance to the Control headquarters from an episode of Get Smart , but this is the front door of the Taser plant .
The corporation has plenty of reasons for high security .
It recently launched an online warehouse for digital evidence , so keeping trespassers out is a top priority .

If biometric security and giant steel doors are not enough to hold back an angry mob , the Taser Shockwave could come in handy .
It is the less - lethal equivalent of a claymore mine , hurling 32 electrified darts every which way at the push of a button .
Military personnel could use it at checkpoints or other places where other people congregate .
The initial concept for neuromuscular incapacitation device came from Jack Cover , a World War II veteran and doctor of physics .
In the 1960s , he developed an interest in less - lethal weapons as a means of controlling riots .
Cover had an idea that high voltage electrical pulses could be used to subdue people after hearing the story of a hiker who became stuck to an electrified fence .
In theory , zapping someone with a combination of very high voltage and low current should incapacitate them without causing any long term damage .
After years of incidents with the purportedly less - lethal weapons , it is still unclear what role they play in the deaths of people in custody .
Taser has promoted a host of studies showing that pigs zapped by the gadgets do not show any signs of cardiac distress .
The company 's media relations team is quick to point out that many , although not all , of the people who die after being tasered by cops were also high on cocaine .

Each weapon is assembled by hand .
At this station , Jose Favela is soldering a pair of LED lights and a laser sight into the device .
Taser products are rife with accessories .
The X - 26 can accept a digital – video camera that records whenever the safety is switched off .
That footage is meant to exonerate officers who are accused of using the less - lethal weapons improperly .
The ammo for each weapon is a single - shot cartridge .
When an officer pulls the trigger , a puff of compressed nitrogen hurls a pair of darts at the target .
Each of those projectiles is connected to a wire that carries the electricity .
If only one probe hits the target , they will get a much milder jolt .

Steve Tuttle , head of media relations for Taser , points an X - 26 incapacitation device at the camera .
Each unit has two bright LEDs and a laser sight .
Officers are trained to avoid shooting certain body parts , like the face .
Both the lights and laser should help them avoid those targeting mishaps .
This diagram of a cartridge from the new Taser X3 shows the paths that each barbed probe follows when they fly out from their plastic cubbies .
The X3 model has two separate laser sights , to show exactly where each of the probes will strike their targets .
Older Taser units have a single laser pointer that shows where the top probe will strike .

The last stop for each Taser is a quality control check .
Since a malfunction could have deadly consequences , each weapon gets checked individually .
If the device delivers too much current , or otherwise malfunctions , it will be rejected .
Before the Tasers can be used by cops , they are subjected to an extensive battery of quality control tests .
Each unit is designed to put out 19 pulses per second for up to five seconds .

Tuttle ended the tour with a live demonstration .
Look closely and you can see the electrified wires leading back from each dart to the weapon .

The latest Taser device has three times the firepower of its predecessors .
Wired.com 's military correspondent , Noah Shachtman , volunteered to take a hit from the new weapon .
He says that it hurts , really bad , and even though he got a one - second shock the residual tingling sensation lasted for hours .

Warren Buffett , the renowned investor and the world ’s second richest man , told Senate Democrats that wealthy Americans need to pay higher taxes , giving Democrats something to mull as they address healthcare reform and soaring federal deficits .
Senate Democrats met with Buffett for more than an hour over lunch Thursday , peppering him with questions about the economy , said lawmakers in attendance .

“ He said rich people are not paying enough taxes , ” said Sen . ( D - Mo. ) .
“ It was interesting to see someone who is such an aggressive capitalist , who believes so much in our capitalist system , saying we ’ve got the scales way too heavily toward people who are very , very wealthy .
” Buffett told lawmakers that because of the cuts to the capital gains tax passed under former President George W. Bush , he pays taxes at a lower rate than some of his company ’s employees .
It is an argument the investor has made before .
Buffett said he paid a 16.5 percent tax rate on all his income because the tax rate on investment dividends and long - term capital gains is only 15 percent .
By contrast , a single employee at Buffet ’s firm , Berkshire Hathaway , who earns between $ 33,000 and $ 83,000 must pay a 25 percent federal income tax rate .
Sen . Ben Nelson , a centrist Democrat from Nebraska , said he was n’t sure whether Buffett ’s chat would embolden his colleagues to raise taxes .
“ I do n’t know that people will move toward tax increases , ” he said in reference to healthcare reform funding .
“ Tax is still for a four - letter word , and I think there are other ways to pay for this than raising taxes .
” In 2003 , Congress cut the capital gains tax from 20 percent and created a separate 15 percent tax rate for dividends .
Before then , dividends were taxed at the ordinary income rate , which is 35 percent for top earners .
Both tax cuts are due to expire at the end of next year .
Senators were eager to hear from the famous “ Oracle of Omaha ” as they struggle to solve the nation ’s economic woes , which have helped drive Congress ’s approval ratings to new lows .
Buffett told lawmakers that the long - term economic outlook of the nation was strong but declined to predict when the recession would end .
“ People wanted to know what was going to happen in the next six months and he said , ‘ I ca n’t tell you , ’ ” recalled one participant .
Buffett told lawmakers that improving education and ensuring broad opportunity would help the nation grow economically over the next decade , but what most perked up some ears was what he had to say about taxing the rich .
Sen. Byron Dorgan ( N.D. ) , chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee , who invited Buffett to the lunch , said colleagues wanted to hear the wisdom of an economic genius who draws 30,000 people to Berkshire ’s annual meeting in Omaha , Neb .
Buffett has met with Senate Democrats several times over the past few years .
“ There were a lot of questions about the economy and his assessment of financial regulation , ” said Dorgan .
Buffett shared with lawmakers his “ common - sense approach to capitalism , ” said one attendee .
He told lawmakers that they should overhaul the nation ’s financial system in a way that allows investors to do well but also imposes a sense of responsibility on Wall Street .
Buffett supported Presidentduring the 2008 presidential election but has since criticized some of the president ’s policy proposals .
Earlier this year he called a cap - and - trade proposal to limit greenhouse gas emissions a “ regressive ” tax .
” Buffett has also urged Democrats to scale back their policy agenda to focus on fixing the economy .
The billionaire investor called the Employee Free Choice Act a “ mistake . ”
The legislation , which would overhaul labor laws , is a priority of unions and many liberal Democrats .
But Buffett and Senate Democrats put aside their policy differences on Thursday to focus on the nation ’s sluggish economy .
He gave a pep talk to some lawmakers who are wondering if the nation ’s best economic days are past .
“ He ’s a real optimist and thinks this is a great country and our best days are ahead of us , ” said Senate Majority Leader ( D - Nev . ) .
One lawmaker who attended the meeting said that Buffett gave the audience a lesson on the economic history of the world , touting the U.S. system as one that unlocks individual potential , striking a contrast with totalitarian countries that limit economic freedom .
Lawmakers said it was refreshing to hear a positive assessment of the nation ’s economic system after listening to months of criticism from the left about capitalist excess and the inability of markets to self - regulate .
Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) , chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , said the cap - and - trade proposal did not come up .
Many senators saw their own portfolios shrink as stock markets plunged over the last year , and no doubt would have liked to hear some personal stock advice from the market guru .
But Buffett said lawmakers did n’t invite him to ask for stock tips .
“ They did n’t ask for any , they must have known how my recent ones worked out , ” said Buffett , who has lost about $ 25 billion in wealth because of the recession , according to Forbes.com .
He declined to otherwise comment on his discussions .
An estimated 400,000 people were at Woodstock in 1969
Woodstock promoter Michael Lang has abandoned plans for a free 40th anniversary gig after failing to find funding , Rolling Stone has reported .
The US magazine said Mr Lang , one of four founders of the legendary festival , had failed to find sponsors to cover costs of up to $ 10 m ( £ 5.9 m ) .
He hoped to stage the gig in New York 's Climate Week in September , it said .
Jimi Hendrix closed the original event in Bethel , New York State , which took place from 15 to 18 August 1969 .
' Big boost '
Rolling Stone said Mr Lang had initially planned a concert in Brooklyn's Prospect Park during August .
Money .
No sponsors
Michael Lang gives his reasons for the cancellation
When that fell through , he had hoped to stage a festival to coincide with Climate Week NYC , which will run from 20 to 25 September as part of the international Seal the Deal campaign .
The campaign aims to push governments towards agreeing a climate change pact at a December summit in Copenhagen , Denmark .
" It would have been a big boost for the issue , " he told Rolling Stone .
Asked why his plans had been cancelled , he simply replied : " Money . No sponsors . "
Speaking about the anniversary show in March , Mr Lang said he hoped the bill would include some of the acts from the original line - up , including Joe Cocker and Santana .

On 21 March , The Independent published a letter in which I argued that there was no empirical evidence of the elections in Iran having been rigged , despite prolific assurances to the contrary .
Driven by forces beholden to the corporate interest , nothing would please the West more than to have the Iranian masses emulate " the mindless McDonald 's - munching slaves of Mammon " of my last sentence .
Ignoring certain wholly predictable responses of a personal nature , two principal lines of reasoning have emerged that are intended to rebut my hypothesis .
First , that recent events in Iran , notably large street demonstrations , are proof of election rigging , and second , that all the Iranian people really want is to enjoy " freedom " and " democracy " – just like us !
A proposition that smacks as much of arrogance as of Fukuyaman hubris .
To suggest that two undeniably devout men , Ayatollah Khamenei and Mr Ahmadi -Nejad , should have engaged in such an un-Islamic conspiracy as cheating their own people ( unnecessary , since the consensus of the opinion polls put Mr Ahmadi Nejad comfortably ahead ) constitutes possibly the most serious allegation that one could level against them .

In supposedly civilised societies , the more serious the accusation the greater the burden of proof required to shore it up .
Evidence is required ; hand - in - the - till - captured - live - on - video type evidence .
Nothing that I have seen or read comes close to this standard ; something all the more surprising given the Iranian people 's inventiveness and tenacity .
If the death of a poor protester is able to be posted on YouTube within minutes of its occurrence , then one might have expected to see some footage perhaps of Revolutionary Guards intimidating voters or of a whistleblower with a blacked - out face claiming he was paid by the authorities to empty ballot boxes and refill them with voting slips he was handed .
Nor is the proposition that a hermetically sealed society has managed to contain evidence of wrongdoing convincing .
Truth has an uncomfortable habit of getting out .
Proper evidence , real smoking guns , have been regularly uncovered where genuinely repressive regimes such as Zimbabwe , North Korea , Stalinist Russia and so on are concerned .
In fact , those who rely on such arguments have clearly never set foot in Iran , where they would be struck by her openness , warmth , lack of surveillance cameras , fingerprinting at airports and other paraphernalia that accompany a KGB - like state apparatus .
The Englishman need travel no further south than Land 's End to experience a genuine police state .
As pointed out by Dr Dickie in his response to my letter ( 28 March ) , where then has the quality of scepticism , a crucial component of the liberal , reasonable mindset , and once so defining of the national character , gone ?
Now replaced in citizens of the so - called free world , including Britain , by a blind acceptance of what they hear from two most discredited sources : politicians and journalists .
How often does one hear , for example , that Mr Ahmadi - Nejad has called for the eradication of Israel ?
A simple click of the mouse is all that separates those who swallow what they are fed from what the man actually said , which was that the state of Israel , qua state , should vanish , not that millions of Jews should be exterminated , as implied in the media .
Such bovine acquiescence before the official line negates the very justification for democracies – which rely upon a citizenry that is rational and capable of making up its own mind – and has dangerous consequences .
Take , for example , the media and politically induced conviction that Iraq abounded in weapons of mass destruction capable of annihilating London at 45 minutes ' notice .
And how to explain this sudden interest in Iran 's democratic aspirations ?
Did Western governments care for the wishes of her people when it helped Saddam kill hundreds of thousands of them because they had risen up in popular revolt against a genuine dictator ?
Whether Iranians support Mr Ahmadi -Nejad or Mr Mousavi , one thing is for certain , virtually to a man they are in favour of their country developing nuclear energy .
Will Western governments support such a democratically expressed desire ?
How about the overwhelming numbers for Hamas ?
Or the Algerians when they voted for the Islamic Salvation Front to save them from oppression by corrupt army cadres ?
What about the wishes of the Uzbek , Egyptian and Saudi peoples ?
Are they respected ?
Put the question of Israel 's legitimacy as a state to the world 's Muslims – how do you think they will vote ?
Always and everywhere , at least in the Muslim world , democracy sides with the dictators .
Perhaps too those , in Iran and elsewhere , who look with cynicism at your democratic utopias are not quite as wet behind the ears as your own citizens .
This was the meaning of my reference to " McDonald 's - munching slaves " – not , as one commentator put it , an expression of snobbery directed at the working class who cannot afford a meal at the Bullingdon , but a highlighting of who it is that actually runs the show in your democracies and enslaves your population through a culture of consumerism .
For McDonald 's is the ultimate symbol of the bourgeois , corporate interests that hold the real reins of power in your countries .
Was it an oppressed working class , as one commentator suggested , which took to the streets in the Nayavaran and Shemiran districts of North Tehran – districts as representative of the nation as are Mayfair and Knightsbridge of Britain ?
On the contrary , Iran 's workers are largely in favour of Mr Ahmadi Nejad .
It was in fact commercial , bourgeois interests which choreographed the Tehran demonstrations , a class compromised by their collaboration with Pahlavi despotism and consequently repudiated by the Iranian masses who groaned under the regime from which that class prospered .
The truth is that many in Iran and in the Muslim world in general have grasped Western democracy 's dirty little secret : that your leaders have no real power .
And if your representatives are as ineffectual as their electorate before the Dictatorship of Money , then what meaning have your votes and your democracy ?
As for the patronising assumption that Muslims in general and Iranians in particular , look with envy from far across the Bosphorus at Western society : wake up !
While I do not claim to speak for every Muslim or even every Iranian , I am confident that my views coincide with those of the majority .
For we look with horror at your anarchy and what you have become .
Visit Iran and you will see a people polite , hospitable , cultured , noble and brave .
Look at Britain 's urban hell and you will see young girls and boys armed with knives , swearing , half naked , vomiting the previous night 's attempt to stifle their pain and their emptiness .
Turn on the radio and listen to laddettes boasting about what they did with their boyfriends in bed the day before , but tune in to Iran 's airwaves and you will hear poetry and beautiful music .
Now while you may have traded Turner for Emin , Shakespeare for Rushdie , Mozart for Madonna , people who think very much like me will never allow such a thing to happen to their nation .
You offer us Puff Daddy but we have Hafez , thank you very much .
You offer us Hollywood when we have perhaps the finest modern cinema on earth .
You may have jettisoned a once great European and God-fearing civilisation , but your moral poison must never be allowed to insinuate its way into one of the greatest and oldest cultures on the planet .
The events in Iran of the past 30 years must be seen for what they really are , not a revolution at all , but a counter revolution ; not a negation of a nation 's grand past as occurred in France or Russia or China , but an affirmation of it ; a realisation that the experiment you call the Enlightenment , or secular liberalism , far from being the triumph of your comfortable certainties , has been the opposite – a bringing low of all that once made Europe great .
The planet has been brought to its knees by bourgeois greed .
Scientists increasingly consider us to be in the midst of a " mass extinction event " , similar to that which gripped the world when a giant meteorite slammed into the Gulf of Mexico and extinguished the dinosaurs .
Vast and increasing discrepancies in wealth cause massive social unrest that can but accelerate the apocalypse .
Meanwhile , the value of your cultural output is zero , and in the West the family has all but disappeared .
Built on a doctrine of expansion , your effervescence entailed history 's greatest genocides , 60 million alone in South and Central America within a century of Columbus 's arrival , the virtual eradication of the Plains Indians in the North ( " Manifest Destiny " ) , the enslavement of millions of Africans and Asians and the pillaging of half the world 's resources .
No creature in history has been as destructive as European Man and no force has harnessed that destructiveness as successfully as secular liberalism with its denial of a transcendent order .
And yet you accuse us of aggression .
The history of Iran is one of invasion by foreign powers .
How many Iranian warships patrol the Gulf of Mexico or the straits of Dover ?
How many Iranian spy satellites sail across your skies ?
How many Iranian troops are stationed next to your borders poised to invade ?
How many billions of Toumans are pumped into destabilising your regimes ?
How many Iranian nuclear missiles are aimed at your cities ?
How many atom bombs has Iran dropped on civilian populations ?
Now ask these questions in reverse .
And yet you allow your politicians to make you feel insecure !
Were the catastrophes I outlined above caused by Islam , or Iran , or even Bin Laden for that matter ?
Or were they in fact caused by a way of life which you arrogantly assume the whole world wishes to embrace ?
Your " mindlessness " , by which I mean your failure to ask such questions , comes from the fact that you cannot even comprehend your own indenture – to money and to desires that can never be satisfied .
Iran is set irreversibly on a course towards independence and will never adopt the position of servility towards Mammon and America which has earned for England the appellative not of the " the Great Satan " , a term reserved for the United States , but " shaytan - e- kuchek " or " the little Satan " .
To this end , she has recently developed her own fighter jets and her own communications satellites .
Likewise , she is engaged in building a giant oil refinery so that she will no longer be reliant upon imported petrol .
And , rest assured , she will develop a peaceful nuclear technology to insure her energy requirements against the inevitable day when the oil runs out , however much the " free world " or " international community " plot .
God willing , she can then become what Huntingdon refers to as a " core state " around which other nations that cherish freedom can coalesce .
As one of the few countries that has consistently dared to stand up to Mammon , she must be a bastion in the coming clash – not of civilisations , as Huntingdon puts it , but between civilisation on the one hand and the barbarism that is now synonymous with secular liberalism in the minds of so many Muslims , and others disillusioned with the fruits of the West , and not just in the imagination of one particular old Etonian , former member of the Bullingdon .
A veteran NYPD detective today was sentenced to four months in prison for lying at the trial of a teen who shot another man in the face in the Bronx .
Former Detective Christopher Perino had faced seven years behind bars for denying having questioned Erik Crespo , 17 , who shot his victim on Christmas Day .
Secret Recording
But the youth had recorded the 70 - minute interrogation on his MP3 player .
Crespo , who had been facing 15 years in jail , plea bargained his way to a seven - year sentence and remains free pending an appeal .
“ Perjury is an affront to the court , ” said Bronx Supreme Court Judge James Kindler before sentencing Perino , a 22 - year veteran who said he could n’t recall interviewing the teen .
“ It was directly due to ( Perino ’s ) perjury that the trial fell apart , and Crespo got the benefit . ”
Perino ’s conviction also cost him his job , pension and health benefits , estimated to be worth $ 3 million .
He shook his head in apparent disbelief as he left the court this morning .
The judge had been given nearly 300 letters written by supporters of Perino , including dozens of former colleagues .
“ It would be a sin , a wrongful act , to incarcerate ( Perino ) even for a day , ” said his attorney , Murray Richman , who argued his client had suffered a memory lapse when he denied questioning Crespo .
But Assistant DA Larry Hartstein said , “ He still does n’t recognize or show any remorse for what he did .
“ This defendant disgraced his badge and violated his oath of office . ”
It will be up to Britain and other European states , and not the United States , to provide reinforcements for Afghanistan if it is decided more troops are needed , Nato sources said today .
Stanley McChrystal , the US general in charge of the overall Nato force of 100,000 has yet to make any formal request , and , according to a senior European official , he has been discouraged from doing so for the time being ‑ at least until there is a clear political settlement in the wake of Afghanistan 's disputed election .
But if and when the call comes , the US will argue that it has already sent an extra 21,000 troops this year , and is still deeply committed in Iraq .
America already provides two - thirds of the Nato force .
The pressure will instead fall on the European states .
" The Germans have more capacity , as do the French , the Italians and the United Kingdom , " one Nato source said .
The Americans would only be able to send in many more if they " draw down the numbers in Iraq " , the source added .
But France , Italy and Germany would have thousands of troops available once peacekeeping missions in Lebanon and Kosovo were wound down , the source said .
France has 2,000 troops in both the Unifil and Kfor missions , while Italy has around 2,500 in Unifil and 2,000 in Kfor .
The Nato official estimated that Britain 's spare capacity was 2,000 , and argued that British public support for continuing was surprisingly high in view of recent deaths of soldiers .
The pressure will increase if Canada carries out its intention to pull out its 2,800 troops from Kandahar province over the next 18 months .
The future of Germany 's 4,000 troops in northern Afghanistan will depend on the result of its general election later this month .
Spain could commit a further 200 troops , adding to the 1,200 deployed there , Madrid said last week .
McChrystal has presented an strategic assessment to Washington and to Nato , and had been expected to supplement that report with a shopping list for more resources .
However , say European sources , the Obama administration was unhappy to see reports quoting the commander discussing the need for thousands more soldiers before all the 21,000 ordered in by Obama had even arrived ‑ 6,000 have yet to deploy in the country ‑ and McChrystal was told to suspend any formal request for more troops .
" They have to bear Congress in mind .
This needs to be a time to calm things down , and not to talk about sending more troops .
Let us wait and see what comes out of the [ Afghan ] election , " a European diplomat said .
Few if any western governments still expected a strong unitary and democratic state to be created in Afghanistan , particularly in the wake of the presidential election , the result of which is still being wrangled over in Kabul .
" No one ever thought this was going to be a free and fair election , " a Nato official said .
Instead , western governments now envisaged " a decentralised , tribal society , large parts of which will be run by people we may not like but who will not allow al - Qaida to train and to plot to kill Americans or Germans or Brits " .
Nato officials insisted today that the alliance 's cohesion was holding in the face of a worsening insurgency and rising casualty rates .
They pointed to the reduced number of " caveats " - national restrictions on what the kind of operations some troop contingents can take part in .
Tevatron near Chicago could be in the running to discover the Higgs boson ( Image : Fermilab )
WITH the Large Hadron Collider still in the repair shop , the race to find the Higgs boson has become a lot tighter , thanks to the older and less powerful – but working – Tevatron collider near Chicago .
“ The Tevatron definitely has a chance , ” says Greg Landsberg of Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , who works on one of the LHC ’s detectors .
With the LHC due to restart only in November at CERN near Geneva , Switzerland , the Tevatron has been gaining ground in the search for the Higgs , …
Europe has emerged as the richest region in the world , pushing North America , where wealth has declined by more than 20 percent due to the economic crisis , off the top spot , a study has shown .
The world 's richest also feel the recession biting , especially in North America , where the financial crisis first unfolded a year ago , reveals a survey on global wealth carried out by the Boston Consulting Group , a global management consulting firm .
The old continent has surpassed the United States in terms of wealth due to the financial crisis ( Photo : Wikipedia )
North America 's wealth , measured in assets under management , plummeted by 21.8 percent , the steepest decline in the world .
A lesser fall was registered in Europe , where assets shrunk by 5.8 percent compared to last year , down to € 22.2 trillion – a quarter of the globe 's total wealth .
The number of millionaire households worldwide fell from 11 million to about 9 million - a drop of 17.8 percent .
The decline was steepest in North America and Europe , at 22 percent in both regions , although the United States continues to have the most millionaire households - nearly 4 million .
The crisis also narrowed the gap between the wealthy and non-wealthy .
Wealth owned by households with less than € 90,000 in assets under management increased by two percent in 2008 , but it declined in all other segments .
Among households with more than € 4.5 million in assets under management , wealth fell by 21.5 percent .
Switzerland remained the largest offshore financial centre , accounting for more than € 1.5 trillion or 28 percent of the world 's tax havens .
But increased regulatory scrutiny is putting pressure on offshores that have based their edge primarily on tax avoidance .
" Once their tax and legal advantages evaporate , so too will their appeal , " Peter Damisch , co-author of the report , said in a press release .
Some nontraditional offshore centres - including several outside Europe - remain poised for growth .
Singapore and Hong Kong , in particular , will continue to benefit from their proximity to other Asian countries , where wealth is expected to stage a faster recovery .
The wealth management industry has weathered the storm better than most other financial - services sectors , but still their profits fell by more than six percent compared to last year .
Stung by losses and scandals , clients shifted their assets to basic , low - margin investments .
" Dazzling product complexity is no longer seen as a positive attribute - if it ever really was , " said Bruce Holley , another co-author of the study .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Vanguard Group Inc are among U.S. companies opposed to rules proposed by U.S. regulators to limit short selling , according to letters filed by the companies .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for comments on a proposal to reinstate the “ uptick ” rule , under which investors can short a stock only after it had moved higher .
In a short sale , an investor sells borrowed stock in anticipation of a price decline that will allow him to repurchase the shares at a lower price .
Some lawmakers and financial industry executives say short selling has worsened the financial crisis and driven down share prices .
Goldman and Vanguard were among several companies and exchange operators opposing new restrictions on short sales .
" The available empirical data suggest that short selling may benefit the market by exposing financial misconduct and aligning market prices with fundamental analysis , " Paul Russo , Goldman 's head of U.S. equity trading , wrote in a comment latter to the SEC .
Other investors , including T.Rowe Price , submitted letters expressing support for the new rules .
" We believe appropriate short selling serves a valid purpose and can enhance liquidity and price discovery , " T. Rowe Price said in a letter signed by Michael Gitlin , head of global trading .
" However , short selling has also been utilized as a device to manipulate stock prices in an abusive manner and has negatively impacted investor confidence . "

The level of the current right wing frenzy against the Association of Communities Organizing for Reform Now ( ACORN ) can only be understood within the dynamics of President Barack Obama 's 2008 election and John Kerry 's " official " loss in 2004 .
ACORN , more than any other political organization , was responsible for Obama 's victory .
ACORN in Ohio , and in key swing states , did what the Democratic Party used to do , but now seems incapable of doing registering large numbers of low income and working class voters .
Instead of going after the real whores at Chase , CitiBank , and assorted other financial institutions that pimped our system and our people , undercover right wing videographers went for a target that fit their pre-fabricated agenda a fake Daddy Mac and whore trying to open up a brothel with an ACORN member 's advice .
Of course any ACORN people involved in illegal practices should be investigated , as should anyone in the elite financial community and anyone out there misusing federal Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) money .
For that matter , the war criminals in the United States beginning with Cheney and Bush who committed war crimes , violated the 4th and 8th Amendments by spying on U.S. citizens and torturing people should be stalked and videotaped whenever possible .
The major reason ACORN has been a target of the Republican Party 's political operatives because it disrupts the strategy put in place by Karl Rove to simply purge as many Democratic voters as possible .
ACORN was one of the few organizations that was consistently active in the inner city of Ohio 's largest urban areas .
Not that there were n't other voter registration organizations , including the Obama campaign , but the one that asked me to register to vote over and over again in the inner city neighborhood I live in was ACORN .
Recall that Arkansas U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins and Western Missouri U.S. Attorney Todd Graves were fired for failing to go after ACORN during its 2006 voter registration drive .
Those responsible for the firing reached all the way to Rove in Bush 's White House .
The National Journal reported that former Bush - Cheney re-election campaign attorney Mark " Thor " Hearne targeted ACORN : " [ Hearne ] believed that the U.S. Attorney Todd Graves was not taking seriously allegations that ACORN workers were registering people who did not qualify to vote . "
The Republican sting operation is little more than an extension of the attacks on ACORN in Nevada , Missouri and Ohio in the 2006 election .
In 2006 , estimates were that ACORN had registered some 1.3 million new voters .
The attacks on ACORN , and their contrived nature were revealed at a 2005 hearing before then - Congressman Bob Ney in Ohio , who was later convicted of a felony .
At the federal hearing held in the Ohio Statehouse , Hearne emerged from nowhere claiming to be a voting rights advocate with a front organization called the American Center for Voting Rights ( ACVR ) .
In a classic Rovian scam , Hearne unleashed an unsubstantiated litany of " voter fraud " charges against ACORN and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) .
Among other things , Hearne , who had no history of ever working as a voting rights advocate , told Congressman
Ney that voter registration campaigns were used crack cocaine as an incentive for registering new voters .
Using the age - old canard of linking a black civil rights and a welfare rights organization with drugs serves the racist stereotypes consistently pitched by right - wingers .
In Hearne 's testimony in Ohio , he also went after the AFL - CIO and Americans Coming Together ( ACT - Ohio ) as evil - doers involved in " fraudulent " voter registration .
In a March 2005 letter to the U.S. Department of Justice , Hearne claimed there was " substantial evidence to suggest potential criminal wrongdoing by organizations such as Americans Coming Together , ACORN , and the NAACP - Project Vote . "

El año pasado , si usted hubiera sido uno de los habitantes más pobres de México , el Gobierno le habría dado en promedio 1.380 pesos mensuales , como parte del programa llamado Oportunidades , creado para atender a la población en condiciones económicas extremas .
Sin embargo , si usted fuera una persona rica due ña de una camioneta SUV , el Estado Mexicano le habría otorgado mensualmente 1.840 pesos en subsidios a la gasolina .
A más visitas a la gasolinera , más subsidio habría recibido , mientras que el subsidio a la pobreza es fijo .
Este tipo de paradojas son comunes bajo el pacto fiscal en el que viven los mexicanos .
Mientras su Gobierno cabildea activamente para lograr una mayor recaudación , la gente se pregunta si debe entregar más recursos a un gobierno que gasta mucho y lo hace ineficaz e ineficientemente .
En el centro de la discusión está el petróleo , el cual el Gobierno de México utiliza para complementar la parte del gasto público que no puede financiar con impuestos , simplemente porque no cobra impuestos suficientes .
En México los Estados y municipios recaudan muy poco .
Sin embargo , gastan pródigamente los recursos que les ha entregado el Gobierno Federal como excedentes del precio del petróleo en los últimos años .
Los excedentes totales del año 2008 repartidos a los gobiernos locales ascendieron a 5.080 millones de euros .
La mayor parte de dichos excedentes vino del superávit petrolero de ese año .
Otras naciones petroleras , como Noruega y Brasil , han aprovechado su riqueza petrolera a favor de la nación , no en su contra .
A diferencia de esos países , el petróleo mexicano se convierte en gasto público y eso eleva el tipo de cambio del peso con respecto al dólar , restándole competitividad a industrias distintas a las del petróleo .
Este es un fenómeno conocido como enfermedad holandesa .
Hartwick , economista de los recursos naturales de los años 70 , sintetizó la cura a la enfermedad holandesa mediante la regla que lleva su nombre , la cual implica que el capital de los recursos naturales debe convertirse en otra forma de capital .
Los noruegos siguen a pie juntillas la regla de Hartwick .
En ese país escandinavo , los excedentes del petróleo se guardan en un fondo para las generaciones futuras .
México gasta todo para la generación presente .
De seguir así , les dejará muchas deudas a los mexicanos del mañana .
El contexto actual no podría ser peor .
El producto interno bruto trimestral de México cayó más de un 10 % anualizado durante el último trimestre .
Esta es , quizás , la caída más grande del PIB para el conjunto de economías grandes del planeta , superada solamente por Rusia ( - 10,9 % ) , Turquía ( - 13,8 % ) y Taiwan ( - 10,2 % ) , de acuerdo a datos de la revista inglesa The Economist .
El desempleo en México es muy agudo : en el segundo trimestre de 2009 alcanzó un máximo de 5,17 % , y hoy ya se habla de cifras cercanas al 6 % de la población económicamente activa , lo cual es inusualmente alto .
La publicidad política del Gobierno de México y del partido en el poder , Acción Nacional , tiende a enfatizar que la crisis vino de afuera y que nadie pudo haberla previsto , ni nadie puede hacer algo para contenerla en este momento .
Sin embargo , sí podía hacerse algo .
Una política de gasto público como la que se observó en México durante los últimos años ha profundizado la crisis actual .
La descentralización del gasto en México hacia los Estados y municipios ha resultado en menores controles sobre el gasto y efectos dudosos sobre el crecimiento económico .
Mientras que otros países de la región , como Brasil o Chile , están saliendo de la crisis bien librados , y han podido aplicar políticas anticíclicas con relativo desparpajo , la recuperación en México será lenta y agónica .
Lo peor , es que la lección no ha calado cabalmente en la conciencia de la clase política del país .
¿ Qué se necesita para que eso ocurra ?
Landing in stores October , Windows 7 is sparking a surprisingly heated debate ( in our forums , at least ) on whether or not upgrading from XP is a good idea .
If you 're in the " nay " camp , we 're going to lay out seven reasons why you should consider switching your stance to " yay . "
When scanning our list , we politely encourage you to ask yourself , " Do I really want to continue using an eight - year - old operating system ? "
Followed by " Do n't I deserve better ? "
Because no matter how comfortable you are with XP , you do deserve an OS that 's both newer and better , and Windows 7 will deliver .
Not convinced ?
Then read on .
You Asked for This Remember Vista ?
We know most of you do n't want to , and that 's because the OS fell short of many consumers ' expectations .
As a result , many – especially power users – elected to skip Vista entirely , and have continued running Windows XP .
Hence Microsoft 's attempt at a redo with Windows 7 .
This time around , the software giant made an effort to crowdsource feedback from Microsoft enthusiasts by distributing a free beta version of Windows 7 in January .
You complained , you demanded , and in response Microsoft slapped something together to ship October 22 .
The result ?
The overall presentation of Windows 7 is familiar enough to welcome XP users , but fundamentally it 's different enough to make you change the way you think of Microsoft .
( I can vouch for that , being a long - time Mac user and ex-Windows fan ) .
Upgrading Wo n't Screw You Over Microsoft has its loyal fans in mind , including those clinging for dear life to XP .
The tech giant promises that Windows 7 has been coded to support almost every piece of software that runs on your XP system .
If , in the rare case one of your XP programs does n't work on Windows 7 , you can still run it in a virtual environment called XP Mode .
What 's especially cool about this mode is you wo n't have to toggle between an XP emulator and Windows 7 .
The apps running in XP Mode appear like ordinary windows that are part of Windows 7 .
Also , the Windows 7 upgrade chart may appear intimidating and confusing , but prior to release Microsoft plans to release a compatibility checker that will automatically scan your system to tell you which version of Windows 7 is for you .
Automatically Installed Device Drivers
This is only a minor improvement , but it addresses a major pain in the ass in earlier versions of Windows .
Who has time to scour the internet for a device driver to work with hardware such as a video card or an external hard drive ?
Life is too short for that garbage work , and fortunately Windows 7 does this chore for you .
Plug in a new piece of hardware , and the OS will find and install the driver for you .
XP has this feature , sort of , but it works better in Vista and much better in Windows 7 .
No more of those annoying yellow question marks .
Good riddance .
Piracy
Yarr !
We know there are plenty of you out there downloading pirated digital booty , especially in Windows land .
But it 's never been convenient to be a pirate compared with being a paying customer .
For example , if you 're a legitimate buyer purchasing movies off iTunes , you can easily stream your media to your legitimately purchased Apple TV .
If you 're a pirate , you 'd have to go through roundabout programs and hardware to re-create the experience .
Windows 7 is an OS practically made for pirates .
Want to display your movies , photos or music on your TV ?
Bam !
Windows Media
Player will do that out of the box if you have a Wi -Fi enabled TV , or an Xbox .
No extra programs to install : Windows Media
Player seamlessly communicates with your Wi-Fi device to display your illegal content in all its glory on your fancy HD TV .
And sharing media is easy , too .
Want to download all of your brother 's music ?
Bam !
HomeGroup , an easy networking feature included in Windows 7 , will make that super easy between computers running the OS .
Immediately upon plugging in to your network with Ethernet or Wi-Fi , HomeGroup will ask if you wish to join the group on the network , allowing you to set up easy file sharing in minutes .
A Better Interface
The new Aero features , which we covered in our Windows 7 first look , will change the way you interact with your computer .
Aero Peek will prove the most useful :
The feature displays outlines of all your open windows behind your active window .
Each outlined box contains a thumbnail previewing its corresponding window to help you choose .
Gizmodo's Matt Buchanan , who has been using AeroPeek for six months , provides an excellent perspective on Aero : " It breaks the instinct to maximize windows as you 're using them ; instead , you simply let windows hang out , since it 's much easier to juggle them . "
Makes sense , does n't it , for a generation of multitaskers ?
Are n't you tired of Alt - Tabbing over and over and over ?
Another feature , Aero Snap , makes it easier to resize and tile windows to fit the available space .
( Read more about Aero Snap and Aero Peek . )
Words are n't enough .
You really have to try the OS to understand why these UI enhancements are a big deal .
We get the idea that the people dismissing Windows 7 have n't yet tinkered with it , and we highly encourage you to download the release candidate and give it a test drive .
But do it now :
The download is only available until August 20 .
More Advanced Hardware Support
Technology evolves faster than living organisms , and Windows 7 is also designed to work well with upcoming hardware .
Touchscreens are getting more popular in the mainstream ( thanks largely to the iPhone ) , and sure enough Windows 7 includes multitouch support .
( Check out a video demoing how it works . )
If 2010 is indeed the year of the tablet , as we predict , then Windows 7 just might be the winning OS in that new landscape .
If you 're not interested in touchscreens , think multiple processor cores .
At some point when multicore computers are more widely available , affordable and energy efficient , an eight - year - old OS like Windows XP is n't going to know what to do with all that extra processing power .
Microsoft has already hinted that Windows 7 will scale to 256 processors .
That 's more than enough , but you get the picture :
This is a new operating system designed for newer systems .
You 're going to need to upgrade eventually , so why not do it now , so you can get a good feel for the OS , rather than later ?
The 64 - bit version of Windows 7 can handle bigger system memory , too , scaling up to 192 GB of RAM , compared to the 4 - GB limit for the 32 - bit versions of Windows XP and Windows 7 , and 128 GB for the less common 64 - bit edition of Windows XP .
Oh , yeah , speaking of new devices — Windows 7 is tweaked to better suit those trendy netbooks , too .
These puny devices are low - powered and thus limited in performance , and Windows 7 will run better on them thanks to its improved memory management .
For example , Windows XP allocated video memory for unseen windows , but Windows 7 does not .
It uses video memory only for visible windows .
That equates to a more responsive netbook with longer battery life .
It Looks Sexier
A superficial reason , we know , but we 've become so intimate with our gadgets that their looks are important , too .
Windows 7 will make your new PC look new , unlike the boring - as - vanilla UI of Windows XP .
Extra detail , polish , gradients and a UI that will clear your desktop of clutter should all make Windows 7 a more attractive choice .

We Freemasons catch so much shit about conspiracies , secret cabals to take over the world , and other garbage , it 's good to see that the press is letting people know that we do this sort of thing .
There are so many charities that we donate to , and so many more that we want to .

Update 2010 : Check out our new post on scaling Wordpress on Amazon's EC2
Recently we were tasked with the following problem : one of the websites we host was going to be featured prominently on a national television program .
They are not a huge - traffic website , averaging probably a couple thousand hits a month and are hosted on a shared server .
As we also have n't seen what the tv program was going to be and what sort of mention the website was going get , we essentially had no idea how much traffic to expect .
A couple of previous times , under normal circumstances the game plan would be something along the lines of : throw up a bunch of x-large amazon instances and move their site , which contains a number of static and dynamic elements onto the cloud .
Unfortunately as this is n't something that we do very often so it's a somewhat painful manual process that takes a fair number of hours to do ( and is not something I look forward to as it's a human - error - prone process ) and we do n't have stock EC2 images up - to - date with all the required software .
So , by the time the sites are up and tested and load balanced there is a significant expense to the client - both in the cost of the instances and the consulting time to get them up and functioning properly .
This client both did n't have the budget to do that and as we did n't know how much traffic was going to come in , we did n't want to waste their money if the rampaging horde of internet users never arrived .
So we can up with a solution that would be cheap but , for the most part at least , would be able to handle whatever traffic came their way - put the static pages of the site on Amazon S3 and run the website from there , but bring users back to the DB driven back - end for the pages that needed it ( logins , user accounts , contributions , volunteering , etc ) - all of which we were able to do with a just a couple of hours of time and a couple of quick and dirty scripts .
Here 's what we did , assuming a linux / apache2 hosting environment :
First the Preliminary steps :
Get yourself an s3 account and download the s3sync.rb scripts and get them configured properly .
See the included README - it 's pretty simple and mostly involves configuring ~/.s3conf/s3config.yml
Then , move all the file and image assets on the live site to S3 ( how you do this depends on your setup - many CMS 's have some S3 module or support , on a static site s3sync.rb and sed should do the trick )
This is n't actually necessary for the rest of what 's below but as the point is scaling to handle increased traffic it'll do it 's part to reduce the load on the live server as well by greatly reducing the number of requests that even hit the server .
Now the meat of the process :
1. Download a static copy of your site .
There 's an export script built into our CMS Webiva but I believe using wget to mirror the site should get you there too :
$ wget -m http://sample.com
Note : Depending on how your site downloads - if the pages are n't named . html you 'll have to modify the commands and scripts that follow - there 's no reason S3 can't serve pages ending with a . php extension with a text / html mime type .
Note 2 : This is more of a tutorial than a set of drop - in - place scripts - do n't expect to follow these steps exactly as your own site may be set up differently .
2 . We need to replace any references to the root homepage with index.html - a couple of quick sed calls searching for '/ ' and " / " did the trick for us :
$ find .
- name " *.html " - exec sed - i s/\'\\/\'/\'\\/index.html\'/g {} \;
$ find .
- name " *.html " - exec sed - i s/\" \\/\" /\" \\/index.html\ " / g {} \;
This is necessary because amazon s3 does n't support index.html files .
We can get around this issue for other pages on the site but not for the homepage .
3. Create an s3 bucket with s3 cmd.rb with the full sub - domain that you will be hosting on ( in our case example static.sample.com ) :
$ s3cmd.rb createbucket static.sample.com
4 . Drop the static javascripts and stylesheets onto our s3 bucket - this applies for files that are hosted locally that your static site will need :
$ cd public /
$ s3sync.rb - v -p -r javascripts / static.sample.com :javascripts/
$ s3sync.rb - v -p -r stylesheets / static.sample.com:stylesheets /
5 . Next I wrote a quick script ( url_replace.rb ) to replace links to specific pages that have forms or dynamic content to point all the way back to the real site .
This will allow any relative links to something like the / contribute page to always go back to the live site .
The script just searches for certain single - ' - or double - " - quoted relative urls and replaces them with full http://sitename.com/url urls .
This worked well enough for us but depending on your site 's content you might need to modify .
This script needs to be called once for each page with dynamic content with the domain to redirect to and the relative url of the page .
Here 's the script :
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
domain = ARGV [ 0 ] ; url = ARGV [ 1 ]
url = url.gsub ( " / " , " \\\\\\ / " )
`find . - name \"*. html\ " - exec sed - i s/\\ '# {url}\\'/\\'
http:\\\\/\\\\/#{domain}#{url}\\'/g {} \\;`
`find . - name \"*. html\ " - exec sed - i s/\\\ " #{url}\\\ " /\\ \ " http:\\\\/\\\\/#{domain}#{url}\\\" /g {} \\;`
Now here 's a sample usage :
$ ./url_replace.rb static.sample.com /email_signup
$ ./url_replace.rb static.sample.com /create_event
$ ./url_replace.rb static.sample.com / contribute
$ ./url_replace.rb static.sample.com / contact
6. Finally I wrote another quick script ( s3 put.rb ) to copy all the exported html files over to S3 .
Since S3 does n't support index files ( in fact , s3 does n't really support directories , everything is just a key ) it needs to just give them directory - like names but make sure they get sent to the client as text / html files ( this is why I could n't just use s3sync.rb to do the heavy lifting ) : :
Here 's the script :
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
bucket = ARGV [ 0 ] ; file = ARGV [ 1..- 1 ] .join ( ' ')
# Files are coming in from a find command , so they are all prefixed with a ./ ( i.e. ./dir/filename.html )
# Special case for index.html files - let them work as / directoryname and / directoryname /
puts ( " Handling : # {file} " )
if file =~ /^\.\/(.+)\/index.html$/
filebase = $ 1
`s3cmd.rb put \" #{bucket} :#{filebase}\ " \ " #{file}\ " x - amz - acl : public - read content - type: text / html`
`s3 cmd.rb put \" #{bucket} :#{filebase} /\ " \ " #{file}\ " x - amz - acl : public - read content - type: text / html`
end
# copy the file normally
filepath = file [ 2..-1 ]
`s3 cmd.rb put \" #{bucket} :#{filepath}\ " \ " #{file}\ " x - amz - acl : public - read content - type: text / html`
And then a find command piped to xargs should do the trick ( note the script above is counting on a " find . " command so all files paths coming in have a leading ./ you can adjust as necessary ) .
$ find .
- name " *.html " - print | xargs - L 1 ./s3put.rb static.sample.com
7 . Now do s3sync for any other static files that need to be hosted ( in my case , all static files were in the system / directory )
$ s3sync.rb - v -p -r system / static.sample.com:system/
8 . Now to take advantage of the fact that any sub-domain prefix to the s3.amazonaws.com domain is treated as a bucket name , we need to add in a quick CNAME to our site 's DNS to get a nice looking static domain - in our case we want static .
sample.com would serve the static site .
Add something like the following to your BIND setup or configure your DNS with whatever you use :
static.sample.com
CNAME static.sample.com.s3.amazonaws.com
Once that propogates , http://static.sample.com/index.html will take you to the homepage of the static site .
You can test your site out on http://static.example.com/index.html and make sure everything is good to go .
Any links to dynamic pages should take you back to the live site .
Once it 's time to deploy the static site :
Add some rewrite rules to your the apache2 config of the live site to kick it over to static .
sample.com on the appropriate pages .
For example to kick the homepage and anything under / about , / news / blog , / partners you can use :
RewriteRule /$ http://static.sample.com/index.html
[ NC, QSA , L ]
RewriteRule ^/( about|news|blog|partners ) (.* ) $
http://static.sample.com/$1$2 [ NC, QSA,L ]
... Any other rules you need ...
And were done - the majority of users will see only the static site unless they to do something active on the site .
Update 9/20 : As someone pointed out , pushing from S3 to Cloudfront will give you much better latency and is a good idea for public - facing hosted files at the cost of being unable to modify your site instantly ( if you discover a typo in some html for example ) .
A good compromise would be to turn cloud front on in your bucket , and then do a sed replacementfor any static media files ( leaving your .html files on s3 ) .
Since the url for the media files is much less important , leaving them on the deafult cloudfront domain name , as ugly as it is , wo n't really hurt .
Update 2010 : Cloudfront now supports default objects - so you can actually skip the index . html hack and point your whole www.sample.com site at the cloudfront distribution , only pointing back to dynamic site as needed ( under a site.sample.com CNAME for example ) - just set your index.html page as the default object for the distribution .
Now what happens to as soon as the rush is over and people have linked to the static site - but the site contains old content ?
Not a problem , because we used the cname feature of s3 we can kick the s3 bucket to the curb and just add in another virtual host on your live server to redirect people to the real site :
< virtualhost >
ServerName static.sample.com
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule /(.* ) $
http://sample.com/$1 [ R=permanent , NC, QSA,L ]
...
</virtualhost >
Now point that cname back to you live local server and all the static links will redirect to the live site .
Overall , not a huge deal and we saved the client a bunch of money .
Now we just have to hope too many people do n't try to contribute all at once on the live server .
=====================
Followup - the TV spot was cut to a quick 5 minute spot without a mention of the website and we did n't even need the extra bandwidth of the static hosted site .
Oh well , one more for the bag of tricks , I 'm sure the experience will come in handy .
Some parts of Blackwater ’s clandestine work for the CIA have begun to leak out from behind the iron curtain of secrecy .
The company ’s role in the secret assassination program and its continued involvement in the CIA drone attacks that occur regularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan have become front - page material in the Washington Post and New York Times .
There is much more to this story than has been reported publicly , and details will continue to emerge , particularly about Blackwater ’s aviation division (s ) .
Now we learn ( unsurprisingly ) that Blackwater offered " foreign " operatives to work on the CIA assassination program .
Blackwater told the CIA that it " could put people on the ground to provide the surveillance and support – all of the things you need to conduct an operation , " a former senior CIA official familiar with the secret program told the Associated Press .
If that ’s true , those foreign individuals would appear to have been privy to information that vice president Cheney and other U.S. officials deemed not appropriate for congressional ears , not to mention oversight .
In light of all of these developments , it is important to remember how Erik Prince essentially hired George W. Bush ’s top people from the CIA ’s directorate of operations to create his own private CIA , Total Intelligence Solutions .
He also offered Alvin " Buzzy " Krongard , the former number - three man at the CIA , a paid position on Blackwater ’s board .
Buzzy was the guy who got Blackwater its first known CIA contract back in 2002 in Afghanistan .
Buzzy is also the one whining about the CIA ’s " morale " problem , in light of the recent scandals , in the Washington Post .
" Morale at the agency is down to minus 50 , " he told the paper .
When you hear reports that a " private " company was hired to do clandestine work , remember that this particular " private " company , Blackwater , is , in part , being run by Agency veterans , including several of the top people running the torture and assassination programs under Bush .
At the end of the day , using Blackwater and / or other companies represents taking covert , lethal operations even further away from anything vaguely resembling oversight by the Congress .
By using ex-Agency people instead of " current " Agency personnel , yet another barrier is thrown up and the case for " plausible deniability " becomes stronger .
When you are dealing with a billionaire like Erik Prince who apparently viewed himself as a crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and Islam globally , as has been alleged by a former Blackwater official , it is not difficult to imagine how all of this could remain – at least in part – off the books .
Would it be a great shock if we learn that Prince volunteered some of his men or his company ’s time to lethal missions for the CIA free of charge ?
" I ’m not a financially driven guy , " Prince told Congress in October 2007 .
Take that with a grain of salt , but it is probably not flat out false .
He was a believer in the crusade .
That is why it is essential that Congress dig deep into all aspects of the CIA assassination program and Blackwater ’s total involvement .
But it is important to remember that it is so much bigger than this one company and certainly bigger than one clandestine program .
Also , it is very important to remember this : Blackwater is hardly alone .
Salon.com ’s Tim Shorrock obtained documents in 2007 from the office of the Directorate of National Intelligence ( DNI ) showing that Washington spends some $ 42 billion annually on private intelligence contractors , up from $ 17.5 billion in 2000 .
That means 70 percent of the U.S. intelligence budget is going to private companies .
" This is the magnet now .
Everything is being attracted to these private companies in terms of individuals and expertise and functions that were normally done by the intelligence community , " former CIA division chief and senior analyst Melvin Goodman told me a year ago .
" My major concern is the lack of accountability , the lack of responsibility .
The entire industry is essentially out of control .
It ’s outrageous . "
Attorney General Eric
Holder should appoint a special prosecutor just to examine the role that Blackwater and other " private contractors " have played – from the jump – in the torture program , the extraordinary rendition program and the assassination program to name a few .
And it should not be just about the operatives in the field .
Who hired Erik Prince ’s men ?
Who authorized these contracts ?
Who " managed " their operations in the field ?
What exactly did they do ?
At Guantanamo , there were contractors involved with torture .
Same at Abu Ghraib .
Same at Bagram .
This all needs to be dismantled and investigated .
Blackwater ’s Private Spies : A Bush - Era CIA Who ’s Who
As for Blackwater ’s role , I wrote about Prince ’s private CIA last summer for The Nation in a piece called " Blackwater ’s Private Spies , " but thought it would be relevant to repost some of what I laid out then because it is extremely relevant to what is happening right now .
( One note : Robert Richer recently left Prince ’s employ . )
Excerpt :
Total Intelligence , which opened for business in February 2007 , is a fusion of three entities bought up by Prince : the Terrorism Research Center , Technical Defense and The Black Group – Blackwater vice chair Cofer Black ’s consulting agency .
The company ’s leadership reads like a Who ’s Who of the CIA ’s " war on terror " operations after 9/11 .
In addition to the 28 - year CIA veteran Black , who is chair of Total Intelligence , the company ’s executives include CEO Robert Richer , the former associate deputy director of the agency ’s Directorate of Operations and the second - ranking official in charge of clandestine operations .
From 1999 to 2004 , Richer was head of the CIA ’s Near East and South Asia Division , where he ran clandestine operations throughout the Middle East and South Asia .
As part of his duties , he was the CIA liaison with Jordan ’s King Abdullah , a key U.S. ally and Blackwater client , and briefed George W. Bush on the burgeoning Iraqi resistance in its early stages .
Total Intelligence ’s chief operating officer is Enrique " Ric " Prado , a 24 - year CIA veteran and former senior executive officer in the Directorate of Operations .
He spent more than a decade working in the CIA ’s Counterterrorist Center and 10 years with the CIA ’s " paramilitary " Special Operations Group .
Prado and Black worked closely at the CIA .
Prado also served in Latin America with José Rodriguez , who gained infamy late last year after it was revealed that as director of the National Clandestine Service at the CIA he was allegedly responsible for destroying videotapes of interrogations of prisoners , during which " enhanced interrogation techniques , " including waterboarding , were reportedly used .
Richer told the New York Times he recalled many conversations with Rodriguez about the tapes .
" He would always say , ‘ I ’m not going to let my people get nailed for something they were ordered to do , ’ " Richer said of his former boss .
Before the scandal , there were reports that Blackwater had been " aggressively recruiting " Rodriguez .
He has since retired from the CIA .
The leadership of Total Intelligence also includes Craig Johnson , a 27 - year CIA officer who specialized in Central and South America , and Caleb " Cal " Temple , who joined the company straight out of the Defense Intelligence Agency , where he served from 2004 to ’06 as chief of the Office of Intelligence Operations in the Joint Intelligence Task Force – Combating Terrorism .
According to his Total Intelligence bio , Temple directed the " DIA ’s 24/7 analytic terrorism target development and other counterterrorism intelligence activities in support of military operations worldwide .
He also oversaw 24/7 global counterterrorism indications and warning analysis for the U.S. Defense Department . "
The company also boasts officials drawn from the Drug Enforcement Agency and the FBI .
Total Intelligence is run out of an office on the ninth floor of a building in the Ballston area of Arlington , Va. Its " Global Fusion Center , " complete with large - screen TVs broadcasting international news channels and computer stations staffed by analysts surfing the Web , " operates around the clock every day of the year " and is modeled after the CIA ’s counterterrorist center , once run by Black .
The firm employs at least 65 full - time staff – some estimates say it ’s closer to 100 .
" Total Intel brings the … skills traditionally honed by CIA operatives directly to the board room , " Black said when the company launched .
" With a service like this , CEOs and their security personnel will be able to respond to threats quickly and confidently – whether it ’s determining which city is safest to open a new plant in or working to keep employees out of harm ’s way after a terrorist attack . "
Black insists , " This is a completely legal enterprise .
We break no laws .
We do n’t go anywhere near breaking laws .
We do n’t have to . "
But what services Total Intelligence is providing , and to whom , is shrouded in secrecy .
It is clear , though , that the company is leveraging the reputations and inside connections of its executives .
" Cofer can open doors , " Richer told the Washington Post in 2007 .
" I can open doors .
We can generally get in to see who we need to see .
We do n’t help pay bribes .
We do everything within the law , but we can deal with the right minister or person . "
Black told the paper he and Richer spend a lot of their time traveling .
" I am discreet in where I go and who I see .
I spend most of my time dealing with senior people in governments , making connections . "
But it is clear that the existing connections from the former spooks ’ time at the agency have brought business to Total Intelligence .
Take the case of Jordan .
For years , Richer worked closely with King Abdullah , as his CIA liaison .
As journalist Ken Silverstein reported , " The CIA has lavishly subsidized Jordan ’s intelligence service , and has sent millions of dollars in recent years for intelligence training .
After Richer retired , sources say , he helped Blackwater land a lucrative deal with the Jordanian government to provide the same sort of training offered by the CIA .
Millions of dollars that the CIA ‘ invested ’ in Jordan walked out the door with Richer – if this were a movie , it would be a cross between Jerry Maguire and Syriana .
‘ People [ at the agency ] are pissed off , ’ said one source .
‘ Abdullah still speaks with Richer regularly , and he thinks that ’s the same thing as talking to us .
He thinks Richer is still the man . ’
Except in this case it ’s Richer , not his client , yelling ‘ show me the money . ’ "
In a 2007 interview on the cable business network CNBC , Black was brought on as an analyst to discuss " investing in Jordan . "
At no point in the interview was Black identified as working for the Jordanian government .
Total Intelligence was described as " a corporate consulting firm that includes investment strategy , " while " Ambassador Black " was introduced as " a 28 - year veteran of the CIA , " the " top counterterror guy , " and " a key planner for the breathtakingly rapid victory of American forces that toppled the Taliban in Afghanistan . "
Black heaped lavish praise on Jordan and its monarchy .
" You have leadership , King Abdullah , His Majesty King Abdullah , who is certainly kind toward investors , very protective , " Black said .
" Jordan is , in our view , a very good investment .
There are some exceptional values there . "
He said Jordan is in a region where there are " numerous commodities that are being produced and doing well . "
With no hint of the brutality behind the exodus , Black argued that the flood of Iraqi refugees fleeing the violence of the U.S. occupation was good for potential investors in Jordan .
" We get something like 600 , 700,000 Iraqis that have moved from Iraq into Jordan that require cement , furniture , housing , and the like .
So it is a – it is an island of growth and potential , certainly in that immediate area .
So it looks good , " he said .
" There are opportunities for investment .
It is not all bad .
Sometimes Americans need to watch a little less TV … .
But there is – there is opportunity in everything .
That ’s why you need situation awareness , and that ’s one of the things that our company does .
It provides the kinds of intelligence and insight to provide situational awareness so you can make the best investments . "
Black and other Total Intelligence executives have turned their CIA careers , reputations , contacts , and connections into business opportunities .
What they once did for the U.S. government , they now do for private interests .
It is not difficult to imagine clients feeling as though they are essentially hiring the U.S. government to serve their own interests .
In 2007 Richer told the Post that now that he is in the private sector , foreign military officials and others are more willing to give him information than they were when he was with the CIA .
Richer recalled a conversation with a foreign general during which he was surprised at the potentially " classified " information the general revealed .
When Richer asked why the general was giving him the information , he said the general responded , " If I tell it to an embassy official I ’ve created espionage .
You ’re a business partner . "

The bus shelter cinema has a capacity of two people
A new record - breaking cinema has opened in Shetland to critical acclaim .
It is not only Britain 's newest cinema , it is also the country 's northernmost and its smallest , with accommodation for a capacity audience of two .
The cinema has been set up in a bus -shelter in north - east corner of the island of Unst .
It has a screen , a projector and it has been given the blessing of the country 's top film critic Mark Kermode , who described it as " remarkable " .
Tourist attractions
The bus shelter is already internationally famous for being decorated each year in different colours by a band of volunteers .
It started as a harmless prank and has developed so that now it even has a website dedicated to it .
If the visitors ' book is to be believed , it is now one of the most visited tourist attractions in Shetland .
Dr Kermode , who reviews films for BBC Radio Five Live , said : " I 've been to premieres .
I 've done Hollywood .
I 've done all that sort of thing .
" But it pales into insignificance when you 're in a bus shelter in Unst .
" It 's a remarkable place to see a film .
I can't think of anywhere more extraordinary . "
Mark Kermode and his mother filled the cinema
The bus shelter has been turned into a cinema as part of the Shetland film festival Screenplay , which is running until the end of the week .
At the grand opening it was used to screen a film by the local young - people 's film club Maddrim Media .
Aidan Nicol of the group said it had been an honour to show it in Britain 's smallest , northernmost and newest cinema .
" It 's a great opportunity for Maddrim to be able to show our work to one of Britain 's biggest film critics , " she said .
" It 's a really great advantage for us . "
Dr Kermode was full of praise for the youngsters .
He said he had been following their work for three years and strongly recommended their short film Masks , which can be found on youtube .
The cinema opening has been described as a great success by Shetland Arts , which is staging the film festival .
Achieving a capacity audience in a venue that can hold only two people maybe is not a fabulous achievement but the organisers are hoping for similar success at its other , larger venues right across the islands .

The Lens of Hypergamy : An Application By Bryan Caplan
Last year , Tyler named “ hypergamy ” his word of the day .
He called the source “ evil , ” but the Evil One ’s explanation is admirably elegant :
It is sometimes said that men are polygamous and women monogamous …
It would be more accurate to say that the female sexual instinct is hypergamous .
Men may have a tendency to seek sexual variety , but women have simple tastes in the manner of Oscar Wilde :
They are always satisfied with the best .
For a nice illustration , see the romance in Public Enemies .
Although Johnny Depp plays a murderer and a thief , he has his girlfriend ’s true love .
Why ?
Because he ’s the nation ’s Number One criminal .
Since I first learned the term , hypergamy ’s explanatory power just seems to keep growing .
Let me share an example .
Last week , Robin reminded me that women initiate most divorces .
This book says women initiate 91 % of them ; other sources say 65 - 75 % .
Here ’s how this pattern looks through the lens of hypergamy :
In marriage , a man and women contract to forsake all others .
Now ask yourself :
If either were going to defect from this agreement , what form would the defection take ?
Men , with a polygamous objective function , typically defect by trying to find an additional woman .
Women , with a hypergamous objective function , betray by trying to replace their existing man with a better one .
It ’s only natural , then , for the woman to initiate most divorces .
She has to lose her zero before she can renew her search for a hero .
The man , in contrast , gets little direct value out of initiating divorce ; with polygamous preferences , divorce is inferior to remaining married while ignoring its constraints .
On further reflection , if fiction is any guide , a decent fraction of male - initiated divorces are probably the result of pressure from the “ other woman , ” who wants to have the two - timer all to herself .
So hypergamy explains even more than it seems :
Why wives initiate divorce , and why mistresses pressure other women ’s husbands to do the same .
In writing about betrayal , I do n’t mean to sound overly cynical .
I ’m not .
The world is full of men and women who not only take their marriage contracts seriously , but are too devoted even to want to break the agreement .
My point is simply that the betrayal takes very different forms – and the lens of hypergamy helps social scientists understand why .
It 'll fry pace makers , destroy iPhones , and turn laptops into useless paperweights .
It 's the scariest thing most people outside the Washington Beltway have never heard of : electromagnetic pulse weapons .
And you can learn all about it starting today at the EMPACT conference in Niagara Falls , New York .
Electromagnetic pulse , or EMP , is a burst of electromagnetic radiation that fries electronics , from satellites to toaster ovens .
The effects of a nuclear EMP were first observed after the 1962 Starfish Prime nuclear test , which knocked out satellites and electronics .
EMP weapons are specifically designed to maximize this electronics - killing effect , which can be done by detonating a high - altitude nuclear explosion .
Though the effect is most commonly associated with a nuclear blast , the U.S. military , among others , has been looking at conventional weapons that harness the EMP effect .
Those who worry about these weapons say that a single EMP attack could shut down the continental United States , creating mass havoc caused by the breakdown in infrastructure .
As the conference description notes : " Two Congressional Commissions , the EMP Commission and the Strategic Posture Commission , have warned that terrorists , rogue states , China and Russia could , using a single crude nuclear weapon delivered by a primitive missile , inflict an EMP attack that would cause the collapse of critical civilian infrastructures–such as infrastructures for electric power , telecommunications , transportation , banking and finance , food and water–across the entire continental United States , that are vital alike for the sustenance of our modern society and the survival of its citizens . "
Concerns about EMP weapons have long attracted a devoted band of doomsdayers , including Roscoe Bartlett , the Republican congressman from Maryland , and former representative Curt Weldon , who has warned of plasma attack weapons ( a non-nuclear EMP ) .
Both are speakers at the EMPACT conference .
Though well known and a source of lively debate among policy wonks and nuclear weapons scientists for decades , the threat of EMP weapons have n't made much headway into popular culture ( and a number of scientists dispute the danger of such weapons ) .
The organizers of the conference , EMPACT America Inc. are trying to change the popular perception of EMP with the conference , as well as with Armageddon - esque videos like this :
As an interesting aside , the conspiracy - plagued High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program , or HAARP , the radar array in Alaska , has been proposed as a facility that could be used to research ways to " scrub " the upper atmosphere , mitigating the effects of EMP .
Also :
... yes , we have the superb British actress Lena Headey .
That 's not news , I know .
The CHICAGO TRIBUNE broke the story , and the casting has been confirmed by the HOLLYWOOD REPORTER , Reuters , and numerous other blogs and websites .
But just in case there were any doubts , this should put 'em to rest .
Lena is best known among genre fans for playing Sarah Connor in the recently cancelled Fox show THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES .
Sarah , of course , was played in the TERMINATOR films by Linda Hamilton , who was also Catherine on BEAUTY AND THE BEAST .
Yes , that was the " Six Degrees " clue , with Sarah Connor as the link .
Lena also starred as Queen Gorgo of Sparta in the film 300 , whence came my two " Gorgo " clues , one playing off the old monster movie GORGO ( see below ) , the other off the actual historical Queen Gorgo , as chronicled by Herodotus , Father of History .
( Some folks have complained that the clues were too hard .
Maybe so .
Hard to judge these things .
Originally I had intended to write that the search for our queen had been terminated after looking at three hundred actresses , but Parris convinced me that you lot would have solved that one in about six seconds .
So blame her . )
Lena Headey has played all sorts of other roles besides Queen Gorgo and Sarah Connor , of course .
Check out her credits on IMDB .
She 's even worked with Jennifer Ehle ( our Catelyn ) in POSSESSION , she played Guinevere in MERLIN , she 's appeared in many period pieces and even a few set during the medieval period .
Her range was one of the things that impressed us most about her ; Cersei is a character with many colors , and Lena will be able to give us all of them .
Her readings were wonderful ... and of course she 's beautiful and sexy as hell .
Yes , it 's true , she 's not a blonde , but she has played one on TV ( and in films ) .
Seriously , guys .
This is HBO .
They know about wigs and hair dyes and stuff like that .
Lena should be amazing as the queen you love to hate .
I 'm thrilled to have her aboard .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A man accused of entering New York 's LaGuardia Airport with a bag containing wires and batteries , sparking suspicion and leading to a large - scale evacuation , was ordered Saturday to undergo a psychiatric evaluation , a prosecutor said .
LaGuardia Airport 's Central Terminal is being treated as a crime scene .
Scott McGann , 32 , appeared in court after authorities said he walked into LaGuardia 's Central Terminal Saturday morning with what was determined to be a fake bomb .
The terminal was reopened after several hours .
Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown said McGann was charged with placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the first degree ; placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in a transportation facility ; and making terrorist threats .
McGann appeared in court Saturday , but his arraignment was postponed , Brown said .
McGann is being held without bail .
" The defendant is clearly a very troubled young man , " Brown said .
" As a result , the Court has directed that he be examined to determine whether he has the capacity to understand the proceedings against him and assist in his defense . "
Earlier , officials said McGann would n't speak to his lawyer or anyone else .
His next court appearance is scheduled for Thursday .
McGann allegedly arrived at a checkpoint in the terminal at about 4:50 a.m. , carrying a backpack and refusing to answer security questions .
Authorities said the officer at the checkpoint was informed that a suspicious package was attached to the bottom of McGann 's backpack , and that McGann allegedly grabbed what appeared to be a trigger device with a red button connected to the backpack .
McGann allegedly pressed the button several times before a Port Authority officer grabbed the trigger and the package away from him .
The package turned out to be a device consisting of batteries , cylinders and electronic components that could have been used to make a bomb , Brown said , but the bomb squad found that it did n't not contain any explosives .
McGann had a ticket on a United Airlines flight to Chicago and a seat on two other connecting flights with his final destination Oakland , California , according to a law enforcement official close to the investigation .
Watch passengers talk about the confusion »
McGann has three prior arrests in the New York area , the source told CNN .
The most recent involved June charges of tampering with evidence and resisting arrest .
He was also arrested twice in 2008 , the source said .
Port Authority spokesman John Kelly said McGann " was just acting crazy . "
The arresting officers described McGann to Kelly as " extremely disheveled and dirty , " in a " near catatonic state " and " staring off into space , " Kelly said .
McGann had been homeless for at least a year .
Authorities evacuated the terminal after 5:20 a.m. , and allowed passengers back in to all areas except Concourse C by midmorning , Kelly said .
The concourse was reopened shortly before 11 a.m. , according to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Holly Baker .
Watch the chaotic evacuation scene »
Authorities had stopped flights from taking off or landing at the airport , but by a little after 9 a.m. , flights resumed , Baker said .
Central Terminal is one of four terminals in the airport , which is in the borough of Queens .
It is about eight miles from Manhattan .
The incident disrupted travel plans for many passengers , and caused American Airlines to cancel 16 flights , said an airline spokesperson .
American Eagle , Continental Airlines and Southwest also reported delays .
iReport : Watch crowds start moving back into the terminal
CNN i-Reporter Jose Ojeda , 24 , had been sitting on the tarmac on a plane headed to Chicago , Illinois , when the evacuation was ordered .
" We were all ready to go , " Ojeda , of Bronx , New York , said of his flight , which he said had been scheduled to leave at 6:10 a.m .
" They did n't make any announcement other than , ' You need to evacuate , ' " he said .
" I thought it was standard procedure , but then once we got out of the plane , they kept pushing us back and back , out of the terminal out of the actual airport . "
CNN 's Chuck Johnston , Aspen Steib , Ross Levitt , Laurie Segall and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .

Researchers from the University of Cambridge took a big step forward this year in understanding how our brains work .
It seems that the brain has a fractal organization .
This likely gives us much of what we consider human .
And at a deeper level these findings may help to connect us in a very fundamental way to the rest of the natural world .
The research team of Kitzbichler , Smith , Christensen , and Bullmore published their results in an article called " Broadband Criticality of Human Brain Network Synchronization , " which is available on - line for free .
I 've had the article for about six months and had been meaning to post something on it .
So at the outset I 'd like to thank " Neel " for getting me going to actually re-read the article and post something with an interesting question he posed about neurological complexity and to the Chaotic Life blog at Psychology Today last month .
I 'd also like to thank my friend and colleague from NY , Grant Brenner for alerting me to the article when it first came out .
The design , results and context for this study are very sophisticated , and the implications are quite abstract .
So I 'm going to do my best to be clear .
First the context : Many natural systems exhibit fractal organization and behavior .
A fractal is a branchlike structure .
Think of a tree : ( 1 ) Trees have many more small branches than large ones .
This characteristic is also sometimes called a " power - law " or " inverse power law " or a " 1/ f " organization .
Each of these terms means that there are exponentially more small branches compared to big ones .
( 2 ) Trees are " self - similar , " meaning that small branching patterns resemble larger ones .
This characteristic is also sometimes called " scale invariance " or " scale free " because no matter the size you are looking at , the general branching shape is the same .
( 3 ) The complexity of tree branching patterns can be quantified .
Fractals are called " fractals " because they exist in fractional dimensions .
A line fits perfectly in one - dimension .
A plane ( like a piece of paper ) fits in two - dimensions .
Fractals fit in between a line and a plane ( or in the real world between two and three dimensions ) .
More simply , because they are so complex , with huge numbers of tini tiny branches , trees never quite reach three dimensions .
If you put them in a box , there will always be some space left over .
You may quickly recognize that many other natural structures besides trees are fractals : Neurons , rivers , the respiratory system , the circulatory system , geological fault lines , snow - flakes , and so on .
Natural systems also produce fractal behavior over time or in dynamics .
Earthquakes are a common example .
There are many more small earthquakes than large ones ( which is nice by the way ) .
Other examples include the size of extinction events in animal species , numbers of academic publications ( a few researchers do huge amounts of work and the rest of us do just a little ) , numbers of hits to web - sites , wait times in stop - and - go traffic , and word usage in literature ( i.e. , zipf 's law ) .
Why do systems do this ?
There are many reasons .
Essentially , fractal systems have many opportunities for growth , change and re-organization .
Yet they also are very robust .
They maintain their coherence ; they hold together well , even under tough circumstances .
They are balanced in this respect , between order and chaos .
They are simple , yet also very complex .
This balance is often referred to as " criticality , " thus the title of the article : " Broadband Criticality . "
And the term " self - organized " is often added because systems tend to become fractal on their own , simply by putting a lot of system components together and allowing them to exchange information .
Think of a party .
All you need to do is come up with enough people at the same place and time and they will start to form complex patterns of connection with one another .
Self - organizing critical systems are also very good at connecting , both internally and also to other surrounding systems .
The branches of a tree are connected in a very lovely way .
If you shake one branch , you 'll see broad shaking across the tree .
Fractal structures hang together nicely .
Yet they branches may be trimmed without affecting the overall structure .
Indeed , if you trim them far enough out ( above the growth bud , " " or " whatever does n't kill you makes you stronger " ) they will often grow even stronger , with more complex connections in the outer branches .
Finally , branchlike patterns easily connect to other systems - a literal web of life .
A tree with many fractal branches ( and also roots ) can better connect to the sun ( and soil ) to gather and exchange life sustaining nutrients .
In the past 10 to 20 years , researchers in psychology have been finding increasing examples of fractal patterns across each of the domains of psychology : Including intentional behaviors , visual search , and speech patterns .
In my own lab within the past few years we have found that interpersonal relationships are organized as fractals and most recently that the is a fractal , with complexity being associated with health in both the psychological and social domains .
Furthermore , it appears that fractal complexity ( or rigidity ) is routinely exchanged among biological , psychological and social processes .
Fractal structure helps us to grow and connect , as do fractal relationships , and each likely has direct influences on physical health by encouraging integration and flexibility among circulatory , respiratory , and immune systems .
The study by Kitzbichler et al ( 2008 ) has added to much prior research suggesting that the brain exhibits fractal behavior .
This makes a necessary link between the physical processes of the brain and each of the larger scale fractals we see in broader personality and social relationships .
It is clear that biological , psychological and social dynamics are highly interlinked across scales , each impacting the other over time in myriad ways .
With fractal organization at each of these scales , one may propose that they in some respects they are all part of the same fractal tree so to speak .
Kitzbichler et al ( 2008 ) used two measures of synchronization across brain systems : ( 1 ) the " phase - lock interval " and the " lability of global synchronization . "
The phase - lock interval is the amount of time that different brain regions are doing the same thing together - the amount of time in which they are synchronized .
Essentially , this is a time - based measure of brain system coordination .
The other measure , " lability of global synchronization " is a space - based measure .
This measure tells you how global are the shifts in brain system synchronization , how broad are they , how far reaching .
Leaving out the many wonderful technical details of their analyses , they found that both measures showed clear - cut fractal patterning .
This means that the amount of time that different brain regions spend in sync is branchlike - with many short linkage times and fewer long ones .
And the spread of these linkages across brain regions was branchlike too , with many small spreads and few large ones .
These results , along with the evidence that has come before them , provide a much truer picture of how the brain is organized and how it works .
Such is the core of basic research .
The applications of these results may be considered to be virtually unlimited , and will over time impact every branch of applied - intelligence , consciousness , , body - mind medicine , and .
What I would prefer to speculate upon instead would be the broader implications .
Indeed what these robust results within the brain suggest is a possible mechanism for the " Broadband Connectivity " we share with the rest of the natural world .
Inasmuch as fractal dynamics in broadband synchronization exist at every scale of measurable reality - from quantum to cosmic , perhaps human consciousness is both simply and profoundly a portal through which such fractal connectivity flows .
Perhaps the linkages that so effect our growth and integration at the biopsychosocial scales extend much deeper into the roots of matter , and much farther into the cosmos than modernist science has ever imagined .
Science appears to be nearing a period of neo-vitalism , with scientifically grounded ways of exploring the attractive worldview of our root - civilizations - that everything in life is connected and that all of the universe is alive within these connections .
Sure - some connections are more proximal than others .
Kitzbichler et al. found that functionally connected brain regions were more likely to find and stay in sync with one another for longer periods of time , yielding fractal complexity measures that were less flexible than the connections among more distant regions .
Similarly , one 's life - partner will be more likely to drive you crazy than the moon .
Nevertheless , it will be interesting to see if certain systemic states encourage coherence , magnifying the connections among apparently separate systems .
For example , the human stress response is a likely candidate for increasing the short - term coherence among biological , psychological and social processes .
When you are , your bodily systems band together , your psychological systems become clear and focused , and your social dynamics become coherent as well as you band together and form strict hierarchies .
Does human stress have broader impacts ?
Can their effect be measured even as far as the quantum realm ?
Conversely , can quantum systems become " stressed " leading them to reach into our macro world ?
Maybe so , maybe not .
One thing is for sure , this blog is already way to long and abstract to fully consider these possibilities .
Perhaps another day ..?
THE TANAISTE lived up to her ' Calamity Coughlan ' nickname yesterday .
The gaffe - prone minister was left red-faced after she erroneously referred to the theory of evolution as having been formulated by Einstein .
To make matters worse , the Enterprise , Trade and Employment Minister had just mentioned the Government 's strategy of Building Ireland 's Smart Economy .
Speaking without notes to an invited audience of entrepreneurs to promote IDA Ireland 's " aggressive " new campaign to market Ireland aboard , Ms Coughlan touched on the idea of the survival of the fittest .
She said the IDA would be marketing Ireland as the innovation island -- " like Einstein explaining his theory of evolution " .
Theory
The scientific basis for evolution , which has moved from theory to accepted truth , was first promulgated by Charles Darwin in his 1859 book ' On the Origin of Species ' .
Ironically , Darwin 's profile has never been higher , with many commemorative events this year to mark the 200th anniversary of his birth and the 150th anniversary of his landmark work .
Einstein , born 70 years after Darwin , formulated the theory of relativity in the last century to explain concepts of how time and space blur the laws of physics .
It has nothing to do with survival of the fittest .
It was Ms Coughlan 's second gaffe in a week -- after she referred to the Green Party in a radio interview in Irish as " na Glasrai " , instead of " An Comhaontas Glas " .
The phrase " na glasrai " means " the vegetables " .
A spokesman for the Tanaiste said last night : " Yes , it was said .
Darwin was evolution and Einstein was relativity -- we all read our science books in school . "

Facebook just sent shockwaves through the social web with its announcement that they will be supporting @mentions in status updates .
The feature , which Facebook calls tagging , allows you to not only reference friends , but groups , pages , and events .
Without any hesitation we will say that this move is a direct attack on its upstart competitor Twitter , whose @mention feature ( formerly known as @reply ) has been an integral part of the microblogging service .
This is only in addition to a wave of other recent moves by Facebook to halt Twitter in its tracks .
Real - time search and the FriendFeed acquisition were just the beginning .
This move has more direct impact on Twitter though , especially as many Facebook users utilize Twitter as their status update tool .
Here are some of the likely implications of Facebook 's new feature :
1 . More of the conversation moves to Facebook : This one 's inevitable .
With the ability to tag and chat with friends in public , some of the public conversation that has been for so long on Twitter will migrate over to the larger user base that is Facebook .
2 . Users could update Twitter through Facebook instead of vice versa :
Soon you could see people updating Twitter via Facebook , now that you can reference people with the same syntax .
Facebook recently launched a Twitter app for Pages .
If it were activated for profiles , user habits would quickly change .
3 . Facebook becomes more attractive to big brands :
Now brands can reach out to users complaining about their brand as well .
And since Facebook is bigger , there are more customers to serve .
It adds a whole new level of interaction between brand and user .
4. People move to Facebook for breaking events :
When there is a plane crash , an earthquake , or a conference , people tend to turn towards Twitter first .
With @mentions generating conversation , it makes just as much sense to update on Facebook .
This could accelerate as the platform becomes more open .
5 . Developers flock back to Facebook :
What makes sense for Tweetdeck : serving 10 million Twitter users or 250 million Facebook users ?
As more and more of Twitter 's functionality makes its way onto Facebook , developers can build fully - functional apps for accessing Facebook and utilizing its data .
It could be a renaissance for the Facebook platform .
While it's way too early to understand the impact of Facebook @mentions on Twitter , it seems clear that its impact will be big .
You can't just take one of Twitter 's best features and adopt it on a platform several magnitudes larger and not see an impact .
Now we want to know what you think .
How will this change impact Twitter ?
What about Facebook ?
Do you think we 'll see a seismic shift or will this just be a blip on Twitter 's radar ?

U.S. tobacco companies –through political donations , lobbying efforts , and networks–are able to exert some control over the degree to which , and how , the U.S. government controls its industry .
One area of resistance involves warning labels .
The tobacco company has been resisting the very idea that cigarettes cause cancer , and the advertising of this fact , for decades .
This photo of cigarettes on sale at a duty free shop in Düsseldorf , Germany , sent in by Steve W. , gives us some perspective on just how successful they ’ve been :
Here , for comparison , is a photo of cartons of Marlboro ’s on sale in Texas :
In case you ca n’t read it , the large text above the “ Marlboro ” logo reads : “ Flip Top Box . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors is upping production and calling 1,350 of its U.S. and Canadian auto workers back to work due to increased demand for its vehicles .
The company said Tuesday it is raising production by about 60,000 vehicles in the third and fourth quarters , in response to the increased sales that accompanied the government 's Cash for Clunkers program .
The increased production will come from added shifts and overtime , GM said .
In addition , the company will keep select plants open during weeks that they had previously been forecast to be shut down .
For example , the Orion Township , Mich. , plant , which had been scheduled to close for nearly two - years in mid-September , will now remain in operation until just before Thanksgiving .
Those additional hours should increase the paychecks for an about 10,000 GM workers beyond those called back to work .
" The uptick is an encouraging sign that vehicle sales are turning around , and we will ramp up quickly to meet that demand , " said Tim Lee , GM group vice president for global manufacturing and labor , in a statement .
Weak sales and a need to conserve cash led the company to shut most production during the spring and early summer months , leaving GM with a record low dealer inventory of about 300,000 vehicles , according to company officials .
Mark LaNeve , GM vice president , U.S. sales , added on a conference call that he expects additional production increases to be announced in coming weeks and that the increased production could continue into the early months of 2010 .
" We 're probably not done , " he said .
The Cash for Clunkers program , which gives car buyers up to $ 4,500 from the federal government for older gas guzzlers if they buy a more efficient new car , caused a spike in sales across the industry during the last week of July .
GM rival Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) has also announced increased production for the second half of this year .
LaNeve said that GM has continued to benefit from healthier demand since the end of July , putting it on pace to beat internal sales targets for August by about 50,000 vehicles .
But he cautioned that strong sales to rental car companies and other so - called fleet customers last August will make it difficult for GM to post a year - over year gain in sales .
GM , which filed for bankruptcy in early June as part of a government - mandated reorganization , emerged from bankruptcy protection last month .
ACCRA , Ghana --
The first African - American president came to the continent of his father to exhort Africans on Saturday to rid themselves of corruption , embrace democracy and move from the grand , often violent , struggles of liberation and tribalism to the quieter , more potent movement of stability and economic growth .

Valve Responds to Left 4 Dead 2 Ban
" We were surprised to hear of this news yesterday , " the executive informed us .
" Obviously , everyone at Valve is pretty bummed . "
Australia 's Office of Film and Literature Classification refused to classify Left 4 Dead 2 due to its " realistic , frenetic and unrelenting violence " and gore , effectively banning the zombie shooter sequel as unrated games cannot be sold down under by law .
" It would be a shame if folks in Australia , or anywhere else , are unable to purchase Left 4 Dead 2 because of a ratings issue , " Lombardi lamented .
Left 4 Dead 2 hits PC and Xbox 360 elsewhere in the world on November 17 , packing a new cast , five campaigns , new enemies , and ratings board - enraging melee weapons .
David Gregory paints this phony outrage as a firestorm , but Friedman has to correct him .
Even Tom Brokaw was stunned at the ignorance and stupidity of the right wingers going ballistic over President Obama 's speech to our school kids .
Meet the Press :
MR. GREGORY : We brought it up with David Axelrod .
Well , this has created such a firestorm .
Here 's the New Canaan Public Schools , writing a parent letter , and in it they say this .
" In developing their plans our principals have considered issues such as developmental appropriateness , curricular relevance , the time at which the speech is being broadcast and the importance of teachers assuming responsibility for the selection of instructional materials .
In elementary schools the administration and faculty will view the speech , download it and after discussing it , make decisions regarding how it might be used in the future -- including deciding its appropriateness for various grade levels .
Parents will be notified , if and when , the decision to show the speech is made . "
Tom Brokaw , talk about tortured language .
What 's going on here ?
MR. FRIEDMAN : Signs of the apocalypse .
I mean , really .
MR. BROKAW : It 's stunning to me .
I come from a time and a place in America where it would be thrilling to have a president of the United States address your school about the importance of studying and staying in school .
And this president , whatever else you think about his political philosophy , is a symbol of working hard , coming from difficult circumstances and getting to where he is in part because of education .
I think it 's so ripe for satire , it 's unbelievable .
The superintendent of the Gettysburg Public School System said today that they have devised a plan for students to be shielded from a President Abraham Lincoln who will be coming to make an address .
Look , that is the most tortured thing I can possibly imagine , what we just read there .
It sounds like East Germany trying to form some restrictions on people leaving the eastern sector to go into the western sector .
I think it 's perfectly appropriate for parents to say , " I do n't want my child to hear that .
I would rather keep them out or put them in a different school that day . "
But this is completely out of control , in my judgment .
And it 's not -- it 's not partisan .
I mean , if -- when I was a student or when my children were in school ...
MR. GREGORY : Right .
MR. BROKAW : ... if it had been Dwight Eisenhower or John Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson or Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan or George Bush , the idea of hearing a president of the United States saying we should study hard and that 's how we advance and we all need to get in on , on this , I think is an appropriate message .
MR. GREGORY : Mayor Giuliani , you ran for president and one of the things that I 've noticed in my experience covering a Republican president , George W. Bush , is the lack of respect for the institution of the presidency .
Whether it 's people saying during Bush 's time , " Hey , he 's not my president . "
Well , no , yes , he is .
Does that trouble you ?
MR. GIULIANI : Yes , it does , and Tom is right .
But the difference is we looked at President Eisenhower or President Reagan , even up to about that point , even President Bush 41 differently .
There 's a lack of respect for the president , there 's a lack of respect for politicians .
And David Axelrod said , " Well , this is n't politics . "
Everything the president does nowadays is politics , for better or worse .
And I think that 's what you 're seeing .
You 're seeing people distrust the president 's motives or the administration 's motives .
It 's not just about the speech , it 's about the lesson plan .
I think it 's unfortunate and I think , you know , what 's the -- it almost seems a shame to say what 's the harm in a president speaking to a group of children .
FMR . REP .
FORD : I wish when I was in fourth ...
MR. GIULIANI : I think , I think the president should be given the opportunity to do it .
MR. FRIEDMAN : But David , you know , you said , it 's a firestorm .
And we live in the age of firestorms .
You know , today , or this week , it 's the president speaking in school .
What it needs is for people to stand up and say that 's flat out stupid , OK ?
That 's flat out stupid what you 're talking about .
The president of the United States , addressing schoolchildren in this country to study hard , work hard because that 's the way you advance in today 's global economy .
And instead of that , we kind of dance around it , you know .
It 's flat out stupid .

Eighteen Reasons Why You Should NOT Vaccinate Your Children Against The Flu This Season
by Bill Sardi
Recently by Bill Sardi : A Fatal Heart Attack Can Occur With Normal Coronary Arteries
This year it is more important that you protect your children and loved ones from the flu vaccines than influenza itself .
Here are the reasons :
1 . This flu is simply another flu .
It is not unusually deadly .
In fact , the H1N1 swine flu in circulation is less deadly than many other influenza outbreaks .
The first 1000 confirmed swine flu cases in Japan and China produced zero deaths .
The Centers for Disease Control alleges 36,000 Americans succumb to the flu each year , but so far , since March through August of 2009 ( 6 months ) , the swine flu has been attributed to ~ 500 — 600 deaths in the US .
The swine flu of 2009 has already swept through the Southern Hemisphere ’s flu season without alarm .
Only exaggerated reports have been issued by the World Health Organization regarding hospitalizations required during the flu season in South American countries .
Getting exposed to influenza and developing natural antibodies confers resistance for future flu outbreaks .
Artificially boosting antibodies by exposure to flu viruses in vaccines is more problematic than natural exposure .
Americans have been exposed to the H1N1 swine flu throughout the summer of 2009 with far fewer deaths and hospitalizations than commonly attributed to the seasonal flu .
2. Health authorities tacitly admit prior flu vaccination programs were of worthless value .
This is the first time both season and pandemic flu vaccines will be administered .
Both seasonal flu and swine flu vaccines will require two inoculations .
This is because single inoculations have failed to produce sufficient antibodies .
Very young children and older frail adults , the high - risk groups in the population , may not produce sufficient antibodies in response to the flu vaccine .
This is an admission that prior flu vaccines were virtually useless .
The same people who brought you the ineffective vaccines in past years are bringing you this year ’s new vaccines .
Can you trust them this time ?
3 . In addition to failure to produce sufficient antibodies , this swine flu vaccine is brought to you by the same people who have n’t been able to adequately produce a seasonal flu vaccine that matches the flu strain in circulation .
In recent years flu vaccination has been totally worthless because the strains of the flu in circulation did not match the strain of the virus in the vaccines .
Authorities claim the prevalent flu strain in circulation in mid-September ’09 is the H1N1 swine flu , which appears to be milder than past seasonal influenza in circulation .
If this data is correct , why receive the season flu shot this year ?
4 . The vaccines will be produced by no less than four different manufacturers , possibly with different additives ( called adjuvants ) and manufacturing methods .
The two flu inoculations may be derived from a multi- dose vial and in a crisis , and in short supply , it will be diluted to provide more doses and then adjuvants must be added to trigger a stronger immune response .
Adjuvants are added to vaccines to boost production of antibodies but may trigger autoimmune reactions .
Some adjuvants are mercury ( thimerosal ) , aluminum and squalene .
Would you permit your children to be injected with lead ?
Lead is very harmful to the brain .
Then why would you sign a consent form for your kids to be injected with mercury , which is even more brain - toxic than lead ?
Injecting mercury may fry the brains of American kids .
5 . This is the first year mock vaccines have been used to gain FDA approval .
Mock vaccines are made to gain approval of the manufacturing method and then the prevalent virus strain in circulation is added just days before it is actually placed into use .
Do n’t subject your children to experimental vaccines .
Yes , these vaccines have been tested on healthy kids and adults , but they are not the same vaccines your children will be given .
Those children with asthma , allergies , type I diabetes , etc. are at greater risk for side effects .
Children below the age of 2 years do not have a sufficient blood — brain barrier developed and are subject to chronic brain infections that emanate into symptoms that are called autism .
Toddlers should not be subjected to injected viruses .
6. Over-vaccination is a common practice now in America .
American children are subjected to 29 vaccines by the age of two .
This means a little bit of disease is being injected into young children continually during their most formative years !
Veterinarians have backed off of repeat vaccination in dogs because of observed side effects .
7 . Health officials want to vaccinate women during pregnancy , subjecting the fetal brain to an intentional biological assault .
A recent study showed exposure flu viruses among women during pregnancy provoke a similar gene expression pattern in the fetus as that seen in autistic children .
This is a tacit admission that vaccines , which inject a little bit of influenza into humans , causes autism .
8. Modern medicine has no explanation for autism , despite its continued rise in prevalence .
Yet autism is not reported among Amish children who go unvaccinated .
Beware the falsehoods of modern medicine .
9 . School kids are likely to receive nasally - administered vaccines ( Flu - Mist ) that require no needle injection .
But this form of live vaccine produces viral shedding which will surely be transmitted to family members .
What a way to start an epidemic !
10 .
This triple reassortment virus appears to be man made .
The H1N1 swine flu virus of 2009 coincidentally appeared in Mexico on the same week that President Nicolas Sarkozy of France visited Mexican president Felipe Calderon , to announce that France intends to build a multi-million dollar vaccine plant in Mexico .
An article written by Ron Maloney of the Seguin , Texas Gazette - Enterprise newspaper announces a " rehearsal for a pandemic disaster " scheduled for May 2 , 2009 .
The article says : " Guadalupe County emergency management and their counterparts around the country are preparing for just such a scenario … "
This means county health authorities across the U.S. had been preparing a rehearsal for mass vaccinations prior to the announced outbreak in Mexico .
Virologists admit this part swine flu / part avian flu / part human flu virus must have taken time to develop .
But it somehow was n’t detected by hundreds of flu monitoring stations across the globe .
On April 24 , 2009 Dr. John Carlo , Dallas County Medical Director , alludes that the H1N1 strain of the Swine flu as possibly being engineered in a laboratory .
He says : " This strain of swine influenza that ’s been cultured in a laboratory is something that ’s not been seen anywhere actually in the United States and the world , so this is actually a new strain of influenza that ’s been identified . "
( Globe & Mail , Canada )
11 . Recall the swine flu scare of 1976 .
In a politically charged atmosphere where Gerald Ford was seeking election to the Presidency , the swine flu suddenly appeared at a military base .
Vaccine was produced and millions of Americans were vaccinated .
But the vaccine was worse than the disease , causing hundreds of cases of Guillain Barre syndrome and a few deaths .
In a replay of the past , the White House is directly involved in promoting the H1N1 2009 swine flu vaccine .
The federal government will use federal funds to pay off schools to administer vaccines , promote vaccination via highway billboards and TV advertisements , and conduct military - style mass inoculations in such rapid fashion that if side effects occur , it will be too late .
The masses will have been vaccinated already .
Over $ 9 billion has been allotted by the federal government to develop and deliver an unproven and experimental flu vaccine .
Do n’t be a guinea pig for the government .
12 . Researchers are warning that over -use of the flu vaccine and anti-flu drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can apply genetic pressure on flu viruses and then they are more likely to mutate into a more deadly strain .
US health authorities want 70 % of the public to be vaccinated against the flu this ’09 season , which is more than double the vaccination percentage of any prior flu season .
This would certainly apply greater genetic pressure for the flu to mutate into a more virulent strain .
13 . Most seasonal influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus strains tested from the United States and other countries are now resistant to Tamiflu ( oseltamivir ) .
Tamiflu has become a nearly worthless drug against seasonal flu .
According to data provided by the Centers for Disease Control , among 1148 seasonal flu samples tested , 1143 ( 99.6 % ) were resistant to Tamiflu !
14 .
As the flu season progresses the federal government may coerce or mandate Americans to undergo vaccination .
France has already ordered enough vaccine to inoculate their entire population and has announced that vaccination will be mandatory .
The US appears to be waiting to announce mandatory vaccination at a later date when it can scare the public into consenting to the vaccine .
The federal government is reported to be hiring people to visit homes of unvaccinated children .
This sounds like the Biblical account of Pharaoh attempting to eradicate all the young Israelite baby boys .
Must we hide our babies now ?
15 . Public health authorities have cried wolf every flu season to get the public to line up for flu shots .
Health authorities repeatedly publish the bogus 36,000 annual flu - related deaths figure to scare the public into getting flu shots .
But that figure is based on the combined deaths from pneumonia in the elderly and the flu .
Maybe just 5000 — 6000 or so flu - related deaths occur annually , mostly among individuals with compromised immune systems , the hospitalized , individuals with autoimmune disease or other health problems .
As stated above , the swine flu in full force has only resulted in ~500 — 600 deaths in the first six months in circulation and it is far more dreaded by public health authorities than the seasonal flu .
The Centers for Disease Control issues a purchase order for flu vaccines and then serves as the public relations agency to get the public to pay for the vaccines .
Out of a population of 325 million Americans , only 100 million doses of flu vaccine have been administered each year and no epidemic has erupted among the unvaccinated .
16 .
The news media is irresponsible in stirring up unfounded fear over this coming flu season .
Just exactly how ethical is it for newspapers to publish reports that a person has died of the swine flu when supposedly thousands die of the flu annually ?
In the past the news media has n’t chosen to publicize each and every flu - related death , but this time it has chosen to frighten the public .
Why ?
Examine the chart below .
The chart shows that the late flu season of 2009 peaked in week 23 ( early June ) and has dissipated considerably .
While every childhood flu - related death should be considered tragic , and the number of flu - related pediatric deaths in 2009 is greater than prior flu seasons as a percentage , in real numbers it is not a significant increase .
See chart below :
According to data provided by the Centers for Disease Control , for week 34 ending August 29 , 2009 , there were 236 hospitalizations and 37 deaths related to the flu .
That would represent just 5 hospitalizations and less than one death per State , which is " below the epidemic threshold . "
17 . Public health officials are irresponsible in their omission of any ways to strengthen immunity against the flu .
No options outside of problematic vaccines and anti-flu drugs are offered , despite the fact there is strong evidence that vitamins C and D activate the immune system and the trace mineral selenium prevents the worst form of the disease where the lungs fill up with fluid and literally drown a flu- infected person .
The only plausible explanation as to why the flu season typically peaks in winter months is a deficiency of sunlight - produced vitamin D. Protect your family .
Arm your immune system with vitamins and trace minerals .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Washington Mutual is long gone , but its lax lending could haunt us for years .
The Seattle - based institution collapsed in the largest - ever U.S. bank failure last September .
WaMu ran out of cash after business customers , unnerved by the implosion of Lehman Brothers , withdrew their uninsured deposits .
After the chaos surrounding Lehman 's demise , WaMu was put to rest with little fuss .
Regulators seized the nation 's sixth - biggest bank on a Thursday night -- a departure from the customary Friday -- and sold it to JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) for $ 1.9 billion .
The move wiped out WaMu's 56,000 shareholders of record and left bondholders nursing billions of dollars in losses .
But the WaMu deal spared the federal deposit insurance fund and thus was , unlike so many federal actions over the past year , an unalloyed positive for taxpayers .
" That was a good outcome , " said Chip MacDonald , a banking lawyer at Jones Day in Atlanta .
Given the financial panic that followed Lehman 's collapse and the rescue of AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , he said , " it could have gone the other way . "
Even so , Americans will be paying for some years for the ill - advised loans made earlier this decade by WaMu and like - minded peers such as Wachovia .
Defaults on the exotic mortgages the firms specialized in have been high , and they could rise even further in coming months as payments jump for some borrowers .
That should add to the stress on the banking system , in the housing markets and in foreclosure - riddled communities .
" We 're still waiting to see how the Wachovia and Washington Mutual portfolios play out , " said Brian Olasov , who studies the banking industry as managing director at law firm McKenna Long & Aldridge .
" We 've got a big bulge in resets still to come . "
WaMu and Wachovia , now part of Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , helped stoke the housing bubble by issuing tens of billions of dollars of so - called option adjustable rate mortgages .
Option ARMs , as they are known , were typically made with little or no documentation and allowed borrowers to underpay in early years -- at the expense of much higher monthly payments later .
These loans helped inflate the housing bubble in then - hot markets such as California by allowing borrowers to stretch well beyond their incomes to bet on house price gains .
When the market turned , these loans began defaulting at a rapid clip , leaving the lenders with huge losses .
JPMorgan took $ 31 billion in writedowns when it acquired WaMu , and Wells took a $ 24 billion hit on its Wachovia loans when it completed that purchase .
The writedowns will limit the damage to the banks .
But that may not prevent borrowers from having their loans reset to higher interest rates or " recast " to higher monthly payments , based on the rate at which principal is paid down .
Some $ 700 billion of option ARMs were written in the U.S. between 2004 and 2007 .
Most option ARMs are set to recast after five years -- meaning that the first wave of higher payments is hitting borrowers this year .
WaMu -- which wrote $ 133 billion worth of option ARMs when house prices were at their peak between 2005 and 2007 -- said in its annual report last year that 13 % of its option ARM loans are due to recast this year .
The bulk of recasts are due to take place between next year and 2012 .
Recasts often lead to defaults because the banks ' option ARM portfolios embody the worst aspects of the housing bubble .
Wachovia , which acquired its option ARM portfolio in its misguided 2006 acquisition of California thrift Golden West Financial and made the loans under the Pick - a - Pay brand , had $ 120 billion of Pick - a - Pay mortgages on its books at the end of 2007 .
Two - thirds of Wachovia 's Pick - a- Pay loans were made in the bubble states of California and Florida , which have suffered from the steepest price declines and the highest foreclosure rates .
Two - thirds of borrowers as of Dec. 31 were using the minimum payment option -- the one that results in their paying less than the full amount of interest due and having the balance added to the loan .
Six loans in seven were written without documenting the borrower 's income or assets .
Option ARMs written by all banks largely share those features , though Wachovia 's loans stand out in one important way : they are n't scheduled to recast until they are 10 years old , which should keep low monthly payments in place into the middle of next decade .
Accordingly , Wells Fargo said in its annual report this year that it expects recasts on just $ 106 million of loans in 2009 and 2010 , and $ 316 million in 2011 - 2012 .
Still , Wachovia was just one player in a once - crowded field that included the likes of Countrywide , now owned by Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , and BankUnited and IndyMac -- two of the biggest bank failures of the past two years .
And while officials have been trying to get lenders to modify mortgages to slow the foreclosure surge , real progress has been hard to come by .
" A lot of people are going to be facing payment shock , " said Olasov .
" There 's a lot of troubled real estate debt in the banks , and there 's no easy answer . "

Given the BotU Special Post for the MESSENGER
Flyby , I thought this would be a great supplemental post .
Some Cool Background
Imagine you ’re looking at a bug flying around an outdoor light bulb at night .
Let ’s say you ’re looking at it from a distance which is always greater than the distance the bug is from the bulb .
Wow .
It ’s a really interesting bug you ’ve never seen before , and you want to share the experience with a friend , or ( in my case ) your son or daughter .
I might say “ Hey Jordi !
Check out this really cool bug ! ”
He ’d say , “ Daddy , where ? ? ”
Ok , now I ’ve got to tell him where to look .
What would you say ?
How about : “ over there , near that light bulb . ”
Well this is EXACTLY the situation with the planet Mercury for earthbound observers .
Mercury is orbiting the Sun and we ’re looking at it from Earth , which is at a greater distance from the Sun than Mercury is from the Sun .
So if you want to see Mercury in your sky , you need to look … near the Sun .
Anybody see a problem with that ?
The Sun is a pretty high wattage light bulb , and if it ’s up in the sky , you ’re not going to see Mercury or the stars for that matter .
They ’re up there with the Sun but their light is absolutely swamped by the sunlight illuminating our atmosphere .
Just so you know , the Sun light bulb is General Electric model # big01 bertha , and its wattage is 383,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Watts .
It is also guaranteed for another nearly 5 billion years of operation .
Handle with care .
Now back to the bug .
So Jordi takes a look in the direction of the light bulb , and he sees the bug whenever it ’s off to the side of the bulb .
When the bug is in front of the bulb , it ’s lost in the bulb ’s light .
So that ’s the secret to seeing Mercury in the sky !
There are times when Mercury is far enough to the side of the Sun , so that it can be seen above the horizon — because the pesky Sun is below the horizon .
The positions of Mercury and Earth in their orbits have to be just right so that we can see Mercury either BEFORE sunrise or AFTER sunset .
Now for the way cool part .
It ’s that time right now !
While MESSENGER is flying by Mercury you can see the planet in the east before dawn !
How To See Mercury Before Sunrise September 29 Through October 1
The Graphic above is taken from This Week ’s Planet Roundup in Alan MacRobert ’s column This Week ’s Sky at a Glance , at Sky & Telescope magazine .
I just spoke to Alan to get some pointers for Mercury viewing to pass on to you .
Here ’s the poop :
• The graphic shows the situation at 40 degrees north latitude but it ’s pretty much the same for the entire continental US ( e.g. , Bangor , Maine : 44 degrees ; Miami , Florida : 25 degrees ) , and for the same latitudes around the globe .
• You need to look about 45 minutes before your local sunrise .
Any closer to sunrise and the sky will already be too bright .
So you need to get your local sunrise time .
How ?
You can use the Sky & Telescope online Almanac or see if it is provided in your local paper .
• You need to look due east .
How can you tell if you do n’t know which way to look ?
Due east will be the brightest area of the sky on the eastern horizon , because Big Bertha ( the Sun ) is about to rise over there .
If you ’re one of those folks that likes to plan in advance , so you need to know the direction of “ due east ” right now , well here ’s a plan .
Go to Google maps , put in your address , or the address of the site from where you ’ll be looking , select “ Satellite ” view , zoom in until you see a recognizable building or landmark , and note that NORTH is up on the map .
• Mercury will be low in the sky , only about 10 degrees above the horizon , so you need to view from a spot where due east is unobstructed by trees and buildings .
• Venus is going to really help you .
It will be a bright star - like object , but it wo n’t be twinkling like the stars ( planets do n’t ) .
You can see in the graphic at the top of the page that Mercury will be below Venus .
Mercury will be far dimmer than Venus , but can be seen with the unaided eye .
BINOCULARS will help .
When you look at Mercury , you might recal that YOU’RE LOOKING AT THE MESSENGER SPACECRAFT TOO .
You ’re looking at history , only from really really far away .
So what — it ’s still history !

Cybercriminals are using smart Trojans to steal huge sums of money from online bank accounts without being detected , security firm Finjan has revealed .
A recent series of thefts indicates the cybercriminals are using increasingly sophisticated techniques to ransack bank accounts .
The criminals ' internet domain was shut down when Finjan researchers alerted police after they found evidence of illegal money transfers on a Ukraine - based server .
Logs on the server showed the cybercriminals had stolen € 300,000 from German bank accounts in 22 days .
At this rate , cybercriminals could steal € 5 m in a year .
The cybercriminals used the LuckySploit toolkit to exploit vulnerabilities in the browsers of victims through both fake and compromised legitimate websites .
The URLZone bank Trojan toolkit was used to control the money transfers from the victims ' bank accounts via " money mule " laundering accounts to the cybercriminals .
The Trojans used in the attacks were designed to steal bank login details , steal money without raising alarms and then cover their tracks .
" This is the first time we have seen attacker use Trojans that contain logic to decide how much money to steal , " said Yuval Ben-Itzhak , chief technology officer at Finjan .
The researchers uncovered code in the malware that adjusts the amount of money transferred to a money mule account based on the current balance .
" The code ensures that the amounts stolen fall below the thresholds of anti-fraud systems used by banks , " said Ben -Itzhak .
Cybercriminals are likely to increase their use of such techniques for bank fraud , which is a very big problem , he said .
" The scale of losses due to internet banking fraud is largely hidden because there is no law that requires disclosure by banks that prefer not to talk about it , " he said .
The Trojans also make sure that targeted bank accounts are not left with a zero or negative balance to avoid triggering alerts on anti-fraud systems , he said .
Researchers even found code in the Trojans used to specify to which money mule accounts the money should be sent .
The Trojans use money mule accounts only a limited number of times to avoid detection by anti-fraud systems .
" Another first is that the Trojans are able to deliver fake bank web pages to users that hide the thefts by displaying unaltered balances , " said Ben -Itzhak .
By the time victims discover their accounts have been raided , the funds have been safely sent to the cybercriminals through their money mule network , he said .
The cybercriminals behind the attacks were getting the money using a well developed network of mules who thought they were working for a legitimate company .
According to Ben - Itzhak most mules allow their bank accounts to receive funds from the Trojans and forward the money without realising they are helping criminals .
Anyone receiving job offers should check if the company exists before accepting by conducting a few simple online searches to see if the company is real , he said .
" If the employer asks you to use your bank account or to open a new one , drop the offer and move forward , " said Ben -Itzhak .

The last day of campaigning is taking place ahead of Thursday 's presidential election in Afghanistan , which Taliban militants have threatened to disrupt .
Notorious ex-warlord Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum endorsed incumbent President Hamid Karzai at a rally after flying in from exile in Turkey .
Mr Karzai faces over 30 challengers but is seen as the frontrunner in the race .
Two of Mr Karzai 's main rivals , who formerly served under him as ministers , also held their own final rallies .
Mass rallies
In the capital Kabul , former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah , addressed a crowd of 10,000 supporters , many wearing blue shifts or waving blue flags .
The return of ex-warlord Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum has alarmed the US The ex-Finance Minister , Ashraf Ghani , addressed a rally of 5,000 in the eastern Nangarhar province .
Mr Ghani , who is running on a campaign of economic development , vowed to replace the " corrupt government with a legitimate one " , according to French news agency , AFP .
Meanwhile in the north of the country , thousands of Afghans attended a rally led by infamous warlord Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum , a key ally of Mr Karzai and his former military chief - of - staff .
" We need to go with Hamid Karzai into the future , " Gen Dostum told cheering supporters in Shiberghan , his home city .
The UN and the US both expressed concern at the timing of Gen Dostum 's return and any prospective role he may have in government .
In a live televised election debate on Sunday , Mr Karzai defended his alliances with several Afghan warlords , saying they served the interests of national unity .
Taliban threat
The election is taking place amid mounting violence in the country , with Taliban militants threatening to harm anyone who takes part .
There are fears that the turnout could be low as a result .
Afghan elections : Main candidates
In pictures : Campaigning closes Deaths take UK Afghan toll to 201 A survey by the BBC's Afghan service suggests the government has limited or no control in 30 % of the country .
The survey is based on assessments by reporters in the field who found that in 4 % of Afghanistan 's districts , the government provides no security or services .
The majority of them are in the south , where most Taliban attacks have taken place .
A spokesman for President Karzai said the government did not agree with the findings and there were security problems in just a few districts .
The BBC's Ian Pannell in Afghanistan says that there is evidence of corruption , but above all it is the ongoing war with the Taliban - within at least a third of the country - that makes this election far from normal .
But having invested so heavily in terms of time , money and even lives , Western officials are likely to declare the vote a success - whatever the flaws and challenges , he adds .

Popular social news website Reddit has stopped the spread of a cross - site scripting ( XSS ) worm that hit the site on Monday .
The XSS worm spread via comments on the site , originally from the account of a user called xssfinder .
Reddit failed to filter out JavaScript in some cases , specifically when a user hovered his or her mouse over a link , a factor the miscreants behind xssfinder 's account exploited to run a proof of concept attack .
In an apparent test attack , xssfinder posted a comment linked to malicious scripts on a thread called " Guy on a bike in New York ' high fives ' people hailing cabs " .
Users reading the comment ended up sending massive amounts of spam comments onto other Reddit threads .
Reddit administrators moved in promptly to close the vulnerability and restore order before things got out of hand .
Throughout the confusion the site was never down .
xssfinder 's account was deleted soon after the attack began , reports Finnish web security firm F - Secure .

Steven J. Rosen ’s defamation lawsuit against the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) is now entering a critical phase .
A series of cross -filings stakes out the critical court terrain .
Rosen intends to show that obtaining and leveraging classified U.S. government information in the service of Israel is common practice at AIPAC .
He claims it was unfair for AIPAC to fire and malign him in the press after he was indicted on espionage charges in 2005 .
AIPAC ’s defense team is committed to getting the case thrown out on technicalities before it goes to trial early next year .
On March 2 , 2009 , Rosen filed the civil lawsuit against his former employer , directors , and an outside public relations firm for libel and slander .
Rosen , AIPAC ’s former foreign policy chief , seeks $ 5 million in damages from AIPAC , and punitive damages of $ 500,000 from each former board member , for a total claim of $ 21 million .
AIPAC made statements to the news media Rosen believes were " knowingly false and defamatory and issued in reckless disregard . "
AIPAC fired Rosen and fellow employee Keith Weissman after they were criminally indicted under the 1917 Espionage Act in 2005 .
Both were caught up in an FBI sting operation receiving classified information from Department of Defense employee Col.
Lawrence Franklin , who pled guilty and turned state ’s witness .
After years of pretrial maneuvers during which presiding Judge T.S. Ellis steadily raised the standards for conviction , U.S. government prosecutors reluctantly dropped [ . pdf ] their case in May 2009 .
AIPAC ’s spokesman told the New York Times in April 2005 that Rosen ’s actions differed from " the conduct that AIPAC expects from its employees . "
On July 7 , 2005 , the spokesperson told the New Yorker that " Rosen [ and his colleagues ] were dismissed because they engaged in conduct that was not part of their jobs and because this conduct did not comport with the standards that AIPAC expects and requires of its employees . "
Rosen ’s legal counsel David H. Shapiro gruffly advised AIPAC ’s attorney Thomas L. McCally that he would be seeking " serious discovery " on Rosen ’s behalf during a status hearing on June 5 , 2009 .
It is this sort of public intrusion guided by knowledgeable insiders , following already devastating FBI raids , that AIPAC probably wants to avoid at all costs .
Ironically , Rosen ’s civil lawsuit , like the failed government prosecution , hinges on proving that circulating classified information is common practice inside AIPAC .
AIPAC ’s counsel originally filed an immediate motion to dismiss [ .pdf ] on May 13 , 2009 , asserting that Rosen failed to show " factual allegations " that could be considered in any way defamatory .
McCally also took Rosen to task for filing outside the one - year statute of limitations for defamation and suing AIPAC board members who have various immunities under District of Columbia statutes .
In a July 8 , 2009 , rebuttal [ .pdf ] , Rosen states his clear belief that the most relevant issue was AIPAC dumping two employees to save itself from being criminally indicted as a corporation .
“ On February 17 , 2005 , only two weeks after awarding Mr. Rosen the $ 7,000 special bonus for excellence in job performance , the AIPAC Board of Directors placed him on involuntary leave .
This was done immediately after AIPAC was threatened by the Justice Department in a meeting between AIPAC ’s counsel and its Executive Director Howard Khor and federal prosecutors on February 15 , 2005 .
There the lead federal prosecutor stated that , ‘ We could make real progress and get AIPAC out from under all of this , ’ if AIPAC showed more cooperation with the government .
On February 16 , 2005 , AIPAC ’s counsel said that the lead federal prosecutor ‘ is fighting with the FBI to limit the investigation to Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman and to avoid expanding it . ’
This warning implied that AIPAC ’s Executive Director and the AIPAC organization as a whole could become targets . ”
Rosen ’s lengthy – even rambling – rebuttal argues “ no expressed standards existed at AIPAC ” regarding the receipt and sharing of information from government officials .
Rosen insists that in spite of AIPAC denials the information he provided from “ intelligence ” sources were passed to AIPAC ’s president with full disclosure of their origins .
In an Aug. 7 , 2009 , court filing , AIPAC fired back claiming Rosen “ has misdirected his anger ” by suing AIPAC rather than the “ government agency that directly investigated him and indicted him for purported criminal activities . ”
AIPAC claims Rosen failed to demonstrate AIPAC ’s intent to defame under the higher standards established for public figures like Rosen .
“ Malice is only required for public and limited purpose public figures to establish a defamation suit .
Even with the heightened standard required of public figures , Plaintiff has not shown any …. ”
AIPAC added insult to injury , claiming that “ by any objective or subjective measure , being subject of a criminal indictment is not conduct an employer expects of any employee . ”
Rosen returned fire on Aug. 24 , 2009 , claiming ample legal precedents for allowing aggrieved parties to file lawsuits outside normal statutes of limitations for extenuating circumstances – in this case Rosen ’s criminal indictment and drawn - out pretrial maneuvers .
Echoing the June 5 , 2009 , courtroom showdown threats , Rosen repeats he “ will be in a position to prove his allegations with evidence following discovery . ”
Rosen ’s quest for elusive justice is oddly parallel to that of his former government prosecutors .
They only wanted to prove the straightforward results of an FBI sting operation , during which Rosen both received and transmitted classified national defense information .
The FBI and DOJ never expected a media circus , ongoing accusations of anti-Semitism , claims that U.S. and Israeli foreign policies are “ the same , ” and speculation that their entire prosecution was covert attempt to overturn the 1st Amendment .
Rosen and former AIPAC chief lobbyist Doug Bloomfield have threatened to prove that AIPAC regularly dabbles in classified information - trading and sometimes even functions as a foreign agent – at least up until the moment of a confidential out - of - court financial settlement .
If the court lets Rosen proceed to discovery , proving these contentions should n’t be very difficult .
Bloomfield worked at AIPAC around the time it was circulating a classified government report outlining the U.S. Trade Representative ’s secret negotiating position for the U.S. - Israel Free Trade Area .
With such inside information about precisely where the skeletons are buried , the duo should have no problem revealing AIPAC to the world as a hotbed of espionage and covert action .
Broadcasting Rosen ’s unsavory activities to the world under such circumstances probably was defamation .
Thrashing AIPAC in court is not something Rosen and Bloomfield , as lifelong Israel lobbyists , would do gladly , but in their eyes the lobby ’s principle of reciprocity and motto of “ divided we fall ” has been badly battered by AIPAC ’s mistreatment of its former operatives .
Telling Rosen that he can’t recover due compensation just because his civil lawsuit was filed too late will surely seem a travesty of justice to the hard core of the lobby .
Americans , on the other hand , must continue to wait for the day that the DOJ finally begins enforcing sensible laws still on the books such as the Foreign Agents Registration Act , the Logan Act , the Commercial Espionage Act , and others that create foreign lobby accountability , improve policymaking , and preserve American industrial innovation .
The only current relief from AIPAC ’s onslaught against America may be that family legal troubles could delay its slow march to entangle the U.S. military in an ill - advised and costly attack on Israel ’s archnemesis , Iran .
“ I did n’t understand fully how difficult it was going to be , ” he added .
“ I do n’t go into a season hoping that just some things will work .
Everything has to work .
The stakes are very high .
The Met is at a moment when either it will continue to be the leading opera house or it wo n’t .
There ’s no middle ground . ”

To that end he has commissioned new productions , some of works seldom seen in New York ; signed up new singers , who do n’t just “ park and bark , ” as he puts it , but actually act ; and recruited directors from Broadway , like Bartlett Sher , and the movies , like Anthony Minghella , who died last year .
Mr. Bondy is a Swiss director of opera and theater , and though Mr. Zeffirelli recently called him “ third rate , ” his productions have a reputation for braininess and for stripping away clutter .
James Levine , the music director of the Met , likened his new “ Tosca ” to a Hitchcock movie .
Mr. Gelb ’s program was initially greeted with skepticism , if not hostility , by many opera buffs .
In his last job , as president of Sony ’s classical record division , where he recorded an album of arias by the soft - rocker Michael Bolton and where his greatest hit was the soundtrack for “ Titanic , ” purists saw him as a shameless panderer .
Mr. Gelb , who likes to point out that classical music used to be pop music , is unrepentant .
“ I have n’t really changed , ” he said .
“ The only thing that changed was the world I was working in .
I ’ve always tried to popularize classical music , and I ’m still doing it , only I do n’t work for a classical record company anymore . ”
And whatever his record at Sony , Mr. Gelb ’s Met career has by most reckonings been an almost immediate success .
The audience has both grown and become more youthful .
He has reached out to contemporary visual artists and begun a promising collaboration with André Bishop , the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater , to develop new work .
His program of showing selected operas on live high - definition television broadcasts has been tremendously popular , filling movie theaters both here and abroad .
There have been artistic misfires , like Mary Zimmerman ’s production last year of “ La Sonnambula , ” which set the opera as a play - within - a - play and was also hooted at on opening night .
But for the most part the Gelb vision has so won over the opera world that it ’s hard now to find anyone with something critical to say  at least on the record .
Most of the grumbling one hears these days is not about the merits of the new Met productions but about how expensive they are .
Since Mr. Gelb took over , the Met budget has increased by about $ 60 million .
The box office is up , but meanwhile personal and corporate donations , which the Met depends on to balance its budget , are down , thanks to the economy , and so is the value of its endowment .
The Met ’s projected deficit for next year is about $ 4 million .
From time to time in my work I come across a new level of bizarre behavior on the part of lenders .
I have previously written about how it never made sense to me that banks with mortgages or credit card companies would not work with their customers to try and work something out .
It always seemed to be more logical for the bank / credit card company to get a deal which would give them some money rather than none .
But for many years that was n’t even a real option for my clients .
I remember bluntly telling the lenders that if they did not do something to help my clients that they ’d have no choice but to do a bankruptcy and more often than not the response was basically ‘ go ahead and do it ’ .
As the economy got worse and the housing market tumbled , some banks started to make some meager moves towards working things out but more often than not they would n’t do anything .
At the same time the banks were finding that once they foreclosed on houses that they were suddenly liable for maintaining the property and that local governments were getting quite serious about enforcing those responsibilities .
The result was a pretty heavy burden to the banks and one of the solutions they arrived at was to tell the former homeowners to remain in the house , thus relieving the bank of a burden ( IE the person in the house would keep things in good condition ) .
I ’ve had a number of clients tell me about how they or their friends had spend two or three or six months in a property before being told to get out , and this was rent free .
Recently however I heard an even more bizarre turn on this scenario .
A homeowner was in trouble , could not afford their mortgage anymore and so they tried to work with the bank .
The bank refused to give ground and so eventually they moved to foreclose .
But they did not tell the homeowner to leave , and in fact allowed him to remain in the house for about eight months .
The next step though was completely unexpected .
The bank actually came to the homeowner and asked them if they wanted to BUY THE HOUSE BACK .
They offered to sell them the property for about half of what the foreclosure amount had been and helped them to secure the loan .
So this person was foreclosed on but never left the house and now they have a mortgage payment that is about half of what the old payment was .
I can see where it was a reasonable deal from the bank ’s perspective .
Rather than renting the property they now passed all responsibility to the new owner and they did n’t have to go through the costs and time of putting up for sale and paying a realtor .
But the obvious question is why did n’t they simply start at the beginning and modify the original mortgage ?
That would have saved them the cost of the foreclosure and any costs of redoing the loan , etc .
I would like to think that the banks are getting smarter about things but I am starting to suspect that this may just be the first of many such sales .
The delay in autumnal leaf coloration and leaf fall in trees is caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) in the atmosphere and not by increased global temperatures , suggests a new study by researchers at the University of Southampton .
In recent years , woodland autumnal colour changes have been occurring later in the season whilst re-greening in spring has been occurring earlier .
During the last 30 years across Europe , autumnal senescence – the process of plant aging where leaves discolour and then fall – has been delayed by 1.3 - 1.8 days a decade .
To date , this has been explained by global warming , with increasing temperatures causing longer growing seasons .
However , while a strong correlation has been observed between increased global temperatures and earlier spring re-greening and bud break , the correlation between autumn leaf colour change and fall and temperature trends in 14 European countries is weak .
Over the 30 years that progressive delays in autumnal senescence have been observed , atmospheric CO 2 has risen by 13.5 per cent .
Experimental studies show that increased atmospheric CO 2 affects plant physiology and function , influencing a myriad of processes .
The Southampton researchers undertook two large forest ecosystem experiments in which poplar ( Populus ) trees in separate plots were exposed to either ambient or elevated levels of CO 2 from planting to maturity .
The elevated concentration was at 550 parts per million , proposed as representative of concentrations that may occur in 2050 .
Changes in the tree canopy were measured by remote sensing .
The trees exposed to elevated CO 2 retained their leaves for longer and also experienced a smaller decline in end of season chlorophyll content , resulting in a greener autumn canopy relative to that in ambient CO 2 .
Professor Gail Taylor , of the University ’s School of Biological Sciences , explains :
‘ The research data provide compelling evidence in terms of both the leaf and canopy that autumnal senescence in such forest ecosystems will be delayed as the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 continues to rise , independent of increased temperatures .
‘ Photosynthesis and canopy greenness are maintained for longer in elevated CO 2 .
This is because a CO 2 rich atmosphere allows the tree to generate carbon rich compounds that are known to prolong the life of leaves .
These compounds may have a positive effect for carbon balance and stress tolerance but may also have a negative effect on the control of dormancy .
‘ When trees keep their leaves for longer , they continue to photosynthesise but trees also need to set bud and if they do n’t do that , it makes them susceptible to frost and other weather events .
A key question now is whether we should be selecting trees which are better adapted to coping with increasing levels of CO 2 , perhaps considering different varieties and species to plant , rather than using locally sourced seed , as is current practice , ’ she continues .

Al menos cinco sujetos que exigen hablar personalmente con el presidente Felipe Calder�n secuestraron un avi�n de Aerom�xico proveniente de Canc�n y amenazan con hacerlo estallar si no es atendido .
El vuelo 576 , con 104 pasajeros a bordo , aterriz� en el Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de M�xico y es vigilado por personal de la Secretar�a de Marina Armada de M�xico .
En un primer momento , la aeronave fue aislada en la pista 23 izquierda , cerca del bordo de Xochiaca ; sin embargo , fue trasladada a la parte final de la pista 5 izquierda , conocida como gota , que se utiliza para arrinconar a los aviones que tienen cualquier tipo de emergencia y as� alejarlos del edificio de la terminal y de los dem�s vuelos .
De acuerdo con informaci�n difundida en varias emisiones radiof�nicas , el presunto delincuente pidi� al capit�n del Boeing 737 dar siete vueltas alrededor de la ciudad de M�xico , lo que no pudo hacerse debido a limitaciones de combustible .
Seg�n los datos , los sujetos , presuntamente armados con explosivos pegados a su cuerpo con cinta canela , no pudo ingresar a la cabina de control del avi�n , porque �sta se encuentra sellada .
De acuerdo con la agenda del presidente Felipe Calder�n , el mandatario deber�a llegar a las 14:25 horas al Hangar Presidencial , desde donde saldr�a hacia Campeche para iniciar una gira de trabajo .
Los aviones que arribar�an a la terminal est�n siendo desviados a aeropuertos alternos , como el de Toluca , en el estado de M�xico .

After landing the coveted cover of Sports Illustrated magazine 's annual swimsuit issue , you can't blame Bar Refaeli for wanting to celebrate .
The Israeli supermodel graces the front cover of the 2009 issue in a barely - there bikini , tantalising male readers as she pulls down her bottoms to reveal her tan line .
Being chosen to model in the swimsuit issue is the considered a benchmark in any supermodel 's path to success and is seen by 66 million readers every year .
Members of the Cree aboriginal peoples are to join the Climate Camp protests in the City of London this week in an attempt to draw attention to corporate Britain 's " criminal " involvement in the tar sands of Canada .
Five representatives from the Cree First Nations are coming to co-ordinate their campaign against key players in the carbon - heavy energy sector with British environmentalists .
Eriel Tchekwie Deranger , from Fort Chipewyan , a centre of Alberta 's tar sands schemes , said : " British companies such as BP and Royal Bank of Scotland in partnership with dozens of other companies are driving this project , which is having such devastating effects on our environment and communities .
" It is destroying the ancient boreal forest , spreading open - pit mining across our territories , contaminating our food and water with toxins , disrupting local wildlife and threatening our way of life , " she said .
It showed British companies were complicit in " the biggest environmental crime on the planet " and yet very few people in Britain even knew it was happening , said Deranger .
She was speaking ahead of an annual Climate Camp that will be held for one week somewhere in Greater London from this Thursday .
The exact site of the camp has not been revealed as green organisers are worried that the police might move to thwart their plans if they are notified in advance .
BP and Shell are two of the major oil companies extracting oil from the tar sands .
The thick and sticky oil can only be removed from the sands by using a lot of water and power as well as producing far heavier CO 2 emissions .
RBS , now partly owned by the British government after its financial rescue , is also a target of environmentalists and aboriginals because it is seen as a major funder of such schemes .
The Climate Camp concept started with a protest outside the Drax coal - fired power station in North Yorkshire and was followed up by similar protests at Heathrow – against the proposed third runway – and Kingsnorth in Kent , where E.ON wants to construct a new coal - fired power station .
There was also a Climate Camp in April at Bishopsgate inside the City of London , which became linked with bad policing after a bystander died following a clash with a constable .
The tar sands are seen by many as a particularly dangerous project providing enough carbon to be released in total to tip the world into unstoppable climate change .
Shell was the first major European oil company to invest in the Canadian - based operations but BP followed under its chief executive , Tony Hayward .
The oil companies both dispute the amount of pollution caused by tar sands and insist they must be exploited if the world is not going to run out of oil .
But George Poitras , a former chief of the Mikisew Cree First Nation , said the so - called heavy oil schemes were violating treaty rights and putting the lives of locals at risk .
He said : " We are seeing a terrifyingly high rate of cancer in Fort Chipewyan , where I live .
We are convinced these cancers are linked to the tar sands development on our doorstep . "
As I have mentioned previously , I ’m working to port OpenBSD ’s net80211 layer , which is an IEEE 802.11-2007 WiFi stack , to Mac OS X .
Haiku , an open - source operating system , managed to do this last year for their own kernel .
So why is it taking us so long to do a similar thing for OS X ?
To start off , although it appears that the OS X kernel being partly based on BSD should make things easier , it actually makes it more complicated to attempt a port such as this .
Since almost half of the OS X kernel consists of FreeBSD code , there are lots of symbols predefined , like ifnet and mbuf .
Apple ’s own “ Kernel Programming Interface ” ( KPI s ) provide access to these data structures and functions through a slightly different API which is designed to prevent direct access .
Unfortunately , most of the code from other BSD kernels heavily relies on direct access ( most notable being the mbuf handling routines ) .
To top it off , several of these data structures have been slightly modified in the XNU kernel compared to their BSD counterparts , making their usage very risky .
Hence , simply including the source code for net80211 and some compatibility glue code ( like Haiku does ) would result in massive naming collisions between predefined structures and functions in the kernel vs. those redefined in the compatibility layer .
Apple already includes a port of the net80211 stack for their drivers for the Atheros wireless adapters .
Without access to that source code , it is difficult to figure out ( at least for me ) what approach they have taken .
My approach has been to convert the entire net80211 source code to C++ and wrap them in a namespace .
This will automatically cause all symbols to be prefixed with the namespace , hopefully avoiding collisions with their kernel counterparts .
This sounds easy enough , but for some things it just does n’t work .
The mbuf handling routines in net80211 make heavy use of direct access to the mbuf structure .
This is not possible in OS X ( or not easily possible ) .
OS X drivers use the mbuf_t structure and the mbuf KPI to manipulate mbufs .
Now , mbufs are used to store all network data coming in and going out of the system .
Thus , it is used extremely frequently .
The two ways to deal with this were to either :
Re-implement BSD ’s mbuf API and structures in our compatibility layer .
Bad option in my opinion because of the naming collisions , and more importantly , from a performance point of view , and being badly integrated with OS X ’s networking tools .
Wade through the hundreds of thousands of instances where mbuf s have been used in net80211 source code , and convert them to their mbuf_t KPI equivalents .
I chose the 2nd option as that was the only one which made sense , despite being extremely lengthy .
I was actually recommended this by Apple kernel engineers on the darwin - drivers mailing list .
So , the end result was to use Xcode ’s “ Find ” feature to find every single mbuf instance , and replace it with their mbuf_t equivalent , after understanding its context .
This was frustrating .
But thankfully it ’s done .
Here ’s an example snippet :
And here ’s the list of files which needed to be manually reviewed line by line ( compiler errors are not always useful ) to make sure every instance was properly converted :
The other issue was that a lot of functionality from OpenBSD ( e.g. kernel cryptography ) is not present in OS X ( it probably is present , but inaccessible from the KPI s ) .
So I included all of those .
There were also several undefined symbols which I defined as equivalents .
All in all , there is a compatibility layer for the compatibility layer :
For what it ’s worth , there probably is a much better and more elegant way to do this .
But sadly I am not knowledgeable enough to figure out how Apple / Atheros developers did it .
How I wish I could at least get a glimpse of their source code !
Ralink probably also uses the net80211 stack ( or something similar ) in the OS X drivers for their USB wifi adapter range .
A few days ago I tried to contact Ralink to get access to their source code ( in return for making their drivers Airport compatible ) , but have not received any reply yet .
Anyway , with most of this mechanical porting done , what remains is to write code to glue the net80211 information / function calls to IOKit ’s “ Airport ” interface , which is referred to as apple80211 in Kernel .
framework from Leopard and older .
Incidentally , Apple stopped supplying this particular set of header files from Snow Leopard onwards .
Recreating the proper headers for Snow Leopard was a challenge which deserves a post of its own .
Maybe later .
So that ’s a survey of the process and the difficulties so far .
This week I ’ll be working to finish off the “ compatibility layer ” for net80211 based drivers to access the hardware , and finally hooking it all up to parts of VoodooWireless so it can talk to Airport .
Hopefully this approach will work .
As is evident , I have not tested even a single line of all this code yet - simply because there are millions of nuts and bolts that all must fit in together before the whole thing will fly .
This month I ’m hoping it ’ll all start to take shape .
If not , well tough luck to us .
Postscript : I mainly wrote this post so that future developers who might want to pick up on this project after I leave , can get an idea of what work is being done and how it ’s intended to work .
Feel free to write to me at voodoo@mercurysquad.com if you have more technical questions ( do n’t write to ask “ how much longer ” or “ it does n’t work ” , though ) .
Thanks for reading !
Opera 10 , the newest version of the browser that 's arguably the most venerable one going , is now available in its final version .
It 's very much the product I reviewed in beta version back in June .
The most striking new feature is Turbo mode , which uses the same technology as the company 's Opera Mini phone browser to compress
Web pages and thereby speed up browsing on dial - up and other sluggish connections .
It 's noticeably zippier than standard mode , although its crunched - down images are pretty darn grainy .
The tradeoff is n't worth it if you 're completely gruntled with the speed of your Net connection , but I think I 'll keep it on hand for the next time I 'm on an unbearably slow public Wi -Fi network .
Other major new stuff includes tweaks to Tabs ( they can incorporate thumbnail previews ) and Opera 's speed - dial screen , which provides one - click access to your favorite sites .
As usual , one of the most notable things about Opera is its sheer volume of features - it incorporates an e-mail app and a BitTorrent client , as well as its own widget engine .
Oh , and the browser has a nicely minimalist new look that 's an improvement on its formerly busy - looking self .
This " final " version of Opera 10 is n't complete :
It lacks Unite , the interesting - but - controversial new feature that embeds a Web server in the browser .
Unite 's still a separate Opera Labs feature ; if it catches on with developers , it 'll be a bigger deal than any of Opera 10's other new features .
I 've been using and enjoying Opera 10 over the past few hours ; the OS X version is running smoothly on Snow Leopard , but the browser 's also available for Windows and Linux .
( I 've encountered one odd , minor bump :
When I try to edit a Google Docs document , I get a view - only version - but it includes a link to a fully - editable one . )
As much as I 'm enjoying the current Browser Wars 2.0 , I think that switching browsers is an act best done by folks who are basically dissatisfied with the browser they 've currently got .
Every browser is capable of handling typical browsing tasks , and they all do them in basically similar fashion .
But if you 're in the mood to try something new , give Opera 10 a whirl - especially if you 're still on dial - up .
( According to Google Analytics , only slightly under two percent of you are currently running Opera , which leaves an awful lot of you who might like it if you tried it . )

Rus -M launch vehicle
Previous chapter : ACTS / PPTS development during 2008
The Rus-M family of rockets , employing the RD - 180 engine on the first stage and the RD - 0146 engine on the second stage , as of April 2009 .
Variant 1 would use three inseparable boosters on the first stage .
Variant 2 would use five boosters , with the four strap - on boosters separating earlier in flight , while the central core booster would burn longer by thrusting less than its full capability during the initial phase of the flight and throttling up to full thrust upon separation of the four strap - on boosters .
Variant 3 would employ a stretched first stage for a larger propellant load .
A fourth variation of the vehicle , with a single first stage booster and an upper stage borrowed from the Soyuz 2 rocket , would also be possible ( not shown ) .
It could deliver six tons to low - Earth orbit .
All four variations would use the same launch facility in Vostochny .
Copyright © 2009 Anatoly Zak
One of the challenges Russian designers faced in developing a next - generation manned spacecraft in the first decade of the 21st century was the need for a new rocket to launch it .
Since the future ship replacing Soyuz would have to carry six instead of three crew members and weigh from 12 to 23 tons , it would need a much larger launch vehicle than the existing Soyuz rocket capable of carrying just seven tons to the low - Earth orbit .
Developers had few options to consider among existing rockets :
Although several ways of upgrading the Soyuz rocket had been evaluated in the middle of decade within the Soyuz - 2 - 3 and Soyuz - 3 programs , Russian space agency ultimately came to realize that the overall architecture of the Soyuz rocket was too obsolete for the new tasks of the 21st century ;
Any idea of using the existing Proton rocket , which did have the required lifting capacity , would be out of the question , since the vehicle used toxic propellants and the agency 's policy was to phase out the rocket as soon as the replacement Angara family became available ;
The Proton replacement -- the Angara rocket -- had been in development since the beginning of the 1990s and with considerable investments already committed to the project it was expected to fly its first mission in 2011 .
However the vehicle was primarily intended for delivering military and commercial satellites from its newly built launch pad in Plesetsk .
Giving the role of manned launcher to Angara would essentially leave the entire Russian rocket fleet in the hands of a single contractor -- Khrunichev enterprise , a clearly to be avoided " all eggs in one basket " strategy .
In the meantime , the existing " alternative " developer of the Soyuz rocket -- TsSKB Progress in Samara -- could be out of the job .
The Zenit rocket could carry the minimal mass considered for the next - generation spacecraft and it also provided a newer design than that of Soyuz and Proton .
It could potentially be upgraded for higher payloads .
However , after the collapse of the Soviet Union , the production of the vehicle ended up outside Russia , in Ukraine , making it politically unacceptable for the nation 's goal of maintaining independent access to space .
Organizing production of the Zenit in Russia could be considered , however it would require sizable investments , perhaps approaching the potential cost of developing a whole new rocket .
Pro and cons of various launch vehicle solutions for the next - generation spacecraft :
Rocket Pros Cons Soyuz Available , man-rated , good reliability record ; Low payload , obsolete architecture and systems ; Proton High payload capability ; Toxic propellants , to be replaced in 2010s by Angara ; Zenit Newer design , higher payload ; Manufactured outside Russia ; marginal payload capacity for lunar missions ; Angara Newest design , close to reaching first flight ;
Needs to be man-rated ; use in manned space flight would leave all Russian rocketry in the hands of a single contractor ; New vehicle ( Rus-M ) Can be custom - built for manned space flight goals with the newest available technologies ;
Can provide employment and capabilities backup to Angara ; Requires to be man-rated , requires a whole new launch infrastructure ; long development period ;
New launch site , transportation issues
By 2008 , the development of a whole new family of rockets for manned space flight had become attractive to the Russian government , especially in light of the decision in the previous year to build the new Vostochny launch site .
The strategic decision to place the space center in the Russian Far East brought up the issue of transporting the vehicles from industrial centers in western Russia .
The size of rocket stages would either have to be limited by the capabilities of railway transport , or the Russian government would have to commit to the development of a compatible air transportation system .
Finally , the third alternative would be the development of a whole new manufacturing base right there in the Far East .
Despite being probably the most expensive and economically difficult proposition , it would match the political goal of the Russian government to industrialize this isolated and sparsely populated region .
Ultimately , the Russian space agency made the pragmatic decision to keep the development of the rocket at the existing manufacturing base in the European part of Russia and to use traditional rail transport to deliver fully assembled stages of the vehicle to Vostochny .
Exotic ideas , like using dirigibles to transport oversized stages , were quickly rejected .
As a result , the diameter of rocket stages was limited to 3.8 meters and length to around 25 meters , to ensure their unimpeded transport by rail via the narrow tunnels and sharp turns of the Far - Eastern railway lines .
Choosing the developer
Upon committing to the development of a new vehicle , the Russian space agency had to decide about the design of the future rocket and choose its manufacturer .
During 2008 , all major rocket " firms " competed for the role of building a future manned launcher .
In the third quarter of 2008 , the " system evaluation " of the rocket 's possible architecture was completed and several proposals were apparently submitted to Roskosmos by Sept. 1 , 2008 .
Although Roskosmos made no formal announcement on the matter at the time , unofficial postings on the forum of the Novosti Kosmonavtiki magazine indicated that the agency favored a two - stage launch vehicle , which would be developed by the conglomerate of TsSKB Progress in Samara , KB Mashinostroenia in Miass and RKK Energia in Podlipki ( Korolev ) .
TsSKB Progress would bear overall responsibility for the launch vehicle and its second stage .
KB Mashinostroenia would develop the first stage .
Finally , RKK Energia was expected to oversee the manned transport system .
Thus , all key players in the industry would retain their traditional responsibilities and preserve their overall workforce .
In an interview with the BBC in March 2009 , Aleksandr Chulkov , the head of the launch vehicle and infrastructure directorate at Roskosmos , said that the key factor determining the winner in the government tender would be the price tag .
He confirmed previous reports that the launch vehicle would have to be able to carry at least 20 tons and a maximum 23 tons to low - Earth orbit .
Within the Russian nomenclature , the new rocket would be classified as a " medium - lifting - class vehicle with increased payload capacity , " or " RN SK PG , " while vehicles classified as heavy lifters would carry from 35 to 50 tons into low - Earth orbit .
Chulkov said that requirements for heavy - lifting capabilities within the manned space program would be met by the Angara family of rockets .
Still , it was reported around the time that the new rocket , equipped with five standard boosters on the first stage instead of three , would be able to deliver 35 tons to the low Earth orbit , while another variation , including four standard boosters on the first stage and one on the second stage , could carry 50 tons .
Thus , as a family , the new rockets would overlap the capabilities of Angara rockets .
Even more ironically , Roskosmos apparently favored the architecture of the rocket , which closely resembled RKK Energia 's failed bid to develop the Angara family of vehicles in the 1990s .
Known as Angara - 2 , the proposal featured three standard boosters on the first stage , equipped with an RD - 180 engine each .
At the time , the Angara - 2 concept was rejected in favor of the architecture proposed by Khrunichev enterprise .
Since Roskosmos reportedly called for the construction of as many as 15 launchers per year , the program could require the production of as many as 45 RD - 180 engines annually .
( Official documentation later called for 15 - 20 launches per year ! )
Even with a " low " rate of four launches a year , 12 RD - 180 engines would be required annually .
Due to such high numbers being compounded by the need to produce the same powerplants for the American Atlas rocket , it looked possible that an additional manufacturer based in the city of Perm would be brought into the project .
The same company was responsible for mass production of the RD - 191 engine for the Angara rocket .
Design requirements
By February 2009 , Russian space agency , quietly published a set of official requirements for the future rocket , dubbed Rus-M .
Although on paper , prospective developers had to compete in a federal tender to meet these specifications , it was a mere formality .
The published description of the rocket , including its name , was skewed heavily toward proposals made by the TsSKB Progress / RKK Energia team .
As expected , the first stage of the medium - lifting rocket had to consist of three standard boosters , each equipped with a singe two - chamber RD - 180 engine .
In 2010 , a special version of this engine , designated RD - 180V , was identified for use in Rus-M rocket .
It apparently differed from the base model by the addition of an extensive network of diagnostics sensors which could help trigger the crew escape rocket at the first sign of catastrophic problems with the engine .
The entire cluster of three boosters would remain inseparable during the flight .
The unmanned version of the rocket would have to deliver 23.8 tons to a 200 - kilometer orbit with an inclination of 51.7 degrees after launch from Vostochny .
The rocket modules of the first stage had to be adaptable to serve as the first stage of a heavy - lifting rocket with a payload of no less than 50 tons and a super - heavy lifter with a payload above 100 tons .
Emergency mode requirements
Perhaps the most controversial set of requirements formulated by Roskosmos included Rus-M 's emergency capabilities , which seemed extremely conservative .
From the moment of liftoff , the rocket had to have the capability to clear the launch facility in the event of a complete failure of a single engine .
There were also reports that , during manned launches , the rocket had to make it far and high enough on two remaining engines to enable the crew vehicle to make a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean .
Thus , the manned spacecraft would avoid landing in the difficult terrain of the Far Eastern taiga , downrange from Vostochny .
Later in flight , the manned rocket would have to be capable of delivering a 18.8 - 20.3 - ton spacecraft to a minimum 135 by 440 - kilometer orbit in case of the failure of a single engine on the first or second stage .
Such a single - orbit trajectory would apparently enable the descent module to return for an emergency landing just north of Vostochny , while subjecting the crew to no more than 12 g .
( The difference between the mass of a standard 12 - ton PPTS spacecraft and the available payload of 18.8 ton would likely be used by the emergency supply of propellant needed to provide thrust during a single - orbit flight . )
Second stage
According to unofficial reports in 2008 , Roskosmos considered using either kerosene or hydrogen on the second stage of the vehicle .
However at the beginning of 2009 , the head of Roskosmos , Anatoly Perminov , told the Russian press that hydrogen would be used on the second stage .
The official technical assignment called for a monoblock second stage powered by four RD - 0146 engines .
The emergency abort mode would allow a 20.7 - ton payload to make a single orbit around the Earth after the failure of one of four main engines on the second stage .
Roskosmos also required the developer to provision a controlled deorbiting of the second stage .
Back in July 2008 , KBKhA design bureau in Voronezh first announced that it had proposed a concept of new - generation engines for the prospective launch vehicles , which would fly from Vostochny .
According to KBKhA , the new series would burn a mix of liquid oxygen and carbon - based fuel and would feature high mass and performance characteristics , high reliability and low development and production cost .
KBKhA documents showed that during 2007 , the RD - 0146 engine was test - fired eight times , burning hydrogen and six times burning methane fuel .
An original assignment to develop RD - 0146 came from Khrunichev enterprise .
Ultimately , the hydrogen - propelled version of the engine was chosen for the Rus-M project .
RD - 0146 engine was reported to produce a thrust of 10 tons and deliver the specific impulse of 463 seconds .
Following its debut onboard Angara A5 rocket , RD - 0146 was expected to go through a new series of ground firings during 2014 - 2015 at NITs RKP center as part of the full - scale testing of Rus - M 's second stage .
Follow - on rockets ( 50 - 60 tons payload )
Borrowing a concept first developed for the Energia rocket , TsSKB Progress decided to use a special platform which would serve as the interface between the launch vehicle and its launch pad .
Known as Block Ya , the structure would feature five receptacles and would be compatible with the three - and five - booster configurations of the rocket .
As a result , the future launch facility could host all but one rocket from the Rus family with payloads ranging from 3 tons to 40 tons , according to TsSKB documents circa 2008 .
In April 2009 , the head of TsSKB Progress quoted 40 - ton and 60 - ton versions of the vehicle , which could use the same launch facility .
As it transpired in the spring of 2009 , the Rus-M project had a " built - in " capability for an upgrade to reach a payload capacity of 60 tons to low - Earth orbit to support lunar expeditions .
To achieve this capability , the developers apparently hoped to use a five - booster combination on the first stage .
All five boosters of the first stage would also have to be streched to accomodate larger propellant load .
( 341 ) With the use of variable thrust , the strap - on boosters of the first stage would separate prior to the core stage burnout .
Instead of four RD - 0146 engines on the original Rus-M , the second stage would likely sport a much larger single engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen .
Presumably , it could be based on the RD - 0120 engine which powered the core stage of the Energia rocket .
However any thought of increasing the diameter of the second stage beyond the accepted 3.8 meters would exclude the possibility of transporting the vehicle by rail .
As of 2009 , exceeding the parameters of rail transportation was not acceptable for the Russian government .
If ever built , two Rus- M - derived rockets with 60 - ton payload could support Russia 's contemporary plans for its first expeditions to the Moon , involving rendezvous in lunar orbit .
Under such a scenario , one launcher would carry a light - weight unmanned lunar lander and another a manned transport ship .
Both spacecraft would be equipped with Earth escape stages , which would enable them to reach lunar orbit , where they would dock for crew transfer and subsequent landing .
A heavier lunar lander , which would be needed for long - term exploration of the Moon , would require a third 60 - ton rocket carrying a separate Earth - escape stage .
Super - heavy launcher ( 100 - 150 tons payload )
Although , with the launch of the Rus-M preliminary design in April 2009 , the basic architecture of the rocket was essentially " set in stone , " Roskosmos still formally required the developer to evaluate alternative configurations of the rocket .
The agency specifically asked the industry to consider monoblock version of the rocket , as well as the possible use of the RD - 0163 engine and of hydrogen propellant ( on all stages ) .
During 2009 , TsSKB
Progress also continued studying the possibility of using three - component propellant for the future reincarnations of Rus-M and other upgrades , which would potentially enable to develop a booster with a 100 - ton payload capacity within the limits of 3.8 - meter diameter .
( 354 )
During an International Astronautical Congress in October 2009 , the head of Roskosmos , Anatoly Perminov , said that building " blocks " of the Rus- M vehicle would enable the low - cost development of a heavy vehicle with a payload of 50 - 60 tons , while the " components " of the same launcher would pave the way to a super - heavy rocket , capable of carrying 130 - 150 tons to low Earth orbit .
Perminov also said that the Rus-M could serve as a testbed for the components and technologies of future reusable launch vehicles .
In June 2010 , as the preliminary design of the Rus-M was approaching the conclusion , the head of TsSKB Progress , Aleksandr Kirilin , told the semi-official Interfax AVN news agency that a 100 - ton class booster was still in the upgrade plans of the Rus-M program .
Preliminary design tender
An industry - wide tender for the development of a manned launch vehicle was officially started on Feb. 14 , 2009 , when all participants were suppose to submit their proposals to Roskosmos .
Only two main projects were actually competing -- one from the Khrunichev enterprise , and one from TsSKB Progress .
Since government requirements closely matched TsSKB 's proposals and left practically no room for an alternative architecture , Khrunichev had no choice but to draft a proposal identical to that of Samara .
Still , the company apparently left on the table a proposal for a man-rated Angara - 5P rocket , as an alternative .
According to unofficial reports , the formal opening of envelopes with industry proposals on the new rocket would take place on March 16 , 2009 .
The commission was then expected to make a decision on March 19 , 2009 .
Chulkov told BBC that Roskosmos would have 10 days to complete the formal review of all proposals and the agency would pick a winner by March 25 , 2009 .
The key consideration would be the cost - effectiveness of the proposal , Chulkov said .
The decision would be followed by the preliminary design , which was expected to last around one year .
Ironically , both TsSKB Progress and GRTs Makeev ( KB Mashinostroenia ) chose April 1 , 2009 , to declare themselves winners of the government tender , as industry insiders had predicted .
According to Makeev center 's press-release , the tender commission made a formal choice on March 18 , 2009 .
( According to most sources , the selection took place on March 19 . )
Development
In an interview with RIA Samara in April 2009 , the head of TsSKB Progress , Aleksandr Kirilin , said that his company had to be ready to defend the preliminary design of the rocket , comprising more than 100 volumes of documentation , by September 2010 at a price tag of 145 million rubles .
( The official documentation placed a price tag for the preliminary design at 375 thousand rubles . )
The successful completion of the preliminary design would pave the way to the full - scale experimental development of the rocket , culminating with " cold " and " hot " testing of the vehicle at NIIKhimmash facilities in Sergiev Posad .
Although Kirilin 's interview ran only days after TsSKB had " won " the tender , the head of the company revealed that one of the former Energia - Buran facilities had already been cleaned up for the upcoming project .
The building would now be used for the manufacturing of propellant tanks for the new rocket .
( 329 ) In June 2009 , during the Paris Air and Space Show in Le Bourget , Kirilin told the editor of this web site that the building had previously been used for the application of thermal protection layers on Energia .
In the meantime , the special chambers used for the thermal protection work had been preserved and could eventually accommodate Rus-M , which , like Energia , employs cryogenic propellants .
In addition , extensive test facilities at TsSKB Progress in Samara went through active upgrades during 2008 and 2009 .
A vibration and strength test stand was renovated in 2009 and some critical test hardware was reportedly replaced for the purpose of the Rus-M and Soyuz - 1 projects .
( 354 )
At Le Bourget 2009 , Kirilin also said that the immediate goal of the Rus-M program , would be the formation of a chief designer council .
A long - time tradition for the Russian space industry , the group would include leaders of key organizations involved in the project .
" In the nearest future , we have to form our industrial development team , or at least the core of it , assemble the council of chief designers and conduct the first meeting of this council , " Kirilin said .
At the time , the event was expected in the third quarter of 2009 .
According to Kirilin , the council would include representatives of the Makeev center , RKK Energia , TsENKI and NPO Avtomatiki .
To accelerate the work on the project , TsSKB planned to conduct preliminary design in parallel with the preparation of the production documentation , Kirilin said , " The project will be developed entirely by means of electronic media . "
In the meantime , during the same show , representatives of the Khrunichev enterprise said that they planned to re-submit their proposals for the PPTS launch vehicle before the end of 2009 .
The company would argue that the development of a man-rated launcher derived from the Angara family would be cheaper than that of the currently approved design .
The Angara - 5P vehicle was apparently considered as a stop - gap measure to launch the 12 - 13 - ton version of the PTK spacecraft on missions to the ISS or a future Russian station .
The rocket would reportedly enable the spacecraft to reach the station after just five or six orbits around the Earth .
On July 9 - 10 , 2009 , the first Scientific and Technical Council , NTS , was held on the Rus-M project at TsSKB Progress in Samara , and it finalized the preliminary design development schedule .
The Chief Designer Council and working groups on various aspects of the project were also formed .
By the end of 2009 , NITs RKP test center ( former NIIKhIMMash ) in Peresvet ( near Sergiev Posad ) announced that it was starting preparations for a test program to support the development of launch vehicles based in Vostochny .
It would be similar to activities conducted during the development of the Angara family of rockets .
By June 2010 , official statements indicated that the preliminary design of the Rus-M rocket had entered final stages as planned .
As is traditional for the Russian space industry , this phase of development was concluded with a meeting of the agency 's Scientific and Technical Council on Aug. 25 , 2010 , during which developers " defended " the project and Roskosmos formulated its assessment of the completed work .
The meeting was to be followed by the delivery of the design materials for an independent expertise .
According to Aleksandr Kirilin , the head of TsSKB Progress , approval of the preliminary design would clear the way for the setup of a construction schedule for the Vostochny launch facilities .
Technical project
A new phase in the development of the Rus-M launch vehicle started on Oct. 22 , 2010 , with the Russian government 's announcement of a federal tender for the work on the so - called " Technical Project . "
The Technical Project is the Russian equivalent of what is known in the West as Phase B or a detailed design -- which is essentially a second phase in the research and development of the vehicle or system , following the preliminary design .
The Russian space agency , Roskosmos , earmarked 1.63 billion rubles ( $ 53.5 million ) for the year - long work within on the Technical Project .
The formal review of bids by the industry and the awarding of the contract for the Technical Project was originally scheduled for Nov. 22 - 23 , 2010 .
The work on the Technical Project would include the development of technical assignments , TZ , for all elements of the Rus- M complex , consisting of :
the rocket itself ;
its optional upper stages ;
launch and processing facilities ;
automated control system for preparation and launch , ASU PP ;
measurement and data processing system , KSISO ;
training facilities and means of transportation for the rocket and its components .
Also , the Technical Project would include calculations and experimental work aimed at validating the chosen version of the rocket .
In its requirements for the development of the Technical Project , Roskosmos , specified a number of additional features for the future rocket .
For example , beginning with the loading of propellant into the rocket , all manual operations on the pad would have to be excluded from the pre-launch processing .
The only exception would be the boarding of the spacecraft crew and its evacuation in case of emergency , or a launch scrub .
The Rus-M complex would have to be capable of 20 missions per year with the preparation cycle ( launch campaign ) not exceeding 30 days .
To support this launch rate , the ground processing building would have two assembly facilities for the parallel preparation of two rockets .
A special transporter powered by a pneumatic system would be used to carry the rocket from the processing area to the launch pad .
Given the use of liquid hydrogen onboard Rus-M , Roskosmos asked developers to evaluate whether the construction of a hydrogen production plant in Vostochny would be more economical than the delivery of this cryogenic propellant from another site .
The formal opening of envelopes with proposals for the Technical Project apparently took place on Nov. 29 , 2010 .
As expected , Roskosmos favored the architecture of the Rus-M rocket drafted by TsSKB Progress over the alternative proposals from the Khrunichev enterprise , industry sources said .
Upper stages
Roskosmos ' requirements for the Technical Project specified a number of details on two variations of the upper ( third ) stage , ( sometimes referred to as a space tug ) for the Rus -M rocket .
The primary job of these vehicles would be boosting unmanned satellites from initial parking orbits into higher orbits around the Earth or into deep space .
The development project code - named Dvina , after a Russian river , envisioned a rocket stage designated 11S861-03 ( a version of Block D upper stage ) and a KVRB stage employing liquid hydrogen propellant .
Separate projects , designated TK - Vostok and Dvina KVSK funded the development of support facilities for the 11S861 and KVRB stages respectively .
With the use of these upper stages , Rus-M was expected to deliver no less than 4.5 tons of payload to the sought - after geostationary orbit , in addition to its primary task as a carrier of a new - generation manned spacecraft and other 20 - ton payloads to low Earth orbits with inclinations 51.7 degrees and 63 degrees toward the Equator .
Rus -M cancelled
On October 7 , 2011 , the new head of the Russian space agency , Vladimir Popovkin , told the Russian Duma ( parliament ) that the agency had decided to abandon the development of the Rus-M rocket .
Popovkin said that the program had been consuming 37 percent of the agency 's budget , however these funds would not be enough to have the vehicle ready anywhere near the projected date of the first launch in 2015 .
Popovkin added that the agency would not need the new launcher and would be able to use already available rockets , apparently referring to the Angara rocket .
In development since the beginning of the 1990s , the Angara family of space launchers would have similar capabilities to Rus-M , however the introduction of the new rocket had been years behind schedule .
Popovkin went on to say that after Angara starts flying from Plesetsk , the agency might make a decision to build another launch pad for this new rocket in Vostochny as well .
The cancellation of the Rus-M program had been rumored for quite some time and the plans to introduce the vehicle in 2015 had never been considered realistic by observers .
Recently , the agency looked at the plans to bring the Angara rocket to the prospective launch site in Vostochny , which was originally expected to host Rus-M missions .
However , the construction of Vostochny itself was continuously delayed and with more realistic prospects of launching Angara from Plesetsk and Baikonur , the yet - to - be built spaceport could be seen as another costly duplication .
Known specifications of the Rus-M launch vehicle :
Number of stages 2 Total launch mass 672-688 tons ; 673 tons ( 352 ) ; 665-680 tons ; ( 372 ) Total length including the payload fairing ( unmanned version ) 61.1 meters 352 ) Total length including PTK NP spacecraft ( manned version ) 58.2 meters ( 476 ) Maximum diameter 11.6 meters Diameter of individual booster stages 3.8 meters Payload fairing diameter ( unmanned version ) 4.35 meters Payload fairing length ( unmanned version ) 19.0 meters Payload capabilities Unmanned payload to a 200 - kilometer , 51.7 - degree circular orbit 23.8 tons * 352 ) ; 23.2 tons ( 476 Manned PTK NP spacecraft ( to a 135 by 440/480- kilometer , 51.6 - degree orbit ) 17.9-19.9 tons { 12 - 14 tons} **** 372 ) ; 18.8 tons***

After working side by side for weeks , two coworkers discovered that they are actually siblings brought together by a series of incredible circumstances .
Gary Nisbet and Randy Joubert , who share the same parents , were adopted and raised by separate families in neighboring Maine towns , never knowing the other one existed .
They attended rival high schools , moved to the same town of Waldoboro , Maine , and both wound up working for the same company , Dow Furniture .
The two rode side by side in a delivery truck and slowly put the pieces together .
" Something clicked with me , " Randy said .
" So I got him up by the truck and said Gary , this is going to sound bizarre , but were you adopted ? "
Gary , somewhat perplexed , confirmed that he was in fact adopted .
After comparing some notes -- dates of birth , and finally birth parents names -- they stared at each other in disbelief .
" This is such a small world , " Gary said .
Randy , the older brother , was the one who first had a hunch they may have been related .
" People are saying we look like brothers , and we go on deliveries together for the last month and a half and we keep getting it " Randy said .
He had recently dug up some information about his adoption and discovered that he had a brother who was born on June 10 , 1974 -- Gary 's birthday .
For two weeks the two kept the news to themselves , but last week they shared their story withco - workers .
Owner Lisa
Dow says she cried when one of the brothers told her , " I would have never found him if you did n't hire me to work here . "
Gary and Randy are still in disbelief .
" I 've been riding around with this guy for a month and a half and he's my full blooded brother , " Randy said shaking his head .
The Andromeda galaxy is still expanding
The vast Andromeda galaxy appears to have expanded by digesting stars from other galaxies , research has shown .
When an international team of scientists mapped Andromeda , they discovered stars that they said were " remnants of dwarf galaxies " .
The astronomers report their findings in the journal Nature .
This consumption of stars has been suggested previously , but the team 's ultra - deep survey has provided detailed images to show that it took place .
This shows the " hierarchical model " of galaxy formation in action .
The model predicts that large galaxies should be surrounded by relics of smaller galaxies they have consumed .

The scientists charted the outskirts of Andromeda in detail for the first time .
They discovered stars that could not have formed within the galaxy itself .
Pauline Barmby , an astronomer from the University of Western Ontario , Canada , who was involved in the study , told BBC News the pattern of the stars ' orbits revealed their origin .
" Andromeda is so close that we can map out all the stars , " she said .
" And when you see a sort of lump of stars that far out , and with the same orbit , you know they can't have been there forever . "
Andromeda , which is approximately 2.5 million light - years from Earth , is still expanding , say the scientists .
The researchers also saw a " stream of stars " of a nearby galaxy called Triangulum " stretching " towards Andromeda .
Dr Scott Chapman , reader in astrophysics at the Institute of Astronomy , University of Cambridge , UK , was also involved in the research .
He said : " Ultimately , these two galaxies may end up merging completely .
" Ironically , galaxy formation and galaxy destruction seem to go hand in hand . "
Nickolay Gnedin , an astrophysicist from the University of Chicago , US , who was not involved in this study , described the work as showing " galactic archaeology in action " .
A Steady Rain runs at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre until 6 December
Actors Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman halted a performance of their Broadway play because of an audience member 's ringing mobile phone .
Secretly filmed footage of the incident last week posted online sees Jackman tell the patron to answer the phone during a performance of A Steady Rain .
" We can wait , " Jackman is seen saying .
" Do n't be embarrassed - just grab it . "
The Wolverine star and 007 actor play Chicago policemen in the play , which officially opens this week in New York .
Both remained in character throughout the incident , footage of which was obtained by showbiz website TMZ and subsequently posted on YouTube .

Tickets for Keith Huff 's 2006 play at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre are among the hottest on Broadway .
According to show producers , it has set the record for the highest weekly ticket sales of a non-musical play .
Before the show officially opened and was still in previews , it made just under $ 1.17 million ( £ 728,305 ) , beating the previous record of $ 1.06 million ( £ 659,832 ) set by comedian Billy Crystal 's 700 Sundays in 2005 .
In the play , Australian Jackman and Englishman Craig play childhood friends whose lives are changed forever by a tragic sequence of events .
The stars are not the first to respond on stage to mobile phone distractions in the stalls .
Actor Richard Griffiths made headlines in 2004 when he ordered a man out of the National Theatre after his phone went off repeatedly during a performance of The History Boys .
The following year , the Harry Potter star scolded another patron for letting her phone ring during a performance of Heroes in London 's West End .
With HR 1207 passage now guaranteed in the House , it is time to focus attention on the Senate .

' Doctors told me it was against the rules to save my premature baby '
Doctors left a premature baby to die because he was born two days too early , his devastated mother claimed yesterday .
Sarah Capewell begged them to save her tiny son , who was born just 21 weeks and five days into her pregnancy - almost four months early .
They ignored her pleas and allegedly told her they were following national guidelines that babies born before 22 weeks should not be given medical treatment .
Battle : Sarah Capewell is fighting to have guidelines about caring for very premature babies changed
Miss Capewell , 23 , said doctors refused to even see her son Jayden , who lived for almost two hours without any medical support .
She said he was breathing unaided , had a strong heartbeat and was even moving his arms and legs , but medics refused to admit him to a special care baby unit .
Miss Capewell is now fighting for a review of the medical guidelines .
Heartbreak : Sarah Capewell with her daughter Jodi , five
Sarah Capewell is fighting for new guidelines on when infants should be given intensive care after her premature son Jayden ( right ) was refused treatment
Medics allegedly told her that they would have tried to save the baby if he had been born two days later , at 22 weeks .
In fact , the medical guidelines for Health Service hospitals state that babies should not be given intensive care if they are born at less than 23 weeks .
The guidance , drawn up by the Nuffield Council , is not compulsory but advises doctors that medical intervention for very premature children is not in the best interests of the baby , and is not ' standard practice ' .
James Paget Hospital in Norfolk refused to comment on the case but said it was not responsible for setting the guidelines relating to premature births .
A trust spokesman said : ' Like other acute hospitals , we follow national guidance from the British Association of Perinatal Medicine regarding premature births . '
Miss Capewell , who has had five miscarriages , said the guidelines had robbed her son of a chance of life .
Short life : Miss Capewell 's son Jayden died two hours after he was born at James Paget Hospital in Gorleston , Norfolk , in October 2008
She said : ' When he was born , he put out his arms and legs and pushed himself over .
A midwife said he was breathing and had a strong heartbeat , and described him as a " little fighter " .
I kept asking for the doctors but the midwife said , " They wo n't come and help , sweetie .
Make the best of the time you have with him " . '
She cuddled her child and took precious photos of him , but he died in her arms less than two hours after his birth .
Miss Capewell , who has a five - year - old daughter Jodie , went into labour in October last year at 21 weeks and four days after suffering problems during her pregnancy .
She said she was told that because she had not reached 22 weeks , she was not allowed injections to try to stop the labour , or a steroid injection to help to strengthen her baby 's lungs .
Instead , doctors told her to treat the labour as a miscarriage , not a birth , and to expect her baby to be born with serious deformities or even to be still - born .
Treasured memories : Pictures of baby Jayden 's feet and hands
She told how she begged one paediatrician , ' You have got to help ' , only for the man to respond : ' No we do n't . '
As her contractions continued , a chaplain arrived at her bedside to discuss bereavement and planning a funeral , she claims .
She said : ' I was sitting there , reading this leaflet about planning a funeral and thinking , this is my baby , he is n't even born yet , let alone dead . '
After his death she even had to argue with hospital officials for her right to receive birth and death certificates , which meant she could give her son a proper funeral .
Justice for Jayden :
His mother is campaigning to change the law
She was shocked to discover that another child , born in the U.S. at 21 weeks and six days into her mother 's pregnancy , had survived .
Amillia Taylor was born in Florida in 2006 and celebrated her second birthday last October .
She is the youngest premature baby to survive .
Miss Capewell said : ' I could not believe that one little girl , Amillia Taylor , is perfectly healthy after being born in Florida in 2006 at 21 weeks and six days .
' Thousands of women have experienced this .
The doctors say the babies wo n't survive but how do they know if they are not giving them a chance ? '
Miss Capewell has won the support of Labour MP Tony Wright , who has backed her call for a review of the medical guidelines .
He said : ' When a woman wants to give the best chance to her baby , they should surely be afforded that opportunity . '
What the medical guidelines say ...
Guidance limiting care of the most premature babies provoked outrage when it was published three years ago .
Experts on medical ethics advised doctors not to resuscitate babies born before 23 weeks in the womb , stating that it was not in the child 's ' best interests ' .
The guidelines said : ' If gestational age is certain and less than 23+0 ( i.e at 22 weeks ) it would be considered in the best interests of the baby , and standard practice , for resuscitation not to be carried out . '
Medical intervention would be given for a child born between 22 and 23 weeks only if the parents requested it and only after discussion about likely outcomes .
The rules were endorsed by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine and are followed by NHS hospitals .
The association said they were not meant to be a ' set of instructions ' , but doctors regard them as the best available advice on the treatment of premature babies .
More than 80,000 babies are born prematurely in Britain every year , and of those some 40,000 need to be treated in intensive care .
The NHS spends an estimated £ 1 billion a year on their care .
But while survival rates for those born after 24 weeks in the womb have risen significantly , the rates for those born earlier have barely changed , despite advances in medicine and technology .
Medical experts say babies born before 23 weeks are simply too under - developed to survive , and that to use aggressive treatment methods would only prolong their suffering , or inflict pain .
The guidelines were drawn up by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics after a two - year inquiry which took evidence from doctors , nurses and religious leaders .
But weeks before they were published in 2006 , a child was born in the U.S. which proved a baby could survive at earlier than 22 weeks if it was given medical treatment .
Amillia Taylor was born in Florida on October 24 , 2006 , after just 21 weeks and six days in the womb .
She celebrated her second birthday last year .
Doctors believed she was a week older and so gave her intensive care , but later admitted she would not have received treatment if they had known her true age .
Her birth also coincided with the debate in Britain over whether the abortion limit should be reduced .
Some argued that if a baby could survive at 22 weeks then the time limit on abortions should be reduced .
The argument , which was lost in Parliament , followed a cut to the time limit in 1990 when politicians reduced it from 28 weeks to 24 weeks , in line with scientific evidence that foetuses could survive outside the womb at a younger age .
However , experts say cases like Amillia Taylor 's are rare , and can raise false expectations about survival rates .
Studies show that only 1 per cent of babies born before 23 weeks survive , and many suffer serious disabilities .
MOST governments sex up their economic records .
Australia 's is sexing its down .
For a year the prime minister , Kevin Rudd , has been issuing dire warnings about a “ long , tough and bumpy road ” , and this summer , he advertised his jauntily entitled essay , “ Pain on the Road to Recovery ” , with the mantra that Australia was “ not out of the woods yet ” .
Which is slightly odd .
Unlike in most rich nations , national income in Australia , buoyed by strong exports to Asia and resilient household consumption , actually grew in the three months to June by 0.6 % and was higher than at the same time last year .
Unemployment remained flat at 5.8 % yet again in August , below its 30 - year average of 7.2 % , and far below the peaks of the early 1990s .
The stockmarket has risen 43 % since March ; house prices in Sydney and Melbourne are up and business and consumer confidence are at or near two - year highs .
Financial crisis ?
What financial crisis ?
Australia 's big banks have reported huge profits in the past 18 months , expanded overseas and tightened their hold on the domestic banking market too .
The government seems to believe its own propaganda .
In May it proposed a budget deficit in 2009 - 10 of 4.9 % of GDP , which would be one of the biggest federal deficits since the second world war .
Torrents of spending are pouring down on public buildings , home insulation , rail crossing gates and pension payments .
After fending off a High Court challenge in April the government sent off cheques worth A$ 900 ( $ 640 ) each to taxpayers earning less than A$ 80,000 a year .
It has also guaranteed bank deposits up to A$ 1 m at no charge , and remaining bank liabilities for a small fee .
Critics fret about both the details and the scale of the spending .
Following accusations of waste , the Senate and the auditor - general ( who answers to Parliament ) are separately inquiring into the stimulus spending on renovating school buildings .
The opposition 's Treasury spokesman , Joe Hockey , reckons that planned spending is “ completely out of proportion ” .
Rumour has it that the finance minister , Lindsay Tanner , agrees , but is overruled .
But market economists are grateful .
“ The economic stimulus caught the economy before it fell , ” says Rory Robertson from Macquarie Bank .
“ There were no prizes for being half - hearted , ” opines Matthew Hassan from Westpac , another bank .
The government is popular among voters too .
Sinclair Davidson of the Institute of Public Affairs , a think - tank in Melbourne , concludes that a combination of “ gloomy rhetoric and massive spending is the perfect strategy : a hedge against bad news , and a reason for good . ”
From the " Long - Lived Forks ' files :
DragonFly BSD 2.4 is now out , including a new 64 - bit ISO image , kernel and feature updates .
According to the release notes , the single most invasive change is the introduction of DEVFS .
" The /dev filesystem is now mounted by the kernel after it mounts the root filesystem , " the release notes state .
DragonFly BSD developers already know that the DEVFS change , as well as a few other items , might be problematic for some users .
There is already a plan to release version 2.4.1 in a month to deal with issues that come up .
New features , aside , what is interesting to me is that Dragon Fly BSD still exists .
It 's an effort that started out in 2003 as a fork of FreeBSD 4.x .
Here we are six years later and this fork is still alive and well .
FreeBSD is now moving toward its FreeBSD 8 release and many , many things have changed , in both BSD's .
NEW YORK – Sarah Palin , the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate , has finished her memoir just four months after the book deal was announced , and the release date has been moved up from the spring to Nov. 17 , her publisher said .
" Governor Palin has been unbelievably conscientious and hands - on at every stage , investing herself deeply and passionately in this project , " said Jonathan Burnham , publisher of Harper .
`` It 's her words , her life , and it's all there in full and fascinating detail . "
Palin's book , her first , will be 400 pages , said Burnham , who called the fall " the best possible time for a major book of this kind . "
The book now has a title , one fitting for a public figure known for the unexpected – Going Rogue : An American Life .
Harper , an imprint of HarperCollins , has commissioned a huge first printing of 1.5 million copies .
Sen .
Ted Kennedy 's True Compass , published by Twelve soon after his Aug. 25 death , also had a 1.5 million first printing .
As with the Kennedy book , the digital edition of Palin 's memoir will not be released at the same time as the hardcover .
Going Rogue will not be available as an e-book until Dec. 26 because ``we want to maximize hardcover sales over the holidays , " Harper spokeswoman Tina Andreadis said Monday .
Publishers have been concerned that e-books , rapidly becoming more popular , might take away sales from hardcover editions , which are more expensive .
Palin , who abruptly resigned as Alaska governor over the summer with more than a year left in her first term , has been an object of fascination since Sen .
John McCain , the Republican presidential candidate in 2008 , chose her as his running mate , making an instant celebrity out of a once - obscure public official .
During last year 's campaign , pundits questioned whether Palin hurt McCain 's presidential bid by " going rogue , " or defying his campaign 's control .
Although Democrat Barack Obama easily won the election and Palin was criticized even by some Republicans for being inexperienced , she remains a favorite among conservatives and is a rumoured contender for 2012 .
Interest in her is so high that a fan recently paid $ 63,500 to have dinner with her , part of an Internet auction for a charity that aids wounded veterans .
Palin , 45 , spent weeks in San Diego shortly after leaving office and worked on the manuscript with collaborator Lynn Vincent , a person close to her said .
She was joined in San Diego by her family and her top aide , Meghan Stapleton , then spent several days in New York working around the clock with editors at Harper , said the person , who was n't authorized to comment and asked not to be identified .

Solving a problem from Google Code Jam ( 2009 .
1A.A : " Multi- base happiness " ) I came up with an awkward ( code - wise ) solution , and I 'm interested in how it could be improved .
The problem description , shortly , is : Find the smallest number bigger than 1 for which iteratively calculating the sum of squares of digits reaches 1 , for all bases from a given list .
Or description in pseudo - Haskell ( code that would solve it if elem could always work for infinite lists ) :
solution = head .
( `filter` [ 2.. ] ) . all ( ( 1 `elem` ) .
( `iterate` i ) . sumSquareOfDigitsInBase )
And my awkward solution :
By awkward I mean it has this kind of code : happy <- lift .
lift .
lift $ isHappy Set.empty base cur
I memoize results of the isHappy function .
Using the State monad for the memoized results Map .
Trying to find the first solution , I did not use head and filter ( like the pseudo - haskell above does ) , because the computation is n't pure ( changes state ) .
So I iterated by using StateT with a counter , and a MaybeT to terminate the computation when condition holds .
and ( like the pseudo - haskell above does ) , because the computation is n't pure ( changes state ) .
So I iterated by using StateT with a counter , and a MaybeT to terminate the computation when condition holds .
Already inside a MaybeT ( StateT a ( State b ) ) , if the condition does n't hold for one base , there is no need to check the other ones , so I have another MaybeT in the stack for that .
Code :

Other contestants using Haskell did have nicer solutions , but solved the problem differently .
My question is about small iterative improvements to my code .
The Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee has just released a summary of their report .
This " Augustine " report ( named after chairman Norm Augustine , former CEO of Lockheed , not St. Augustine , which might have made for more entertaining reading ) discusses the future of US manned space exploration .
The full report should arrive within the month .
The summary makes one critical point : NASA is woefully underfunded to accomplish its stated goals ( Let 's go to the Moon and Mars and beyond ! ) .
The committee 's basic message is that , under the current funding profile , NASA can barely retire the space shuttles and the International Space Station .
Any ambitious manned space exploration plans will have to be delayed by a minimum of 15 - 20 years ( Bush wanted us to be playing soccer on the Moon by 2020 ) .
The committee says an additional $ 3 billion / year for ten years is required to have a viable manned exploration program , on top of the roughly $ 10 billion / year currently being spent ( for reference , NASA science programs weigh in at under $ 5 billion / year ) .
As far as space exploration is concerned , the current trajectory is n't going to get us anywhere .
One interesting aspect of this report is the absence of science .
Out of 12 pages , science is mentioned twice .
In the third line of the report , we are advised that spaceflight " really is rocket science " .
Cute .
Towards the end of the introduction , we are told " Human exploration can contribute appropriately to the expansion of scientific knowledge " .
The emphasis is theirs , not mine .
Perhaps they 're feeling a little defensive ?
As well they should .
From what I can tell , nobody has articulated a compelling scientific case for human beings to go beyond low - Earth orbit .
Or even leave Earth , for that matter .
From a scientific perspective , the International Space Station has been an unbelievably colossal waste of money .
As the Economist tells us , " the useful science that has been done on board could be written up on the back of a postage stamp . "
( Sam Ting 's AMS would be an exception .
But this is unlikely to have been the most cost - effective way to go about this experiment . )
The space shuttle program , on the other hand , has been instrumental in producing amazing science , epitomized by the launching and servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope .
Given the immense cost of the shuttle program , however , the science return on investment remains fairly slim .
How many space telescopes could have been built and launched by conventional rockets , for the cost of all that shuttle development ?
It could be argued that the manned space program is not about science at all .
It 's about slipping the surly bonds of Earth and fulfilling our " natural destiny " .
There is certainly something compelling about this , although I would argue that the current plans are ludicrously expensive and overly ambitious .
My main concern is that the public misses the distinction : NASA sometimes appears to conflate human exploration and basic research .
When we talk about sending humans to the Moon or Mars , we 're not talking about scientific exploration .
If science is your goal , you send unmanned probes and satellites , at a tiny fraction of the cost .
These missions carry no risk to human life , and considerably larger scientific payoff .
Like any science fiction fan , I 'm intrigued by the idea of human colonies on the Moon and Mars and beyond .
But if these long - term aspirations suck the oxygen out of the room for basic science , humanity on the whole loses out .
And The ' Worst Bad Name ' Goes to Iona Knipl By By Chris V. Thangham Apr 7 , 2008 in Entertainment The New York Times hosted a “ Worst Bad Name ” contest and today named the winner : Iona Knipl .

Several buses away , Cancellara said , “ Racing like that , I ’m sure , Evans will never win the Tour . ”
Evans , a two - time Tour runner - up , cannot seem to get a break at this Tour  or in past ones .
He came into this race as one of the favorites , but now he is a long shot .
On a team much weaker than Cancellara ’s Saxo Bank or Lance Armstrong ’s Astana , Evans is in 18th place after 9 of the 21 stages .
He is 3 minutes 7 seconds behind the race leader , Rinaldo Nocentini of Italy .
But struggling to win , and often coming close , has been the story of Evans ’s career .
For the past three years , Evans has finished second at the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré , a race many riders use as a tuneup for the Tour .
Even as a young rider growing up in Australia , Evans had great success in mountain biking and road cycling .
But , he lamented Monday during an interview , he always seemed to miss out on the biggest prize .
“ I have one third , one second , one third , one fourth and another third , ” he said , naming the world championship medals he won as a junior and under - 23 racer .
“ All together , I have seven world championship medals , but none gold .
“ It ’s frustrating .
It ’s hard to handle when you always come so close to winning but never do it . ”
Evans , 32 , who is one of the best road cyclists in the world , can be intense on and off the bike .
He has head - butted a television camera and screamed at a fan who nearly stepped on his beloved dog , a small mixed - breed named Molly , “ Do n’t step on my dog , or I ’ll cut your head off ! ”
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Taking his private equity firm public paid off big for Blackstone Group LP ’s Stephen Schwarzman , who became the top - paid chief executive in the United States last year , a title he is likely to retain for some time , according to an analysis released on Thursday .
But the surest route to big bucks was running an oil or natural gas company .
Their CEOs represented seven of the 10 highest - paid U.S. CEOs in 2008 , according to a report by independent research group The Corporate Library .
Schwarzman bumped Oracle Corp ’s Larry Ellison down to No. 2 on the list .
They were followed by seven oil CEOs and Michael Jeffries , head of teen apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co .
The year stood out for the amounts the top - paid executives received , as seven people secured total compensation of more than $ 100 million .
Just three made that much a year before and two of them were retiring CEOs , said Greg Ruel , a Corporate Library research associate who coauthor the report .
Ellison ’s compensation , for instance , soared to almost $ 557 million , from $ 192 million .
Another major shift was how few executives outside the oil and gas industry made the list .
“ It ’s so filled with petroleum executives , ” Ruel said , adding that the result reflected executives cashing in on stocks that until last summer were still chasing oil ’s rally to a record high near $ 150 a barrel .
The study ranks CEOs on “ total realized compensation , ” which includes cash pay and bonus , perks , plus the value of stock options exercised and the vesting of restricted shares , Ruel said .
FOUNDERS TOP THE LIST
The vast bulk of Schwarzman ’s pay -- $ 699.8 million of a total $ 702.4 million -- reflected the vesting of equity grants he received when the company went public in 2007 .
The vesting will continue over the next four years .
“ It is reasonably safe to assume that Mr. Schwarzman will remain at the top of ( the ) highest paid CEOs list , or close to it , for a few years to come , ” the report says .
It notes that given his status as founder of the company much of the pay reflects his initial investment in Blackstone .
But Blackstone disputed this should count as compensation .
“ This is absurd , ” said Blackstone spokesman Peter Rose .
“ At the time of the IPO , Steve ( Schwarzman ) received stock in exchange for his partnership interest in Blackstone .
This vests over a number of years .
In no sense does the stock he owns as it vests become compensation . ”
Schwarzman had a base salary of $ 350,000 for 2008 according to a regulatory filing in March .

Moving to contain a public relations mess , Wells Fargo & Co. fired a top executive accused of using a bank - owned Malibu beach house to entertain her family and friends .
Cheronda Guyton , a senior vice president responsible for commercial foreclosed properties , broke company rules barring personal use of bank property , Wells Fargo said in a statement Monday .
The Times reported last week that Guyton had been spotted by neighbors spending time at the Malibu Colony home with her family this summer .
At a party in August , guests were ferried to the beach house from a yacht , residents of the enclave said .
Guyton did not return phone calls or e-mails requesting comment .

The property ’s former owners , Lawrence and Linda Elins , were among the victims in Bernard L. Madoff ’s massive Ponzi scheme .
Because of their financial losses , the couple had been forced to sign over the property to Wells Fargo to help satisfy a debt , their former real estate agent said .
As Wells Fargo investigated the employee ’s alleged improper conduct over the weekend , the reports of lavish frolicking in the wake of the foreclosure crisis drew widespread attention from organizations including the ABC , CNN and Fox television news networks , as well as the overseas wire service Agence France - Presse .
In a statement , Wells Fargo said its internal investigation concluded that “ a single team member was responsible for violating our company policies .
As a result , employment of this individual has been terminated . ”
“ We deeply regret the activities that have taken place as they do not reflect the conduct we expect of our team members , ” the statement added .

Although the statement did not mention the fired employee by name , Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Langan confirmed that it was Guyton .
Wells Fargo ’s investigation has concluded , Langan said , adding that “ no other Wells Fargo team member was involved . ”
Wells Fargo ’s quick action after The Times ’ report last week reflects the bank ’s recognition that the case could become a liability , especially in light of its acceptance of federal bailout money , ethics experts said .
Wells Fargo is trying to “ cut the story off rather quickly , ” said Mark Pastin , president of the Council of Ethical Organizations , an Alexandria , Va. , nonprofit promoting ethics in business and government .
“ They might have acted differently if it was a lower - tier employee , but this was a senior vice president . ”

Rapidly firing Guyton could also have been an attempt by Wells Fargo to present her conduct as the isolated action of an individual , Pastin said .
If Wells Fargo let the situation drag on for weeks or months , other employees might have gotten the idea that Guyton ’s alleged behavior was tolerable .
But by firing her , he said , it cuts off the “ internal rot ” that could have set in .
Malibu Colony residents and real estate agents said they had expected the home to be put on the market after the bank took it over .
The home was valued at $ 12 million when it was transferred to Wells Fargo in May .
Wealthy real estate shoppers who had gotten wind of the house being held by the bank said they were frustrated they could not offer to buy it .
Local real estate agents said they began to get calls from eager would - be buyers -- but the house was n’t for sale .
The gated Malibu Colony , whose residents include actor Tom Hanks and former Univision Chairman A. Jerrold Perenchio , stretches for three - quarters of a mile in the heart of Malibu .

“ It ’s a trophy property .
They do n’t come on the market often .
People like myself would buy it sight unseen , ” said Arthur Spector , a Las Vegas resort developer who said he was willing to pay all cash for the house if it was priced close to $ 12 million .
The three - bedroom house had not been listed for sale until Friday , the day after The Times ’ story first appeared online .
The bank listed it at $ 21.5 million .
According to property records , the home is 3,800 square feet and sits on an 8,700 - square - foot lot .
When told of the list price , Spector ’s interest quickly cooled .
“ It ’s going to sit until it comes down to the right price , which is anywhere from $ 9 million to $ 14 million , ” he said .
Irene Dazzan - Palmer , a Malibu agent who had tried to lease the house for the previous owners , said people had called her saying they were interested in buying the house , but Wells did not want to show it .
Neighbors also said they knew people who wanted to purchase the property .

The house was built in 1990 and had been owned by clothing designer Nancy Heller .
Guyton ’s own residence is a one - story cottage home in the Fairfax district .
Two private security guards stood watch Monday at the house , which records show was bought in 2004 for $ 900,000 .
The guards would not say who hired them or whether the residents were home .

BRUSSELS — Carbon trading put the European Union in the environmental vanguard .
Since 2005 , the trade bloc has operated the world ’s only continentwide system that puts a cap on greenhouse gas emissions and that requires major polluters to hold tradable allowances .
But the system has also been the most “ costly climate policy program in the world , ” according to Jürgen R. Thumann , the president of BusinessEurope , a powerful confederation of industry and employer groups .
Mr. Thumann said European business leaders are desperate to expand the system to the United States and eventually across the globe to reduce the “ dangers to our ability to compete internationally . ”
But with talks on a new global climate treaty seemingly at a stalemate , and with climate legislation delayed in major polluting countries like the United States and Australia , those prospects look increasingly distant .
Risk Intuition
People have a natural intuition about risk , and in many ways it ’s very good .
It fails at times due to a variety of cognitive biases , but for normal risks that people regularly encounter , it works surprisingly well : often better than we give it credit for .
This struck me as I listened to yet another conference presenter complaining about security awareness training .
He was talking about the difficulty of getting employees at his company to actually follow his security policies : encrypting data on memory sticks , not sharing passwords , not logging in from untrusted wireless networks .
“ We have to make people understand the risks , ” he said .
It seems to me that his co-workers understand the risks better than he does .
They know what the real risks are at work , and that they all revolve around not getting the job done .
Those risks are real and tangible , and employees feel them all the time .
The risks of not following security procedures are much less real .
Maybe the employee will get caught , but probably not .
And even if he does get caught , the penalties are n’t serious .
Given this accurate risk analysis , any rational employee will regularly circumvent security to get his or her job done .
That ’s what the company rewards , and that ’s what the company actually wants .
“ Fire someone who breaks security procedure , quickly and publicly , ” I suggested to the presenter .
“ That ’ll increase security awareness faster than any of your posters or lectures or newsletters . ”
If the risks are real , people will get it .
You see the same sort of risk intuition on motorways .
People are less careful about posted speed limits than they are about the actual speeds police issue tickets for .
It ’s also true on the streets : people respond to real crime rates , not public officials proclaiming that a neighbourhood is safe .
The warning stickers on ladders might make you think the things are considerably riskier than they are , but people have a good intuition about ladders and ignore most of the warnings .
( This is n’t to say that some people do n’t do stupid things around ladders , but for the most part they ’re safe .
The warnings are more about the risk of lawsuits to ladder manufacturers than risks to people who climb ladders . )
As a species , we are naturally tuned in to the risks inherent in our environment .
Throughout our evolution , our survival depended on making reasonably accurate risk management decisions intuitively , and we ’re so good at it , we do n’t even realise we ’re doing it .
Parents know this .
Children have surprisingly perceptive risk intuition .
They know when parents are serious about a threat and when their threats are empty .
And they respond to the real risks of parental punishment , not the inflated risks based on parental rhetoric .
Again , awareness training lectures do n’t work ; there have to be real consequences .
It gets even weirder .
The University College London professor John Adams popularised the metaphor of a mental risk thermostat .
We tend to seek some natural level of risk , and if something becomes less risky , we tend to make it more risky .
Motorcycle riders who wear helmets drive faster than riders who do n’t .
Our risk thermostats are n’t perfect ( that newly helmeted motorcycle rider will still decrease his overall risk ) and will tend to remain within the same domain ( he might drive faster , but he wo n’t increase his risk by taking up smoking ) , but in general , people demonstrate an innate and finely tuned ability to understand and respond to risks .
Of course , our risk intuition fails spectacularly and often , with regards to rare risks , unknown risks , voluntary risks , and so on .
But when it comes to the common risks we face every day — the kinds of risks our evolutionary survival depended on — we ’re pretty good .
So whenever you see someone in a situation who you think does n’t understand the risks , stop first and make sure you understand the risks .
You might be surprised .

An update from Campaign for Liberty ’s president John Tate :
Dear Friend of Liberty ,
As you and I both know , Campaign for Liberty is leading the fight to pass Ron Paul ’s bill to Audit the Fed .
With 282 cosponsors in the House and 23 in the Senate , your efforts have so far proven very successful in establishing large , bipartisan support for Federal Reserve transparency .
We ’ve come a long way in demonstrating to the nation that monetary policy is a critical issue , and every day more and more people are waking up to the harm that the Fed has caused our economy .
But our mission is not yet complete .
There are more Americans to educate , more signatures to collect , and more work to be done to combat the “ big guns ” that have come out against Ron Paul ’s Audit the Fed bill .
That ’s why today I ’m proud to announce that we ’ve taken the next step in our efforts by launching AuditTheFed.com , a focused , coalition website with one purpose : to push this historic piece of legislation through Congress , past the President ’s desk , and into law .
AuditTheFed.com includes : contact information for your congressman and senators , petitions , widgets , and banners to promote the website , dynamic graphs of the bill ’s cosponsors , a detailed summary of the Audit the Fed bill , a list of our growing coalition , a blog to keep you up to date on all the latest Audit the Fed news , a sign up for email updates , and social networks to help get the word out online .
This website was designed to put you , the liberty - loving activist , in a position to efficiently and effectively promote Audit the Fed to family , friends , neighbors , and strangers alike .
This new website is the latest addition to our efforts to Audit the Fed , but it is by no means the culmination .
Stay tuned to CampaignforLiberty.com in the coming days for information on how we plan to mobilize to gain not only more cosponsors for HR 1207 and S 604 , but support for a vote in the House and Senate .
For Liberty ,
John Tate

eBay had said earlier this year that it planned to spin off Skype Online auction site eBay has agreed to sell the majority of internet phone company Skype for about $ 2bn ( £ 1.2bn ) .
Skype is to be majority - owned by a group of private investors , including Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen and private equity firms .
EBay will keep a 35 % stake in the firm , which it has been trying to sell for some time .
It has said that Skype had " limited synergies " with it .
The deal values Skype at $ 2.75 bn .
EBay bought Skype for $ 2.6bn in 2005 .
The new owners are Andreessen Horowitz , Index Ventures - which originally invested in Skype - as well as private equity firm Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board .
They will pay $ 1.9bn in cash , and give a $ 125 m note to eBay , meaning that it promises to pay that amount on demand or at an agreed time .
For sale Earlier this year , eBay had said that it planned to spin off Skype and list its shares in the first half of 2010 , an announcement many took as a signal that the firm was for sale .
Ebay wrote down the value of the firm to $ 1.2bn a year after it was taken over .
Including payouts to Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis , who founded Skype in 2003 , eBay paid over $ 3bn for the company .
Skype 's software lets computer and mobile phone users talk to each other for free and make cut - price calls to mobiles and landlines .
Unlike traditional mobile calls , which are transmitted over a cellular network , Skype turns your voice into data and sends it over the internet .
Since being acquired , the number of registered Skype users has risen to 405 million from 53 million , though free user - to - user calls still dominate the service .
The deal should be finalised by the last three months of the year .

It was graduation week , and like many matriculating seniors , Genevieve Thiers wondered what she would do with her life .
She worried that her classical Opera training might not provide the immediate financial relief that she would need to pay the bills .
That 's when she spotted inspiration : a pregnant woman .
She watched the slow , belabored steps the woman 's swollen feet took up the staircase ; she watched the woman grab the railing for support as she pulled herself up the stairs like a pot - bellied mountaineer hoisting himself up a steep rock wall .
The woman was trekking across the Boston College campus , posting fliers soliciting a babysitter .
Pistons began firing in Thiers ' head .
She recalled thousands of nights spent babysitting as the oldest of seven children .
She saw how inconvenienced the pregnant woman was by drafting , printing , and distributing flyers , not to mention actually finding a worthy candidate .
And Thiers knew there was a relatively simple answer to the problem that millions of mothers around the country must have been facing too : an online community that matches care - seekers with care - givers .
The whole thing reminded her of Match.com , where she met the man that would eventually become her husband .
" If people could use the Internet to find true love , why not use it to find a quality sitter ? "
Thiers asks .
After a quick call to her father and a $ 120 loan to buy the domain name , www.SitterCity.com, No. 358 on the Inc. 500 , was born .
Online - only is becoming an increasingly popular start - up model , especially for entrepreneurs looking to launch a business with low overhead .
For many of the companies on the 2009 Inc. 500|5000 list , such as Sittercity , which is based in Chicago , online - only is what makes sense -- less overhead means better prices for customers and more profits for business owners .
Greg Murtagh , the CEO of Triad Digital Media , says he launched his online media management and operations company , No. 373 on the Inc. 500 , because he saw a need and thought he could rectify it .
" I could clearly see the value to be generated by moving printed materials to the Web and delivering customized information to people quickly and cost - effectively , " Murtagh says .
" Not only could the Web cut costs , it could grow revenue . "
But sometimes it take a bit of trial and error to see what model will work for your business , explains Jeff Goldberg , president of Cali Bamboo , a bamboo flooring and fencing company and No. 254 on the Inc. 500 .
' We tried every selling method under the sun , from traditional knock - on - doors , going to other fencing companies , direct mail , and online , ' Goldberg says .
' We did n't really choose to be an online - only company , online chose us . '
By creating a well - organized website that effectively markets the company 's bamboo fencing , Cali Bamboo was able to hit $ 7.2 million in revenue in 2008 and 877.1 percent growth over the last three years .
For Faraz A. Syed , CEO of DeviceAnywhere , No. 62 on the Inc. 500 , the Internet is crucial to his business .
DeviceAnywhere.com is a global provider of mobile application testing and development .
The company is inconceivable as a traditional business , because the Internet provides the portal that gives developers around the world access to more than 2,000 cell phones and smartphones remotely .
Catering to program and application developers comes with its own set of challenges , Syed says .
" Our customers are very savvy people , so the functionality of the website is of utmost importance .
Aesthetic is always important , but for us , the functionality trumps the look and feel . "
That means 24 - 7 service .
" When you have an online - only business , your revenue is tied to something that needs to be operational at all times , " he says .
" Any outage or service degradation has an impact on both your revenue and your customers ' experience . "
For some , online is n't a permanent part of the business model as much as it is the best place to be right now .
" We never looked at ourselves as an online business , " says Michael Bellavia , president of No. 402 Animax , an online media company .
" We 're a multi- platform business that was birthed online .
To us , we want to make sure that we 're using the platform that 's most appropriate for the brand story . '
Volusion , a shopping - cart software developer and No. 248 on the Inc. 500 , is in the unique position of exclusively serving online businesses while being one itself .
" Customer experience is the entire DNA of our organization , " says Clay Olivier , co-founder and COO of the Simi Valley , Calif . - based start - up .
" We used to charge a fee for customers who wanted to change their domain name after it had been established .
While changing the domain name requires a lot of work on our end -- everything is tied to your domain name -- the fee was upsetting our customers , so we now allow for a 30 - day grace period , " Olivier says .
While starting an online business does require a certain amount of technological know - how , it also represents an evolution in entrepreneurship , says Stephen Kessler , a counselor at the nonprofit entrepreneurial education group SCORE .
' With good technical architecture , a good marketing plan and a unique idea , you can launch a successful business easier than ever before . '
August exports in China plummeted 23.4 % from a year earlier as the global economic crisis continued to take its toll on developed countries .
However , industrial production in the Red Dragon still managed to grow , indicating the best is yet to come for the world 's third largest economy .
Boosted by a $ 586 billion ( 4 trillion yuan ) government stimulus package that is stoking domestic demand , output at China 's factories gained 12.3 % year - on - year last month .
A poll of 15 economists by Bloomberg News showed a median estimate of 11.8 % production growth .
" Exports wo n't truly recover unless China 's main trading partners such as the U.S. and Europe regain growth next year , " China International Capital Corp.
economist Xing Ziqiang told Bloomberg , adding that trade " will continue to be a drag on the recovery . "
Still , the production growth is a testament to China as a market in its own right , as its middle class continues to expand and consume goods :
Additionally , retail sales climbed 15.4 % in August from a year before , beating the median estimate of 15.3 % by analysts polled by Bloomberg .
South Korea 's largest carmaker , Hyundai Motor Co. , upped its 2010 production capacity in China to 600,000 from 500,000 .
And new loans in August were 410.4 billion yuan , up from 355.9 billion yuan in July .
Any concerns about inflation amid the huge stimulus package were momentarily quelled in August , when consumer prices fell 1.2 % from a year earlier and producer prices showed a 7.9 % decline .
China will raise interest rates " around next spring " when inflation will rise to as high as 5 % , BNP Paribas SA economist Isaac Meng told Bloomberg .
When western economies do recover , China , where everything from iPhones to desktop fans are made , will return to its status the export powerhouse of the world .
China expects its economy to grow 8 % this year and that growth will almost certainly accelerate when a recovery takes hold in the United States and Europe .
China said Friday the flood of positive indicators has it on the right track to achieve its expected 8 % growth for the year .
" The data from January to August has laid a good foundation for realizing the eight percent economic growth target for the full year , " Li Xiaochao , a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) , said in a press conference .
" So far , the main reason why the overall economy is stabilizing and starting to recover is that we adopted the stimulus package to expand domestic demand . "

Appeasing right wing , US Justice Department launches ACORN probe
By Jerry White
24 September 2009
The Inspector General of the US Justice Department has agreed to open a formal investigation into whether the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) sought or received any Justice Department grant money , and if so , whether Justice officials reviewed the use of such funds .
The decision by the Obama administration follows a campaign by Republicans and right - wing news outlets demanding the cut - off of public funds to the organization , which conducts voter registration drives in poor and minority neighborhoods and provides housing , legal and financial assistance to low - income residents .
The organization was the victim of a right - wing sting operation , in which two conservative activists , dressed as a pimp and prostitute , took a hidden camera to ACORN offices in several cities and sought advice from employees on how to carry out illegal activities and avoid paying taxes .
Video footage of the operation has been repeatedly aired on Fox News and other media outlets .
Rather than exposing the political character of the attack , the Democratic Party , which has chiefly benefited from the voter registration activities of the group , is throwing the organization to the wolves .
During Sunday ’s television talk shows Obama — who had worked for an ACORN affiliate during his days as a “ community organizer ” in Chicago and represented the group in a lawsuit defending voter rights against the state of Illinois in 1995 — called the videos “ disturbing ” and said there should be an investigation .
Last week , the US Senate voted to prohibit ACORN funding in its spending bill for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development , and the House of Representatives voted to deny all federal funds to ACORN .
On Monday , Inspector General Glenn A. Fine wrote Texas Rep. Lamar Smith , the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , indicating that his office would open a probe into whether ACORN had gotten Justice Department grants .
Lamar welcomed the decision saying an investigation would “ help Congress ensure that money allocated to support law enforcement efforts is not instead used to support criminal conduct . ”
He added , “ It is clear that ACORN has fostered a culture of corruption .
With investigations of ACORN now occurring in 20 states , it is time for the FBI to open up a full scale investigation into possible criminal conduct by ACORN . ”
Republicans are demanding other federal agencies review the grants , contracts and entitlements that ACORN received .
Under political pressure , the Census Bureau announced it would not use the organization to collect census data , and ACORN said it was suspending a joint program with the Internal Revenue Service to provide tax assistance to low - income people .
ACORN has long been targeted for its efforts to register poor and minority voters who are largely disenfranchised during elections .
Because these voters have largely supported the Democrats , the Republicans have charged the organization with “ voter fraud ” and taken legal steps to curtail its operations or shut the organization down .
The organization was in the middle of the illegal efforts by Bush administration officials to fire US district attorneys who failed to pursue charges of voter fraud .
Publicly released emails show that Karl Rove directly pushed for the termination of US Attorney David Iglesias , in large part for his decision not to pursue allegations of voter fraud against ACORN in 2006 .
Iglesias had investigated the charges and found them unwarranted .
Shortly before the 2008 presidential elections , the FBI opened up an investigation into Republican allegations that ACORN was engaged in voter fraud .
The FBI has not commented on the case since .
Among those leading the witch - hunt in Congress is California Rep. Darrell Issa , a multi-millionaire who came to political prominence in 2003 when he personally financed the campaign to overturn the results of the California gubernatorial election and recall Democratic Governor Gray Davis .
The responses of a few ACORN employees — who have since been fired — to the right - wing sting operation have been used to suggest that the entire organization is engaged in criminal activity .
While echoing this specious claim , the media scarcely bothered to report that several employees contacted the police after the couple asked them for assistance .
In Philadelphia , for example , the staff filed a police report after the couple left .
In National City , California , police said an ACORN worker — Juan Carlos Vera — who appeared to give advice to the couple about their plans to smuggle children from Latin America for a prostitution ring , had contacted them after the incident .
The political motivations behind this witch - hunt were made clear by John Fund , columnist for the Wall Street Journal , in comments on National Public Radio ’s “ On Point ” program Tuesday night .
Fund denounced ACORN ’s voter registration efforts for “ clogging up the voter rolls with fraud ” and “ gumming up the system . ”
The Wall Street Journal columnist — who has been engaged in a decade - long campaign against the organization — is the author of the 2004 book Stealing Elections : How Voter Fraud Threatens Our Democracy , which helped give the Republican Party a plank on which to intimidate voters and such organizations as ACCORN during the past two presidential elections .
In it Fund rails against ACORN and measures to facilitate voter registration , including the Motor Voter Act , which enables voters to register when they apply for their driver ’s license .
When an NPR listener pointed out that the columnist ’s newspaper and the Republicans attacking ACORN had defended the criminal activities of the Wall Street banking executives who created the current economic catastrophe , Fund attempted to blame ACORN and similar groups for the collapse of the banking system , saying its advocacy bank providing loans to low - income families had precipitated the sub - prime mortgage crisis .
While the Democratic Party has made use of ACORN ’s “ get out the vote ” activities , the fact that it has joined the attack on this organization demonstrates that it is no more committed to defending the right to vote than the Republican Party .

Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Even as China overtakes the U.S. in the dubious category of “ world ’s leading greenhouse gas producer , ” it is also well ahead of the U.S. in developing the technologies and policies to solve the problem — and selling those solutions to us at massive profits which could have been ours .
On a recent trip , I saw entire Chinese towns powered by farm waste and enough windmills for jousts with ten thousand Don Quixotes .
As you read this , China will have just surpassed the U.S. as the leading producer of wind turbines , many of which are exported at very high margins .
And to get a sense of just how fast China is leaving us in their rearview mirror , consider this : the Golden Dragon has doubled its wind capacity every year since 2004 .
Solar too .
I wrote a speech for California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2005 when he visited China on a trade mission .
He spoke at Tsinghua University in Beijing , “ China ’s MIT , ” and held up the world ’s most efficient solar cell , designed by Silicon Valley ’s SunPower Corporation .
The cells were being manufactured in China for export back to the states , but SunPower had to double capacity because of Chinese domestic demand .
Schwarzenegger noted that a student in the audience might design the next / better solar cell someday — and every head nodded with knowing smiles .
So while we have already lost the battle for low - cost , high - tech manufacturing , we may soon lose bragging rights and IP royalties when our designs are surpassed by China .
One reason China is leaving us in the dust is a shrewd government that has invested 40 % of its stimulus funding in green companies , compared to just 12 % by U.S. taxpayers , ensuring the rapid growth of the economic gift that keeps on giving .
They also get the money out the door — compare our Department of Energy , which is still mired in communist - era bureaucracy and can’t ever seem to pull the trigger on loan guarantees / grants for projects that actually work .
The secret is that the Chinese government fast - tracks projects that create economies of scale , recently approving a 25 square mile solar farm .
That helps Chinese companies get costs down and become even more competitive globally .
The final ingredient in the fast - rising Chinese cleantech soufflé is finance .
When I spoke in Hong Kong to investors , pension funds , and shoe shine boys with coins to invest , they are all putting money into these clean technology companies and looking for more .
That includes real estate investors , who are looking for green development projects with LEED or other certified efficiencies .
My firm , Pegasus Sustainable Century Merchant Bank , recently partnered with Ross Perot ’s Hillwood Realty to host a US tour for the China Real Estate Chamber of Commerce and 30 of their investors .
They ’re looking at green projects , but also figuring out which energy efficiency and green building products they can take back to China for use in their own developments .
But never fear : everyone I spoke to in China ’s government and private sector was very polite .
They are willing to share all of this with the rest of the world — at the right price , of course .
See you at the race track !
On academic freedom
This week the Los Angeles Times published an op -ed by Rivka Carmi , the president of Ben Gurion University .
It was a response to Neve Gordon ’s earlier op - ed announcing his support for the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel ’s occupation .
Gordon is a tenured faculty member at BGU and chairman of the international relations department .
He is also a decorated IDF veteran , an accomplished scholar , and a long - time peace advocate .
( See here for my earlier discussion of Gordon ’s op - ed , including my own disagreements with it ) .
Carmi ’s initial response to Gordon ’s article showed that she has little understanding of the core concept of academic freedom , insofar as she and her official spokesperson both made it clear that they think Gordon should consider leaving the university ( if not the country ) on account of his views .
Her op - ed makes it clear her early reactions were not just a hasty misjudgment but rather a reflection of her core values .
As such , they reveal why she is unfit for academic leadership at any institution that prizes free inquiry and open discussion .
Here ’s the key passage from Carmi ’s op -ed :
Academic freedom exists to ensure that there is an unfettered and free discussion of ideas relating to research and teaching and to provide a forum for the debate of complicated ideas that may challenge accepted norms .
Gordon , however , used his pulpit as a university faculty member to advocate a personal opinion , which is really demagoguery cloaked in academic theory .
In other words , if your research and expertise leads you to express a “ personal opinion ” on important and controversial issues , and if that opinion is n’t acceptable to your University ’s president , look out .
By her standard , an American academic who concluded and openly stated that either the invasion of Iraq or the Bush / Cheney torture regime justified an international boycott of the United States would be unfit for a faculty position and could be sanctioned by his or her university merely for stating that view .
Similarly , a scholar whose research led him or her to conclude that assassinating foreign leaders is morally or strategically preferable to invading an enemy country could also be sanctioned , because that recommendation was a “ personal opinion . ”
( Just to be clear , I ’m not endorsing either of those views , although I know a few scholars who might ) .
Needless to say , everything that scholars write is their “ personal opinion , ” based on the knowledge they have accumulated in the course of their research .
And the concept of academic freedom is intended to insulate scholars from precisely the sort of pressure that Carmi is trying to bring to bear on Gordon .
Anyone ’s research and commentary can be denounced as “ personal opinion ” if some administrator does n’t like it , or if it is inconvenient for those in charge , which is precisely why the principle is so important .
The reason we have open scholarly debate and discussion is so that we can weigh these “ personal opinions ” ( and the evidence behind them ) and come to greater collective understanding of important issues .
Carmi then reveals her real concern :
This is particularly pernicious for our university , a proudly Zionist institution that embodies the dream of Israel ’s first prime minister , David Ben-Gurion , to bring development and prosperity to all the residents of the Negev region .
This work — which includes community outreach and scientific innovation in Israel and around the world carried out by nearly 25,000 students , faculty and staff — is being threatened by the egregious remarks of one person , under the guise of academic freedom .
I ca n’t tell if Carmi believes that all BGU faculty members must be committed Zionists ( which would presumably rule out Israeli Arabs , anyone advocates of a bi-national state , or even some ultra-Orthodox Jews ) but it ’s clear from the full text that her real concern is fund - raising .
Specifically , she ’s worried that donors will punish BGU because of the views of one faculty member , and that ’s why she has to go after him in public .
But a principle like “ academic freedom ” is n’t worth much if you sell it out because it might cost you a few checks from wealthy donors .
To have the president of a university leading a public flogging like this can only have a chilling effect on the overall atmosphere .
If I were an untenured member of the faculty at BGU , or even a tenured member , and I was thinking about writing something that might be controversial , I would now have to ask myself : “ what will President Carmi think and what might she do to damage my career ? ”
Is that a situation likely to encourage free thought and discussion ?
She goes on to charge that :
Gordon has forfeited his ability to work effectively within the academic setting , with his colleagues in Israel and around the world .
After his very public , personal soul - searching in his Op - Ed article , leading to his extreme description of Israel as an “ apartheid ” state , how can he , in good faith , create the collaborative atmosphere necessary for true academic research and teaching ?
Carmi presents no evidence that Gordon “ cannot work effectively ” with his colleagues , and her claim is contradicted by the fact that nearly 200 Israeli academics and students ( including colleagues at BGU ) have already signed a petition defending him ( without necessarily endorsing his views , of course ) .
Universities are usually filled with people who disagree with each other — sometimes vehemently — and every faculty I ’ve ever been on also has a few loners who do n’t collaborate well with others and can be difficult to manage .
But presidents , deans , and other responsible administrators are supposed to hold those diverse communities of thought together , not try to drive out anyone with whom they disagree .
Yet President Carmi has said that demands that Gordon resign his post as department chair are “ legitimate , ” and that she hopes he will “ reach the right conclusions . ”
Several other aspects of this incident merit comment .
First , although Carmi obviously disagrees with what Gordon wrote — which she ’s entirely free to do — her op - ed devotes almost no space to actually refuting either his claim that Israel has become an apartheid state or his claim that an international boycott is the only way to save Israel from itself .
These are controversial assertions , to be sure , and a number of thoughtful people — including prominent leftists like Uri Avnery — have offered sharply - worded critiques of his position .
But instead of explaining why she thinks he ’s wrong — as a true scholar would — her focus is on the damage he allegedly has done to BGU and his unfitness for continued service there .
She admits she can’t fire him , but leaves little doubt that she would if she could .
Now that ’s an attitude that is likely to encourage free thought !
Second , like Phil Weiss , I suspect the LA Times printed her piece because they took a lot of heat for running Gordon ’s original op - ed .
But instead of giving the space to someone who would challenge the substance of Gordon ’s claims and recommendations , they gave the space to his boss , so that she could explain why his remarks were bad for the university she runs .
This is unfortunate , but not unusual when dealing with the always - sensitive subject of Israel in the United States .
Third , this issue is important because universities are among the last bastions of free thought and debate in many democratic societies .
The think tank world in most countries — and this includes the United States — is heavily donor - driven , and many of them exist solely to disseminate a particular world - view .
“ Academic freedom ” has little meaning in most think tanks .
Consider , for example , what would happen to you if you worked at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy — an important part of the Israel lobby — and you publicly stated that you thought Neve Gordon was right .
You would probably be fired or forced to recant , because WINEP ( and many other think tanks ) is n’t in the business of encouraging truly open inquiry .
I do n’t expect to see anyone at AEI defending socialism either , and if they did , I would n’t expect them to stay there for long .
But universities are supposed to be different .
They are also sensitive to what donors think , of course , which is why the principle of academic freedom has to be defended vigorously .
Contrary to what many people think , donors do n’t get to pick the faculty and do n’t get to determine what they say ( although some of them might like to ! ) .
But academic administrators do pay attention when donors are unhappy , which is why universities need strong and principled leaders who know where to draw the line and can stand up to outside pressure .
If they do n’t , the faculty quickly learns what might get them into trouble — even if only marginally — and many will begin to trim their sails .
The result is either scholarship that avoids controversial subjects or that confines its commentary within “ acceptable ” boundaries .
And when that happens , foolish but well - entrenched policies are less likely to be examined , and the society as a whole is more likely to suffer .
If President Carmi understood her job correctly , she would make it clear that she disagrees vehemently with Professor Gordon ’s views , while making it equally clear that she defends his right to hold and express them , and that she is proud that Ben Gurion University is an institution in which especially unpopular views can be expressed and debated .
Sadly , that is not going to happen .
Finally , the Middle East Studies Association has sent a letter to President Carmi on Gordon ’s behalf , see here .
If you ’re interested in the American Political Science Association ’s general statement on academic freedom , see here .
One more thing :
In a bizarre parallel , the New York Times reported earlier this week that government authorities in Iran are contemplating a purge of social science faculties at Iranian universities , which are believed to have been incubators of discontent as manifest following the recent elections .
In particular , some faculty members are accused of fostering “ un - Islamic ” ideas .
I ’m not suggesting that the two situations are identical , but it reminds us that once people start enforcing orthodoxy in academic settings , it can be hard to know where to stop .

I think Joe Wilson is a boor ( both Joe Wilsons , for that matter , the Republican House member from South Carolina and the former diplomat ) .
I can't watch Glenn Beck for two minutes without being repulsed by his equal parts maudlin and pompous shtick .
But members of Congress who are strangers to decorum and polite discourse , unfortunately , inhabit both parties ' caucuses , in roughly equal numbers .
President Bush labored through his state of the union addresses through loud and persistent boos by Democrats .
Maxine Waters recently called some senators " Neanderthals , " a term she reserved for moderate members of her own party .
She 's considerably less charitable to her Republican colleagues .
And the ratings wars on cable television are won by self - aggrandizing , close - minded , loudmouthed conservatives and liberals , unless one thinks Keith Olbermann built his audience share on the strength of his good manners and tolerance .
Excesses of zeal by anti-Obama protestors make me ashamed for my country .
As did excesses committed by anti-Bush protestors .
Today's " birthers , " are no more offensive or weird than those who believe the Bush Administration was complicit in planning the attacks of September 11 or invaded Iraq to increase the profits of defense companies .
And , yet , it only seems to be rude or asinine behavior on the right that gives the press and other Washington elites the vapors .
While on the left it is tolerated , attributed to provocations by the right , or in some cases invested with a virtuous significance it surely lacks .
Many thousands of demonstrators marched on the Washington Mall last Saturday to protest Democratic healthcare reform proposals , and the Obama administration 's record spending and centralization of economic power in the federal government .
The Washington Post headlined the event as " Lashing Out at the Capitol . "
I can't recall the Post using a similar verb choice to characterize the expressions of anti- war protestors , some of whom carried posters bearing President Bush 's likeness in a Nazi uniform and Hitler moustache .
Political intolerance and incivility by the left and right is as prevalent on the internet as porn , and not that much less a factor in the coarsening of our culture .
But for many reporters , anger on the right side of the web is worrying and important story .
The Huffington Post is a source .
Maureen Dowd , who usually offers readers little more than a few samples of her apparently limitless supply of silly pop culture tropes , this Sunday denounced Joe Wilson 's lack of impulse control and " lovelorn " Mark Sanford 's refusal to accept federal stimulus money as racist , and suspects the character defect is shared by most opponents to President Obama 's policies .
I 'm more than a little familiar with that calumny , having been charged along with other senior members of the McCain campaign and our candidate with the same offense .
We were somehow complicit with every intemperate jerk who shouted something obnoxious at any of our campaign events .
Our ads about Democratic support for Fannie Mae were racist .
Calling candidate Obama a " celebrity " was racist .
Shouts of " murderer " or " warmonger " by Obama supporters or our opponent 's accusation that Senator McCain was anti immigrant or trying to steal grandma 's Medicare went largely unnoticed .
And yet it was our candidate who often and publicly denounced crude or outrageous attacks on our opponent .
The courtesy was seldom returned .
McCain would have fired any staffer who said something or acted in a way that could fairly be described as racist .
For his troubles , he was likened by a leading civil rights figure and Obama supporter to the murderers who killed three little African American girls .
There was barely a murmur of protest by the press about that injustice .
When a prominent abortion doctor was murdered the shocked outrage in the press and establishment Washington was pervasive and appropriate .
As a pro-life Catholic , I 'm convinced that people who murder to advance the cause are destined for a special place in Hell .
But I do n't think it 's just my subjective perception that the murder of a disabled pro-life protestor was met with considerably less interest and outrage here .
I despair of the coarsening of our politics and our broader culture .
So much so that after a lifetime in politics I 'm beginning to think I might have rendered more honorable service to humanity had I worked in professional wrestling .
That independents , who decide elections in this country , seem to feel the same way is enough encouragement to hope that perhaps we are still capable of reform .
But our political discourse wo n't begin to recover any civility until we get some referees back in the game , who will call bullshit on both sides .

In preparation for swine - flu vaccinations next month , Washington ’s Health Department on Thursday temporarily suspended a rule that limits the amount of a mercury preservative in vaccines given to pregnant women and children under the age of 3 .
The preservative , thimerosal , has never been linked to any health problems , said Secretary of Health Mary Selecky .
But a vocal minority believes the compound could be linked to autism .
The state Legislature adopted the limit in 2006 .
Thimerosal has been eliminated from most vaccines in the United States , but it will be added to the bulk of the swine - flu vaccine being produced to stem a pandemic that health officials estimate could sicken more than a third of the state ’s residents .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Pregnant women and young children are considered at high risk for swine flu , and lifting the mercury limits will give them quicker access to the vaccine , Selecky said .
“ It ’s vital that everyone in a high - risk group has the choice to be vaccinated when swine - flu vaccine becomes available , ” she said .
Full story here .

The existence of evil : the real divide between libertarians and social conservatives
Hopefully , this post wo n't offend anyone , libertarian or conservative .
My intent is not to assess the truth of either of these views , but merely to determine the degree to which they are compatible .
While I 'd like to offer definitions of both positions -- both libertarian and social conservative -- doing so would immediately embroil this post in debates I would like it to avoid .
In any event , I do n't have an exhaustive definition of either term , and descriptions of social conservatism , like this one are worse than useless .
Rather , I would like to suggest one point , only one , on which libertarians and social conservatives differ .
They may differ in other respects , but this one difference can explain much or all of the variance between the two positions .
There is a common view , and it used to be more common , that politics is a matter of applied morality .
Relatively speaking , the idea that " you ca n't legislate morality " is of recent vintage , and even the people who now declare their allegiance to it probably do n't believe what they are saying .
Not really ; but it is a fashionable thing to say , and so the fashionable left says it .
Repeatedly .
Until it becomes nauseating .
There can be no complete separation between politics and morality .
To take a trivial example , murder laws track the moral prohibition on killing .
The distinction between murder and manslaughter depends on our suspicion that malicious intent adds to one 's moral responsibility .
The question , therefore , is not whether morality should drive politics , but the degree to which it should do so .
On one end of the scale , law prohibits every immoral act , and political institutions are used to ensure that people make good choices for their lives and the lives of others .
On the other end , politics is completely detached from morality , or even opposed to it , so that citizens are commanded to act immorally .
We want to find a principled basis for stopping somewhere between these two extremes .
The libertarian has one , or thinks he does : law is violence , and so it is fitting that it be used only to prohibit violence .
Violent actions are particularly immoral -- or immoral in a special way -- and this is why the line must be drawn at this point and no other .
The libertarian claims that only part of morality should drive politics , the part that prohibits violence , but that otherwise government and morality ought to be kept at arms ' length .
Thus , while the libertarian may recognize that there are better and worse ways to live , he will only make use of the law when it is necessary to protect people from the violent actions of others .
He may believe , and be right to believe , that non-violent drug users tend to live poorly from a moral point of view .
Their lives may be shallow and empty , but as long as they refrain from inflicting violence on others , the law will not intervene .
So says the libertarian .
The social conservative has a different perspective .
Despite what some may think , I have quite a bit of sympathy for that perspective , and hopefully that will prevent me from drawing a caricature .
First , the social conservative recognizes that those who live poorly often encourage others to live poorly .
The very presence of the non-violent drug user can lead others to live worse lives than they would otherwise .
Moreover , a culture of irresponsible and intemperate drug- abusers will be unable to sustain a commitment to important values and principles , including ones the libertarian hopes to rely on .
The law can prevent this , and should prevent it .
The libertarian has a response to this way of thinking .
Rational persuasion , social stigma and economic forces will keep people in line , the response goes .
The invisible hand will ensure that society does not sink into a miasma of cannabis smoke .
Violence is unnecessary .
There are reasons to reject this response .
Some are rooted in history ( China 's experience with opium is an oft - cited example . )
But grander than history , tradition and theology teach another lesson : evil exists , and that 's the way most people like it .
Running counter to the magnetism of rationality or the pull of the invisible hand , there is evil .
Indeed , evil , reason , and economics sometimes work together , reinforcing each other , birthing new , more efficient kinds of perversions and devastation .
" Of course evil exists , " the libertarian declares .
" Violence is evil , is n't it ? "
Of course , that 's not what the existence of evil means to the conservative , or not only .
What does it mean for evil to exist ?
I think one of Dostoevsky 's characters , the narrator of Notes From Underground , had it about right : humans really like to do what they know they ought not do .
If a person realizes he is living poorly , this may be precisely the motivation he needs to encourage others to live the same way .
If another recognizes that it would be better , all things considered , if he did X , he is just as likely to spurn X in favor of Y .
This is not the banal evil of Hannah Arendt , but the primal evil , the first evil , the evil of Milton 's Lucifer , who once declared , " Evil , be thou my good ! "
If humans are enmeshed in this kind of evil , born into it , then rationality and economic forces will be insufficient to curtail the destructive impulses of the masses .
Evil , by this standard , becomes rational : absent the violence of the state , it is rational for the drug addict to create other drug addicts , and for the corrupt to corrupt others .
For the " supply " of evil to be curtailed by diminishing " demand " -- there must be diminishing demand for evil , not an ever - increasing appetite for it .
The libertarian draws the line .
The conservative says , " That 's not good enough .
It permits too much evil to flourish .
And evil will eventually wipe away that line , too , and the result will be more violence than you ever thought possible . "
At this point , the libertarian has a response : " You are right that limiting the role of government permits evil to flourish .
You have to accept that .
The alternative is a more powerful government , one that can use its power to create more evil .
Limiting government , keeping evil on an individual scale -- that 's the better bet . "
I 've come to think that this response is a dodge .
I call it a dodge .
Why ?
Because it 's not necessarily the better bet .
There is no evidence that allowing individuals to spawn as much evil as they please ( except violence ) results in less evil .
There is no evidence that governments , given the constitutionally - limited power to quash evil , will all turn into versions of Nazi Germany .
In addition , the conservative can agree with the libertarian that governments given an unlimited mandate to quash evil will themselves become evil .
But that is not what the conservative wants ; what he wants is not unlimited power but some power ; not the ability to crush evil no matter the cost , but the ability to nibble at evil , around the edges , and to keep it on a leash .
Outside prohibiting violence , the libertarian thinks government ought to leave evil alone .
The conservative thinks government ought to engage it -- defeat it -- sometimes .
The choice is not that of liberty or fascism , but that of freeing evil from political control , trusting other forms of social control to fully contain it , or giving government a role in doing so .
It should be noted that the liberal and the libertarian do not necessarily clash in this way .
The liberal -- and here I mean the modern , " progressive " variety -- does not believe in evil the way the conservative does , as John Kekes has pointed out .
To the liberal , evil does not exist , or at least does not exist as a natural force .
For example , the non-violent drug addict is not evil , but sick .
Terrorists who kill children are not evil , but the product of corrupt institutions and U.S. foreign policy .
Naturally , people are good , or at least decent ; if they do n't act that way , it 's because other , un-natural forces are at work ( like religion , with its scrupulous , stifling moral codes , etc . )
It is not freedom but that lack of it that causes people to behave in an evil fashion , or so says the progressive .
While this way of thinking can be traced at least as far back as Rousseau , it 's unfair to put all the blame on him .
If people have a natural inclination towards evil , then we should expect people to be drawn to ideas that glamorize that inclination and denigrate the institutional forces that , in the past , kept it in check .
In this respect , Rousseau is just a scapegoat , and we might as well blame Satan .
But , in some sense , the liberal and the libertarian agree that more individual freedom is the answer to the problem of evil .
Leave people alone , let them make decisions for themselves , and they 'll end up seeking the good and shunning the bad .
This is why I said there is no real clash between the liberal position and the libertarian one , at least as far as evil is concerned .
If I 'm right , then the root of the conflict between libertarians and social conservatives is an old one .
This is not to say that libertarians can't believe in evil as thoroughly as conservatives do .
However , I 'm not sure they can believe in it in precisely the same way .
Let 's consider the example of violence .
Often , violence is an evil .
But almost no one ( except maybe the progressive liberal ) thinks that violence can't be put to good use .
If a small amount of violence can prevent a great amount of evil , then that might be reason enough to support the use of violence .
Fortunately ( here , libertarians will disagree , and I will disagree with them ) , modern government has gotten quite good at being economical in its use of violence .
The barest threat -- the frown of the police officer ; the possibility of an tax audit -- is enough to get most people to comply .
Thus , the very efficiency of the modern state , its ability to use small amounts of violence for very great effect , makes it difficult to sensibly reject unleashing the state against the threat of evil .
If you believe in evil , of course .
The libertarian who both believes in evil and believes that the state should not be unleashed to combat it has the burden of explaining why .
In what follows , I 'll call the libertarian who believes in evil ( beyond the infliction of violence ) a conservative - libertarian , and attempt to meet the burden he bears .
Here is one explanation : violence is evil to such a degree that its use can never be sanctioned , not even against ( by implication ) lesser evils .
The drug user lives poorly and encourages others to do the same , but we do even worse if we bring violence against him .
This has to be the comparison the conservative - libertarian has in mind : using violence against people who live evil lives is worse than allowing them to continue and spread their evil .
But if this is the idea , then , frankly , it sounds silly .
A tiny amount of violence , directed at a few , evil people , to prevent them from spreading their evil further .
And still , that 's too much ?
On every occasion ?
But why ?
What makes a small amount of violence -- neutered , and under the control of legions of bureaucrats -- so bad that it can never be used in this way ?
What the libertarian needs to say , I think , is that it is an injustice to use violence just to get people to make good choices .
That it is wrong to force people to live good lives .
That we can not use the smallest amount of violence to make the world a better place .
But this sounds absurd , and must sound absurd to social conservatives .
Thus , I submit that the libertarian , to avoid this absurdity , cannot believe in evil the way the social conservative believes in evil .
He must believe in evil the way liberals believe in evil : that it is unnatural , and that more freedom will , over time , lead to less of it .
This is not to say the libertarian can't believe the drug addict is living poorly , that his life would be better if he made different choices .
But he must believe that , given sufficient freedom , the vast majority of people will not choose to follow the drug addict into perdition .
Evil is always the exception and never the rule .

Shane , I 'm really curious as to what you 'll think of this post .
The conversations we 've had served as a model , at least to a degree .
Hopefully I have n't invented a straw conservative , as I was trying to be sympathetic .
Posted by : Terrence Watson | 2009-06-14 5:16:42 PM
I do n't believe in evil , in the religious sense , as some sort of universal force .
I also do n't think that people are naturally good .
I do think the state should be limited to ensuring people do n't use violence against each other because I think people can , and should , be trusted to make their own decisions , regardless of whether others think them good or evil .
Some people think doing recreational drugs and having sex with prostitutes is evil , others do not .
Who are we to judge right and wrong as long as no one is getting hurt ?
It is due to my belief that people are not naturally good that I think we should have less government involvement in our lives and in the economy .
The beauty of the market economy is that it accepts that people are naturally greedy and self - centered and harnesses this in order to make everyone else better off .
Posted by : Jesse Kline | 2009-06-14 7:46:35 PM
Jesse ,
At some point , I 'll write a follow up post addressing the kind of view you espoused , which -- I do n't think I 'm wrong about this -- you find more often in liberals than conservatives .
But if you believe in evil as present and pervasive , you 're also going to think that people engaged in destructive ways of life ( e.g. the drug - addict ) are n't always going to admit or even see the true nature of their lifestyles .
That 's just the way evil works .
So you 're not going to trust people to pick good lives -- at least , not without some help from a surrounding culture that 's informed , nuturing , and willing to condemn evil unambiguously .
In other words , the culture better not be broadcasting a " Who am I to judge ? " message , because people will take advantage of that permisiveness to choose the worst lives they can .
The conservative is more than willing to answer the " Who 's to say that X is evil ? " question , drawing on tradition and human nature to do so ( or on religious bigotry , as Mike Brock would surely add . )
And as soon as we go to the place where we 're no longer willing to make such judgments , I think we 've left the social conservative behind .

When one says that you cannot legislate morality , much depends on what he actually means .
I have stated the same in the sense that you cannot force a person to be moral through legislation .
However , I also recognise that the foundation of any legal system is based on morality .
What varies of course is whose version of morality it is based .
I tend to agree that on a whole most vice laws should not exist , but there is a large difference between the state not criminalising victimless vices and the state rewarding bad behaviour .
An example ( yes I know it is certain to draw the wrath of some ) is homosexuality between consenting adults .
A truly neutral state would neither criminalise it nor condone it .
It would allow those who reject the life style the freedom to express their views , the freedom not to associate and the freedom to deny access on private property .
They would never however have the freedom to use or to promote the use of violence to enforce their views .
Homosexuals would also have exactly the same freedoms .
I prefer to stay clear of labels , such as libertarian or social conservative , since I find so little consistency in the people identifying with one or the other .
For example I find some in both camps who ignore or deny human nature .
Be they fundamental atheists or religious people who are fundamentalist , they both believe that human nature is perfectible while denying that we are all capable of the most extreme evil or the highest good .
They thus promote either a theocracy or a secular totalitarianism in order to accomplish their earthly utopia .
Both invariably resort to persecuting , incarcerating and killing those who do not conform .
Posted by : Alain | 2009-06-14 8:25:09 PM
Alain ,
You make some good points , especially regarding labeling .
I started out trying to define the two terms , and found it was next to impossible .
The most I could do was contrast them , in some small way .
You 're right that there are some religious folks who seem to want to bring about the kingdom of heaven on earth , and perhaps they do think of themselves as conservatives .
In a sense , they might be : they believe that some lives are evil , and that , left to their own devices , people will choose evil over good .
The difference might be that sensible conservatives recognize that the most you can do is " keep evil on a leash . "
You ca n't eliminate it .
You can't bring about heaven on earth .
But , at the same time , you can't let it run its course unobstructed .
At the same time , I did appreciate John McCain 's answer to the question he was asked by Rick Warren , with regard to what we should do about evil : confront it , negotiate with it , etc .
McCain said , gruffly , " Defeat it . "
Obama 's answer was quite a bit longer and I do n't even remember most of it .
That one answer revealed something about both conservatives and liberals , at least in my mind .

Interesting thoughts .
It would probably be useful to define evil , and define the intended function of government .
Whether your ethical framework was delivered to you by parents , religion , culture , or personal investigation , no two people 's ethical frameworks are identical .
However , there can be common ground .
Ethics are the touchstone by which one judges good versus evil .
Since ethics vary – especially at the grayer borders – so , then does each person 's evaluation of good and evil .
Finding that common ground where all agree on evil is harder as the number of people involved increases .
Limiting the governmental or legal definition of evil to " initiated physical force by one citizen towards another " avoids the ethical calculus required when asking to government to enforce everyone 's set of ethics on everyone else .
This leads me to considering the proper function of government .
Is it to " combat evil " ?
What is its charter ?
Given the events of the last decade or so as an American , I 've found myself reading more of the founding its documents and the philosophies that inspired them .
In the American Declaration of Independence I was struck by a passage which I had read before , but had n't fully appreciated :
" We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just Powers from the consent of the governed … "
Governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed .
The people delegate just powers to a government in order to accomplish something .
What ?
" In order to secure these rights " .
America 's founders instituted government TO SECURE RIGHTS .
They did not institute government to fight evil .
They did not institute government to control bad people .
While this is strictly an assertion by America 's founders and by no means intended to be a statement of universal fact .
I find I wholeheartedly agree with the concept .
I do not expect you to live for my sake , or up to my definition of good , or to eschew my definition of evil – so long as neither you nor I initiate force upon each other and threaten our unalienable rights .
" The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire . "

I do n't believe that most of us are inherently evil or good .
There is sufficient evidence to convince me that many of us are intellectually lazy .
We do not take the time or the effort to search for and recognize the " good " .
If we find it we tend to follow the first rule of plumbing and do what appears on the surface to be the easy route .
This will invariably lead us to the wrong conclusion .
Then , like the purchaser who has bought a lemon ( car ) we rationalize our actions and never expend the energy to recover .
Living an life of integrity requires moral courage , something that is sadly lacking in many of us .

Good Grief !!
One of the definitions of evil according to social conservatives is ...' living poorly ' ?
Have I got that right ?
If so , it 's not that libertarian minded folks do n't believe in evil they certainly do , but they would n't lump making poor choices or living poorly in with it .
Posted by : Farmer Joe | 2009-06-14 9:06:53 PM
Farmer Joe ,
I would n't say that living poorly is the definition of evil ( and I did n't mean to imply that it was . )
But shunning virtue and goodness creeps close to evil , even if it does n't involve inflicting violence on others .
Encouraging others to do the same probably qualifies completely .
This all assumes , of course , that there is something like " objectively better or worse ways of living " , and that we should , other things being equal , try to live good , virtuous lives .
From talking to conservatives , I get the impression they'd be willing to leave , e.g. , Marc Emery alone if they thought his brand of " evil " would be confined to his own life .
But they know ( or believe ) that corruption has a way of spreading until it affects society as a whole .
I 'm waiting to hear from Shane , but I 'm pretty sure he 's said something like that on occasion .

Ca n't a person 's belief system be a mixture of both social conservatism and libertarianism ?
In addition , social conservatism sometimes means different things to differnt people .
In New Zealand , we have three main parties ( ACT , National , and New Zealand First ) .
All of them have a mix of libertarian and social conservative policies .
Furthermore , some of them differ greatly on what would be a conservative position .
1. ) ACT describes itself as a free market liberal party .
It supports reducing the top corporate and income tax rates to 15 % .
It wants to reduce the GST to 10 % .
It supports school vouchers and a taxpayer bill of rights .
The party is firmly for gun owner rights .
It supports the reestablishemnt of private prisons .
On a free vote , the party voted 5 - 4 for legalizing civil unions .
It also supported legalizing prostitution .
Yet , the party also has some rather conservative positions .
It is the toughest on crime and supported a 3 strike law .
It also supports zero tolerance policing and seizing criminals assets for victim reparations .
In addition , it supports expanding the New Zealand military to 30,000 ( more than doubling it ) .
The party also opposed the ban on smacking children .
Finally , an independent survey showed that most ACT candidates are pro-life .
2. ) National is the largest center - right party .
It wants tax cuts but as large as the numbers ACT calls for .
The same is true on defense .
It wants parents to have more say in their childrens education but will not make any statements about vouchers .
It takes no real position on guns .
It
has adopted ACT 's crime policy .
Also , most of its members are pro-life and anti-stem cell .
It has butted heads with ACT on the Civil Union bill , the Prostitution bill , and the anti-smacking ban .
3. ) New Zealand
First is the final significant right - leaning party .
It supports tax cuts but opposes free trade .
It wants to help small businesses but condemns multinational corporations .
It calls for helping the elderly but keeping out asian immigrants .
It is supportive of gun rights and takes a tough position on crime policy .
It calls for supporting the traditional family .
It 's leader Winston Peters is mixed race ( Maori and White ) and a former National Party man who rambles incessantly about asian immigrants destroying New Zealand culture .
He also has a thing about giant corporations taking control of the country .
He views the other two parties as too close to big business .
So , we have three parties with differing views of conservatism .
For example , New Zealand First wants to wall the country off from the outside and promote traditional New Zealand values .
Meanwhile , ACT is the most supportive of reducing the size of government but also adopts the hardest line on crime and defense which are not libertarian , right ?
National has parts of each but is not as hardline .
Which is the true libertarian ?
Which is the true conservative ?
It comes down to individual choice does n't it ?

" shunning virtue and goodness creeps close to evil , even if it does n't involve inflicting violence on others . "
I do n't eat as well as I should , and have been shunning regular exercise for at least five years now ( probably more ) .
Trying to make ends meet with three kids a ( mostly ) stay at home wife and three levels of government breathing down my neck is keeping me kind of busy .
Never the less eating well and exercising regularly can objectively be said to be more virtuous than what I am doing .
Does this make me evil ?

Faith on the providence of Government is dangerous .
Like faith in the providence of that other Claimant to Omnipotence , it defies all known evidence and experience .
Sorry to disillusion you .
The State , by definition , claims a MONOPOLY on the use of coercive force within a geographical region .
What makes you expect an entity that claims a monopoly on one form of " evil " to do good , even even on balance - and supposing the True Human Good could be defined .
I have only one question :
What planet do you live on ?
Posted by : Grant Brown | 2009-06-15 12:57:03 AM
Grant ,
I think the conservative agrees with you about the danger of government , which is why he does n't support a government with an unlimited power to smite evil - doers .
But he also perceives a danger in leaving evil without any political opposition .
Why can't there be a balance ?
A government with a limited mandate to combat those evils recognized as such by tradition and common mandate ?
That 's not my position , but I can see the sense in it .
Of course , if the idea of an objective human good is rejected , and " good " is reduced to " whatever satisfies a person 's preferences " , then my post does n't apply .
But that would be an even larger divide between conservatives and libertarians than the one I identified .
If libertarianism vs. conservatism is really subjectivists vs. objectivists , any attempt to bridge the gap will be completely hopeless .

How does one objectively define evil for all individuals in a country ?

Interesting piece that really does n't get libertarians at all .
Some of it smacks of the typical conservative hit - piece that makes us libertarians to be no better than socialists .
The wanting to meddle gene in social conservatives help create the modern organised crime movement ( thanks to booze prohibition ) and is continuing to sustain drug lords all over the world ( drug prohibition ) .
Rather than accepting that some people are stupid and let them get on with killing themselves with drugs , you have to meddle .
So -cons are just as meddling as the socialist they just derive their " mission " to meddle from a religious drive .
So-cons are happy to collectively the entire population because of the few idiots who abuse or misuse something or are mentally unstable .
So -cons treat the population as either naive children or idiots incapable of dealing with life .
In that sense they are no different than socialists .
So -cons think the best of people are shocked when they turn out bad .
Libertarians are naturally and properly cynical of their fellow man and act accordingly .

Akston , evil is usually defined as malevolence and a desire to make others suffer , or at least a depraved indifference as to whether one 's actions cause others to suffer .
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2009-06-15 6:53:16 AM
For myself , evil does exist but only when someone deliberately goes out to harm someone else .
I honestly cannot fathom , for example , how someone doing drugs can be evil .
It may be stupid behaviour , but evil ?
So in essence I 'd have to agree with you , we obviously do n't define evil in the same way .
Posted by : Charles | 2009-06-15 6:54:33 AM
Andrew , what did I get wrong about libertarianism ?
1. Violence is evil
2 . Since laws are backed up by violence , they should only be used to prevent or respond to violence .
3 . Therefore , laws should not be used to limit or quash non-violent forms of evil , if there is such a thing .
That 's about right , is n't it ?
I know some prefer the term aggression to violence , but that does n't seem to matter in this context .

In this post , the " primal evil " I had in mind can be defined as a deliberate shunning of virtue and pursuit of vice , regardless of long term cost to self or society .
Of course , we still need to know what defines virtue and vice , but I left that open .
Around here , enough libertarians have told me that they agree ( roughly ) with conservatives about what virtue and vice involve .
They just disagree about what the state should do ( if anything ) about non-violent evil .
That was my starting point : supposing that a libertarian does agree with the conservative about virtue and vice , can a laissez - faire approach to non-violent forms of evil be justified ?
Posted by : Terrence Watson | 2009-06-15 7:07:02 AM
" ...

hm " if anything ? " are you still on that 911 as the home number of the Nanny State stuff ???
this resolves a lot of mystery as libertarians defend Marc Emery to the steel gates of prison -- I never knew why otherwise sane people slipped into irrational thinking .
Its this obsession with violence - and as long as your heros do n't hit anybody they are doing everything correctly .
The moral thermometer here is slaps and punches , the hallmark of the gradeschool bully ..
So if criminal intent and social corruption is done with a " hands to oneself " policy every other excess , corruptive act of fraud or acting as distributor of toxic , dangerous and / or otherwise undesireable things to other people is just fine with you guys .
Sheesh ..
And then you jump on anyone who dares to define toxic - dangerous and especially " undesirable . " .
Well OK then .. thats why Libertarianism will always be an endangered species , , its lack of discernment passing itself off as open minded .
And if Libertines are still standing shoulder to shoulder with their Bi Polar Prince of Pot since his surrender and four star absurd TV interviews last week ... well maybe you will regroup at the nearest restaurant when your freedom hero # 0003 drops out of formation .
and when you get a chance , move all the lower numbered freedom heros up one notch .

" Then set me straight .
Most libertarians on this blog have yet to define a government or government policy -- any government , any policy -- in any terms except as an evil to be eradicated . "
When it comes to economics this is true , libertarians would like to see a separation of the economy and the state in the same way that we have a separation of church and state and for the same reason .
But that does not mean no government at all , it means a more minimal government than we have now .
The only proper functions of a government are : the police , to protect you from criminals ; the army , to protect you from foreign invaders ; and the courts , to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud by others , to settle disputes by rational rules , according to objective law .
But a government that initiates force against men who had forced no one , the employment of armed compulsion against disarmed victims , is a nightmare infernal machine designed to annihilate morality : such a government reverses its only moral purpose and switches from the role of protector to the role of man ’s deadliest enemy , from the role of policeman to the role of a criminal vested with the right to the wielding of violence against victims deprived of the right of self - defense .
Such a government substitutes for morality the following rule of social conduct : you may do whatever you please to your neighbor , provided your gang is bigger than his .

Depending on the drug , it can be evil because getting hooked on such drugs can and does have ill effects on the people around the addict , not just the addict .
The addict knows this , and knew it going in , but did not and does not care .
Hence , evil .
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2009-06-15 8:42:09 AM
Now one of my problems with the Liberitarian position on pot is that the argument gets framed as having the freedome to do the wrong thing .
I want more freedom ( such as being able to sell my own wheat for instance ) so that I can do the right things for myself and my family ( like buy my own medical insurance ) .
But as Ghandi once said , " Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes . "
When government gets to involved in deciding what are good or bad choices for people the worse things get because they usually get it wrong .
I am told the government can do a much better job than I could selling my own wheat yet when I look across the border into an open market I find that many times I could have sold all my wheat on the worst day for the worst price and still done better than the government did .
On their best day they still only net me a below average return .
Yes if I sold my own grain I might make worse decisions , but it is highly unlikely .

No , it is not evil unless the addict somehow initiates the use of force .
That is the line that must be crossed .

F.J. ,
1 . The reason the economy and the state are not separated is because the lessons of the early 20th century , not least of which was the Great Depression , showed us the downfalls of such a laissez - faire approach .
Granted , without government restriction , meteoric rises in wealth were possible , as evinced in the 1920s .
But when the party ends and the hangover begins , it 's one hell of a hangover .
While the New Deal was a failure , government regulation of the economy does serve to take the harder edges off of it .
There has not been another depression as bad as the 1929 since .
2. , 3 . The problem with that is that a government performing even those minimal duties would require some form of revenue , meaning taxes in some form would have to be levied .
Since the government has to use the threat of force to ensure compliance ( who would pay tax if they did n't have to ? ) , we have already run afoul of point number 3 .
Policing also requires the threat of force , miring us further .
And then there is schooling : compulsory , public , and free .
Plus the child - labour laws which keep children in school and out of the factories to which some parents would doubtless send them if they had the choice .
Your model of government may have been possible in Jefferson 's 18th - century rural America , F.J. , but not today .
If that is truly how you want to live , I suggest you overcome your aversion to religion , if you have one , and move to an Amish community .
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2009-06-15 8:53:11 AM
I must say Shane you have an amazing ability to get almost everything wrong .
The Great Depression was caused by Government interference and it was the worst in places where the government interfered the most .
The voluntary taxation issue is so far down the line from where we are now it does n't need to be discussed but it is most certainly possible .
And the one thing about force / violence that you so - con 's always seem to get wrong is that it is not evil in and of itself .
It is wrong to initiate the use of physical force against someone .
But one certainly has the right to use it in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use .
That is the job of the police .
You seem to believe that the ends justify the means that you can do something wrong ( use force against those who have done nothing to you ) to achieve a so called ' greater good ' .
Well you can't .

" You seem to believe that the ends justify the means that you can do something wrong ( use force against those who have done nothing to you ) to achieve a so called ' greater good ' .
Well you can't . "
And as far as I can tell that is the biggest difference between Libertarian types and Social Conservatives .
Social Conservatives seem to have a great desire to use the governments monopoly over physical force not to protect peoples rights but to violate them in an effort to create their perfect world .
To force people to be " better " .
This is wrong and it is immoral .
You can certainly encourage people to live better lives but once you step over the line and start forcing them to do so you are the one who is in the wrong .

In contrast there is no reason to believe that a persons child would be a slave in a system that puts individual rights at the top of the priority list .
Your argument is a red herring .

Well Shane , I can't speak for others but I can speak for myself .
I 'm not an anarchist .
The state should exist but in a very minimal form , to protect its citizens rights .
It should not be interfearing in the economy or in peaceful activities .
" Granted , without government restriction , meteoric rises in wealth were possible , as evinced in the 1920s . "

" I must say Shane you have an amazing ability to get almost everything wrong . "
Uh huh .
This is not going to be one of your better efforts ; I can tell that much already .
" The Great Depression was caused by Government interference and it was the worst in places where the government interfered the most . "
Actually , it was caused by the stock market crash .
The Roaring Twenties bubble burst , and since there had been no regulatory limits on how big that bubble was allowed to get , its breaking was catastrophic .
By the way , since government intrusion today is even worse than it was in the 1930s , do you have an alternative explanation for why another Great Depression has not recurred ?
" The voluntary taxation issue is so far down the line from where we are now it does n't need to be discussed but it is most certainly possible . "
What are you basing that on , F.J. ?
Would YOU pay tax if you did n't have to ?
Would you pay more to make up for those who did n't ?
If you can say this with a straight face than you are totally delusional .
" And the one thing about force / violence that you so - con 's always seem to get wrong is that it is not evil in and of itself .
It is wrong to initiate the use of physical force against someone .
But one certainly has the right to use it in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use .
That is the job of the police . "
But the police are also allowed to arrest you for non-violent crimes , and even to shoot you if you do them no hurt but merely approach in a manner they decide is threatening and refuse to back off .
Yes I can , yes the government can , and moreover , yes the government does .
Sucks to be you .

Did n't read the whole post .
You 've oversimplified the libertarian view of evil .
I think it is better summed up as " interfering with the pursuits of others through force or fraud is evil . "
Hence :
-- Hurting self by taking drugs ( not evil )
-- Violently attacking a forest to make furniture ( not evil )
-- Selling a pound of flour as a pound of cocaine ( evil )
-- Having an abortion ( depends on whether the libertarian in question considers the fetus a person )
-- Putting your competition out of business by spreading rumors about them ( evil )
-- Putting your competition out of business by having a superior product ( not evil )
" violence = evil " is nowhere even close to accurate , and that idea seems to form part of the basis of this post .

Posted by : Akston | 2009-06-15 3:47:48 PM
Akston ,
Probably by starting with the one that affects judgment -- an individual 's own meager defense against evil -- more than the others .
But the sheer level of destructiveness would also have to be considered .
Fatty foods tend to be unhealthy , but at least they leave people with the judgment necessary to know they are unhealthy .
And , while they can mess you up , at least it 's not permanent .
Exercise is always an option .
Like I was saying , I do n't think the point is to eliminate evil , but to contain it .
It 's the belief that legal containment might be necessary that separates the conservative from the libertarian .
Posted by : Terrence Watson | 2009-06-15 4:22:21 PM
" It 's the belief that legal containment might be necessary that separates the conservative from the libertarian . "
I would agree that it 's one of the differences .
It 's been my experience that one man 's line where an action becomes evil can often be slightly or wholly different from another's .
That difference is based on each man 's ethical framework .
When laws shift from defending citizen 's rights to enforcing one man 's ethics over another , one can as easily be the " enforcee " as the enforcer .
And the lines are always drawn by subset of the country and imposed on a dissenting subset .
And whether the subset of citizens which established the socially conservative law is a majority or just a vocal minority , that subset is comprised of citizens who are not necessarily wiser , more saintly , or even better informed than the citizens they intend to control .
They are simply more powerful , owing to their use of governmental force .
Social conservatives support governmental coercion to contain social evils , socialists and communists support governmental coercion to contain what they see as the evil of disproportionate distribution of wealth .
Same means , different end .
Many historical atrocities start as small and well - meaning encroachments and abuses of power .

The most commonly accepted liberties -- those of speech , press , religion , conscience , and so forth -- are traditionally violated not by individuals , but by the state .
So in effect you 're saying that the role of the state is to protect the people from -- the state .
Nice bit of circular reasoning .
" What 's your point exactly ?
The only way that hyperinflation ( or any inflation ) can occur is if the money supply is increased at a faster pace than the economy can grow . "
The printing of money is but one step on the road to hyperinflation , and is never the root cause .
That 's my point .
As you seem to now realize , but can't quite force yourself to admit .
I 'd drop it , but you wo n't let the matter rest .
" The 1920 's madness was created by an overly expansionist monetary policy coupled with government guarantees on a bunch of loans ?

The 1920s madness was a classic economic bubble .
The exact causes of the Depression are still being debated .
Experts remain divided , and in spite of your iconoclastic posturing , you 're not going to convince me that you know better than the best economic minds of two centuries .

" True .

I 'll agree to avoid Godwin , though the road leads where it leads .
Whether we start down it , and how far we tolerate going , is up to us .
Perhaps " any regulation or restriction " is an inaccurate reading of the point .
Are there classes of regulation and restriction ?
Or are they all of the same type ?
Can we discern differences ?
Blurring the lines between protecting rights and enforcing some group 's ethical world view actually facilitates movement between anarchy and totalitarianism .
When all restrictions are the same type , more is just more .
When there are classes of restrictions , some restrictions may be off the table .
I prefer a government which is constitutionally constrained to defending citizens ' rights over a government which is used as a cudgel to enforce one group 's ethical world view over the rest .

THE JUNE 29 op - ed “ Walking miles in Palestinian feet ’’ by Claire Messud was excellent .
As a peace activist who has been to Israel , the occupied West Bank , Gaza Strip , and East Jerusalem eight times , I cannot stress enough the importance of experiencing Palestinian life under Israeli rule .
Americans are largely ignorant of facts on the ground - from petty things , such as the refusal of the Israeli government to pick up trash in Palestinian neighborhoods inside Israel , to nightmarish policies , such as the demolition of Palestinian homes , seizure of Palestinian land , and killing of Palestinian civilians .
Few things inform better than firsthand experience .
There are many fine organizations that help Americans be eyewitnesses to Israeli policy and its cruel impact on Palestinians .
I pray that more Americans , such as Messud , will go and see for themselves how US tax dollars are being misused to crush the Palestinians .

Most shoppers know the feeling .
You stand in front of piles of organic produce and wonder what those premium prices are buying you over and above what you get from budget foods .
A new study has concluded that , on nutrition grounds , the answer is nothing .
But we are missing the point when we worry about the nutritional pros and cons of organic food ?
The problem is that head - to - head comparisons between organic and conventional crops , which the media loves to focus on , leave no room for other contenders .
There are many ways of farming and some offer advantages over others .
By obsessing over just one aspect of food production – whether it is organic or not – we lose sight of other important issues , like the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from farms , and the vital question of increasing food supply and security .

‘ Wrong question ’
“ It ’s not about whether organic food is good or a sham , ” says Jules Pretty , an agricultural scientist at the University of Essex in Colchester , UK .
“ That ’s the wrong question .
We should be asking how we can make all of agriculture more sustainable . ”
Understanding nutrition is , of course , still vital when it comes to choosing food .
A team from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine examined 162 papers that compared organic and conventionally produced food : they concluded that there was no evidence to back up claims that organic food contains more of the nutrients that matter to human health .
So it seems consumers should not buy organic food purely on health grounds .
However , nutrition is only one of the aspects of food that shoppers care about , and the situation becomes more complex when these other issues are factored in .
Pros and cons
Take energy use .
Some organic farming systems have been shown to be more energy efficient than conventional farming methods , partly because they do not use synthetic fertilisers , which are energy intensive to produce and release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
Yet organic farms themselves could improve the way they work .
Pretty says that some use propane burners , which produce CO 2 , to keep weeds down .
But there is limited pressure on organic farmers to cut emissions because they do n’t have to do so in order to qualify for organic status .
Soil erosion is another problem area .
Many organic farms emphasise crop rotation , in part to ensure that fields are not left uncovered and vulnerable to erosion .
But some organic farmers actually cause erosion by tilling the soil frequently , again to keep down weeds .
Conventional farmers often use chemicals to tackle plant pests , but these come with problems of their own .
Defining goals
“ Organic agriculture is not without environmental consequences , ” says Laurie Drinkwater , an expert in sustainable agriculture at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York .
Rather than compare organic and conventional systems using simplistic comparisons , Drinkwater and Pretty say we should start by identifying the things we want from farms .
Food production is the obvious one , but farmers can also help boost biodiversity , keep rivers free of certain kinds of pollution , and fight climate change .
There is also the question of animal welfare .
Farming systems should then be judged on how far they go towards meeting all those goals .
The result would probably be a system that borrows techniques from many existing methods .
That would be good news for farmers and the rest of society , even if it might not produce so many snappy headlines .

A Brazilian art restorer has discovered a new layer hidden in a centuries - old painting of the Greek god of fertility Priapus by French artist Nicolas Poussin - the deity 's erect penis .
" They hid the phallus of Priapus .
It 's what we call adjustment for modesty , and it's not uncommon , " said Regina Pinto Moreira , quoted in Tuesday 's edition of the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper .
She suspects the cover - up was made in conservative Catholic Spain in the 18th century .
Ms Moreira , who worked as an master art restorer at the Louvre in Paris for some 30 years , spent eight months alongside two French experts restoring Poussin 's large 1634 - 1638 painting Hymenaios Disguised As A Woman During An Offering To Priapus .
The 3.71 - metre by 1.66 - metre artwork depicts Hymenaios , the Greek god of marriage ceremonies , dressed as a woman and dancing with Priapus , who was traditionally depicted with an erect penis .
The painting however once belonged to the Spanish royal family , and Ms Moreira says she thinks this was when the post - production modesty came in .
Removing layers of dirt , dust and paint specks that accumulated over more than three centuries cost 150,000 euros ( $ 257,500 ) .
The artwork will be put on display at Sao Paulo 's grand Museo de Art on September 8 .

It ’s a simple question for this edition of open mic .
Preaching is ________________.
And / Or Preaching is not ________________.
Do n’t write a novel or even a short story .
Keep it compact and to the point .
I especially hope that this open mic question will involve as many non-preachers as possible .
Preachers might not know everything there is to know about preaching .
Ya think ?
The mic is yours .
Feel free to offer answers and to discuss answers in the threaded comments .
Normally you would be triggering an external flash , while the shutter is open using a cable release with the camera in ' bulb ' mode .
Once the flash goes off , you let the shutter close .
This requires the room to be darken because the shutter will be open for many seconds .
In this setup you can have the room lights on because the flash and shutter are triggered at the same time , and the exposure is set for 1/10,000th of a second .
Before we hook the camera up to the trigger circuit we first adjust it 's settings , manually taking pictures until we get the exposure correct .
Mount your camera on a tripod and place a stationary test object right where the drop is going to land .
Frame the test object , and adjust zoom to your liking .
Use the macro setting if your camera is close enough to do so .
Keep in mind that you will most likely get milk splashed onto your camera and lens , so the Dollar Store glass plate should be placed in front of the lens to prevent this .
If the glass plate is in front of the flash it may reflect back into the lens , causing unwanted glare .
Now take a test shot and revue how it turned out .
If the shot is n't properly exposed adjust the exposure , flash and ISO until it is .
You can also adjust the shutter speed , but keep in mind that it 's mostly the flash that 's freezing the action .
I set the shutter speed to 1/10000 of a second and left it alone .
On my A470 aperture override is not available .
In its place is ND Filter State .
ND stands for Neutral Density filter .
Some cameras do n't have an iris , but instead have a filter to adjust how much light enters the camera .
If your camera has this instead of aperture override you wo n't have as much control over exposure because there are only three settings : [ In ] , [ Out ] and [ Off ] .

While real sanctions are necessary to exploit this moment , they are not sufficient .
We also need to keep alive the prospect that Israel could do something crazy .
I do n’t favor Israeli military action against Iran and hope we ’re telling Israel that privately .
But I do believe that U.S. officials , particularly the secretary of defense , Robert Gates , need to stop saying that publicly .
Gates is a smart power player .
He knows better .
If any U.S. official is asked for an opinion on whether Israel should be allowed to strike Iran ’s nuclear facilities , there is only one right answer :
Refer them to former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s 2005 comment that Israel “ might well decide to act first ” to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons , and say nothing else .
Why should we reassure Iran ?
I would hope by now that the murderous crackdown on Iran ’s mass democracy movement by the country ’s oil - funded ruling cartel would have removed the last scales from the eyes of those Iran watchers who think this is simply a poor , misunderstood regime that really wants to repair its relations with the West , and we just have to learn how to speak to it properly .
This is a brutal , cynical , corrupt , anti-Semitic regime that exploits the Palestinian cause and deliberately maintains a hostile posture to the West to justify its grip on power .
A regime that relates to its own people with such coercive force is not going to be sweet - talked out of its nuclear program .
Negotiating with such a regime without the reality of sanctions and the possibility of force is like playing baseball without a bat .
The U.S. is being advised to explore a variety of sanctions , including encouraging capital flight from Iran , thereby creating a run on the Iranian currency .
It is also considering a global ban on companies doing business with Iran ’s oil industry , which would be a big blow to the regime , because its oil industry  which provides the vast majority of government revenues  needs modernizing and that requires foreign technological help and financing .
Les automobilistes paieront - ils un jour pour descendre les Champs - Elysées ?
On n’en est pas encore là mais l ’idée du péage urbain progresse en France .
Le Sénat a adopté hier soir un amendement à la loi Grenelle 2 qui permet de tester ce système ( impossible jusqu’ici ) « à titre expérimental » , dans les agglomérations de plus de 300 000 habitants , soit une dizaine en France .
Un amendement prudent , sous conditions , basé sur le volontariat des collectivités , qui n’est , selon son auteur , qu’une « première étape » .
Pourquoi aujourd ’hui ?
« Il appartiendra [ aux collectivités locales ] de librement décider de la possibilité de créer des péages urbains . »
A l’automne 2007 , dans l’euphorie du Grenelle de l’environnement , Nicolas Sarkozy était prêt à tenter l’expérience .
Inscrite dans l’avant - projet de loi Grenelle 2 , l ’idée avait disparu dans la version définitive .
Avant de revenir par la grâce d’un amendement du sénateur UMP Louis Nègre .
« Les mentalités évoluent fortement » , décrypte ce dernier .
A quoi ça sert ?
« Si toute l’Europe s’y met , il doit y avoir une raison » , juge Louis Nègre qui a fait cet été la tournée des métropoles ayant mis en place un tel système ( voir infographie ) .
Mi-source de revenu , mi-outil politique … le tout est de bien choisir ses priorités .
« Historiquement , rappelle le Centre d’études sur les réseaux , les transports , l’urbanisme et les constructions publiques ( 1 ) , les péages ont été mis en place pour financer les infrastructures de transport . »
Depuis , l’accent est plus mis sur la lutte contre la congestion et la pollution .
Est -ce que ça marche ?
A la lumière des expériences de Londres et Stockholm , le Certu juge les résultats « assez concluants » sur le trafic routier , avec des baisses d’au moins 15 % .
Mais l’étude pointe le manque de recul pour tirer un bilan définitif .
« C’est plus intéressant pour lutter contre la congestion que pour dégager des ressources , pointe Louis Nègre .
Ce n’est qu’un outil dans une boîte pour mieux gérer le milieu urbain . »
Paris s ’y mettra -t - il ?
L’opposition UMP va demander aujourd ’hui au conseil de Paris de mettre le sujet à l’étude .
« Il ne s’agirait pas d’une barrière d’octroi [ taxe sur les marchandises perçue autrefois à l’entrée en ville , ndlr ] mais d’une réflexion dans le cadre du Grand Paris , défend l’UMP Thierry Coudert .
Il va bien falloir trouver de l’argent pour les transports en commun . »
Pour l’instant , la mairie est réticente .
« Nous sommes opposés à un péage qui conduirait à faire payer l’accès à Paris et à créer de la ségrégation urbaine » , argumente Annick Lepetit , adjointe aux transports .
Qui préférerait rendre payant le réseau autoroutier francilien , pour les poids lourds dans un premier temps .
Les autres métropoles hexagonales n’étant pas non plus très demandeuses , le débat n’en est sans doute qu’à ses débuts .
(1) « Péages urbains , permettre leur expérimentation en France » , Certu , juin 2008 .
STOCKHOLM 2007
Mis en service après expérimentation et référendum , le péage de la capitale suédoise s’applique sur une zone de 35 km2 .
Un cordon de 18 portiques délimite la zone , sans que l’automobiliste ait à s’arrêter .
Le coût est de 10 à 20 couronnes ( 1 à 2 € ) par passage .
La baisse des temps d’attente dans le trafic a été estimée entre 30 et 50 % .
LONDRES 2003
La zone à péage originale , sur 24 km2 , correspondait à l’hypercentre de la capitale britannique .
Les automobilistes paient 8 £ ( un peu moins de 9 € ) en semaine , de 7 heures à 18h30 .
Ce système fonctionne avec des caméras qui filment les plaques d’immatriculation .
Si ce péage est considéré comme un succès , son extension aux quartiers ouest en 2007 est moins concluante et pourrait être revue .
MILAN 2002
A Milan , c’est le niveau de pollution qui a été mis en avant : le tarif journalier pour circuler dans la ville historique , de 2 à 10 € , est fonction du niveau de pollution du véhicule et de la plage horaire .
Sur les douze premiers mois de fonctionnement , la municipalité annonce 5 millions de véhicules en moins dans le centre et 62 de jours de moins de dépassement des normes de pollution de l’air .

Is world government truly an alternative to war ?
Certainly , if we listen to the advocates of world federation and read their literature and attempt to analyze their arguments .
Platitudes and pious prating seem to run like a heavy thread through the fabric of the discussions and writings of many persons who seem to feel that the only obstacle to a world government and peace is a perverse desire , on the part of some malevolent individuals , to engage in or profit from war .
Objections to the Superstate
I , too , believe that war is a horrible waste of lives and property , and in common with everyone else in the world , I hope that there can be peaceful solutions to world and local problems .
But , I am opposed to world government .
I am opposed to any world government , first , because I believe that the realities of international affairs would make a mockery of any attempt to secure peace through a single superstate .
Secondly , I am opposed to world government for idealistic reasons .
Let us consider these two objections separately .
First , what are the realities we face ?
The realities are the antagonistic and conflicting national forces in the world today ; and the various forms of government which prevail throughout the world — from tribal societies to colossal , monolithic , authoritarian states .
Obviously , if we are to set up a world government , we must find some common denominator which will permit all forms of society to meet under one vast umbrella of law ; for unless all society submits to world " law , " that portion of society which remains outside must be considered " outlaw . "
The proponents of world government generally recognize the difficulty of including all people within the jurisdiction of a common government .
As a general rule , they state that each country shall have the exclusive right to make its own laws governing its citizens , subject only to the supreme and superior law of a world government .
Essentials for World Government
Mr. Clark M. Eichelberger , Director of the American Association for the United Nations , and the Commission to Study the Organization of Peace , has stated that " those who believe in world government want essentially a few definite things .
First , the law of the world community must be above the sovereignty of the individual nation .
There must be a supreme law against war .
Second , there must be an executive authority strong enough to use police force or whatever measures are necessary to preserve the peace .
Third , there must be a constant procedure for producing such regulations as are necessary to lessen friction among the peoples of the world and enable them to grow and expand in their world community .
It might be called the legislative process . "
Let us consider that proposal for a supreme law against war , and an executive authority strong enough to use police force or whatever measures are necessary to preserve the peace .
Disregarding for the moment the contradictions implicit in such a proposal , it seems to me that the person or persons in charge of any such world government would need the power to decide when a transgression occurs .
In this day and age of Pearl Harbors and Koreas , decisions would have to be instantaneous and the executive in charge of any world government would have to dispatch the police force without delay .
I can easily foresee the time when hostilities may break out and the police force sent into action without consideration of who might be right and who might be wrong .
I am not a historian , but it has always been my impression that the government of any nation involved in a war has thought , rightly or wrongly , that the other side was the transgressor ; and history would seem to indicate that there are many cases where right and might have been equated .
There should be no doubt that a strong executive backed up by power can enforce the will of the sovereignty , but sometimes that will of the sovereignty does not represent justice , even though it may well represent peace .
" Peace in Our Time "
We all remember that prior to the last war , Hitler had shouted about the injustice done to Germany by the Versailles Treaty , and then proceeded to march into the Rhineland .
The Allied powers capitulated without a struggle — so there was no war .
Then , we all remember Mr. Chamberlain 's sincere explanation when he stepped off the plane on his return from Munich — he had secured " peace in our time . "
Yet everyone agrees that Hitler was in the wrong ; that is , everyone but the Nazis .
We know , too , that Russia snuffed out the states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , and that if the natives of those countries and the rest of the world do n't take up arms to object , we wo n't have war — at least not over those issues .
Should we , then , advocate a sovereign superstate which will be prepared to resort to war whenever a maltreated state rebels against a bully state ?
This brings me to my second major objection to any world government .
To build a world community upon the premise that a law against war will end wars is to build upon a false premise , and my idealistic leanings rebel against any such notion .
A law has no meaning unless it can be enforced , and if enforcement means war , then a law against war is worse than a paradox , for it is a delusion .
To call a conflict which involves hundreds of thousands of men a police action is idiotic .
A local disturbance in a state which involves masses of men is called a civil war , and not a police action .
Peace Cannot Be Enforced
Certainly , if our goal is to be peace , then the possibilities of achieving that goal lie elsewhere than in formulating a supreme law against war .
The proposal to have " an executive authority strong enough to use police force or whatever measures are necessary to preserve the peace , " is like a proposal to drink carbolic acid to get rid of a respiratory infection .
The function of a police force in a civilized community is to preserve justice , not peace .
If a stranger robs me and I call the police , they may have to break the peace in order to restore my property .
I do n't call the police if I am willing to let the stranger keep my property in peace .
While peace may not always be desirable , justice is .
Moreover , peace can never be enforced , for peace is the absence of force .
" While peace may not always be desirable , justice is .
Moreover , peace can never be enforced , for peace is the absence of force . "
Many of our advocates of a world government seem to be unaware that history records the existence of many such powerful governments .
For example , the Roman Empire in its heyday actually constituted a single sovereign power whose rule extended , for all practical purposes , over the entire known or civilized world at that time .
Roman rule was not only directed by a strong executive but was extremely bloody in the exercise of its power .
One has only to read Tacitus to realize that the barbaric extermination of masses of people was not a Hitlerian innovation .
The rebellions against the Roman executive authority and his police force were not only justified , they were inevitable .
Great Sovereign States
In more recent times we have had sovereign states which , although not worldwide , nevertheless have covered a great portion of the civilized world , and could be considered as rough prototypes of a world government .
We in this country were part of the British Empire , but who would be so rash as to say that our war and the Declaration of Independence were not justified ?
Spain at one time controlled most of South America , Cuba and the Philippines , but there are few outside of Franco 's Spain today who would now contend that the breakup of that Spanish World was an evil .
Further , within the last several years we have seen India and Pakistan come into existence as independent nations , and most of us would applaud the breakup of British sovereignty over these two nations .
It is to be noted , however , that behind our approval of the disintegration of the sovereignties mentioned above , is the feeling that these states exercised their powers in an unjust manner .
The British , to whom the world owes a great debt for concepts like the bill of rights , have learned that the leadership of the Commonwealth is best secured by means other than a strong executive authority over the member states .
In fact , the strength of the Commonwealth lies in the weakness of the sovereign power over its members .
World Federalists often point to our own country as an example of how a world government could exist .
It would be unthinkable , they claim , for New York State to go to war with Wisconsin , for if New York had a dispute with another state , the federal government would intervene and settle any quarrel .
The argument is not without merit .
However , is it not just as unthinkable that we would ever go to war with Canada , or with Great Britain for that matter ?
If there were ever to come a time of dispute between our country and Canada or Great Britain , it is unthinkable that we could not solve the dispute without recourse to war .
This is so , not because we have a common government with them , for we do not .
What we do have is a common understanding as to what is right and what is wrong .
World Government Versus Morality
In order to have a world federation , we would first have to determine who should be admitted as members , and what should be done about those not to be admitted ; we can not yet put people in rockets and deport them to another planet .
This makes it apparent that we could have no world organization at all , unless we kept our standards so low that we discarded any concept of morality .
But that , of course , does not concern the proponents of world government .
Mr. Eichelberger , for example , wants " just enough government to accomplish three objectives : political security , economic advancement , and the guaranty of human rights . "
The guaranty of human rights and the objective of political security do not in our times mean the same thing ; there are many countries where they do not coincide .
A world government which would include such states as Russia and her Iron Curtain countries , Franco 's Spain , Argentina , the Dominican Republic , and other totalitarian states , seems to be the kind of government I would want to escape from .
A state where the individual is responsible to the government rather than the government being responsible to the individual , is to me a loathsome state .
What kind of morality can a world government have , and what kind of freedom would its world citizens have , if the world government permitted its members to engage in such practices as the secret police measures of the Iron Curtain countries , or the colonial policies of the French in Africa , to mention only a few of the more obvious horrors ?
Are we to abandon our efforts , feeble though they are , to combat these practices when committing ourselves to work for political security ?
Who is to determine whether a particular state should be guaranteed its political security ?
The United States takes great pride in its Point Four program .
We are helping , so we think , the underprivileged countries in the world .
In doing so , we are overly careful in the administration of this program so as not to interfere with the political setup in the country being helped .
Why do we take such pains to keep clear of politics ?
Presumably for the reason that if we were to meddle in internal affairs , our aid would be rejected with a cry of imperialism .
But Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas , who traveled a great deal in some of the Eastern countries , suggested that we encourage peasant revolts , because the existing political setup in some of these countries was such that no matter what help we gave the country , the people , as opposed to the ruling class , would get very little benefit .
" An authoritarian state can never be peaceful because it can never be healthy ; even if such a nation is unable to carry on a war against other nations , it is still at war with its own citizens . "
The Cause of War
It seems to me that before there can be a peaceful world , it will be necessary for us to understand why there is no peace .
It is too superficial and too sophomoric an answer to say that war is caused by the Hitlers and the Stalins in the world .
If it were not a Hitler , it would be a Goering or a Goebbels , and if not a Stalin , then a Malenkov or a Molotov .
Wars have been an evil concomitant of civilized society ever since history was recorded .
What , then , are the conditions which give rise to wars ?
Certainly they are not merely the differing political philosophies which are in current vogue , for we had wars long before Karl Marx saw the light of day .
It is my firm belief that the evils of war , and of poverty , totalitarianism and a host of other social maladies , are but the suppurations of a festering economic system , and that the drive toward war is in almost direct proportion to the sickness of the economy .
An authoritarian state can never be peaceful because it can never be healthy ; even if such a nation is unable to carry on a war against other nations , it is still at war with its own citizens .
Worldwide competition between free men is the condition to be encouraged , for it leads to a virile , strong society !
This country , as an example , owes its strength in no small measure to the free market which our founding fathers provided for in our Constitution .
It is unfortunate , but true , that we are fast losing our freedom in this country ; there are many in and out of government who keep chipping away at our heritage .
We are becoming so befuddled that we tend to lose faith in freedom and confuse liberty with license ; we seem to have lost our ideals and no longer seem to know what the words " free society " mean .
Need for Libertarians
In our almost psychotic fear of communism and other totalitarian philosophies , we tend to adopt some of their methods and thinking .
Essentially , communism and fascism are ideas , and unless we have a better idea we will never be able to win the battle for men's minds .
The Smith Act , the McCarran Act and all the armies in the world can never insulate or isolate us from the onslaught of totalitarianism .
As never before in our history , we need men in this country who are willing to defend their liberty by espousing the conditions which make up that liberty .
Unless we can create a healthy , free economy , we will continue to have conflicts ; and no amount of government , worldwide or otherwise , is going to bring about a lasting peace .
If anything , more government will lead to more distress .
I want a world where there will be less , not more laws ; where there will be more , not less freedom ; where people will travel from one country to another with less , not more immigration restrictions ; a world where trade is free and not regulated by tariffs and quotas ; where a man can walk in the sunlight without fear of the police , and where his ideas are free and not censored ; a world where the individual is supreme and the state is subservient , and not the other way around .
Waverly , Mo. , Sept. 9 , 2009  --
For most of the nearly 100,000 kids in America 's juvenile justice system , life in prison means orange jumpsuits , barred cells and constant guard .
But the Waverly Regional Youth Center in Missouri is a different kind of detention center .
It 's the home and hope for 44 boys already embarked on a life on crime .
The walls are adorned with colorful posters and bulletin boards with positive affirmations .
Counselors and dormitories have replaced guards and cellblocks .
For over a year , " Primetime " lived alongside the kids to examine firsthand this radical take on juvenile justice .
By taking some of the hard edges out of juvenile corrections , the state of Missouri has chalked up results that have corrections experts across the country taking notice .
One juvenile inmate at Waverly , Chris , 14 , looks like the kid next door -- but he spent the last few years drinking and doing drugs .
" I was also stealing cars , " Chris said .
" I was the ' bad ass ' around town , nobody wanted to mess with me . "
Chris ' mother left when he was 11 months old and she 's been in and out of prison ever since .
He said he has no memory of her .
At Waverly , the inmates do n't just do time sitting in a cell ; instead they are divided into small teams and undergo constant group therapy and emotional self - examination .
Every evening , they hold a group meeting in a darkened room , where the boys feel safe to bare their secrets .
One night , Kim Orear , a group leader , invited anyone in the group to " open up about some of the more shameful issues . "
Chris raised his hand and took a step that would change him forever .
' We 're All Missing Something
Chris claimed his father abused him and said running away from the alleged abuse is what started him down the path of drugs and crime .
" No matter what my dad did to me , I love my dad .
He is my only parent that was there and did n't leave me , " said Chris .
But the devastating claim had severe unforeseen consequences .
He could no longer speak to his father , who denied the allegation .
A state investigation later found the abuse unsubstantiated .
For days , Chris cried at his bunk , caught between his love for his father and his need to finally unburden himself and begin to heal .
A fellow inmate , Dylan , stepped in to help soothe Chris by giving him a bunch of stuffed animals .
" He 's down and teddy bears make people happy .
They 're cuddly and soft , " Dylan said .
Showing support and depending on one another are part of what Waverly teaches .
" We 're not alone .
No matter what we 're going through , there is someone on another bunk going through the same thing , " said Dylan .
" We 're all missing something in our lives and that 's why we 're here to get it back and fix it . "
The counselors at Waverly say one of the most effective things they do here is something you never see in prison -- hugs .
" We will never replace the parent that never paid attention to them , but what we do is show them they are worthy of hugs , " Orear said .
One hundred miles away , on a college campus in Fulton , Mo. , is the Rosa Parks Center .
The 10 girls there have committed crimes ranging from drug offenses to burglary and assault .
Tye , 17 , has been in and out of foster care since the age of 2 , and has been convicted of multiple felonies .
She told ABC News that her biggest hurdle is a volatile relationship with her mother , who rarely visits her .
" I felt really abandoned by her , " Tye said .
" I just have this hatred toward her .
I think that is what holds me back . "
At the Rosa Parks Center , as part of her treatment Tye recounted her drug history .
" At the age of seven was when I first smoked pot , " she said .
When she was in the fourth grade , Tye said , she began taking her mother 's prescription pills and selling them because there was n't enough food in the house .
At 10 , she started using meth and cocaine .
The Future of Juvenile Justice ?
For Tye , Rosa Parks is her first stable environment .
Although there are no guards or even fences at Rosa Parks , there are very few escapes .
In fact , fewer than 50 kids a year abscond from Missouri 's 32 residential facilities .
" Rosa Parks becomes part of your family , " one girl said .
" You do n't want to betray them . "
Tye summed up the difference between Missouri facilities and other juvenile prisons , comparing the kids ' problems to invasive weeds .
" Other placements want to cut off the weed , " she said .
" Here , you get down to the root and they try to pull them out , because you can't kill it unless everything is gone . "
Surprisingly , all the intensive therapy of the Missouri system actually costs less than other juvenile systems .
The cost per child in Missouri , $ 50,000 a year , is about half the national average .
Twenty - five years ago , Missouri changed the way it looked at juvenile corrections because , officials say , the familiar model -- large prisons and boot camps -- was failing .
" The conditions for young people were n't safe , [ they ] were n't getting any better and were going out and repeating [ the same ] behaviors if not worse , " said Tim Decker , director of the state 's Division of Youth Services ( DYS ) .
The new program has shown success .
Only 10 percent of the kids in Missouri 's juvenile jails end up in adult prison within three years , according to the DYS .
In other states , that number is as high as 40 percent .
Recent reports about excessive violence against juvenile inmates have renewed calls for a national overhaul of the system .
Does Missouri 's model have the answer to America 's broken juvenile justice system ?
Or are they just coddling children , as some critics say ?

Piratenplakate mit Werbung für Senioren Union überklebt
Im niedersächsischen Rinteln wurden vier von der Stadt genehmigte Plakate der Piratenpartei mit Werbung der Senioren Union überklebt .
Dem Coppenbrüggener Blogger Torben Friedrich zufolge informierte man die CDU - Altenorganisation in der Kleinstadt am Freitag über die Sachbeschädigung .
Von den Nutznießern der
Tat ausgehend entstanden in Foren schnell zahlreiche Ideen zur Ermittlung der Täter .
Erster Ansatzpunkt war dabei die Aufklärung " wer denn wann genau welche Plakate bekommen hat und damit wo plakatieren sollte . "
Ein Aufzeigen diverser CSI - Fahndungsinstrumente sollte möglicherweise auch CDU - Anhänger für eine Problematik sensibilisieren , der sie sich sonst eher schwer zugänglich zeigen .
Allerdings lagen auch derartige Methoden keineswegs außerhalb des für eine solche Straftat von manchen Behörden als verhältnismäßig Angesehenen - immerhin wurden in anderen kleineren Sachbeschädigungsfällen bereits Gentests angeordnet .
Am Samstagabend meldete sich schließlich der Vorsitzende der Rintelner Jungen Union telefonisch bei einem Mitglied der Piratenpartei und entschuldigte sich für den Vorfall , der angeblich daraus resultierte , dass eine " untrfahrene Truppe " mit dem Anbringen von Plakaten beauftragt worden sei , die sich " nicht an die Vorgaben gehalten " habe .
Alle vier Plakatflächen sollten deshalb von der CDU - Jugend in ihren alten Zustand versetzt werden .
Da die SU - Werbung beim Abriss deutliche Beschädigungsspuren hinterließ , wird die JU zu diesem Zweck möglicherweise noch Plakate kaufen und neu ankleben müssen .
Und weil es sich bei den Werken um " Geistiges Eigentum " der Piratenpartei handelt , könnte diese natürlich Monopolpreise dafür verlangen .
Bereits vor dem Anruf führte eine Spur zur CDU - Jugendorganisation : Unter dem Slogan
" Gut für jung und alt " war auf den Unionsplakaten nämlich nicht nur der SU - Bundesvorsitzende Otto Wulff , sondern auch der JU - Bundesvorsitzende Philipp Mißfelder abgebildet .
Genau jener Mißfelder hatte vor ein paar Jahren mit der Forderung auf sich aufmerksam gemacht , dass ältere Menschen keine künstlichen Hüftgelenke mehr von der Krankenkasse bezahlt bekommen sollten .
In Chats spekulierte man nach dieser Entdeckung über das krankheitsbedingt schnellere Vergessen mancher Senioren und fragte sich , ob das vielleicht ein Grund dafür ist , dass sie bei der CDU beliebter sind als das Internet , wo sich Mißfelders Äußerung noch heute problemlos nachlesen lässt .

Der Vorfall in Rinteln ist , wie die Wikiseite PlakatFoul zeigt , nicht der einzige Hinweis darauf , dass der Wahlkampf von Teilen der beiden Volksparteien als " rechtsfreier Raum " gehandhabt wird .
In Sonthofen und im hessischen Königstein etwa brachte die SPD verbotenerweise Werbeflächen an Verkehrszeichen an und in zahlreichen anderen Städten begannen gleich mehrere etablierte Parteien rechtswidrig früh mit dem Plakatieren .
Allerdings weiß man manchmal nicht sicher , ob nicht einfach Plakate aus alten Wahlkämpfen hängen gelassen wurden :
So prangt etwa auf denen der SPD im nordrhein - westfälischen Neuss noch Gerhard Schröders Konterfei .
In Bochum hatte die Junge Union mit Flyern auf sich aufmerksam gemacht , die vielerorts als Verführung von Jugendlichen zum " Komasaufen " kritisiert wurden und auch noch in einer anderen Hinsicht nach hinten losgegangen sein könnte : Politische Gegner der " Anti-Internetpartei " ( Thierry Chervel ) kamen dadurch auf die Idee , künftig bei solchen Ereignissen vorbeizuschauen und eventuell " kotzende und pissende JUler " mit der Kamera zu dokumentieren .
Auch wenn diese nur mit ordentlich verpixelten Gesichtern ins Web eingestellt würden , könnte so bei betroffenen " Leistungsträgern " und " Polithoffnungen " ein Problembewusstsein für Datenschutz - und Überwachungsfragen geweckt werden .

Eine Fußbodenheizung ist Luxus für die Füße .
So können Sie selbst im Winter barfuß durch die Wohnung laufen .
Dies ist nicht nur angenehm , sondern dazu auch noch viel gesünder für die Füße .
Die Kosten zur Anschaffung und zum Nachrüsten einer Fußbodenheizung können jedoch je nach Heizungsart auch luxuriöse Summen in Anspruch nehmen .
Kosten für eine Fußbodenheizung
Wie viel Sie in eine Fußbodenheizung investieren müssen , hängt ganz davon ab , ob Sie sich für eine elektrische oder eine konventionelle Fußbodenheizung entscheiden , mehr dazu hier .
Konventionelle Heizungen werden wie Heizkörper mit Heizungswasser durchströmt , nur mit niedrigeren Temperaturen .
Die Kosten zur Erstanschaffung und zum Nachrüsten sind bei Elektrofußbodenheizungen wesentlich geringer .
Dafür sind die Verbrauchskosten höher als bei mit Wasser betriebenen Heizungen .
Auf langer Sicht rentiert sich daher eher eine Wasserheizung .
Zudem ist es wesentlich umweltfreundlicher .
Nachrüsten beim Immobilienkauf
Wer eine Immobilie kauft und in diesem Zuge die Fußbodenheizung nachrüsten möchte , sollte dies in die Baufinanzierung einkalkulieren .
Wenn nicht genügend Eigenkapital vorhanden ist , entscheiden nicht nur die Kosten der Fußbodenheizung allein , ob ein solches Bauvorhaben finanzierbar ist , sondern auch wie hoch die Zinsen des Fremdkapitals sind .
Sie sollten deshalb immer auch die Zinsen vergleichen bei einer Baufinanzierung .
Die Europäische Zentralbank hat angekündigt , dass sie die Leitzinsen anheben wird .
Dadurch will sie der aufkeimenden Inflationsgefahr entgegen wirken .
Dies bedeutet auch für die Baufinanzierung , dass die Kreditzinsen bald steigen werden .
Wer mit dem Gedanken eines Immobilienerwerbs spielt , sollte sich deshalb möglichst schnell entscheiden .
Die Zinsen für Baukredite variieren sehr stark .
Die Spanne zwischen den unterschiedlichen Anbietern von 15 - jährigen Darlehen beträgt oft ein Prozentpunkt .
Über die Jahre addiert sich der kleine Unterschied zu immensen Summen .
Wer einen Baukredit aufnehmen möchte , sollte deshalb unbedingt einen genauen Vergleich von Zinsen vornehmen .
Das Sparpotenzial einer Fußbodenheizung
Eine Fußbodenheizung ist nicht nur sehr angenehm für die Füße , sondern auch für das Portemonnaie .
Eine Fußbodenheizung verbraucht wesentlich weniger Energie als eine gewöhnliche Radiatorheizung an der Wand .
So können bis zu zwölf Prozent der Energiekosten eingespart werden .
Um das Sparpotenzial auch voll auszunutzen zu können , sollten Sie die Funktionsfähigkeit Ihrer Heizung regelmäßig überprüfen .
Die Handwerkskammer Potsdam gibt auf ihrem Portal hilfreiche Tipps zu diesem Thema und zeigt welche Messgeräte zur Ermittlung der Wärmekapazität geeignet sind .
Wenn
Sie sich überlegen eine Fußbodenheizung anzuschaffen oder nachzurüsten , sollten Sie deshalb nicht nur die dazu aufzuwendenden Kosten berücksichtigen , sondern auch das Einsparpotenzial solch einer Heizung .
Langfristig kann sich das Investieren in eine Fußbodenheizung auszahlen .
Slim and sleek as it is , the iPhone is really the Hummer of cellphones .
It ’s a data guzzler .
Owners use them like minicomputers , which they are , and use them a lot .
Not only do iPhone owners download applications , stream music and videos and browse the Web at higher rates than the average smartphone user , but the average iPhone owner can also use 10 times the network capacity used by the average smartphone user .
“ They do n’t even realize how much data they ’re using , ” said Gene Munster , a senior securities analyst with Piper Jaffray .
The result is dropped calls , spotty service , delayed text and voice messages and glacial download speeds as AT&T ’s cellular network strains to meet the demand .
Another result is outraged customers .
Cellphone owners using other carriers may gloat now , but the problems of AT&T and the iPhone portend their future .
Other networks could be stressed as well as more sophisticated phones encouraging such intense use become popular , analysts say .

Felis Cattus , is your taxonomic nomenclature ,
an endothermic quadruped carnivorous by nature ?
Your visual , olfactory and auditory senses
contribute to your hunting skills , and natural defenses .
I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations ,
a singular development of cat communications
that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection
for a rhythmic stroking of your fur , to demonstrate affection .
A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents ;
you would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance .
And when not being utilized to aide in locomotion ,
it often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion .
O Spot , the complex levels of behaviour you display
connote a fairly well - developed cognitive array .
And though you are not sentient , Spot , and do not comprehend ,
I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend .
Evidently a church in Michigan has won the lottery
HASLETT , Mich . – Divine intervention ?
Or just plain luck ?
No matter what the circumstances , a Michigan church is $ 70,000 richer courtesy of the Michigan Lottery .
The Covenant Life Worship Center and its 25 members in Haslett , Mich . had one of the second - prize tickets in the Lucky 7s raffle held May 4 .
The $ 10 ticket was purchased at a convenience store in Haslett , five miles northeast of downtown Lansing .
The lottery Web site says the odds of a single ticket winning $ 70,000 in Lucky 7s are one in 55,556 .
Michigan Lottery officials say the church will receive the full amount of the prize because it is a tax - exempt group .
Pastor Marilyn Parmelee tells the Lansing State Journal that the prize money will go toward the church building fund , setting up a missionary fund and supporting local community service projects .
First and foremost , please consider these biblical quotes as well :
1 Timothy 5:8 says :
" But if anyone does not provide for his own , and especially for those of his household , he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever . "
Proverbs 12:11 says :
" He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread . "
Proverbs 28:20 says :
" He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent . "
Proverbs 28:22 says :
" He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye , and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him . "
Proverbs 13:11 , says :
" Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished ; but he that gathereth by labor shall increase . "
Now , I was never a believer and I wo n't even claim to have read the bible cover to cover , though I have read a bit of it for a comparative religions class .
I do n't like to ' quote mine ' the bible but on this point I feel its valid to point out the possible hypocrisy of a christian church that gambles .
Personally , I read biblical versus and I just shake my head .
This shit is often confusing and worthlessly vague .
I looked up these versus not immediately , rubbing my evil atheist hands together as I gleefully attempted to find hypocricy and gloat - no .
I looked them up only after listening to my partner 's reaction to this news article .
Interestingly , my reaction to this article was a bit of a chuckle over hypocrisy and more annoyance over the fact they they wo n't be taxed on that money .
My sweetie , however , was immediately outraged .
He was raised southern baptist but is now agnostic , and the hypocrisy of this story really effected him on a personal level as if by reflex .
He was raised that the above bible versus ( among others ) mean that gambling is explicitly wrong and not a behavior to be engaged in by christians .
Now , this small fellowship has an ambiguous name so it's hard to tell if they are one of the thousands of Christian sects that interpret the bible to say that gambling is wrong or not ( though their site does mention living life true to the Word of God ) .
I 'm sure if you asked them now , they would certainly distance themselves from any interpretation of their holy text which claims gambling is wrong .
That , to me , is one of the greatest strengths of the Bible .
The book is a labyrinth of contradictions and vague speech - you do n't need to adhere to it , you just make it adhere to you .
