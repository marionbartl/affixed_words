Online marketing je v současné době jedním z nejsiln ějších marketingových nástrojů , který využívají prakticky všechny ekonomické subjekty a organizace , zvláště ty , které nabízejí služby .
Je to způsobeno především vysokou digitalizací lidského života a přesunem řady aktivit do virtuálního prostoru , který poskytuje řadu možností , jak svůj byznys zviditelnit , a zároveň spojuje velké množství potenciálních zákazníků , bez ohledu na časové pásmo či aktuální region , v němž se nachází .
Online marketing je součástí tzv. digitálního marketingu a jeho specifikem je nutnost připojení k internetu , který je hlavním prostorem , v němž se takový marketing odehrává a pro jehož zákony a podmínky se vytváří konkrétní strategie .
Co je online marketing a jak se liší od digitálního marketing u
laptop – digitální marketing v praxi
Přesun marketingových aktivit do virtuálního prostoru logicky navazuje na vývoj obecného zájmu o digitální média a jejich upevňování pozice v běžném lidském životě .
Řada velmi důležitých sociálních a socializačních aktivit se v dnešní době odehrává mimo reálný hmatateln ý svět v zázračném a prakticky neomezeném prostředí internetu formou různých aplikací či speciálních programů , které umožňují komunikovat na různých úrovních a prostřednictvím velmi variabilních kanálů .
Marketing má tak možnost potenciálního zákazníka nejen oslovit velmi specifickou formou čí cílenou taktikou , ale také sledovat , jakým způsobem je daná strategie úspěšná již ve velmi krátkých časových úsecích , aktivně ji kontinuálně upravovat a vylepšovat .
Marketingová strategie využívající pro prezentaci firmy digitálního formátu ( ať už v online nebo offline podobě ) , je označována jako digitální .
Rozsah nástrojů využívaných v této oblasti je v porovnání s inline marketingem širší , jelikož ten tvoří v podstatě podmnožinu marketingu digitálního .
Kromě standardních online nástrojů se do digitálního marketingu počítají také digitalizované verze brožur či prezentace , které mohou být promítány v rámci různých akcí nebo soukromých událostí , ale také product placement strategie .
Nástroje digitálního a online marketingu
Digitální marketing je vlivem dosahu online nástrojů a strategií s jeho internetovou formou často zaměňován , a to zvláště proto , že běžně oslovuje největší cílovou skupinu potenciálních zákazníků a jeho dosah je v podstatě časově neomezený .
Digitální marketing jako nadmnožina všech nástrojů využívajících digitální média zahrnuje především následující kategorie :
Online nástroje a strategie
Reklamní prvky v tradičních digitálních médiích ( především televizní spoty či product placement vizuálního charakteru v televizi , filmech apod . )
Offline marketing v moderních digitálních médiích ( jedná se především o zaměření na mobilní zařízení )
Nástroje nevyužívající internetu mohou vedle marketingových strategií objevujících se v tradičních médiích mohou být zaměřeny také například na počítačové hry či jinou formu digitální zábavy , nebo mohou využívat přímého kontaktu se zákazníkem formou reklamních hovorů či SMS .
Celé spektrum nástrojů digitálního marketingu zahrnuje řadu oblastí , které spravují marketingoví specialisté orientovaní na konkrétní oblast , kteří rozumí způsobu , jakým daný prvek na jednotlivé cílové skupiny působí a jakou úspěšnost zvyšování povědomí o produktu či službě může poskytnout .
Online marketing jako jeden z nejúčinn ějších způsobů získání zákazníka
Mezi jednotlivými strategiemi digitálního marketingu dosahuje online marketing stále rostoucí důležitosti , jelikož množství oblastí a komunikačních kanálů , kter ými lze zákazníka oslovit se díky sociálním sítím stále rozšiřuje .
Aktuáln ě se online marketing člení do řady podkategorií typických svou taktikou .
Těmi nejdůle žit ějšími strategiemi online marketingu jsou :
SEO neboli Search Engine Optimization – optimalizace pro vyhledávače – orientovaná na webové stránky subjektu

Jak posílit byznys prostřednictvím online marketingu a jak se využívá SEO
Chcete -li , aby vaše společnost či produkt oslovily co největší okruh potenciálních zákazníků , je online marketing v podstatě nezbytný .
Než se pustíte do složitých strategií zahrnujících sekundární propagaci , kterou jsou přímé oslovení cílové skupiny prostřednictvím online komunikačních kanálů , měli byste být připravení na té prvotní frontě a to zejména optimalizovaným konverzním poměrem a souvisejícím web designem , který zaručí , že v momentě , kdy návštěvník váš web navštíví , dostane se do jeho povědomí , zapamatuje si jej , či provede operaci , jež zajistí jeho návrat ( například bude - li web informačn ě bohatý nebo obsahovat důležitá či zajímavá sdělení , může se přihlásit k odběru newsletteru ) .
Po dosažení vhodného CRO pak následuje optimalizace pro vyhledávače , která je dalším velmi důležitým krokem .
Optimalizace pro vyhledávače tedy SEO znamená implementaci vodných klíčových slov a zpětných odkazů do textových částí webu , které umožní robotům konkrétního vyhledávače ( Google , Bing , Seznam ) vracet nejlepší výsledky s ohledem na unikátnost , originálnost a obsah webu .
Algoritmy těchto robotů slouží k tomu , aby v případě zadání vyhledávání vytvořily rozmanitý seznam stránek , které se danou tématikou zabývají a nabídly tak osobě , která vyhledávání zadala , nejlepší zpětnou vazbu .
Pokud chcete využívat marketingu prostřednictvím SEO , je dobré provést celkovou analýzu aktuálního textového řešení webu a následně jej upravit tak , aby obsahoval potřebná klíčová slova a odkazy , která robota na stránku navedou a při jejím hodnocení ( indexování ) získá vysoký rating a posílí tak svou pozici mezi stránkami konkurenčními .
Konečným efektem pak bude vysoká návštěvnost , která při podpoře CRO může velmi výrazně zlepšit celkovou ziskovost subjektu .
No immigration agents descended on Overhill Farms , a major food - processing plant in Vernon .
No one was arrested or deported .
There were no frantic scenes of desperate workers fleeing la migra through the gritty streets of the industrial suburb southeast of downtown Los Angeles .
For more than 200 Overhill workers , however , the effect was devastating :
All lost steady jobs last month and now find themselves in a precarious employment market , without severance pay or medical insurance .
It was n’t a hot tip or an undercover informant that helped seal their fates , but a computer check of Social Security numbers .
“ A desktop raid ” is how the workers ’ representative , John M. Grant , vice president of Local 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union , described the scenario .
Overhill , a $ 200 - million - a - year company that provides frozen meals for clients such as American Airlines , Panda Express , Safeway and Jenny Craig , says it had no choice :
An Internal Revenue Service audit found that 260 workers had provided “ invalid or fraudulent ” Social Security numbers .
The government took no action against the workers .
But Overhill did :
All of the employees were fired May 31 .

The dispute underscores some of the complex issues facing President Obama as he tries to make good on his pledge to overhaul the nation ’s “ broken ” immigration system .
Like agriculture , the food - processing and preparation sectors rely heavily on immigrant labor , much of it illegal .
The White House has already scaled back the Bush administration ’s controversial practice of work - site raids .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has vowed to shift the emphasis to employers who hire illegal workers .
Audits of employers ’ records are an essential tool in such cases .
But the Overhill case illustrates how desktop raids can ravage immigrant families , even without arrests and deportation .
Employers facing stiff fines and potential prison terms for hiring illegal immigrants may decide to fire employees who have suspect paperwork .
“ We killed ourselves on the assembly lines for years , many of us have injuries from repetitive motion , ” said Bohemia Agustiano , 38 , a mother of four from Huntington Park .
“ Now we ’re worth nothing .
We ’re out on the streets .
This is unjust , no one should be treated this way . ”

Overhill says it gave the workers 30 days to correct the problem with the IRS and provide the company with verification , but none did so .
“ This is not something the company planned to do , it ’s not something the company initiated and it ’s not something that benefited the company , ” said Alexander Auerbach , a spokesman for Overhill , which dismissed about a quarter of its 1,000 - plus workforce .
“ Quite the contrary .
We lost very good , very loyal employees . ”
Overhill , whose workforce is largely Latino , says it has no idea of the legal status of the fired employees .
No one has formally accused them of being illegal immigrants .
Still , the company argues that it risked potential criminal liability under tax and immigration laws if it continued to employ them after the IRS audit .
“ Based on the advice of three different law firms , the company ’s belief was that it was legally compelled to terminate these employees , ” Auerbach said .
Overhill has already rehired workers for most positions .

But the union says Overhill responded rashly .
“ I think the company acted hastily and unnecessarily , ” said Peter Schey , a Los Angeles lawyer who represented the union .
“ Legally , there was nothing that compelled these terminations . ”
Immigrant advocates who applaud the Obama administration ’s determination to shift the work - site enforcement focus to employers acknowledge that such an approach still leaves workers vulnerable to losing their jobs .
“ At the end of the day , it ’s the employees or the undocumented workers who are still walking around with a bull ’s - eye on their backs , ” said Angela Kelley , vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress , a Washington think tank .
“ They either get directly caught up in a raid , or they get caught in a ricochet attack by an employer acting preemptively to let them go . ”

IRS officials declined to comment on the case , citing privacy concerns .
Although the federal agency regularly alerts employers about workers with incorrect Social Security or tax identification numbers , it does not mandate that those employees be fired .
“ We do not advise employers to fire or hire anybody , ” said Larry Wright , an IRS spokesman .
All of Overhill ’s dismissed factory hands were hired before the introduction of the Department of Homeland Security ’s so - called E - Verify system , which allows employers to confirm the legal working status of new hires electronically , verifying Social Security numbers and other data .
The program was designed as a weapon against the vast trade in fraudulent and stolen Social Security numbers .
Overhill is now using the system for new hires .
Six of the company ’s fired workers interviewed at a protest outside the Vernon plant last week insisted that their Social Security numbers were legitimate .

“ My Social Security number was good all these years , why is it suddenly no good now ? ” asked Eva Macias , a 19 - year veteran of Overhill Farms .
“ We left our youth in that plant . ”
The ousted workers held signs proclaiming that they were not “ disposable . ”
Passing truckers honked their horns in solidarity in a heavily industrialized zone where Latino immigrants constitute much of the labor force .
Employees in white laboratory coats and hairnets observed from the factory grounds during their breaks from the assembly line , where they fill trays of frozen food that are shipped to supermarkets and fast - food outlets .
One after another , the ex-workers lamented losing a steady job , even if it paid only $ 10 an hour , the average salary .
All spoke of bleak prospects for finding alternative work in a shrinking economy .
Many have been in the United States for a decade or more and have U.S. - born children .
They see no option of returning to Mexico and its enduring lack of opportunity and social mobility .
They worry about missing rent payments , being unable to pay medical bills and having no money for food .

“ I ’m already a month behind on the rent , ” said Gabriel Cruz , 28 , a father of two from Compton .
“ It ’s not an easy time to find work right now . ”
Overhill is a rare union shop in an overwhelmingly nonunion industry , but that has n’t made much difference for the fired workers .
The plant ’s union has demanded that an independent arbitrator hear their case .
But such a session can take months to arrange .
“ We ’re talking here about hundreds of families that have been denied a gainful wage , denied medical care , ” said Grant , the union official .
“ This basically tears apart an entire community . ”

“ Do n’t get depressed , get involved , ” Merrie said , and gave her some literature .
“ I would n’t want to be Walter right now , ” Seth remarked as soon as Patty was gone .
“ I ’m frankly glad to hear that , ” Merrie said .
“ Was it just me , or did you hear an undertone of marital discontent ?
I mean , helping Carol with her taxes ?
You know anything about that ?
I thought that was very interesting .
I had n’t heard about that .
And now he ’s failed to protect their pretty view of Carol ’s trees . ”
“ The whole thing is so Reaganite - regressive , ” Merrie said .
“ She thought she could live in her own little bubble , make her own little world .
Her own little doll house . ”
The add - on structure that rose out of Carol ’s back - yard mud pit , weekend by weekend , over the next nine months , was like a giant utilitarian boat shed with three plain windows punctuating its expanses of vinyl siding .
Carol and Blake referred to it as a “ great - room , ” a concept hitherto foreign to Ramsey Hill .
Following the cigarette - butt controversy , the Paulsens had installed a high fence and planted a line of ornamental spruces that had since grown up enough to screen them from the spectacle .
Only the Berglunds ’ sight lines were unobstructed , and before long the other neighbors were avoiding conversation with Patty , as they never had before , because of her fixation on what she called “ the hangar . ”
They waved from the street and called out hellos but were careful not to slow down and get sucked in .
The consensus among the working mothers was that Patty had too much time on her hands .
In the old days , she ’d been great with the little kids , teaching them sports and domestic arts , but now most of the kids on the street were teen - agers .
No matter how she tried to fill her days , she was always within sight or earshot of the work next door .
Every few hours , she emerged from her house and paced up and down her back yard , peering over at the great - room like an animal whose nest had been disturbed , and sometimes in the evening she went knocking on the great - room ’s temporary plywood door .
“ Hey , Blake , how ’s it going ? ”
“ Going just fine . ”
“ Sounds like it !
Hey , you know what , that Skil saw ’s pretty loud for eight - thirty at night .
How would you feel about knocking off for the day ? ”
“ Not too good , actually . ”
“ Well , how about if I just ask you to stop , then ? ”
“ I do n’t know .
How about you letting me get my work done ? ”
“ I ’d actually feel pretty bad about that , because the noise is really bothering us . ”
“ Yeah , well , you know what ?
Too bad . ”
Patty had a loud , involuntary , whinny - like laugh .
“ Ha - ha - ha !
Too bad ? ”
“ Yeah , listen , I ’m sorry about the noise .
But Carol says there was about five years of noise coming out of your place when you were fixing it up . ”
“ Ha - ha - ha .
I do n’t remember her complaining . ”
“ You were doing what you had to do .
Now I ’m doing what I have to do . ”
“ What you ’re doing is really ugly , though .
I ’m sorry , but it ’s kind of hideous .
Just — horrible and hideous .
Honestly .
As a matter of pure fact .
Not that that ’s really the issue .
The issue is the Skil saw . ”
“ You ’re on private property and you need to leave now . ”
“ O.K. , so I guess I ’ll be calling the cops . ”
“ That ’s fine , go ahead . ”
You could see her pacing in the alley then , trembling with frustration .
She did repeatedly call the police about the noise , and a few times they actually came and had a word with Blake , but they soon got tired of hearing from her and did not come back until the following February , when somebody slashed all four of the beautiful new snow tires on Blake ’s F - 250 and Blake and Carol directed officers to the next - door neighbor who ’d been phoning in so many complaints .
This resulted in Patty again going up and down the street , knocking on doors , ranting .
“ The obvious suspect , right ?
The mom next door with a couple of teen - age kids .
Hard - core - criminal me , right ?
Lunatic me !
He ’s got the biggest , ugliest vehicle on the street , he ’s got bumper stickers that offend pretty much anybody who ’s not a white supremacist , but , God , what a mystery , who else but me could want to slash his tires ?
Apparently it ’s not enough for them to nail a barn onto the back of their house , they ’ve also got to sic the cops on me because I do n’t happen to love the sound of Paul Bunyan ’s router at ten at night outside my bedroom window . ”
Merrie Paulsen was convinced that Patty was , in fact , the slasher .
“ I do n’t see it , ” Seth said .
“ I mean , she ’s obviously suffering , but she ’s not a liar . ”
“ Right , except I did n’t actually notice her saying she did n’t do it . ”
“ My question is , where is Walter ? ”
“ Walter is killing himself earning his salary so that she can stay home all day and be a mad housewife .
He ’s being a good dad to Jessica and some sort of reality principle to Joey .
I ’d say he has his hands full . ”
Walter ’s most salient quality , besides his love of Patty , was his niceness .
He was the sort of good listener who seemed to find everybody else more interesting and impressive than himself .
He was preposterously fair - skinned , weak in the chin , cherubically curly up top , and had worn the same round wire frames forever .
He ’d begun his career at 3 M as an attorney in the counsel ’s office , but he ’d failed to thrive there and was shunted into outreach and philanthropy , a corporate cul - de- sac where niceness was an asset .
On Barrier Street he was always handing out great free tickets to the Guthrie and the Chamber Orchestra and telling neighbors about encounters he ’d had with famous locals such as Garrison Keillor and Kirby Puckett and , once , Prince .
More recently , and surprisingly , he ’d left 3 M altogether and become a development officer for the Nature Conservancy .
Nobody except the Paulsens had suspected him of harboring such reserves of discontent , but Walter was no less enthusiastic about nature than he was about culture , and the only outward change in his life was his new scarcity at home on weekends .
This scarcity may have been one reason that he did n’t intervene , as he might have been expected to , in Patty ’s battle with Carol Monaghan .
Walter had strong feelings about courtesy and fairness and amity , and he was borderline uxorious as a husband , but he was apparently willing neither to support his wife nor to curb her .
His response , if you asked him point - blank about her battle , was to giggle nervously .
“ I ’m kind of a neutral bystander on that one , ” he said .
And a neutral bystander he remained all through the spring and summer of Joey ’s sophomore year and into the following fall , when Jessica went off to college in the East and Joey moved out of his parents ’ house and in with Carol , Blake , and Connie .
The move was a stunning act of sedition and a dagger to Patty ’s heart — the beginning of the end of her life in Ramsey Hill .
Joey had spent July and August in Montana , working on the high - country ranch of one of Walter ’s major Nature Conservancy donors , and had returned with broad , manly shoulders and two new inches of height .
Walter , who did n’t ordinarily brag , had vouchsafed to the Paulsens , at a picnic in August , that the donor had called him up to say how “ blown away ” he was by Joey ’s fearlessness and tirelessness in throwing calves and dipping sheep .
Patty , however , at the same picnic , was already vacant - eyed with pain .
In June , before Joey went to Montana , she ’d again taken him up to Nameless Lake to help her improve the property , and the only neighbor who ’d seen them there described a terrible afternoon of watching mother and son lacerate each other over and over , airing it all in plain sight , Joey mocking Patty ’s mannerisms and finally calling her “ stupid ” to her face , at which Patty had cried out , “ Ha - ha - ha !
Stupid !
God , Joey !
Your maturity just never ceases to amaze me !
Calling your mother stupid in front of other people !
That ’s just so attractive in a person !
What a big , tough , independent man you are ! ”
“ I want to read something targeted directly at me . ”

By summer ’s end , Blake had nearly finished work on the great - room and was outfitting it with such Blakean gear as a PlayStation , Foosball , a refrigerated beer keg , a large - screen TV , an air - hockey table , a stained - glass Vikings chandelier , and mechanized recliners .
Neighbors were left to imagine Patty ’s dinner - table sarcasm regarding these amenities , and Joey ’s declarations that she was being ignorant and unfair , and Walter ’s angry demands that Joey apologize to Patty , but the night when Joey defected to the house next door did n’t need to be imagined , because Carol Monaghan was happy to describe it , in a loud and somewhat gloating voice , to any neighbor sufficiently disloyal to the Berglunds to listen to her .
“ Joey was so calm , so calm , ” Carol said .
“ I swear to God , you could n’t melt butter in his mouth .
I went over there with Connie to support him and let everybody know that I ’m totally in favor of the arrangement , because , you know Walter , he ’s so considerate , he ’s going to worry that it ’s an imposition on me .
And Joey was totally responsible like always .
He just wanted to be on the same page and make sure all the cards were on the table .
He explained how he and Connie had discussed things with me , and I told Walter — because I knew he’d be worried about this — I told him that groceries were not a problem .
Blake and I are a family now and we ’re happy to feed one more , and Joey ’s also very good about the dishes and garbage and being neat , and plus , I told Walter , he and Patty used to be so generous to Connie and give her meals and all .
I wanted to acknowledge that , because they really were generous when I did n’t have my life together , and I ’ve never been anything but grateful for that .
And Joey ’s just so responsible and calm .
He explains how , since Patty wo n’t even let Connie in the house , he really does n’t have any other choice if he wants to spend time with her , and I chime in and say how totally in support of the relationship I am — if only all the other young people in this world were as responsible as those two , the world would be a much better place — and how much more preferable it is for them to be in my house , safe and responsible , instead of sneaking around and getting in trouble .
Connie ’s a special person and I do n’t know what would have happened to her if it was n’t for Joey .
I ’m so grateful to him , he ’ll always be welcome in my house .
I said that to them .
“ And I know Patty does n’t like me , she ’s always looked down her nose at me and been snooty about Connie .
I know that .
I know a thing or two about the things Patty ’s capable of .
I knew she was going to throw some kind of fit .
And so her face gets all twisted , and she ’s like , ‘ You think he loves your daughter ?
You think he ’s in love with her ? ’
In this high little voice .
Like it ’s impossible for somebody like Joey to be in love with Connie , because I did n’t go to college or whatever , or I do n’t have as big a house or come from New York City or whatever , or I have to work an honest - to - Christ forty - hour full - time job , unlike her .
Patty ’s so full of disrespect for me , you ca n’t believe it .
But Walter I thought I could talk to .
He really is a sweetie .
His face is beet red , I think because he ’s embarrassed , and he says , ‘ Carol , you and Connie need to leave so we can talk to Joey privately . ’
Which I ’m fine with .
I ’m not there to make trouble .
I ’m not a troublemaking person .
“ Except then Joey says no .
He says he ’s not asking permission , he ’s just informing them about what he ’s going to do , and there ’s nothing to discuss .
And that ’s when Walter loses it .
Just loses it .
He ’s got tears running down his face he ’s so upset — and I can understand that , because Joey ’s his youngest , and it ’s not Walter ’s fault that Patty is so unreasonable and mean to Connie that Joey ca n’t stand to live with them anymore .
But he starts yelling at the top of his lungs , like , ‘ YOU ARE SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND YOU ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL YOU FINISH HIGH SCHOOL . ’
And Joey ’s just smiling at him , you could n’t melt butter in his mouth .
Joey says it ’s not against the law for him to leave , and anyway he ’s only moving next door .
Totally reasonable .
I wish I ’d been one per cent as smart and cool when I was sixteen .
I mean , he ’s just a great kid .
“ But it made me feel kind of bad for Walter , because he starts yelling all this stuff about how he ’s not going to pay for Joey ’s college , and Joey ’s not going to get to go back to Montana next summer , and all he ’s asking is that Joey come to dinner and sleep in his own bed and be a part of the family .
And Joey ’s like , ‘ I ’m still part of the family , ’ which , by the way , he never said he was n’t .
But Walter ’s stomping around the kitchen — for a couple of seconds I think he ’s actually going to hit him , but he ’s just totally lost it , he ’s yelling , ‘ GET OUT , GET OUT , I ’M SICK OF IT , GET OUT , ’ and then he ’s gone and you can hear him upstairs in Joey ’s room , opening up Joey ’s drawers or whatever , and Patty runs upstairs and they start screaming at each other , and Connie and I are hugging Joey , because he ’s the one reasonable person in the family and we feel so sorry for him , and that ’s when I know for sure that it ’s the right thing for him to move in with us .
Walter comes stomping downstairs again and we can hear Patty screaming like a maniac — she ’s totally lost it — and Walter starts yelling again , ‘DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU’RE DOING TO YOUR MOTHER ?’
Because it ’s all about Patty , see , she ’s always got to be the victim .
And Joey ’s just standing there shaking his head , because it ’s so obvious .
Why would he want to live in a place like this ? ”
Although some neighbors did undoubtedly take satisfaction in Patty ’s reaping the whirlwind of her son ’s extraordinariness , the fact remained that Carol Monaghan had never been well liked on Barrier Street , Blake was widely deplored , Connie was thought spooky , and nobody had ever really trusted Joey .
As word of his insurrection spread , the emotions prevailing among the Ramsey Hill gentry were pity for Walter , anxiety about Patty ’s psychological health , and an overwhelming sense of relief and gratitude at how normal their own children were — how happy to accept parental largesse , how innocently demanding of help with their homework or their college applications , how compliant in phoning in their after - school whereabouts , how divulging of their little day - to - day bruisings , how reassuringly predictable in their run-ins with sex and pot and alcohol .
The ache emanating from the Berglunds ’ house was sui generis .
Walter — unaware , you had to hope , of Carol ’s blabbing about his night of “ losing it ” — acknowledged awkwardly to various neighbors that he and Patty had been “ fired ” as parents and were doing their best not to take it too personally .
“ He comes over to study sometimes , ” Walter said , “ but right now he seems more comfortable spending his nights at Carol ’s .
We ’ll see how long that lasts . ”
“ How ’s Patty taking all this ? ” Seth Paulsen asked him .

As we all know RPG usually means a game where you kill things .
If you are role - playing a good character , you kills things in the name of justice and general goodness , weeping for every life taken .
If you are role - playing an evil character , you kill with glee because you are evil ( duh ! ) , and finally , if you are playing an undecided character , you kill things and shrug .
You can often see " Different ways to play the game ! " on a game box .
12 out of 10 it means " different ways to kill things " .
For example , venerable Baldur 's Gate 2 offers 11 different classes , including bard , druid , and monk .
Surprisingly enough ( well , not really , but the word " surprisingly " increases the overall dramatic effect I 'm going for ) , even though the manual boldly claims that bard 's " strength is his pleasant and charming personality ;
With it and his wits he makes his way through the world .... " , the psycho bard makes his way through the world by killing things and singing sons that help him and his buddies kill things in a more efficient manner , which is great if you think that killing things is what RPGs are all about .
If not , if you are starting to doubt that diplomacy is for fags , or expecting more than backstabbing from your thief , or simply wondering where the fuck all non-combat classes are , welcome to our PowerPoint " Non-Combat Gameplay : Myths and Reality " FAQ - style presentation :
Q : What is this non -combat gameplay you so obnoxiously speaketh of ?
A : It 's a form of gameplay that does n't consist of , require , or revolve around killing things .
You play a game and overcome challenges thrown at you without killing anyone , using your character 's non-combat skills and abilities .
Here is a generic situation :
You are standing in front of a fortress and dying to get inside because that 's where all the cool kids are .
There is a gate , but it 's guarded .
You need a pass to enter .
Your options are :
- knock some sense into the guards with your war hammer and go inside .
- persuade the guards to let you in : Hi there !
I 'm with the Tavern Food & Service Inspection Agency .
We 've heard rumors that you have rats running around in every cellar .
Well , it 's fucking better be a misunderstanding because if I see a single rodent - looking motherfucker - which includes this rat - faced bastard over there - I 'm shutting this evil fortress down TONIGHT !
Now open that fucking door already !
- ask around about the pass , find out who has one , and either steal it or trade it for something .
- create a diversion - Look behind you , a three - headed monkey ! - and sneak inside .
Or hire some thugs to attack the guards and while the guards are busy breaking some heads , sneak inside .
- wall - climbing text - adventures are fun and very ninja - like : your dagger blade snaps with a loud noise and you plummet to your death cursing stupid non-combat gameplay .
- impersonate an officer - Atten - hut !
Is that how you salute an officer of the watch , swine ?
Stop eyeballing me !
You 're not worthy to look your superiors in the eye .
Stand straight , eyes forward !
What is the name of your commanding officer ?
- bribe your way in .
- forge a fake pass using your knowledge of what a real pass looks like and skills ( lore , literacy , scribing , etc )
Let 's count now .
Eight different ways to get in , only one requires bashing someone 's head .
As you can see , non-combat solutions are the core of role - playing because that 's where the choices are .
Figuring out what you can do in this situation is infinitely more interesting than checking your blade , putting on your reinforced hockey helmet , gulping a potion , and charging the guards .
Q : Your gate example is amazingly awesome but there is a huge difference between passing through a gate that nobody cares about and dealing with bloodthirsty monsters that are completely immune to persuasion , charisma , and personal magnetism .
A : Let 's use the Bloodlines ' sewers as an example .
The sewers are packed with monsters and are often used as a counter - argument in " RPG diplomacy " discussions , pointing out that you can't convince a bloodthirsty monster not to eat you .
The sewers , however , are n't floating somewhere in the void , being completely removed and detached from anything .
They are a part of the game world and thus could be easily affected by many different things .
Flooding the sewers could be a nice and elegant solution , requiring a bit of knowledge ( you 'd have to research the sewers , find out about the flood controls and where they are ) and engineering to operate them .
Another great option would have been tipping the authorities about , let ’s say , terrorists in the sewers .
SWAT teams go in looking for terrorists , run into the monsters , and eventually kill them all .
Needless to say , you 'd have to be very persuasive to pull that off , and additionally you 'd get a strike for breaking the Masquerade , but at least you 'll be safe .
And finally you should have been able to push on the local vampire clan running that town and persuade , force , or manipulate them into cleaning the sewers for you .
You work for the Prince after all , so you might as well use that to your advantage .
So , as you can see , you do n't have to deal with in - game problems by charging at them .
Obviously , you can't negotiate with big-ass scorpions , but hey , maybe you can find some dynamite and blow up their cave .
If you know what I 'm talking about , nod in agreement .
If not , go play Fallout .
Q : Bandits .
You travel from point A to point B and run into some bandits .
What are you going to do ?
Go back and wait for the cavalry to clean up the roads ?
Plenty of things , but instead of making things up , let 's use Marco Polo as an example .
Marco decided to LARP old - school .
He formed a small 3 - man party ( I can only assume that they were fighter , mage , and thief ) and decided to go adventuring all the way to China .
Back in those days people were still taking their role - playing seriously .
He had received gifts for the Great Khan from Pope Gregory X and travelled 5,600 (! ) miles of " bandit - ridden " roads , passing through Armenia , Persia , Afghanistan , and finally arriving to China 3.5 years later and delivering the Pope 's gifts to the Khan .
If Marco managed to avoid the bandits , ninjas , and pirates for 3.5 years and deliver the valuable gifts , we shall assume that dealing with RPG bandits in non -combat ways is more than possible .
Anyway , the story gets better and suggests a great way to handle hostile encounters in RPGs .
Kublai Khan gave Marco a golden tablet , which had the Khan 's seal and stated " Fuck not least you be fucked with ! " .
Well , actually it said , " By the strength of the eternal Heaven , holy be the Khan 's name .
Let him that pays him not reverence be killed . " , but that 's pretty much the same thing .
Needless to say , the magic tablet helped Marco to arrive back to Venice safely and bring back a fortune after serving the Khan for 17 years .
Q : Ok , you ’ve dealt with bandits , but what about armies ?
Surely one ca n’t stop armies with a flowery speech and a pretty smile ?
A : Actually … .
In 1815 Napoleon Bonaparte , an exiled French emperor , landed near Cannes with 600 soldiers and started moving toward the capital .
Near Grenoble he was stopped by the 5th Regiment .
Napoleon stepped forward and using nothing but his charisma , persuasion , and dramatic effects convinced the soldiers to join him .
A day later the 7th Regiment failed their roll against Napoleon ’s maxed out Charisma .
Marshal Ney promised Louis XVIII to bring Napoleon in an iron cage , but the power of Napoleon ’s personality was too great and Ney joined his side , bringing in 6,000 soldiers .
Without firing a shot (! ) , Napoleon took over a country and gained a 340,000 ( regular soldiers and volunteers ) army .
His progress ( very RPG - like ) could be tracked by the French newspaper Moniteur ’s headlines :
March 10 : The Corsican ogre has landed at Cape Juan .
March 11 : The tiger is in Gap .
Troops are on their way and will stop him .
He will end his miserable adventure as a homeless refugee in the mountains .
March 12 : The monster succeeded in proceeding to Grenoble .
March 13 : The tyrant is now in Lyon .
Horror has caught the people .
March 18 : The usurper is some days ’ march distant from Paris .
March 19 : Bonaparte approaches in a hurry , but he will not succeed in advancing to Paris .
March 20 : Napoleon will be in Paris tomorrow .
March 21 : Emperor Napoleon is in Fontainebleau .
March 22 : Yesterday evening His Majesty celebrated his arrival in Paris .
The jubilation cannot be described .
From ogre to His Majesty in 12 days .
Not bad at all .
Q : Well , Napoleon was an ex-emperor , so that does n’t count .
How about a completely hostile town where you can be killed on sight ?
A : Sir Richard Francis Burton - the 19th century explorer , linguist , ninja - cartographer , undercover intelligence officer , and swordsman .
He spoke 25 languages ( 40 if you count dialects ) flawlessly ( can you imagine it ? 25 languages !
That ’s what happens , kids , when you do n’t treat your INT as a dump stat ) and was able to impersonate native speakers in Africa , Asia , and South America .
He was the first westerner who infiltrated Mecca disguised as an Afghani physician .
If he were discovered , he would have been immediately executed .
Just think about it .
An Englishman was able to enter the holy Muslim city , maintain his disguise all the time , demonstrate an understanding and familiarity with Islamic rituals ( asking “ what do we do now , guys ? ” was kind of out of the question ) , behave like a Middle East man ( mannerism , etiquette , reaction ) without raising suspicions , study everything and leave to write a book about it .
Anyway ...
Next step - the forbidden Muslim city of Harar in Somaly .
All non-believers who had entered Harar before Burton had been executed , but he manages to go in , party with the locals like it 's 1995 , and leave alive AGAIN .
Quite a feat .
Imagine infiltrating a town like that in an RPG .
Combat is not an option for obvious reasons .
You rely only on your knowledge , your “ soft ” skills and abilities .
I ’d definitely tap that .
Q : Non-combat solutions to ALL in - game problems ?
That 's crazy and I laugh at this crazy stuff .
Ha Ha. Ha. Ha .
A : This is crazy ?
No ! THIS IS SPA ....
Sorry , got carried away there a bit .
Have you ever thought about the " traditional " RPG design ?
Every little problem - and some games have hundreds of problem - can only be solved by violence .
- I was attacked by bandits
- GREAT ! LET ME KILL THEM !
- Rats ate all my food
- GREAT ! LET ME KILL THEM !
- My neighbours ...
- GREAT ! LET ME KILL THEM !
- My crops ...
- GREAT ! LET ME KILL THEM !
- My ...
- KILL ! KILL !
KILL !
- My lord , you 've killed everyone .
There is nobody left but me ....
* the great battle axe swings and a headless body hits the ground *
KILL .....
Since everyone 's ok with solving ALL problems with combat skills , I do n't see why solving ALL problems with non -combat skills should be an issue , but that ’s not what we are talking about here today .
We are talking about paths .
An RPG can have many optional quests , but as long as it offers several distinctive paths through the game , I 'm happy .
There are few things worse than playing a diplomatic character through the game and then suddenly being forced to fight because we ’ve entered the “ REAL MEN only ! ” area of the game , so it should be a complete and distinctive path through the game .
I ’d settle on at least Combat Boy , Charisma Boy , and Stealth Boy , but would prefer to see more .
Combat is definitely a great and enjoyable way to beat a game , but it should n’t be the only way .
Q : Yeah , yeah , whatever .
Non-combat gameplay = giving your character high intelligence and choosing the wordiest options available .
It 's a great read , but from a player - game interaction standpoint , not much is going on there .
That would be bad design again .
The way I see it , the diplomatic path , for example , should require a lot of in - game knowledge , interacting with characters , forming relationships , and so on .
You do all that and then getting the lines showing your character 's knowledge of the gameworld and his ability to manipulate situations would come as a reward when all pieces of the puzzle you 're playing with come together .
Let me use one of our optional quests as an example .
You are asked to assassinate a noble who 's plotting against the local lord .
The noble is well guarded , but that should n't stop you from going over there and killing everyone .
Your fighting prowess should be properly tested , after all .
However , let 's assume that you want to be a bit more creative .
We support that by offering you 4 different ways to kill the bastard .
Naturally , only one requires you to get you well - manicured hands dirty .
You can investigate the plotting business and find out that the noble relies on a certain general ’s support .
Then you acquire a legionnaire ’s uniform , put it on , and pay the noble a visit :
Guard :
Who the hell are you ?
PC :
1 . Show him the ring .
2. [ disguise ]
" General Pavolla has been assassinated !
Gaelius ' guards are on their way here . "
3. Attack .
If # 2 is successful : " Pavolla ... dead ... "
The guard slowly turns around , visibly shaken by the news .
1. Attack .
2 . " Take me to Serenas .
We do n’t have time to waste . "
Serenas looks at the guard and understands everything without words .
The details are n't important .
What 's important is that his dream of ruling House Aurelian is over .
" What happened ? " he asks weakly .
" General Pavolla was murdered by Gaelius ' assassins .
Several other patriots were brutally murdered in their own beds .
It 's a matter of time until they get to you , my lord . "
" What do you suggest ? "
1 . " You must flee at once . "
2. " Poison , my lord .
It 's painless and fast . "
" Poison ?
Are you out of your mind ? "
[ persuasion ]
" Have you ever visited your uncle 's torture chambers ?
You will be dying there for weeks , being broken in every possible way and begging for death .
Or you can die with dignity , by your own hand . "
If successful : Serenas ' hand shakes as he accepts the poison .
He looks you in the eyes with determination and hate as he swallows the liquid .
His death is quick and painless , as you promised .
Your work here is done .
Alternatively , you can have a chat with the guard , expressing your concerns about the whole situation and convincing the guard that Serenas will sell everyone the first chance he gets .
Then you go and scare the hell out of poor Serenas :
“ I do n’t believe it !
Gaelius would n't kill his own nephew .
I 'll go to him right now and explain everything .
It was that sneaky bastard Pavolla and the others .
Yes , the others .
If I give them to my uncle ... "
A well placed strike interrupts his tirade .
Grim - faced , the guard withdraws the blade from Serenas ' back - " Fucking vappa !
You were right .
He would have sold us all to save his own skin .
Do you have a problem with that , friend ? "
His nod indicates the dead body .
1 . “ None whatsoever . ” Salute and leave
2 . “ Actually , I do .
I 'm sure that general Pavolla might be disappointed too . ”
…
So , as you can see , kids , non-combat gameplay is interesting , realistic , and more complex than clicking on lines with more than three words .
If you ask me , that 's where all the fun is .
Why am I telling you all this ?
Well , son , I 'm building up your expectations and hopefully somehow that would translate into more interesting games with more depth than " poke dis guy with a sword until he 's dead , then report back for more killing " .

Nearly all RPGs feature a dangerous setting , where there the fear of death exists .
For the diplo - path , I think that this should mean that even though the * possibility * is there to avoid all combat , this should not necessarily mean that many players should manage to " get it " on their first playthrough .
There should be a real difficulty there , and a real fear of dying .
Also , the stealth boy approach is a hard one for me .
Most games that feature stealth never actually seem to have much content for it .
You might get some optional loot and stuff in certain games , but it rarely feels you 're getting rewarded somehow by sneaking vs other ways .
Rarely does a game recognize that you 've sneaked through a place instead of just killing all the guards before confronting the final boss .
Just more dialogue for the sneaky character would be great ( and a well done thieves guild would be a very good start ) .

Viral marketed over on the Codex for great justice .
Anyway :
The biggest problem I see with typical non -combat gameplay is that there 's rarely ever a degree of success .
The best you can hope for is a variance in how much you have to pay as a bribe , that sort of thing .
There 's too much scripting involved , whereas combat generally relies on dynamic interactions within a set of rules .
And more often than not , failure means " time to reload " because you 're not given opportunities to fail multiple times before " losing the battle " .
Of course , this is all because of a lack of design effort in this area , but are there simple , elegant and general solutions that can add a bit more variance to systems like dialogue or stealth ?
I think there are , and I think this thread is the place to brainstorm them .

I like what you said about how a little research could provide interesting solutions .
This could be applied to assassinations : you 'd have to gather all sorts of intelligence about someone before you attempt to kill them , for instance :
- with more complex npc schedules , it could be fun to map out the victims daily motions , and you should perhaps disguise yourself if you 're gonna follow him around , to avoid suspicion .
Once you know his activities , you could place deadly traps at proper locations .
Other options would be stuff like poisoning water or food supply .
One skill I have n't seen in crpg's , is something like " detect traps " , but you detect tracks and residue instead .
Besides tracking down monsters or whatever , you would also be forced to cover your own tracks for various reasons .
Maybe you failed to notice all the tracks due to poor skill , which would increase the probability of some cunning bounty - hunter closing in on your trail .
I need sleep now , I hope this reply was n't too half - baked

They have this kind of thing in Mount & Blade , it is really awesome .
You run into a fresh trail of a warparty , you know it 's time to turn around and head for the nearest town unless you are prepared .
You do n't have the skill , you and your party of peasants continue on oblivious .

Great read !
But I can't stop myself from nitpicking this example .
First - I do n't think that flooding the sewers would do much - those things do n't need to breathe .
So instead of having a dungeon full of monsters , you would have a flooded dungeon full of monsters .
And some very wet and pissed off Nosferatu .
Second idea - calling the cops .
Bloodlines is very forgiving when it comes to masquerade breeches , but this goes a bit too far imo .
In any vampire city the police force would be kept under control by whatever faction holds power , and you can bet that somebody is watching for just this kind of masquerade breeching stunts at all times .
Not only would it not work , but any attempt is likely to be met with extreme prejudice ( read - a gorilla with a big sword ) .
Now the third idea - calling in for help .
That is a great idea - why is n't the sheriff and his friends helping you ?
Where are all Camarilla vampires ?
And where are the Anarchs ?
If there is one thing that Anarchs hate even more the Camarilla , it 's the Sabbat .
This problem is n't limited to Bloodlines only - take Fallout 2 .
I have friends in power in Vault City , New Reno , NCR , Broken Hills , San Francisco and the Brotherhood .
So why am I going after the Enclave alone ( or with a few NPCs ) and not with a whole army ?!
Back to the Bloodlines example - here is another potential non-combat path .
By the time you get to the sewers , you already know at least one ugly - son - of - a - bitch that knows how to get to the Nosferatu warrens .
Why not pay him a visit , politely remind him of all the favors you did for him for which he has done practically nothing in return ( favor trading is very important in Camarilla ) and ask him to tell you how to find Nosferatu .
And if he refuses , then use favors you have with Therese & Jeannette , the Prince , the Regent or whomever and make them lean on him until he gives you the information .
I actually tried to do this when I was playing the game for the first time - it looked like a logical thing to do .
It was very disappointing to learn that the only way to the warrens leads through monster infested sewers .

This is a great piece , and should be pinned above every RPG developers monitor .
You are also getting better and better at writing these , its really fun to read your stuff by now .
However , you talk almost exclusively of quest design ( which of course makes sense as it is the key strength AoD seems to aspire to ) , I had hoped it would go a little beyond and also cover other non-combat gameplay elements , like crafting / alchemy / player - made magic , collecting , puzzles .

I think it 's a different topic .
I was talking about non-combat ways to play RPGs , while alchemy and crafting are what you do in - between combat .
Diablo 2 had a great crafting system with socketed items , gems of various strengths , runes & runewords , and crafting recipes , but the game had nothing but combat .
The Witcher had an interesting alchemy system , but it was a story - driven action game .
In AoD , for example , you can make acid and use it on locks , but the way I see it , that 's less about alchemy and more about providing alternative solutions .

CSI : RPG !
Great article , I agree fully that the combat focus is ridiculous , and one of the reasons the RPG genre is folding into others .
I mean , put a combat heavy , low choice RPG into FPP , make the combat real - time , what really distinguishes it from an FPS ?
Stats , levelling and a bit of dialogue , that 's not a seperate genre .
Of the alternatives ( stealth , dialogue ) , stealth seems the more achievable as a strong mechanic .
Some skills are already there , and the gameplay just needs to be cut and pasted from Thief .
I do think it unlikely for a generalist RPG to produce stealth play of this level , it would probably need to be a more thief focused RPG .
There is the problem of where the line between player and character skill is drawn , but I 'm sure it can be well implemented ( ie. having skills affect the light gem ) , and I certainly do n't want stealth as cool as Thief 's to be taken away from the player and being controlled by a mere roll of the dice .
When it comes to dialogue as an alternative , there are a number of unanswered questions and much more work that needs to be done .
I 've not played an RPG with dialogue resolution that was anything but an interesting departure from combat , a dialogue / knowledge mechanic has never been strong enough to stand on its own , like a good combat system can .
Is it possible for it to do so ?
Has any game come close ?
Is this likely or imminently achievable ?
Does Iron
Tower think they can achieve it ?
The example of dialogue resolution given in the OP is great , and contains some good choice for the player , " how will I deal with this situation : 1,2,3 , or 4 " as well as having a role for the character , by using character skill checks .
Where it is lacking in comparison to combat , is that there are much fewer options , the player does not really get to do anything cool , the gameplay is little different to reading normal dialogue trees that have no real options , it makes the player pay more attention but in the end he 's still just clicking on lines of dialogue and seeing more dialogue in response .
You are also often depriving the player of content , who would pass up hours of sewer scouring in VtmB for a quick dialogue with the police , leaving all the fun to them ?
What kind of dialogue gameplay have we seen in RPGs : choose from various pre-scripted options , character skill checks to determine success of actions , collecting knowledge from various sources via more pre-scripted dialogue and using that knowledge to make better choices .
The fun part of non -combat quest resolution is coming up with the idea , attempting it in game and finding that you can actually take that path .
Much like solving a puzzle in an adventure game .
Obviously , to have more of these cool moments , the developers need to code many different paths .
I see this kind of gameplay as satisfying , and a very good option in an RPG that also has stealth , combat and other options , but do not see it as strong enough to stand on its own the way combat is able to .
Can dialogue quest resolution be as strong a game mechanic as combat ?
Or is it destined to always be an option , or a nice addition to other elements ?
I 'm not querying whether a non -combat RPG could be made , I 'm certain it can , rather whether an RPG which focused as heavily on dialogue gameplay as most RPGs do on combat gameplay could be viable .
This may not be a goal worth aiming for , as a game does not need to be so narrowly focused , just questioning how far the dialogue focus can go .
The obvious answer to making dialogue gameplay more compelling , is mini -games .
Fahrenheit ( adventure game ) had a great system where you press a combination of arrow keys at the right time during dialogue and cutscenes .
I have no answers as to how to improve dialogue gameplay , just some half - baked ideas .
One possibility is to have some questions that the PC can always / often ask , and for the responses to these to be partially / mostly unscripted , based on game and PC / NPC states .
CSI : RPG !
Great article , I agree fully that the combat focus is ridiculous , and one of the reasons the RPG genre is folding into others .
I mean , put a combat heavy , low choice RPG into FPP , make the combat real - time , what really distinguishes it from an FPS ?
Stats , levelling and a bit of dialogue , that 's not a seperate genre .
Of the alternatives ( stealth , dialogue ) , stealth seems the more achievable as a strong mechanic .
Some skills are already there , and the gameplay just needs to be cut and pasted from Thief .

Substitution
Rather than every line of dialogue being completely static , I want to breathe a bit of life into them by a simple system of substitution .
When parsing raw script , the game looks for curly brackets : { } - which represent optional elements and parentheses : ( ) which represent required elements .
Both can potentially draw from the same Lexicon ( pool of words / phrases ) , but only curly bracketed lookups can return NULL .
The parser also automatically capitalises the start of each sentence , in case of a script that begins with an optional lookup .
So for example :
Code : { exclam_comma} what { the_fuck} was that {shit} ?!
can produce any of the following :
* What was that ?!
* What the fuck was that ?!
* Sweet Jesus , what in tarnation was that ?!
* Mother of fuck , what the motherfucking hell was that motherfucking shit ?!
... and so forth .
It all depends on what is contained in the Lexicon .
That 's all well and good for a bit of flavour , but kind of pointless unless it actually interacts with the gameplay .
So I introduce the concept of tags :
Tags
All entries in the Lexicon feature meta tags to describe the tone and content of the word / phrase , independent of its literal meaning .
Characters then choose their own speech according to the tags they prefer , and react accordingly to ones they do n't .
Tags may be generated dynamically during runtime , and an instance of the Lexicon effectively becomes a " living document " , changing and expanding throughout the course of the game .
So for example :
Code : in_trouble { " in trouble " [ default ] ; " up shit creek " [ swearing ] [ shit ] [ colloquial ] ; " fucked " [ swearing ] [ fuck ] ; " in quite a predicament " [ intellectual ] [ wordy ] ; }
So with those basics in place ( as well as a whole asston of other factors , such as skill / stats / emotional state ) , it 's now possible to say the same thing in umpteen different ways , and generate a varied response , such as a character who does n't like swearing in general , or one who ca n't stand the word " cunt " , and so forth .
It 's a start , but the actual " gameplay " side of it is still passive unless you give the player " tactical " control over their word / phrase picks .
The problem is , that gets clunky in a hurry if you have too much control , like a drop down for each substitution , so I 'm considering ways to create interesting macro controls over dialogue lines , such as setting " mode " , " tone " or " intent " and so forth .
It 's funny .
I 'm happy to preside over lengthy turn based combat interactions , but the idea of deliberating over a dialogue response for any longer than it takes to read the options abhors me , because I have this notion that it ought to remain " natural " and fairly immediate .
Am I the only who thinks this way ?
What would it take for " chess - like " consideration of each dialogue to be acceptable ?

Although I definately agree on many points that you made there , Vince , I 'm afraid that I do not entirely see this as a realistic goal .
At least , not for commercial RPGs .
I spoke about this with a mate , and he came up with an explanation that elaborates on it ...
The biggest problem actually is that noncombat gameplay is generally EXTREMELY badly repeatable .
There are exceptions , of course .
Stealth , for example , which requires a fairly advanced AI .
Plus of course some environment interaction systems that you just do n't need in a combat game .
But say you have a level with 5 obstacles to be passed before you reach Treasure™ .
If you already have a combat system in place ( and you will , even in an indie RPG ) , you just plop in 5 different monsters , either more and more difficult or in increasingly large groups .
JOB DONE !
If you want the player to be able to bypass them stealthily , and you have a stealth system in place , well you make sure the monsters patrol in set patterns so they can be avoided and that there 's something to hide in ( bushes , water , darkness , whatever ) .
So that 's two solutions !
Yay !
Now if you want the player to use diplomacy or trickery ... you have to write branching dialogue for that .
And you do n't get away with writing one piece of dialogue and just making it harder because that makes no sense .
You have to write new dialogue for each encounter , and you need to script the outcomes .
And if you 're as ambitious as the examples in the first post , you need a DAMN LOT OF BRANCHES .
And when you 're done , because you 're working on an AAA game here , you have to record that dialogue .
Then implement it .
And then test the whole thing .
Congratulations :
You just multiplied your workload by 20

My Thoughts :
( OrganicJar ) I ’m still surprised at the number of people who buy raw almonds thinking that they ’re raw .
The truth is they ’re not .
In the fall of 2007 a bill was passed requiring all raw almonds in North America to undergo a mandatory pasteurization making it illegal to purchase raw almonds .
Last week a federal judge rejected challenges to the law , which was introduced in response to two isolated outbreaks of salmonella , in conjunction with conventional almond farms , one in Canada in 2001 , and a second in Oregon in 2004 .
While contamination in almonds is not common , the industry determined that aggressive measures were necessary to prevent any other occurrences .
Raw almonds , the heartbeat of all nuts , literally , have been associated with reduced risk of heart disease , a rich source of calcium , magnesium , vitamin E , protein , fiber and antioxidants to name a few .
Now , these once amazing and life enhancing health benefits have become devastatingly reduced if not completely eliminated in the pasteurization process .
Luckily , there are a few loop holes that still allow you to purchase raw almonds .
You can purchase them online , and at farmers markets .
Just make sure to buy from a reputable source .
Laws like this are a blatant attack on our food freedom .
I remember emailing Nancy Pelosi back in 2007 , only to get an email response cloaked in “ we must do this for the health of the nation ” .
My only response was to ask , how many people die every day from prescription medication that the pharmaceutical cartel and corrupt FDA label as safe ?
I 'm still waiting for a response to that email .
Would love to hear your thoughts and any recommendations on where you buy your raw almonds .
" I have always divided the reaction between those two forces : those within the beltway , the ' fonctionnaires ' , those who gasp with horror , and on the other hand the heads of state who are far more realistic .
They are glad they did n't have to put the question themselves to their people . "
Corporate migration to Windows 7 may be less about evaluating the new Microsoft operating system and more about how to properly gauge the correct time to get XP off client desktops .
The equation corporate IT pros will have to figure out is how long it will take to get all their XP desktops to Windows 7 before XP support runs out or before application vendors quit producing XP versions of upgrades or new software , which some predict could come as early as 2012 .
Windows 7 is the shiny new operating system from Microsoft slated to arrive this fall to replace Windows Vista , which after 30 months has failed in the eyes of IT buyers .
Windows 7 offers a host of tantalizing corporate features such as AppLocker , DirectAccess , Branch Cache and XP Mode , a virtualization technology that should buy time for users who migrate but must hold on to key legacy applications .
Gartner predicts that more than half of the corporate Windows user - base is skipping Vista and aiming at Windows 7 .
While that means XP users wo n't have to tangle with Vista in name , it does n't mean they will avoid the application compatibility issues that gave Vista a black eye right out of the blocks in November 2006 .
Windows 7 is built on the Vista code base .
" If you are on XP , Windows 7 is n't going to solve a lot of Vista 's migration problems , " says Brett Waldman , a research analyst for IDC .
" Going from Vista to Windows 7 should be a much easier transition than XP to 7 . "
Users who have deployed Vista have an easier path because Microsoft provides an upgrade option not available to XP users , and because they have already solved their application compatibility issues .
Microsoft says nearly all applications that run on Vista will run on Windows 7 and early testing by users is beginning to validate that claim .
In addition , hardware upgrades made for Vista are relevant for Windows 7 rollouts .
While those rollouts wo n't be painless for Vista converts , it is those on the XP side who will have to tap into their planning and organizational skills .
The XP equation
The predominant migration questions among those coming off XP are " when " and " how . "
" What we are saying is that by the end of 2012 you should be off XP , " says Michael Silver , vice president and research director at Gartner .
With most large corporations taking 12 to 18 months to test and pilot a new operating system , the migration clock is ticking .
" If I target the end of 2012 to get XP out then you have your migration window , " he says .
" Organizations really need to be poised to do a lot of migrations on new machines and some existing ones in 2011 and 2012 .
That will be the mainstream of the migrations . "
Silver says Gartner 's recommendation is a conservative one that provides a 15 - month buffer before XP support ends on April 8 , 2014 .
Mainstream support for XP ended in April 2009 , just a year after XP SP3 shipped .
Microsoft for its part told XP users last month ( MAY ) that if they are just starting to test Vista that they should switch to Windows 7 .
Silver recommends users in that boat switch only if it means less than a six - month delay in their current planning .
" You do n't want to lose momentum .
If you have already done lots of testing or might be set to deploy you should continue with Vista , " he says .
" One of the big issues here is that Vista is a difficult decision politically at this point , but the folks that have migrated to Vista are generally happy . "
Hitching the migration horse to the Windows 7 wagon , however , does n't mean users wo n't have to take along issues that polluted Vista acceptance .
Applications that were not compatible with Vista wo n't work on Windows 7 .
The new XP Mode , available with professional , ultimate and enterprise editions , will give users a bit of a respite , but not a panacea .
With both Windows 7 ( the host operating system ) and XP ( guest ) running on a single machine , users will be forced to maintain and patch two operating systems per desktop .
Analysts such as IDC's Waldman and Gartner 's Silver say it 's a short - term solution .
" To take full advantage of new enhancements in Windows 7 , which is what users are paying for , the app needs to be built for Windows 7 , " Waldman says .
He says XP Mode is likely a one - to two - year Band - Aid .
Users are gearing up
" XP Mode might be the way we get around the fact that some of our institutional apps are behind the technology curve ; it could be the answer , " says Jeff Allred , manager of network services at the Duke University Cancer Center .
He said patch management tools will make it easier to manage two operating systems on a desktop and that XP Mode 's administrative considerations are not a showstopper
Allred is in the process of testing Windows 7 , which he says is faster , more stable and seems leaner than Vista .
" We are much happier with Windows 7 RC than Vista in its full shrink - wrap version , " he says .
He said a Vista migration would have meant upgrading 60 % of his hardware , something he was not prepared to do .
With Windows 7 and its smaller footprint , the majority of his hardware is already compatible .
The same is true for Wesley Stahler , senior system consultant at Ohio State University Medical Center , who is testing Windows 7 from an Asus Eee netbook .
He says the medical center is just now beginning migration discussions to move off XP .
" We have some clinical - based apps that work great on [ Internet Explorer ] 6 , but on IE 8 [ with Windows 7 ] not so much .
Those are the thing we will have to look into , " he says .
He says XP Mode might help , but " as someone who has to maintain the environment I would prefer not to support two operating systems . "
Stahler says there are other features that are enticing or will help save money .
" Right now we are using two different products to do what BitLocker can do , so we could save money and administrative headache , " he says .
BitLocker is a full - disk encryption feature introduced with Windows Vista and available in Windows 7 .
Microsoft 's input
For its part , Microsoft is offering its range of migration tools to help with a move to Windows 7 .
Microsoft also has added tools to its Windows Automated Installation Kit ( WAIK ) , specifically to ease the management and deployment of Windows images .
The Windows System Image Manager lets users do low - level customization of an operating system image .
The tool works with System Center Configuration Manager , which adds an administrative UI that lets users replicate information across their network .
Integration with System Center management tools supports rollouts that scale to enterprise deployments .
Windows 7 also features updates to Microsoft 's ImageX command - line tool , which lets users capture , modify and deploy Windows images .
The tool is rolled into Configuration Manager and given a GUI interface .
Deployment Image Servicing and Management also is part of WAIK and is used to apply updates and drivers to Windows images .
Microsoft also is updating its User State Migration Toolkit with a new feature for hard - link migration , which keeps desktop data on the machine during the operating system upgrade , cutting deployment time from hours to minutes .
And the forthcoming Microsoft Deployment Toolkit ( MDT ) 2010 is an updated version of the Business Desktop Deployment Kit that shipped with Vista .
It is now integrated with System Center Configuration Manager and builds off WAIK tools .
Microsoft will release version 6.0 of its Application Compatibility Toolkit once Windows 7 ships .
" The capability to centralize and bring into one admin console the ability to customize and deploy an [ operating system ] with applications and updates is where the Windows division with System Center is a great story , " says Jeff Wettlaufer , senior technical product manger for System Center .
Now the only other story left to tell is if Windows 7 will deliver on its promises .

This story , " Windows 7 Looks Good , but XP Migration Is Key " was originally published by Network World .
Sir Tim Berners - Lee , the inventor of the world wide web , will help the British government to make its data more easily available online , Gordon Brown said today .
" So that government information is accessible and useful for the widest possible group of people , I have asked Sir Tim Berners - Lee who led the creation of the world wide web , to help us drive the opening up of access to Government data in the web over the coming month , " the Prime Minister said in a statement about electoral and Parliamentary reform .
Sir Tim has been an eager proponent of better access to all forms of government and other data .
In a talk to the TED conference in March , shown below , he said : " What you find if you deal with people in government departments is that they hug their database , hold it really close , so that they can build a beautiful website to present it .
" I would like to suggest : sure , make a beautiful website , but first , give us – all of us – the unadulterated data .
We have to ask for raw data now . "
The government is known to be working on the creation of a central data source from which all sorts of government data could be accessed , as has been introduced by the Obama administration in the US .
Sir Tim was also critical of the obstacles that national governments put in the way of easy access to data .
" You have no idea of about the excuses people come up with to keep data out of your hands , even when you as taxpayers have paid for it , " he told the TED talk .
Sir Tim originally devised the technologies behind the world wide web in the early 90s while working at the particle collider laboratory at Cern in Switzerland : he was trying to devise a method that would allow researchers to get easy access to documents for a future project they were working on - the Large Hadron Collider , which finally began operation last autumn .
For a long time I had conflicting feelings about Bureaucrash .
On the one hand , I was encouraged to see a well - funded , well - organized libertarian organization that had broken out of the electoralist trap , was no longer focusing on trying to persuade statist politicians to be less statist , or , even worse , to try to replace them with other statist politicians , and that instead was committed to bypassing that whole shell game in favor of a primary focus on culture jamming , street - level organizing , and other forms of activism directed at ordinary people rather than at the political apparatus and its hangers - on .
And I know lots of awesome organizers and activists who have come out of Bureaucrash , I think precisely because of that focus .
On the other hand , Bureaucrash always presented itself as a wing mainly of the American libertarian movement ; even while many or most Crashers were not only radicals but anarchists , they spent a great deal of their time hanging out with , and promoting the causes of , reformist minimal statists — a strategy I think to be fundamentally self - undermining .
And part of the reason for all this was , of course , that there was always the Competitive Enterprise Institute hovering there , in the background .
And besides the institutional ties , in site of the shift in focus and rhetoric , there were still the lingering cultural and rhetorical attachments to the old conservative think - tank - tarian world — notably , a lot of cap - doffing , even in supposedly irreverent culture - jamming , to Capitalism , President Thomas Jefferson , and other idols of libertarian respectability ; also what seems to me to have been a lot of crude , or even willful , misunderstanding of the counter - globalization movement , and the critique of multi-statist neoliberalism .
However , as you may have noticed , in recent days CEI has taken some major steps towards relieving me of the burden of ambivalence .
If you have n’t noticed , former Crasher Xaq Fixx lays out why in his resignation letter :
Hello Crashers , I have had the pleasure of working with many of you during our time with Bureaucrash , and some of us have only recently discovered each other .
Regardless of whether we are new friends or old allies , I thank you all for your commitment to liberty .
As you all know since the beginning of Bureaucrash the position of Crasher - in - Chief has always been held by very principled libertarians .
All were welcomed to be members of the Bureaucrash community so long as they shared the desire to decrease the roll of the state in our lives .
Passionate freedom fighters Ryan Oprea , Jason Talley , and Pete Eyre have guided the organization as members and not as top down masters by encouraging people to find their own path to liberty and offering assistance along the way .
I had hoped to continue in this tradition if I was passed the sledgehammer .
Jason and Pete were some of my earliest supporters , and I thank them for that .
There were several other applicants for the crasher - in - chief ( CiC ) position that I would have gladly worked alongside as they followed the trails blazed by their CiC forerunners .
CEI has decided that tradition has no virtue , and crasher quantity is far more important than crasher quality .
Over the past several years they have attempted to exert more control over BC , stifling several pro-liberty projects , hamstringing others , discouraging some issues and encouraging others that fit their narrow vision of liberty that coincides with the interests of their donors .
Jason and Pete proved difficult to control , and I would be no better so they hired an outsider with no knowledge of our community .
They chose someone that they would n’t have to fight with or attempt to mold .
I cannot blame them for their hiring decision , because to them it makes sense .
Bureaucrash became their brand several years ago and they can do with it what they wish .
Lee Doren to some extent is as much a victim as any of us .
He was hired to turn Bureaucrash into a youth outreach organization by a conservatarian think tank .
Having no prior knowledge of Bureaucrash tt was not unreasonable for him to expect a crowd that shared similar views .
He was also not given help for feedback from CEI after being hired ; he was given a site and a password and told to make it work .
His views may not be in line with ours , but they are what his superiors were looking for .
We could perhaps fault him for taking a job with an organization where he strongly disagrees with the majority of active members , or at least being woefully uninformed about the goals of views of that group but , most likely , he was brought in to reform those things anyway .
He is just doing his job , and as this is a voluntary organization we should remember that every government employee is more deserving of scorn and ridicule than he .
Because of CEI ’s clear disdain for Bureaucrash ’s traditions , and complete lack of respect for all of us , the Crashers , I feel it is time to turn our backs on the Bureaucrash brand .
I will no longer be hosting the Podcrash , and will be returning all the equipment to CEI .
If they are to offer me the position of Crasher - in - Chief , I cannot in good conscious accept it knowing what they want to turn BC into .
I cannot continue to contribute my time , labor , and money to what is becoming a front group for an organization that is aligning itself with the authoritarian right instead of those that love liberty the most .
I would be honored if you would join me in finding somewhere else to unite against the ever growing state .
I have created a facebook group , ABC ( After Bureaucrash ) Action to share some alternatives , and discuss what you want out of them .
Yours in Liberty ,
Xaq Fixx
For some excellent commentary , see Brad Spangler ’s remarks , Misconception : Radicalism undermines reform efforts .
I ’d just want to stress , in addition to what Brad has to say , that the kind of co-optation and self - vitiation that Brad talks about are n’t just tendencies , and they are n’t just the work of some clever set of minimal - statist manipulators .
I think that they are built in to the electoral - reformist project itself , necessarily and always — that they are structural limitations that you will always face if your politics is hitched primarily to influence the state or trying to gain a base of power within the state .
The process itself only admits of certain outcomes , and the process itself also tends to consume those who put themselves into it .
( For more on why , see GT 2008 - 11 - 14 :
So you are in favor of personal money holes ?
and GT 2008 -02 - 25 : I am shocked !
shocked ! to find that politics is going on in here . )
So , depending on how you want to look at things , and how you think of what Bureaucrash was , you might think of this as the dismantling of Bureaucrash by the CEI .
Or you might think of it as the liberation of Bureaucrash from the CEI .
It all depends on whether you ’re interested in the brand or in the substance .
If it ’s the latter , then it does n’t matter what kind of shit the CEI decides to call Bureaucrash .
What ’s matters is what ’s going on among those who have come out , who have left the purges and the chickenshit co-optation behind them .
And if you ’re interested in that , then I think there ’s good reason to hope that this particular cutting of strings will lead to a more radical politics of individualism , without the constraints imposed by the think - tank paradigm , and with better connections and stronger ties to their real allies ( or ALLies ) and conversation partners in the freedom movement — the radicals , not the reformists ; the counter - economy , not the Establishment ; the anarchists , not the minimal - statists concentrated around the imperial Metropole ; that is , the left - libertarians , agorists , mutualists , social anarchists , and the rest of us on the anti-statist radical Left .
Here ’s hoping , anyway .
So let ’s get started .
The ex-Crashers are congregating around ABC Action :
ABC Action means After Bureaucrash Action –
This group is dedicated to those liberty loving activists that have made BC great over the years but are exploring other options due to the new direction CEI and Lee Doren want to take the organization .
And , for those of you who have a radical sensibility and some rad geekery skills , I especially want to point to Mike Gogulski ’s Activism opportunity for liberty - loving geeks , which was the main motivating factor in my putting up this post .
Mike says :
I have been asked to start up a small sub - working - group , a task force , if you ’ll pardon the term , of active people with the time , inclination , experience and knowledge necessary to provide and manage the technology infrastructure for this effort .
This will include , right away , setup and administration of a new ning.com social - networking site , and probably the same duties for a WordPress blog .
Longer - term , we need to create a new activist platform that goes beyond the capabilities of ning , and which could rival the reach and power of the online campaign management and fundraising systems used by groups like moveon.org , Campaign For Liberty , etc .
Anyone who would like to participate in this tech working group — or perhaps become its long - term leader — is invited to contact me directly , and right now !
Full contact info for me is at http://www.gogulski.com/contact.html
Yours in liberty ,

Bureaucrash has long been a focal point for libertarians who are young , focused , practical , radical , passionate , and creative .
Now that CEI has made it clear that they want more boring professionalist politicos , the ex-Crasher networks are going to become a focal point for libertarians who are young , focused , practical , radical , passionate , creative , pissed off , and , for the moment at least , have become free of binding ties to gradualism , reformism , conservative small - government types , and their program of governmentalist futility - through - respectability .
A time , then , to strike , while the hammer is free to swing .
We are going to dismantle the master ’s house , and we are going to build our own damned tools to do it with .
Onward .
Okay , there ’s good news and bad news .
The good news is that we ’ve found a safe source of fresh air for people trapped in high - rise hotel fires .
The bad news is that they have to feed a breathing tube into a vent pipe in the sewer line .
William Holmes ’ 1981 brainstorm probably would have saved many lives , but even a guest surrounded by toxic smoke has some natural squeamishness .
Jon Jones is not your average 21 - year - old .
In 2008 , the former state champion and junior college national champion wrestler signed a four - fight contract with the UFC , making him the youngest UFC fighter on roster at that time .
Jones had captured six professional wins against unknown competition between April and July of last year before making his UFC debut in August .
" Bones " actually planned on matriculating to a four year college after graduating with his Associate ’s Degree , but his plans quickly changed when the big league came knocking on his door .
Such is the case for athletes ahead of the curve .
His UFC debut came against Andre Gusmao at UFC 87 .
Jones took the fight on three weeks notice as a late replacement for Tomasz Drwal .
He went straight to work on the the former IFL standout , dismantling him with takedowns and unorthodox striking which showcased some flashier moves such as spinning elbows and a spinning back kick .
In his sophomore effort , Jones would go on to dominate the venerable Stephan Bonnar at UFC 94 .
The former Ultimate Fighter finalist was on the receiving end of a barrage of slick Greco throws , a spinning elbow that dropped him and a suplex for good measure .
Despite an empty gas tank towards the end of the fight , anyone who had dismissed Jones as a one - hit wonder was quickly reconsidering their position .
" As far as the Bonnar fight , a lot of people said I gassed out a lot , " said Jones .
" Only I know how I really felt .
I really started to realize , especially in the third round , that I really had that fight won .
Call it my lack of experience , but I was satisfied with winning the fight which caused me to back up more . "
" My corner told me to use my push kick more and keep my hands up .
All Bonnar could do was swing and hope he could pull something off .
I really was n’t that tired .
I was just trying not to get caught .
I was satisfied with the win and was playing smart .
Next time , it will be different . "
" And just for the record , Bonnar was exhausted too .
It was just a grueling fight .
And I was supposed to get my ass kicked .
I pull off a unanimous decision over Stephan Bonnar and people are talking about my cardio .
I should be somewhat tired .
I am not superman -- yet ( laughs ) . "
Jones now carries an 8 - 0 record as a professional mixed martial artist , with five wins by knockout .
What is most impressive is that instead of smothering opponents with his wrestling ability , he became branded as a dangerous striker almost immediately .
Now the biggest stage in all of MMA awaits Jon Jones as he takes on Jake O’Brien at UFC 100 .
For Jones , he feels blessed to be on the historic card and if things go according to plan , his birthday present to himself –- which is one week after UFC 100 - – will be a 9 - 0 record .
" It ’s an absolute blessing to be on this card .
There is no other way to explain it when there are so many other big name established fighters .
I believe I got on the card because of my style of fighting .
I go out there and I like to mix it up and throw strikes that people do n’t see coming . "
" I realize it ’s entertaining for the audience to see strikes that you do n’t see in your everyday MMA match .
So the UFC wanted to add a little flair and excitement to the undercard .
I am honored they chose me . "
While his fight with Jake O’Brien is on the undercard , Jones is confident that his performance will have the fight making its way onto the pay - per-view .
" Getting on the main card will help out with sponsors and get me more exposure .
I am hoping something magical happens out there and the fight gets shown .
I have some new tricks to show the fans .
If you watch from the Gusmao fight to the Bonnar fight you will see a huge difference in technique , form and knowledge . "
" I am growing every day , like wildfire .
I have no clue how much better I ’ve gotten until I go out there and pull the trigger again .
I am on that exponential learning curve right now so with each fight , I will just get better and better .
I am looking forward to going out there and showing it . "
Jones realizes that the light heavyweight division is one of most stacked in the organization .
When talk turned to what would allow him to stand apart , the young man who learned a great deal of his fight style from watching YouTube videos had a specific answer .
" My ability to rapidly absorb new information and add new tools to my arsenal will effectively set me apart .
A lot of guys who have been in the UFC who have been around for years have their set game plan and strategies .
I do n’t really have a game plan or strategy yet . "
" I do n’t have a set way of fighting .
I am learning how to fight in the UFC which is insane .
This is the biggest stage in the world and I am still learning how to fight and practicing on world class athletes in the process . "
" That has helped me out so much .
I want to be thrown into deep waters every fight .
I ’m a freak about taking in new techniques , remembering old ones and combining it all together .
I am fresh in this sport .
I have a fresh head , a fresh chin and a fresh body .
I am just ready to go out there and abuse some people . "
Jones went on to explain about his personal YouTube phenomenon .
" When I first started out I did n’t have the best coaching staff so I took things into my own hands .
I had to find techniques that worked so that is where the YouTube videos came in .
I started out by watching K - 1 videos to see how they kicked , all the angles , and went from there .
" It is a good idea for young fighters to go beyond the things they can learn in the gym .
Do your own research .
I was taught by some of the best guys in the world .
I really sat up and took notice and it paid off .
It ’s a new era with the Internet , so why not take advantage ? "
Jones ' uninhibited confidence recently extended to him making statements about current light heavyweight champion Lyoto Machida which left many asking , " Who does Jon Jones think he is ? "
For Jones , all the uproar left him slightly confused .
" I was a bit disappointed in how people perceived my comments .
I do n’t get online much to read negative stuff but one of my buddies called me and said there were a lot of people commenting about the Machida thing . "
" The bottom line is I am a fighter .
If you ask me a question about another fighter I am going to respect the other guy but I am not going to sit there and stroke anyone ’s ego .
I am not going to talk about how great Machida is , how he has started his own era , or say he ca n’t be beat . "
" How are you going to ask me about some other fighter and expect me to back down ? "
" I am going to tell you that I can beat this guy ; that I know I can beat this guy .
If you ask me the same question about Fedor , I have to say that I am going to beat the guy .
That ’s just the way it has to be .
It does n’t mean I think I am the greatest fighter alive . "
" A fighter needs ultimate confidence .
If you want to win you have to believe at your core that you can win at all times .
Even if the fight does n’t happen for two or three years maintaining complete confidence is the key .
You have to know with all your heart .
The saying , ‘ In order to achieve you must believe ’ is something I take seriously .
The body achieves what the mind believes . "
Jones does n’t want his confidence to come across as cockiness .
What he does want is for fans of MMA to know just how seriously he takes his mixed martial arts .
" I ’m trying to be cocky and speak ahead of myself .
Obviously I am not saying I can beat Machida right now but when the UFC gives me a fight like that , I am going to be at that level , and I am going to believe 100 % that I am going to kick his butt . "
" This is just more then just a sport for me .
I think of myself as a modern day warrior .
When I step in that gym I am extremely serious everyday .
I am teaching myself how to think like a martial artist and truly live the life of a martial artist . "
" I am so into this and involved in this that I look to be a modern day Samurai warrior .
I have left behind the old Jon Jones , the guy that went out and just did whatever .
Those that know me now look at me as a martial artist and a fighter .
I have learned to embrace it for what it is . "
Back to his UFC 100 opponent , Jones is very excited about his fight with Jake O’Brien .
Jones wants to give the former heavyweight fighter a proper introduction to the light heavyweight division and he thinks his style is the perfect one to do that .
" The first component of my strategy is to stay on my feet and outstrike him .
I have worked on my takedown defense a lot .
I think it ’s going to be hard for him to take me down .
He is used to fighting big , slow heavyweights .
I will be a different animal .
I will be something he has never seen before with my striking and speed . "
" I will also look to mix it up in the wrestling department .
Gusmao and Bonnar are both good at jiu - jitsu so my game plan was to take them down , score some points and not be on the ground for an extended period of time . "
" It ’s different with O’Brien because I can take him down , get into scrambles with him , roll with him , go for submissions and reversals and not worry about some slick Gracie technique that I have n’t seen before . "
" I will fight him a lot differently .
You will get to see a lot more of my fight style .
You will see my ground game .
You will get to see my takedowns , my takedown defense .
I wo n’t know how strong he truly is until I grab him but I am very confident in my strength . "
The third time could be the charm for Jones at UFC 100 .
If he can avoid the double leg takedown and punching power of O’Brien he will be 3 - 0 inside the Octagon and looking toward brawls with fighters in the top 10 of the division .
But Jones is n’t too worried about who he fights next .
" I think of it as destiny for the most part .
After the O’Brien fight is over it will be the UFC ’s decision to either kick it up a notch or baby me and take it slow and let me learn and go that route .
Ultimately it does n’t matter .
Let ’s say they give me a Forrest Griffin next .
That is going to elevate me so much .
Now I am forced to train at a whole different level .
It will push me to improve my striking , blocking , Muay Thai and Jiu-Jitsu .
Stepping in the cage with the best guys in the world is eventually going to make me the best fighter and athlete I can be . "
When asked what Jones saw in his future the picture of success was crystal clear in his mind .
" I visualize myself with a belt around my waist .
You have to set your intentions and make it a reality .
You have to think positive all the times , not just some of the time .
Paint a very specific picture of what success looks like your mind .
You create your own success .
It is what the most successful people in the world do to achieve unlimited abundance . "
In the UFC success comes one fight at a time .
For Jones , his future success starts this Saturday night on the biggest stage to date .
Beyond the very general details of the X3 , Taser is still keeping mum with the specifics on how it works , confirming only that the X3 fires equal or less voltage than their current model , the X26 , which can unload 50,000 volts at its peak .
Taser claims the actual shock delivered to the body is in the range of 400 - 1,200 volts .
The X3 also includes a feature that reports back on whether the shock delivered was " good , partial or no connection . "
Commodore and Apple : Late love with obstacles
C64iPhone is a full C64 emulator , that is even officially licenced from Commodore Gaming .
You can play all the vintage games with it .
It comes initially with five games at the moment .
So here ’s the website .
But there is more to this story .
I was wondering , why nobody else did this thing before , C64 on the iPhone .
It seems , that several people tried to do a port of the Frodo - emulator for the iPhone SDK sufware emulator – just for the fun of doing it .
According to reports form Touch Arcade and Pocket Gamer a developer from Manomio also worked on this project , but later rejected it because
a ) there the licences from Commodore were unclear and
b ) the terms of the iPhone store would not allow a project like this .
But the itch under the fingernails stayed .
So he went to Commodore and Kiloo and began clearing the rights .
He also contected Apple right away , if an emulation - project like this would be possible to release on some future day .
The got really exited at Apple and confirmed the project .
And here we are now .
And you know what ?
Apple rejected the app !
It seems , that Manomio will have to remove the BASIC - interpreter in the app and make this whole thing only possible for emulating games .
What is the coder in you now saying ?
Buhu .
Why is licensing - stuff an obstacle for expressing creative code ?
I call this a major fail ( at least from the Apple iPhone policy ) .
This here is the official statement form Apple , that were send with the rejection :
Thank you for submitting C64 1.0 to the App Store .
We ’ve reviewed C64 1.0 and determined that we cannot post this version of your iPhone application to the App Store because it violates the iPhone SDK Agreement ; “ 3.3.2
An Application may not itself install or launch other executable code by any means , including without limitation through the use of a plug - in architecture , calling other frameworks , other APIs or otherwise .
No interpreted code may be downloaded and used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple ’s Published APIs and built - in interpreter (s ) . ”
So let ’s wait what will happen to this project .
The last word is n’t spoken yet .
Update :
There is also another version , that say , that the App was rejected , because the ROM - Files ( the games actually ) are interpreted the be “ Emulator App ” , and not this official iPhone API .
So this is the rule from the iPhone SDK agreement I quoted above .
Really lame , but there seem to be also a lot of other apps live on the App Store , like apps , that play .
SID - files , that would be also break this rule .
Let ’s still wait for new developments .
Update : The C64 - iPhone got approval by apple !
Update 2 : The day after the app got unapproved again , but today ( 11 - 11 ) it should be available again .
Slowly also more and more games are being ported to the C64 on iPhone .
Stephen Leahy interviews JAMES LOVELOCK the scientist who first proposed the Gaia Hypothesis
TORONTO , June 5 2009 ( Tierramérica )
“ When the first great climate disaster strikes , I hope we will all pull together just as if our nation were being invaded , ” says British scientist James Lovelock in this exclusive Tierramérica interview .
Please throw something in the tip jar before reading on .
This is how I make my living .
As the world marksInternational Environment Day Friday , Lovelock argues that as the climate warms and the carbon content of the atmosphere soars , humanity is facing a far grimmer future that will be upon us sooner than any of the projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
A chemist , physician and biophysicist , Lovelock is one of the world ’s foremost environmental scientists and founder of the Gaia Hypothesis , which describes the planet as a living organism , a complex system in which the components of the biosphere and atmosphere interact to regulate and sustain life .
Although his ideas often feed controversy , Lovelock has wide - ranging scientific credentials .
As an inventor , he holds more than 50 patents , including the first devices for detecting the presence of ozone - depleting CFCs ( chlorofluorocarbons ) and pesticide residues in the environment .
He is also the author of many books .
The most recent , “ The Vanishing Face of Gaia : A Final Warning ” , was published in April .
Lovelock spoke with Tierramérica ’s Stephen Leahy in Toronto .
TIERRAMÉRICA :
Why are you critical of the IPCC ?
JAMES LOVELOCK :
There are many excellent scientists working with the IPCC but their computer climate models cannot model the biosphere ’s response to increasing temperatures from global warming .
The models do not include forest or ocean response to rising carbon dioxide levels .
They cannot model a self - regulating Earth as yet .
That is why the IPCC projections are so far off the mark .
Observational evidence shows sea level rise has been much higher and the melting of the Arctic is happening far more quickly than IPCC predictions .
Climate change is happening much faster than most realise .
TIERRAMÉRICA : Has the Earth already passed a climate tipping point ?
JL : Yes , I think it has .
The Earth is already moving towards a hotter state in response to the changes we ’ve made in transforming much of the surface of the planet and adding CO2 into the atmosphere .
Let ’s not forget that the Earth was once nearly entirely forested and those forests were a major part of a living planet ’s regulatory system .
Based on Gaia theory at some point in the future there will be a sudden shift to a new global climate that may be 5 or 6 degrees Celsius warmer on average than today .
I have no idea when that shift might happen but my guess is that we may have 20 years to prepare .
TIERRAMÉRICA :
What will this new climate be like ?
JL : The tropical and subtropical zones of the Earth will be too hot and dry to grow food or support human life .
People will be forced to migrate towards the poles to places like Canada .
There will be less than one billion people by the end of the century .
My hope is that we will stay civilised and those in the North will give refuge to the unimaginably large numbers of climate refugees .
TIERRAMÉRICA :
You paint a grim view of the future .
Is there no hope ?
JL : My main point is that we humans need to adapt and survive on this new hotter planet .
Humans survived the last interglacial age , when ice covered much of North America and Europe and sea levels were 120 metres higher than today .
The first step is to stop thinking blindly that all we have to do is reduce our carbon footprint , and begin preparations to adapt to what is coming .

The Nanny Nation
Once upon a time , America was a wild , unsettled country .
Enterprising men and women eager for land of their own literally ran for it .
They spent their lives working from dawn until dusk on lonely homesteads to build a better life for themselves and their children .
The distance between survival and total failure was small , and families behaved accordingly — protecting against risk with great caution .
Barry Ritholtz , in his new book Bailout Nation : How Greed and Easy Money Corrupted Wall Street and Shook the World Economy writes , “ The iconic image is the American cowboy .
You can picture him on a cattle drive , wearily watching over his herd .
All he needed to get by were his wits , his horse — and his trusty Winchester . ”
Americans are proud of this heritage , proud of being a country of “ determined , self - reliant individuals ” where hard work , not government handouts or family connections , promised a shiny future .
Ritholtz ’s book seeks to explain how the United States , once so proud , became “ a nanny state for well - paid bankers . ”
Ritholtz may be just the right person to explain the transition to both the disillusioned amateur and the finance junkie .
He does n’t pull his punches or bury the truth in layers of finance - speak , caveats , and disclaimers .
Since he began blogging seven years ago , in - the - know readers of his popular blog , The Big Picture , have turned to Ritholtz for his prescient , refreshingly honest commentary on the economy .
Anyone interested in understanding the roots of our current crisis should check out the book , but while you wait by the mailbox , here are some highlights .
Ritholtz On Bailouts
Unlike some commentators and economists who have blamed the crisis on a failure of capitalism and free markets , Ritholtz bases his book on the premise that we have n’t had a properly functioning capitalist system since 1971 , the fateful year that the U.S. government bailed out Lockheed Martin .
Before 1971 , ” … excessive greed , recklessness and foolish speculation were punished by the market . ”
If an early American cowboy left his herd to pursue a shaky investment deal , he most likely ended up ruined , stuck on a construction crew in some dusty outpost while he tried to scrape together enough money to start again .
Meanwhile , the conservative cowboy who stuck with his herd , growing it carefully and cautiously , prospered — and perhaps picked up a few of Cowboy # 1 ’s cattle at a steep discount .
After 1971 , all of that changed .
While the United States government had intervened on other occasions to encourage young industries , its involvement had been modest and usually resulted in the delivery of a valuable public good .
The Lockheed bailout was different ; it was the first government bailout of an individual , private corporation .
It also flew in the face of capitalism ’s crucial auto - correcting mechanism .
Ritholtz quotes the economist Allan Meltzer : “ Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin — it just does n’t work . ”
A generation of American cowboys had learned that if their business venture failed , their very own red , white , and blue knight would come riding in .
Ritholtz walks his reader through the bailouts of the 70’s , 80’s , and 90’s and stops briefly at the 1980 Chrysler bailout to play “ What If ” as in “ What if the government had n’t butted its nose into the private sector ? ”
He hypothesizes that the failure of Chrysler might have served as a wakeup call to General Motors , Ford , and the United Auto Works ( UAW ) union , resulting in more fuel - efficient cars and more sustainable labor contracts .
Chrysler ’s assets may have attracted investors , Korean manufacturers perhaps , and the company may have reemerged as a smarter , slimmer corporation .
“ It is quite reasonable to conclude that the bailout of Chrysler in 1980 prevented significant market forces from doing their best to reboot the entire U.S. auto sector . ”
Ritholtz on Greenspan
Ritholtz reiterates some well - established criticisms of Greenspan — he kept interest rates too low for too long , he had blind faith in the self - regulating powers of markets , etc .
However he also takes the Federal Reserve governor to task for his focus on propping up asset prices , a policy Greenspan affirmed in 1996 .
Greenspan said , ” … evaluating shifts in balance sheets generally , and in asset prices particularly , must be an integral part of the development of monetary policy . ”
To Ritholtz , this new focus on asset prices as a goal of monetary policy explains much of Greenspan ’s disastrous actions .
He writes :
The Fed ’s power to change interest rates as a way to promote and protect asset prices is the key to understanding the Greenspan era .
Indeed , it is the crucial economic element that was the precursor to the late 2000 bailouts .
Rather than seeing markets as a sign of the economy ’s health , the Fed chair tended to see asset prices as an end unto themselves .
What this led to was the treatment of symptoms , rather than underlying causes .
The markets ’ health , rather than the economy ’s , seemed to be what was of paramount importance .
Once Greenspan established his willingness to protect asset prices , traders and market participants began to engage in ever riskier behaviors .
After all , as long as Greenspan had their backs , what was the downside ?
Ritholtz on The Ratings Agencies
Ritholtz does n’t go any easier on the ratings agencies , a stance which has caused him some headaches .
In a recent blog entry , he wrote that he butted heads significantly with McGraw - Hill , the book ’s original publisher and the owner of Standard and Poor ’s , over his critique of the agencies .
Ritholtz eventually returned his advance and found a different publisher for the book .
Ritholtz explains that the ratings agencies were integral players in the creation of the structured products , working to ensure that they received triple - A ratings .
It was these triple - A ratings that allowed the securities to spread so thoroughly through the market , leaving even “ conservative ” investors vulnerable .
More controversially , he also places blame squarely on the purchasers of these products .
He writes :
Buyers of these securities should have paused a moment to consider one simple fact :
These C.D.O. ’s rewrote the laws of economics .
They promised to be as safe as U.S. Treasuries , but paid out a significantly higher yield .
In other words , for the same exact risk , the reward was much greater .
This should have been recognized as an impossibility .
In the markets , greater reward always means greater risk .
Someone would either be winning a Nobel prize in economics — or going to jail .
Bailout Nation is a lament for the early days of our country , for a system that was both ruthless and ruthlessly efficient , a system that no longer exists in the United States .
Ritholtz writes , “ As a car guy , I can say without hesitation that General Motors has n’t designed a dashboard that was n’t ugly as sh*t since the 1950’s . ”
He then goes on to point to Toyota ’s success in America and concludes , “ I am hard - pressed to name any nonfinancial American company that deserves bankruptcy more than G.M. ”
In a post we did a couple weeks ago about the Salinger suit , we quoted a copyright lawyer who suggested that the work by the defendant , J.D. California ( a.k.a. Fredrik Colting ) might only withstand Salinger 's challenge if he could prove that his book was a parody of Salingers ' original , the " Catcher in the Rye . "
In order to prove itself " parodic , " the lawyer said that California 's book might have to provide commentary on the original work .

Canada ’s chief diplomat in Israel has been honored at an Israeli public park — built on occupied Palestinian land in violation of international law — as one of the donors who helped establish the park on the ruins of three Palestinian villages .
Jon Allen , Canada ’s ambassador to Israel , is among several hundred Canadian Jews who have been commemorated at a dedication site .
A plaque bearing Allen ’s name is attached to a stone wall constructed from the rubble of Palestinian homes razed by the Israeli army .
Allen , who is identified as a donor along with his parents and siblings , has refused to talk about his involvement with the park .
Rodney Moore , a Canadian government spokesman , said the 58 - year - old ambassador had not made a personal donation and that his name had been included as a benefactor when his parents gave their contribution .
It is unclear whether he or they knew that the park was to be built on Palestinian land .
Canada Park , which is in an area of the West Bank that juts into Israel north of Jerusalem , was founded in the early 1970s following Israel ’s occupation of the West Bank in the 1967 war .
It is hugely popular for walks and picnics with the Israeli public , most of whom are unaware they are in Palestinian territory that is officially a “ closed military zone . ”
Uri Avnery , a former Israeli parliamentarian who is today a peace activist , has described the park ’s creation as an act of complicity in “ ethnic cleansing ” and Canada ’s involvement as “ cover to a war crime . ”
About 5,000 Palestinians were expelled from the area during the war , whose 42nd anniversary is being marked this month .
Israel ’s subsequent occupation of the West Bank , as well as East Jerusalem and Gaza , is regarded as illegal by the international community , including by Canada .
The country has become increasingly identified as a close ally of Israel under the current government of Stephen Harper , who appointed Allen as ambassador .
About $ 15 million — or $ 80 m in today ’s values — was raised in tax - exempt donations by the Canadian branch of a Zionist organization , the Jewish National Fund ( JNF ) , to establish the 1,700 - acre open space following the 1967 war .
The Canadian government spokesman declined to say whether an objection had been lodged with the fund over its naming of Allen as a donor , or whether Allen ’s diplomatic role had been compromised by his public association with the park .
The spokesman added that the park was a private initiative between Israel and the JNF in Canada .
That view was challenged by Dr. Uri Davis , an Israeli scholar and human rights activist who has co-authored a book on the Jewish National Fund .
“ Canada Park is a crime against humanity that has been financed by and implicates not only the Canadian government but every taxpayer in Canada , ” he said .
“ The JNF ’s charitable status means that each donation receives a tax reduction paid for from the pockets of Canadian taxpayers . ”
Davis and a Canadian citizen are scheduled to submit a joint application to the Canadian tax authorities next week to overturn the JNF ’s charitable status .
He said they would pursue the matter through the courts if necessary .
Davis said attempts to rename Canada Park “ Ayalon Park ” over the past decade suggested that the Canadian authorities were already concerned about the prospect of the country ’s involvement in the park coming under scrutiny .
Joe Rabinowitz , the executive vice - president of the JNF in Canada , said ceramic plaques to Canada Park ’s donors — including Allen — had been erected a couple of years ago .
Previous metal dedication signs were stolen many years ago , he said .
He refused to comment on the circumstances of the park ’s creation , saying details about the park were available on the JNF ’s website .
A search , however , found only passing references to Canada Park .
The JNF is a major landowner in Israel , with duties that include establishing and managing parks and forests on behalf of the Jewish people worldwide .
Most of the parks have been created over the remains of more than 400 Palestinian villages destroyed after the foundation of Israel in 1948 .
Canada Park is believed to be the only example , outside East Jerusalem , of the JNF becoming directly involved in managing land in the Occupied Palestinian Territories .
JNF operations in the West Bank are run by a subsidiary , Himanuta .
The formal division between the two companies is designed to protect the charitable status of contributions to the JNF .
Donations are often used to plant forests of pine trees over destroyed villages , including at Canada Park .
The organization boasts it has helped plant more than 240 million trees in Israel .
According to Ilan Pappe , an Israeli historian , only a tenth of local indigenous tree species survived the JNF ’s reforesting program with pines .
He said that fast - growing pine was preferred because it was a rapid way to ensure expelled Palestinians could not return to their land and year - round foliage also helped to conceal the rubble of the destroyed villages .
At Canada Park , scattered stones from the three villages are still visible , and one building , a mosque misleadingly labelled a Roman bathhouse , stands near its entrance .
One of the villages , Imwas , is believed to be the Biblical site of Emmaus , where Jesus supposedly appeared to two disciples after his resurrection .
Among non-Canadian donors mentioned on the plaques in Canada Park is “ Martin Luther King , USA . ”
It is believed the donation was made on behalf of the human rights leader after his assassination .
In an interview with Canadian TV in 1991 , Yitzhak Rabin , who headed the army during the 1967 war and later became prime minister , said he had personally ordered the destruction of the three villages within what became Canada Park .
He justified the decision on the grounds that Egyptian commandos were hiding there .
However , photographs by Amos Keenan , who entered the villages with the army as an official photographer , confirm Palestinian testimony that the Israeli soldiers faced no resistance as they advanced .
Uzi Narkiss , the Israeli general who led the assault on the villages , has said their destruction was “ revenge ” for the army ’s failure to capture this much - prized section of West Bank land — then known as the Latrun Salient — in the earlier , 1948 war .
Today most of the Palestinian families expelled from the three villages are living in the West Bank or Jordan , unable to visit their former lands .

Uganda has already lost two - thirds of its forests in the last 20 years and could have lost all of its forested land by 2050 , which would have severe repercussions for its poorest people according to environmentalists .
Deforestation has already seen Uganda 's 5 million hectares ( 12.3 million acres ) of forest in 1990 dwindle to 3.5 million by 2005 .
Now the National Environment Management Authority ( NEMA ) has warned that if deforestation continues in Uganda at its present rate there will be no forests left in 40 years .
In its State of the Environment Uganda 2008 report , published this month , NEMA attributes the acceleration of deforestation to expanding farmland , a population boom and increasing urbanisation .
It says unless the situation is reversed , the knock - on effect will be catastrophic , contributing to and exacerbating soil degradation , declining food security , disease and conflict .
" In 41 years time , if the current rate of deforestation continues , the per capital forest cover will be zero because already we are tending towards desertification - type conditions , " Aryamanya Mugisha , executive director at NEMA , told the UN newswire IRIN today .
Annet Nakyeyune , an environmentalist at Makerere University , added that the poorest people living in rural areas , such as Katine , would be hardest hit .
Desertification due to deforestation is likely to " tamper with the country 's food security because rainfall will be erratic , floods rampant , " she said .
Nakyeyune also warned that water sources will disappear , water catchment areas will dwindle , agricultural productivity will be badly hit and livelihoods destroyed as a result .
Disease will also inevitably increase .
The situation is being blamed partly on Uganda 's booming population , which is growing at a rate of 3.2 % per annum .
Areas around the capital , Kampala , have lost more than 78 % of forest land since 1990 .
NEMA also say that as only 10 % of Uganda 's population has access to electricity and 89 % of rural Ugandans use firewood to cook it will be an uphill struggle to reverse this alarming trend .
If NEMA is correct , then the people of Katine are likely to be among the first hit by the effects of deforestation and climate change .
Already farmers in Katine say they are struggling to adapt to what they perceive as rapidly changing and increasingly erratic weather patterns .
Rain is not falling when it is supposed to and drought has left many farmers struggling to find enough food to feed their families .
On the Katine site today , Joseph Malinga reports on farmers ' fears of serious famine as a result of poor rains .
It is one of the greatest injustices that the world 's poorest will be the hardest hit by global climate change and the effects of deforestation and the destruction of the natural environment .
The introduction of new strains of drought - resistant cassava as part of the Katine project 's livelihoods programme is one way the project is trying to help farmers mitigate against more unpredictable weather , but are we doing enough ?
Libertarians believe that property is an essential human right .
Because of this , they maintain that taxation is an unjust and unnatural violation of their rights .
Property , after all , is a natural extension of the idea of self - ownership .
Here 's the problem , though .
You control your body so completely that even assuming Cartesian dualism , it may as well be YOU .
The same is not true of , say , a gold mine , your house , or your car .
Property does n't exist without the same sort of coercion inherent in taxation .
The natural state of things is for there to be no ownership .
Nobody can lay claim to a patch of virgin forest until someone picks up a weapon and kills anyone who challenges that claim , or convinces someone else to help them do this , like the government or a group of hired thugs .
Until that happens , it 's free .
Anyone can cross it , anyone can have their sheep graze , anyone can mine the ground under it , etc .
Yes , property is ultimately needed to prevent chaos , but practical necessities are completely separate from moral rights , and even the necessity of property is ultimately theoretical .
Property ( and the market ) is a convenience , nothing more .
When you fail to see this , you descend into totem worship and lose the argument .
Incidentally , I may have figured out why conservatives hate nature .
Nothing they believe in exists in nature .
Not God , not the State , not property , not the military , not even race .

A tense debate in Iceland 's parliament on whether to apply to join the European Union stretched through a fifth day Wednesday , with the prime minister predicting a tight vote .
The marathon session reflects deep rifts in Iceland over how best to resurrect the country after its financial meltdown during the global crisis last fall , when excessive overseas borrowing wrecked Iceland 's banks and its currency , the krona .

For most of us , it seems like there ’s never enough time in the day .
This is especially true for those of us who enjoy our sleep and have difficulty dragging ourselves out of bed .
But if you want to make more time in your day , you need to get up earlier .
So what ’s a habitual …
Special Announcement :
It is with a heavy heart that Out of the Woodwork Productions announces the cancellation of the Virginia Renaissance Faire ’s 2020 season .
The decision was n’t made lightly – we know that the Faire is important to so many people .
But for the safety of all and in the interest in making sure the Faire can come back strong in 2021 , we will not open this year .
Please stay tuned out our Facebook page during what would have been our season .
Our Faire will be fine – but the artisans and performers who help bring our Faire to life are being terribly impacted by this loss of income .
We ’ll be providing an online place for them to promote what they do – please , if you are able , what you ’d normally spend at our faire , this year , spend on supporting them .
We ’ll be back in 2021 to celebrate our 20th season and hope to see you then !
Germans Can Now Buy Gold Through Vending Machines
A vending machine selling tiny gold bars was launched at the main railway station in Germany ’s Frankfurt - am - Main .
The ATM machine , the size of a phone - booth and shaped as a gold bar , was installed in the financial metropolis of the European Union , Itar - Tass news agency reports .
The new service appeared because of the aspiration of the Germans to rescue their savings during the crisis converting the funds on their bank accounts to gold bars .
About 59 tons of gold bars and coins were sold to natural persons during the first quarter of the current year in Germany .
The gold sales exceeded the same - period level of the previous year four times .
The prices on gold bars available through the ATM change several times a day according to market fluctuations of gold prices .
One gram of gold is currently priced at 31 EUR .
The ATM accepts credit cards and cash .
Each gold bar comes with the certificate of authenticity .
The Germans hold the absolute leadership when it comes to purchasing gold .
For comparison , the French bought only 1.1 tons of gold from January to March .
About 500 gold - dispensing ATMs will be installed in Frankfurt - am - Main and other large German cities in the foreseeable future .

In Japan , Nintendo has released the Metroid Prime games on Wii as part of the " New Play Control " series of enhanced GameCube titles .
In the U.S. , the strategy for these first - person shooters is different :
They 'll be packaged together with the 2007 Wii sequel on a single disc called Metroid Prime Trilogy .
Although we 'll have to wait longer than Japanese consumers for the game , which will be available on August 24 , the price tag of only $ 50 for all three critically - acclaimed sci- fi adventures is a much better deal .
I played the Japanese version of * Metroid Prime * when it shipped earlier this year , and played Metroid Prime 2 later at Nintendo 's offices .
The games have been fully upgraded with all of the bells and whistles that the Wii brings – full motion control and 16:9 widescreen display being the most obvious enhancements .
But there are also some smaller upgrades .
The " ball hop " – the ability to make Samus Aran 's Morph Ball form jump in the air with a quick flick of the Wiimote – has been retrofitted into both of the earlier games .
Nintendo said the games also have shorter loading times , and some mildly updated graphical effects like bloom lighting .
Badges – achievements for completing certain game objectives – have also been added in to the GameCube titles .
The badges for all three games are combined in one overarching bonus menu , instead of being split up per title .
This means that you can unlock the same set of bonus materials ( artwork galleries , etc. ) no matter which game you play .
The Metroid Prime 3 control scheme is fully replicated in each of the classic games – you can adjust the sensitivity of the cursor and turn on " Lock - On Free Aim " if you want more control over your aiming .
The only downside that I can see is that the multiplayer mode in Metroid Prime 2 has n't been taken online .
I played a few rounds with Nintendo employees at a recent visit to their office , and it 's still far from Halo - caliber multiplayer , although it does work a lot better with pointer - style controls versus the GameCube controller .
Nintendo of America has taken its lumps from hard - core gamers as of late , and rightly so , for refusing to release many games that the Japanese and European branches do .
It 's nice to see their growing autonomy used for good instead of evil , in crafting a much better deal for American gamers .

The ordinary - language meaning of technical terms often wanders far from home , following paths of connotative association and denotative opportunity .
We 've followed the semantic travels of " passive voice " through meanings like " vague about agency " , " stylistically listless " , and " failure to take sides " .
I recently read that writers should " Use an active voice ( putting things in present / future ) instead of a passive voice ( putting things in the past ) " .
The terminology of the " autism spectrum " seems to have started a similar journey through successive steps of family resemblance .
For example , Jason Calacanis ( " We Live in Public ( and the end of empathy ) " , 1/28/2009 ) , used the term " Internet Asperger 's Syndrome " to describe the reaction to a late - 90s " art project " in which his friend Josh Harris " put a couple dozen cameras all over his loft and recorded the inevitable breakdown of his life with the love of his life " , and set up internet chat rooms for public discussion of the results .
The commenters in the chat rooms were so " vicious " , according to Calacanis , that " it took Josh five years to recover " : something about the experiment " robbed the subjects — and their audience — of every last ounce of empathy " .
This leads Calacanis to propose what he calls " Harris ' Law " :
At some point , all humanity in an online community is lost , and the goal becomes to inflict as much psychological suffering as possible on another person .
And he says that he 's come to " recognize a new disorder , the underlying cause of Harris ' Law " , Internet Asperger 's Syndrome , which " affects people when their communication moves to digital " , causing them to " [ stop ] seeing the humanity in other people " , and to behave in other ways that ( in his view ) parallel the symptoms of Asperger 's Syndrome .
The term Internet Asperger 's Syndrome was recently picked up by Jonathan Kimak in a humorous piece for Cracked ( " 6 New Personality Disorders Caused by the Internet " , 6/30/2009 ) .
Kimak writes ( inaccurately ) that Asperger 's Syndrome is a
… rarely diagnosed but often claimed disorder is a mild form of Autism that comes with what seems to be a biological inability to show empathy for other human beings , as well as ( and maybe stemming from ) an inability to recognize nonverbal cues .
They continually do weird , upsetting things because they do n't know it 's upsetting you .
That part of their brain is broken .
People cringe when they hear this term because they know that a large number of the teenagers claiming Asperger 's are , in fact , merely dicks .
He agrees with Calacanis 's diagnosis :
Calacanis figured out that people who do all of their communicating online wind up mimicking Asperger 's behaviors because they are imposing the same disadvantages on themselves .
In both cases , when the ability to see nonverbal responses and facial expressions goes away , so does empathy .
Soon the thing you 're communicating with is n't a person , they 're just a bunch of words on a screen .
A bunch of words that the little bastard did n't even bother to spellcheck .
Thus Kimak ends up connecting Asperger 's Syndrome with various forms of internet - mediated mob cruelty — his characteristic examples are things like " A kid commits suicide on webcam while the trolls cheer him on … Normal kids , … but get them in a chat room and suddenly it reads like the transcript to a Charles Manson parole hearing "
Ironically , it takes a certain lack of empathy to see Charles Manson 's sociopathic crimes as having any similarity at all with the social awkwardness and focused , " systematizing " interests of Asperger 's people .
And spontaneous adolescent mob cruelty , internet - mediated or not , strikes me as having little to do with either one .
In this case , Calacanis and Kimak make the the connection between chat - room meanness and Asperger 's because of the idea that the lack of non-verbal cues leads to the depersonalization of victims .
But the kind of mobbing gossip that they describe — as familiar from school cafeterias as from web forums — is way outside the spectrum of Asperger 's behaviors , from everything I 've seen and read .
And charismatic sociopaths like Manson are especially skilled in exactly the sorts of communicative manipulation that Aspies have problems with .
The current DSM - IV - TR description of Asperger 's Disorder ( 299.80 ) is :
Qualitative impairment in social interaction , as manifested by at least two of the following :
marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye - to - eye gaze , facial expression , body postures , and gestures to regulate social interaction failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment , interests , or achievements with other people ( e.g. , by a lack of showing , bringing , or pointing out objects of interest to other people ) lack of social or emotional reciprocity
Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior , interests , and activities , as manifested by at least one of the following :
encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus apparently inflexible adherence to specific , nonfunctional routines or rituals stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms ( e.g. , hand or finger flapping or twisting , or complex whole - body movements ) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
The disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in social , occupational , or other important areas of functioning .
Apparently , Calacanis and Kimak have taken two points of association — the lack of non-verbal cues characteristic of text - mediated interactions , and the " lack of social or emotional reciprocity " that is a possible diagnostic indicator for Asperger 's Syndrome — and made a terminological jump to a completely different sort of phenomenon , namely socially - reinforced mob cruelty in chat rooms and similar web forums .
( With a nod to yet another phenomenon , namely Charles - Manson - like sociopathic charisma . )
This is quite like the chain of associations at work in various folk interpretations of " passive voice " .
A different chain of autism - associations emerges in Gary Stix , " The Science of Economic Bubbles and Busts " , Scientific American , 6/22/2009 .
But before getting to the autism part , let me take advantage of the digression - tolerant blog format to point out a lovely example of Explanatory Neurophilia from the same article :
Behavioral economists have identified a number of biases , some with direct relevance to bubble economics . .
In confirmation bias , people overweight information that confirms their viewpoint .
Witness the massive run-up in housing prices as people assumed that rising home prices would be a sure bet .
The herding behavior that resulted caused massive numbers of people to share this belief .
Availability bias , which can prompt decisions based on the most recent information , is one reason that some newspaper editors shunned using the word “ crash ” in the fall of 2008 in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid a flat panic .
Hindsight bias , the feeling that something was known all along , can be witnessed postcrash : investors , homeowners and economists acknowledged that the signs of a bubble were obvious , despite having actively contributed to the rise in home prices .
Neuroeconomics , a close relation of behavioral economics , trains a functional magnetic resonance imaging device or another form of brain imaging on the question of whether these idiosyncratic biases are figments of an academician ’s imagination or actually operate in the human mind .
Think about that for a minute .
Decades of careful experimentation have demonstrated the existence of these biases , and explored their nature in elaborate quantitative detail , resulting in thousands of publications and a Nobel Prize .
But all this might just be a figment of some academician 's imagination — until we see the fMRI pictures to be found in Bernd Weber et al. , " The medial prefrontal cortex exhibits money illusion " , PNAS 106( 13 ) : 5025 - 5028 , 2009 , which show that
… areas of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) , which have been previously associated with the processing of anticipatory and experienced rewards , and the valuation of goods , exhibited money illusion .
We also found that the amount of money illusion exhibited by the vmPFC was correlated with the amount of money illusion exhibited in the evaluation of economic transactions .
( The " money illusion " is the tendency of people to evaluate sums of money in terms of their nominal or face value instead of in terms of their purchasing power . )
I could digress further , to explain why the fMRI evidence is actually weaker , so far , than the evidence from experiments using behavioral dependent variables other than blood oxygenation level in various brain regions — and likely to remain that way for some time — but that 's a topic for another post .
For now , on to what Mr. Stix has to say about the relationship of autism to financial bubbles :
One group that does not value perceived losses differently than gains are individuals with autism , a disorder characterized by problems with social interaction .
When tested , autistics often demonstrate strict logic when balancing gains and losses , but this seeming rationality may itself denote abnormal behavior .
“ Adhering to logical , rational principles of ideal economic choice may be biologically unnatural , ” says Colin F. Camerer , a professor of behavioral economics at Caltech .
The suggestion here is that the rational - choice dynamics of neo-classical economics is somehow " autistic " .
This idea may be connected to the rebellion in 2000 of a group of French economics students , who wrote an open letter to their professors and administrators to complain about the domination of the neoclassical model in their curriculum , explaining that " Nous ne voulons plus faire semblant d’étudier cette science autiste qu’on essaie de nous imposer " ( " We no longer want to pretend to study this autistic science that is being forced on us " ) .
They named their website autisme - economie.org , and a page on their website explains their choice of terminology as follows :
Nous avons utilisé ce terme d’ « autisme » parce qu’il nous semblait bien résumer ce que nous ressentions , notamment la fermeture totale de la discipline au monde extérieur .
Or cette fermeture à l’extérieur est communément associée à l’autisme , même si , comme beaucoup d’autres personnes , nous connaissons très mal cette maladie .
Selon le Petit Robert , l’autisme désigne une « attitude de détachement de la réalité extérieure accompagnée d’une vie intérieure intense ».
Pour le Larousse , c’est une « perturbation affective caractérisée par un repliement du sujet sur lui-même avec perte plus ou moins importante des contacts avec le monde extérieur » .
Ce seul mot parvient donc , selon nous , à caractériser le comportement du courant dominant ( académiquement ) en économie .
Celui - ci se caractérise en effet par sa coupure au monde extérieur , d’ailleurs couplée à une « vie intérieure intense » , c’est - à- dire la production à jets continus de petits modèles tous plus débiles les uns que les autres .
We have used the term " autism " because it seem to us to summarize what we were objecting to , namely the complete closure of the discipline to the outside world .
Now , this closure to the outside is commonly associated with autism , although we , like many others , know very little about this illness .
According to the Petit Robert dictionary , autism refers to an " attitude of detachment from exterior reality accompanied by an intense inner life " .
For the Larousse , it 's an " affective disorder characterized by withdrawal of the subject into himself , along with a significant loss of contact with the outside world " .
This single word then , we feel , manages to describe the behavior of the dominant ( academic ) trend in economics .
This is characterized in fact by its cutting of connections to the outside world , at the same time coupled with an " intense inner life " , that is , the production of a continuous stream of little models , each more retarded than the last .
An American relative of this movement is called " Post - Autistic Economics " , with a website and a journal called the " real world economics review ( Formerly the post- autistics economics review ) " .
( See Edward Fullbrook " The Post - Autistic Economics Movement : A Brief History " . )
In the French rebellion and its American echo , the idea seems to be that neoclassical economics is " autistic " because it is isolated from society and " [ preoccupied ] with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus " .
This is arguably insulting both to neoclassical economics and to autism , but it 's plausible as a metaphorical application of the DSM - IV type of definition .
Colin Camerer 's ideas about the relations between autism and rational - choice theory , in contrast , seem to include the idea that they both apply logic inappropriately in attempting to predict human behavior .
( For a hilarious account of game theory mis-applied to normal human interactions — without any mention of the autism spectrum — see Dan Zettwoch 's Deadlock . )
This perspective is expressed at somewhat greater length in Camerer et al. , " Neuroeconomics : How Neuroscience Can Inform Economics " , Journal of Economic Literature XLII : 9 - 64 , 2005 .
Here 's how the authors discusses irrationality in the Ultimatum Game :
When players do follow the dictates of game theory , the result can be a low payoff and confusion .
Consider this quote from an upset subject , an Israeli college student , whose low offer in a $ 10.00 ultimatum game was rejected ( from Shmuel Zamir 2000 ) :
I did not earn any money because all the other players are stupid !
How can you reject a positive amount of money and prefer to get zero ?
They just did not understand the game !
You should have stopped the experiment and explained it to them . . .
Ironically , while the subject ’s reasoning matches exactly how conventional game theory approaches the game , it also sounds autistic , because this subject is surprised and perplexed by how normal people behave .
Camerer et al. discuss " Elizabeth Hill and David Sally ’s ( 2003 ) extensive comparison of normal and autistic children and adults playing ultimatum games " .
But the Hill and Sally experiments do n't support a view that the " rationality " of conventional game theory is " autistic " , either in the Ultimatum Game or elsewhere .
The citation by Camerer et al. is to a 2003 UCL working paper , Elisabeth Hill and David Sally , " Dilemmas and bargains : Autism , theory - of - mind , cooperation and fairness " .
The research was continued , and the final published version was David Sally and Elisabeth Hill , " The development of interpersonal strategy : Autism , theory - of - mind , cooperation and fairness " , Journal of Economic Psychology , 27( 1 ) 73-97 , 2006 ) :
Mentalising is assumed to be involved in decision - making that is necessary to social interaction .
We investigated the relationship between mentalising and three types of strategic games – Prisoners ’ Dilemma , Dictator and Ultimatum – in children with and without autistic spectrum disorders .
Overall , the results revealed less dramatic differences than expected among the normally developing age groups and the children with autism , suggesting that in these laboratory tasks , mentalising skills are not always necessary .
There were , nonetheless , some important findings .
Young children were more cautious about initiating cooperation than their older peers and , in bargaining situations , they were less generous in their opening unilateral grants and over - solicitous of an empowered receiver .
Participants with autism did have a harder time shifting strategy between versions of the Prisoners ’ Dilemma , and they were much more likely to accept low initial offers in the Ultimatum game and to refuse fair proposals .
In addition , participants ’ measured mentalising abilities explain intentional and strategic behaviour within the prisoners ’ dilemma and the avoidance of unsuccessful ultimatum proposals .
The differences between ASD children and neurotypical controls were significant , but not explainable in terms of a difference in rationality ( nor do Hill and Sally attempt any such explanation ) .
For example , the distribution of offers in the Ultimatum Game looked like this :
The ASD kids were more likely to offer 0 , 6 , and 7 units than their non-ASD peers — but none of those choices are dictated by rational - choice game theory .
And similarly for the acceptances :
In both cases , the explanation that Hill and Sally offers is not that the ASD children were more rational than the others , but rather than they were less likely to be able to model the mental state of others .
The main evidence is the distribution of Ultimatum Game behaviors as a function not of ASD diagnosis , but of score on a test of " mentalising " ability :
In this case , the conclusions of game - theoretic " rationality " do overlap in part with the results of failure to model the likely reactions of others — but this is not because the poor mentalizers are more rational .
In some respects , the poor mentalizers were even further from the " rational " standard than the good mentalizers were .
I 'd be willing to bet , in fact , that low scores on the " second - order false belief test " would usually correlate , especially developmentally , with low scores on test of abstract logical reasoning .
So along with the extended or figurative use of Asperger 's Syndrome to mean something like " rude and cruel " , we seem to be seeing an extended sense of autistic to mean " excessively rational " .
This is all part of the normal — and irrational — process of semantic drift .
Unfortunately , like the similar drift in meaning of spastic , it 's rude and cruel to the individuals in the set originally referenced .
[ Some earlier Language Log posts on ASD and its intersection with popular culture : here , here , here , here . ]
[ It 's also worth noting that the word autism as a technical term has also undergone a century of semantic drift , and that the current phrase " autism spectrum " itself may refer to a collection of things that will turn out to have nothing more in common than a slightly more systematic application , by psychologists and psychiatrists , of a somewhat better - informed family - resemblance process … ]

• Tevez says signing of Berbatov was beginning of the end • ' I gave my life for the Manchester United shirt '
Carlos
Tevez claims he knew his days at Manchester United were numbered when Dimitar Berbatov joined the club .
The Argentina striker will be playing for a new team next season after turning down a five - year contract to remain at Old Trafford .
And he felt Berbatov 's arrival from Tottenham last summer , which provided further competition for places up front , proved to him that his future did not lie at United .
" I am not sure where I am going to play , but I know for sure that it will not be at Manchester [ United ] , " Tevez told the Argentina TyC Sports television network .
" When I arrived I had to fight for a place like any other player .
My first season was good .
I was a starter or a substitute , but I respected that .
" But in my second year , after the match against Liverpool , the coach started to overlook me .
The fans supported me a lot so I thought that something was going on as my performances were also good .
I was a professional .
" I did not feel supported after they signed Berbatov , because I was the man for the job he was bought to do .
Last year I was the second top scorer after Cristiano [ Ronaldo ] .
We won two titles [ the Premier League and the Carling Cup ] and being shut out like this was something that I could not understand .
" They did not ask me to sign the contract .
Ferguson told me not to be worried about Berbatov 's arrival , but I did not like it when he started to put me on the bench often .
I gave my life for the Manchester United shirt . "
Raccoons Rescued From Inside Pepsi Machine Chris Howell , NewsOn6.com
TULSA , OK -- People who live at an apartment complex in Tulsa were shocked to see more than soda cans in a Pepsi machine .
They saw two raccoon faces peering out from behind the machine .
" They just kind of came peeking around there and before I knew it , they were all the way out here kind of looking at me , " said Linda McWater .
" I really thought it was best to get someone that knows what they 're doing .
We called several people and I finally got hold of the Skunk Whisperer . "
The Skunk Whisperer , Ned Bruha , has rescued all types of wild animals from inside attics and under houses .
So while the call was unusual to the apartment residents , it was just another day for him .
" They put money in and a little raccoon hand came out , " Ned said .
" All wildlife wants is food , water and shelter , that 's all wildlife wants .
That raccoon has substituted that water with Pepsi . "
After the Pepsi vendor opened the machine , Ned was able to use a little of his quiet coaxing and a gentle poke in the backside with a bent coat hanger to evict the troublesome twins from their poolside condominium .
" This is what we do every day , " said Ned , " and when we can save an animal 's life , that makes it so much better . "
The raccoon kits were relocated to much more appropriate accommodations at a local wildlife sanctuary .

In what is perhaps further efforts to placate the LGBT community over the recent DOMA brief controversy , the White House announced it is now considering adding same - sex marriages , unions and partnerships to the the 2010 Census data .
From the Wall Street Journal :
The administration has directed the Census Bureau to determine changes needed in tabulation software to allow for same - sex marriage data to be released early in 2011 with other detailed demographic information from the decennial count .
The bureau historically has n’t released same - sex marriage data . …
The Census Bureau has long collected data on same - sex marriages when people chose to report it .
White House officials said the previous administration interpreted the federal Defense of Marriage Act as prohibiting the release of the data .
The Obama administration has abandoned that interpretation .
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs addressed the WSJ report at the White House press briefing today and went on to answer a question on DADT .
Is it me is or is there a subtle shift in tone ( towards the positive ) on how Gibbs handles questions related to LGBT issues ?

Please remember to add feedback -> here <- as we can get useful feedback that will help us .
We suggest that everyone upgrade to this version .
Please note the following :
BASICS
The unlock works exclusively with baseband 02.28.00 .
This baseband is provided by the latest firmware update ( 2.2 ) from Apple .
You ’ll need to upgrade to this release using iTunes and then use Quick Pwn to activate etc .
There are plenty of tutorials about this on iclarified , bigboss , modmi and other established tutorial sites .
Because it works on 02.28.00 , it is available to everyone on the planet .
This means we do n’t need to unnecessarily expose holes in earlier basebands , which is an important concern .
The application is a small daemon that is launched on boot .
It injects the payload at boot and also whenever there is a baseband reset .
You wo n’t notice anything about it other than that your third - party sim now works .
It ’s a small program and unobtrusive .
There is no GUI ( this is by design ) .
You can add the application using the sources outlined below .
There are Cydia and Installer sources available , so use whichever you are comfortable using .
yellowsn0w is completely removable through Cydia , the command line , and iTunes .
DETAILS
There is a known issue with SIM cards that have STK ( SIM Toolkit ) application menus .
These menus are usually items such as “ top up ” “ get credit ” “ lotto numbers ” etc .
These menu items confuse the application sometimes .
Removing and reinserting the SIM once after reboot ( give it about 10 secs 60 seconds ( with v0.9.1 ) after you see the slide to unlock widget ) fixes this issue .
We ’re working on a better fix .
Update : version 0.9.4 fixes this for many ( but probably not all ) users who previously had to wait a minute and then replug the sim .
60 seconds ( with v0.9.1 ) after you see the slide to unlock widget ) fixes this issue .
We ’re working on a better fix .
version 0.9.4 fixes this for many ( but probably not all ) users who previously had to wait a minute and then replug the sim .
For those of you using SIM cards without STK menus , the application has some optional arguments that will make the unlock much faster for you .
So either experiment on your own ( use “ yellowsn0w -h ” for usage ) or wait for a customization writeup .
After you install yellowsn0w via Cydia , you should return to the Cydia main menu then reboot your iPhone with the 3rd party SIM installed .
Wait for the slide to unlock screen , then wait 10 or 15 secs more .
If you do n’t see your carrier name pop up , then remove your SIM , reinsert it , and wait 10 secs more .
This is the step we ’ll be working on eliminating next .
RANDOM
The application is version 0.9.5
This is considered beta software , you use it at your own risk .
You know the score .
The application is released on a non-commerical basis .
Please do not accept pirates and scummy ripoffs of this software .
We license this software for single use and in a non-commerical environment ( meaning you ca n’t charge for it ) .
The techniques and methods used are not to be used by third party companies .
We are watching you Jody … we wo n’t be so forgiving this time .
we wo n’t be so forgiving this time .
Direct linking to the repository URLs is prohibited , please only link to this post .
We will be checking referers .
Happy 2009 and enjoy !
The iPhone 3G is used all over the world with all sorts of SIM cards , and we almost certainly will see untested and unexpected situations .
If the soft unlock does n’t work for you on day 1 ( literally day 1 , of 2009 ! ) then please do n’t panic or be impatient .
This is new territory for everyone , so enjoy the ride as much as you can :)

Since Benjamin Netanyahu ’s recent trip to Washington to meet Obama , there ’s been plenty of discussion over the future of Palestine - Israel .
It appears to many that we ’re seeing a genuine opportunity for movement on the stalled peace process .
Obama is keen on two - states .
Netanyahu , under pressure , has mentioned the possibility of a ( highly conditional ) Palestinian " state " , but is nonetheless content with the Palestinians out of sight behind the Wall .
Israelis want Israel for Jewish people everywhere .
But what about the Palestinians ?
What ’s their perspective ?
Zionists , moderates , outsiders — even dissident Israelis — get more space to talk about the issue , including how it affects the aspirations of Palestinians , than Palestinians do themselves .
Their views are rarely expressed in the mainstream media .
As one of those Palestinians , let me give you my take .
There is a hollowness in the modern Palestinian psyche , a product of the failed Oslo agreement , the establishment of the Palestinian Authority , the weakening of the PLO , the emergence of Hamas , a long history of captive American administrations and decades of Israeli occupation , dispossession and economic distress .
Along with that , the Palestinian perspective is complicated by the lack of an always - cohesive position on contentious matters ( including the two - state issue ) , by their differing representation in the political landscape , and by the diverse conditions different sectors of the Palestinian people live under as a result of 61 years of conflict .
Of those different population sectors , the refugees ( who represent almost half the Palestinian people ) have endured the longest and gravest effects , have the least representation and would gain very little under many versions of the two - state proposal .
And significantly , in Netanyahu ’s version of the future , they are virtually non-existent .
One fundamental issue here is this : if the displacement of the Palestinians from their homes since 1948 is an accepted fact , why is their natural and legal right to return offensive and unrealistic ?
Any serious attempt to resolve the conflict involving a people cannot ignore the plight of half the people it has impacted .
Had Palestinians actually stayed in Palestine back then , would Israel have been established — despite the presence of what would have been an overwhelming Palestinian majority ?
In essence , Palestinians had to be forced out to make a " viable " Israel , and their consequential personal loss is yet to be acknowledged , returned to them or compensated for .
Where injustice is perpetuated , peace does not flourish , and that is a problem facing those who would seek " peace " without addressing the right of Palestinians to return to their homeland .
If a family were to be removed from its home in Melbourne , forced to live in Canada , America or England , and forbidden to return , how could we possibly justify that ?
Could it be justified by telling those families that there are other countries they can go and live in which are majority - Christian , English - speaking and considered Western ?
Would that make their dispossession acceptable ?
If the answer is No , how is that different from Palestinians refusing to consider Jordan , Lebanon , Egypt or any other country as an acceptable alternative to their own homes ?
And those homes are not simply " in Palestine " they are actual homes , in actual towns .
If the Melbourne family would reject returning to Perth as a compromise , a family from Haifa will predictably demand to return to their family home in Haifa instead of settling in Jenin .
For Palestinians still living in Palestine - Israel there is another problem .
Recently , Israel ’s Foreign Minister , Avigdor Lieberman , formalised his plan to test the allegiance of the one - fifth of Israeli citizens who are of the indigenous Palestinian minority .
The plan , proposed by his party Yisrael Beiteinu ( " Israel Is Our Home " ) , would require these Palestinians to swear loyalty to the Israeli state — the very state that came to replace their own , and displace their people .
Many will likely decline to take the racially prejudiced oath , lose several of their rights in their own birthplace and perhaps be thrown in jail and lose their citizenship for commemorating their dispossession .
Let ’s be clear here : the predicament for Palestinians under Lieberman ’s plan does n’t equate to an Afghan migrant facing tricky questions about cricketers for the Australian citizenship exam , it rather equates to telling Cathy Freeman that she will lose her citizenship unless she swears loyalty to Australia , agrees that the dispossession of her people was a good thing , and swears that Australia is an exclusively Christian country and that non-Christians should have fewer rights .
And if later she is deemed to have broken this oath — for example by attending a commemoration of the dispossession of Indigenous peoples — then she ’s suddenly stateless and has no rights at all .
Israel ’s peculiar selective democracy affords an Australian citizen more rights than an Israeli citizen , if the Australian is Jewish and the Israeli is of Palestinian origin .
This would stay under Netanyahu ’s vision for the Palestinians .
The exact shape of the next " peace plan " may be something between Obama ’s and Netanyahu ’s proposals .
Such a " solution " would look like this : Palestinians living in Israel will permanently be inferior citizens , Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza will be the citizens of a virtual Palestine , living on scattered pockets of land ( albeit with fewer checkpoints and a heavier addiction to international aid ) ; and Palestinians in Jerusalem will have to choose between the two .
The refugees in Jordan , Lebanon and Syria will remain in transit in perpetuity , and if they get lucky , they end up as lower - class citizens of another Arab state .
None are allowed to return to their homes .
Palestine , according to Netanyahu , will not host all the Palestinians , will not be contiguous , will have no apparent borders , will not have an army and will not control its airspace , water resources or economy .
While virtual and intangible , it is promised to be a viable " gas " state .
On the other hand Israel will be the " liquid " state that fills the gaps among the Palestinian fragments , and ultimately maintain its present form .
The perfect two - state solution !
There is no way that this " plan " will be workable .
That is why we say to Mr. Netanyahu that we will pay no attention to his empty and deliberately impossible proposition .
Lasting peace brings justice , not illusions that merely improve the living conditions a little for some , legitimise the harsh realities of others and yet expect to be welcomed as conclusive and just .
Netanyahu ’s current stance in demanding Palestinians recognise Israel as a Jewish state while giving up the right of return for Palestinians is absurd and extremist .
Based on a " divine promise " to the Jewish people , Netanyahu ’s plan simply gives millions of people living in America , Australia and elsewhere a collective right — if they happen to be Jewish — to territory that they ’ve never set foot in , and would extinguish the legal right of people who were displaced from that very place .
To Barack Obama however we say this : we are fascinated by your energy and truly encouraged by your decency and leadership .
We concur with your positive approach of openness and inclusion .
On the current recipe for peace however , we hold a different view .
We believe that when Palestinian refugees are granted the rightful , unambiguous and urgent return to their own homes , then we can have true peace .
Individuals ’ rights will have to be the guiding principles , not the bargaining chips , and the settlements must not be only frozen , but become homes for all — Israelis and Palestinians .
Yes , we will have to accept and accommodate the generations of Israelis who know no other home — we must not demand justice with injustice .
Perhaps then we will see before us a country like yours , Mr Obama , for both peoples as equals regardless of race or faith .
We Israelis and Palestinians have , like Americans , " shed blood and struggled for centuries " and maybe should adopt a motto similar to yours : E pluribus unum — " Out of many , one " .
To sum up , many of us Palestinians decline this form of two - states , staunchly challenge the Jewish state and finally say to Netanyahu , and to Lieberman , " Palestine Beiteinu " : Palestine is our home .
If you are thinking of ways to generate a steady stream of additional income , having part - time jobs seems to be the most suitable option .
There are many choices for part - time job and each one can significantly contribute to your pocket .
However , most part - time jobs require fixed number of hours per day and a specific schedule .
If you are not amenable to such arrangement , you may start exploring other options that would allow flexible hours and have an undemanding schedule yet equally as rewarding .
One part - time job you can consider is becoming a Property Manager .
What is a Property Manager ?
Also referred to as Estate Manager , a Property Manager is someone who is in charge of the operations of a real estate property for a specific fee or charge .
Such job title is relevant in cases wherein the property owner cannot personally attend to the needs of his property due to various reasons .
In such instances , the Property Manager is the one who manages the property ’s requirements and other details pertaining to it .
A property may be a residential building or a commercial establishment .
Job Description and Responsibilities of a Property Manager
The usual and common responsibilities of a Property Manager are ; dealing with tenants ( for commercial spaces ) , coordinating with the property owner ’s requirements and requests , collection of rents , and settlement of taxes , fees , and other expenses .
A Property Manager is likewise expected to update the property owner regarding important matters , issues and concerns by way of periodic and direct reporting .
Basically , the owner delegates tasks to the Property Manager depending on what the property requires on a specific case or scenario .
The responsibilities of a Property Manager vary in scope and type .
This depends on the type of property being managed .
For instance , properties such as vacation homes which are only periodically occupied by the owner may require a different management approach compared to other properties such as apartments and units which are being rented by another party or other commercial spaces on lease .
Some jurisdictions require Property Managers to have a professional license .
However , this is on a case - to - case basis and depends on the scope of responsibility and expanse of the property being managed .
An example is Certified Property Manager Certification or CPM which is the professional designation given by the Institute of Real Estate Management or IERM which offers a comprehensive course exclusively designed for property and asset managers who are connected with large portfolios of all types of properties .
If you have this certification , you ’ll be on your way to earning more .
If you are organized and trustworthy with excellent public relations and communication skills , you can consider entering this field .
As a Property Manager , it is important to maintain good and open communication with the property owner and other parties involved ( if there are any ) in order to meet and satisfy each other ’s demands and expectations .
It is natural for you and for all the parties involved to seek certain rights and benefits out of the entire set up .
Still , being a Property Manager can promise you a good profit .
Property Manager as a Part - Time Job
There are many job opportunities for Property Managers .
In fact , having this part - time job is a good way to earn passive income .
You will be given a set of responsibilities but basically , your time is flexible and you do n’t need to follow a regular schedule on a daily basis .
Miami is a good place to get started with such venture .
With its fast - growing and highly promising real estate market , property management service in Miami will surely be one of the most in - demand part - time jobs you can consider that pays really well .
The number of real estate property investors in Miami is expected to increase over the next years due to tax advantages .
And as of this time , it is still one of the top destinations for senior citizens all over the U.S. , retired individuals , and foreign elders because of its warm weather , beautiful beaches , laid - back environment and topnotch health benefits .
Thus , you can be sure to get more opportunities for this part - time job in the near future .
If you are interested to enter the field of Property Management , you can explore various options within Miami .
It is a part - time job that can potentially give you a recurring income for a long time which , in turn , can help you achieve your financial goals faster .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Jen-Hsun Huang , chief executive officer of graphics chip maker Nvidia , called Intel ’s chip pricing unfair but said his company will not seek antitrust action against the world ’s largest chip maker for now .
Nvidia makes graphics chips that pair with Intel ’s low - powered Atom in lower - priced netbook computers .
He said Intel sells an Atom chip by itself for $ 45 , but sells a three - chip set for $ 25 to lure business away .
“ That seems pretty unfair , ” he said .
“ We ought to be able to compete and serve that market . ”
Last week , the European Commission fined Intel $ 1.06 billion euros and ordered it to change its business practices for competing illegally against Advanced Micro Devices .
Intel brushed off Huang ’s suggestion .
“ We compete fairly .
We do not force bundles on any computer makers and customers can purchase Atom individually or as part of the bundle , ” said Bill Calder , a spokesman for Intel .
“ If you want to purchase the chip set , obviously there is better pricing . ”
For now , Huang plans no legal action .
“ I hope it does n’t come down to that , ” he said , adding : “ We have to do whatever we have to do when the time comes .
We really hope this company ( Intel ) will compete on a fair basis . ”

Biodegradable nanomaterials could prevent scarring after surgery according to Japanese researchers .
They say their polyester - based nanosheets seamlessly seal up surgical incisions in mice and could make having stitches a thing of the past .
’ I think maybe , in the future , there will be no suturing - only this taping of the nanosheets to seal the incision site .
Operation time will be very short and very easy and there will be no scar after the operation , ’ says lead researcher , Shinji Takeoka of Waseda University in Tokyo .
’ This [ lack of ] scarring is a very good advantage for plastic surgery , for example , and for many other operations where people are anxious about scars . ’
External scarring is generally seen as undesirable , but internal scarring can also lead to painful and sometimes dangerous adhesions , with areas of tissue that should remain separate become joined by scar tissue .
Another important advantage of the new material is that it appears to reduce the risk of these adhesions .
In Takeoka ’s experiments , several mice whose stomachs were stitched normally showed evidence of adhesion after a week .
When stomachs were sealed with nanosheets , however , there were no adhesions , and very little scarring .
The team ’s nanosheets are made from PLLA - poly ( L - lactic acid ) .
PLLA and other polyesters have been clinically applied in drug delivery and as degradable stitches , but not as ultra - thin sheets , which have very different adhesive and mechanical properties .
The researchers formed 23nm thick sheets by spin-coating PLLA on a silicon dioxide substrate and then transferred them to a supporting poly ( vinyl alcohol ) film .
After taping across incision sites , they dissolved the supporting films in saline , leaving just the nanosheets .
’ The PLLA film prepared by spin-coating was evidently compliant , elastic and adhesive , ’ says Weiliam Chen , a biomedical engineer and pharmacist at Stony Brook University in New York .
This could , however , have been due to a trace amount of solvent plasticising the material , according to Chen .
He also points out that an in depth collagen analysis - collagen bundles being the defining components of scar tissue - is required to confirm the quality of wound healing .
According to Takeoka , it will be at least three years before the nanosheets enter clinical trials , but he thinks they could be used for a wide range of applications , including tissue regeneration , immobilisation of drugs and release of materials for continued patient care post - surgery .
’ If you ask 100 medical doctors about applications of this material , each doctor will propose several different unique ideas , ’ he says .
But Chen worries that the results in mice will not be reproducible in humans .
’ In the mouse model , the tension created held the tissues together and maintained wound closure .
This manoeuvre is feasible in a very small organ , but reproducing it in larger animal models will be very challenging . ’

Officials in New York have found the decomposing body of a man inside a van parked for weeks beneath a busy highway overpass , gathering parking tickets .
The city 's medical examiner said George Morales , 59 , had died naturally of heart disease .
His body was found in the back seat only when the vehicle was being towed away after members of the public reported a foul odour in the area .
Police said officers would not normally search vehicles they ticketed .
The daughter of Mr Morales said she could n't understand how no one noticed her father inside the Chevy Ventura .
" They just gave him tickets , " Jennifer Morales told the New York Daily News .
She said she had reported her father 's disappearance , but the police said they had no record of it .
They did , however , say that they are looking into the case .
Science fiction movies do n't necessarily flourish in deep space .
The best ones blossom in the fertile gray matter between your ears , and that 's precisely where Moon takes root .
Trafficking in paranoia , isolation and corporate cover-ups , this delicately crafted first feature from director Duncan Jones shines a light toward the awkward shadow dance between science and humanity .
Jones wrote the story specifically for actor Sam Rockwell ( Choke , Confessions of a Dangerous Mind ) , who delivers a virtuoso performance as helium miner Sam Bell .
Playing a lonely man on the moon as he nears the end of his three - year mining contract , Rockwell digs deep and comes up with an intricately layered portrait of a drone at wits ' end .

As he preps for his return to Earth , Sam starts hallucinating about sinister scenarios that may or may not be unfolding at his lunar outpost .
Glitches in video messages he receives from his wife and from his corporate masters only fuel his paranoia .
Meanwhile , Sam 's robotic helper Gerty — voiced by Kevin Spacey , who does a fine , affect - free imitation of 2001 : A Space Odyssey 's HAL 9000 — begins to behave suspiciously .
This simmering psychological stew eventually comes to a roiling boil when Sam finally confronts his predicament .
Moon , which hits theaters in New York and Los Angeles this Friday and expands to other markets the week after , is not your typical Hollywood sci- fi offering .
While a blockbuster like J.J. Abrams ' whiz - bang Star Trek dazzles with candy - coated visual effects but dissolves like so much cotton candy soon after , Moon 's mental momentum builds slowly .
Its examination of contemporary issues will linger in moviegoers ' minds long after the film 's last flicker .
A sci-fi fan from way back , director Jones name - checked ' 70s and ' 80s classics like Alien , Outland and Silent Running after Moon made its West Coast premiere last month during the San Francisco International Film Festival .
" We thought it would be fun to play around with people 's expectations , " he said , " sort of set up what they thought was gonna happen because of the films that they 've seen ... and then take them in a different direction . "
That thoughtful approach pays off , making Moon a movie that stands up to repeated viewing .
Despite its relatively low budget ( Jones says Moon cost $ 5 million to produce ) , this indie gem delivers plenty of gorgeous special effects ( more than 450 FX shots during the 33 - day production , according to the director ) .
Cinematographer Gary Shaw 's exterior shots rely heavily on old - school models for aesthetic as well as financial reasons , Jones said .
When Sam patrols the heavily shadowed surface of the moon in a rover created by the same U.K. model makers that crafted Alien 's spaceship Nostromo , the Earth — giant , blue and beautiful — floats on the horizon almost like a colorized outtake from the Apollo 11 mission .
With no giant explosions , no monstrous aliens and no shortage of nods to cerebral sci- fi classics , Moon delivers a stirring , character - driven story about a profoundly isolated blue - collar guy in a bad situation .
Rockwell 's intensely introspective performance imbues this somber little movie with sci- fi beauty that 's more than skin deep .
Wired : Rockwell in stereo ; magnificent moonscapes .
Tired : Intro and outro feel rote ; ominous soundtrack gets repetitive .

IT'S ONE thing for the US Treasury Department to overpay banks for their toxic assets on the prayer that bank shareholders will do something besides pocket it - something that will help the economy .
It 's another thing to set up a complex leveraged auction scheme to surreptitiously make the transfer .
And it 's yet a third thing to set up a scheme that will lead the banks to overbid for their own toxics to garner even larger windfalls and end up with the toxics still in their hands .
Suppose the government tells the market that it will match dollar for dollar bids to buy a toxic asset called Troubled from Seamy Bank .
Absent the subsidy , Troubled would be worth $ 1 billion - only 20 percent of its $ 5 billion face value .
With the subsidy , bidders will offer $ 2 billion since their net cost is just $ 1 billion , which is Troubled 's true value .
Seamy Bank 's profit from the " sale " equals $ 1 billion ( the $ 2 billion it receives less the $ 1 billion it hands over in the form of surrendering title to Troubled . )
But suppose Seamy Bank is n't happy with getting just $ 1 billion for free and sets up a special investment vehicle called Rescue Inc.
Rescue bids $ 5 billion ( the assumed maximum bid ) .
It does so by putting up $ 2.5 billion of its own money and using $ 2.5 billion provided courtesy of Uncle Sam 's subsidy .
But where does Rescue get the $ 2.5 billion ?
From Seamy .
Seamy gives Rescue $ 2.5 billion , but takes in $ 5 billion , so its profits are $ 2.5 billion .
And we the taxpayers are bilked for $ 2.5 billion rather than simply $ 1 billion .
Since raising its bid does n't cost it anything , Seamy will bid as much as it can .
Troubled can be worth nothing , and Seamy will still bid the maximum $ 5 billion and pocket $ 2.5 billion .
The real icing on the cake is that Seamy still ends up owning Troubled , but via its subsidiary Rescue .
Once Troubled is back on Seamy 's books , Seamy can " sell " it again and pocket another $ 2.5 billion .
It 's possible that some fine print in the plan by Lawrence Summers , director of National Economic Council , and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner of the toxic - owning banks would preclude explicit hyper - self - dealing of the type just described .
But when there is free money on the ground , people on Wall Street figure out ways to pick it up .
What we need is trust and transparency .
Those banks that are insolvent based on market values of their assets should be taken over by the FDIC and reorganized .
Over time we need to adopt Limited Purpose Banking , which would make all banks , insurers and financial companies operate as pass - through mutual funds , which would never be allowed to gamble at the public 's expense .
Under Limited Purpose Banking , banks sell safe as well as risky collections of securities to the public .
Banks act as middlemen , connecting lenders with borrowers and investors with savers .
Banks never own financial assets , never borrow short to lend long , and are never in a position to fail .
A new government agency - the Federal Financial Authority - would rate , verify , supervise custody , disclose , and clear all securities purchased , held , and sold by LPB mutual funds .
The authority would eliminate insider rating , a key cause of our financial mess .
S&P , Moody's , etc. could still operate , but the public would have an independent assessment of financial products .
LPB banks would market cash mutual funds , which would only hold cash and be valued at $ 1 per share .
All other funds would break or exceed the buck .
Owners of cash mutual funds would be free to write checks against their holdings .
These cash mutual funds would represent the checking accounts under LPB and , since they'd hold a dollar of cash in reserve to back each dollar of deposits , there 'd be no need for FDIC insurance and no chance of bank runs .
LPB would include insurance mutual funds .
Contributors would get paid off in proportion to the losses they experience .
The Summers - Geithner plan needs to be scrapped .
Limited Purpose Banking is the right financial fix , and the sooner we implement it , the sooner we 'll really recover .

Donuts and tea are the main ingredients in a MacGyver - style do - it - yourself solar cell , explained step - by - step in this video .
" It turns out these delicious little things contain everything we need to make a simple solar cell , " said Blake Farrow , a Canadian scientist who filmed the video while visiting Prashant Kamat 's lab at the University of Notre Dame .
Powdered sugar contains titanium dioxide nanoparticles , a substance that is also used in paint .
When that powder is coated with an organic dye , like the colorful chemicals in pasionfruit tea , it can be used as the light - absorbing layer of a photovoltaic device .
" In dye - sensitized solar cells , colored materials like tea absorb some visible light and transfer the energy to good electron transporting materials , like white TiO 2 , that cannot absorb on their own , " said Farrow .
Once those electrons have been excited , they need somewhere to go .
So Farrow sandwiched the TiO 2
between a clear electrode , and a graphite electrode that he fashioned by rubbing a pencil onto some glass .
As a finishing touch , he added some electrolyte solution , improvised from everclear and iodine water purification tablets .
Dye - sensitized solar cells are cheaper and more durable than traditional photovoltaics , but they are less efficient .
And by extracting the titanium dioxide from donuts , Farrow gives them a whole new layer of inefficiency .

The first rate campaigning group Prostate Cancer - Charter for Action issued a worrying study to coincide with Men's Health Week .
The headline statistic showed that at least 96 of England ’s 529 parliamentary constituencies ( 1 in 6 ) have a death rate from prostate cancer more than 25 % above the England average ( 25 deaths per 100,000 population ) with men in Tottenham almost five times more likely to die of prostate cancer than men in South East Cambridgeshire .
Iranians went to the voting booth today , Friday , June 12th , for their 10th presidential election since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Their decision today is largely whether to keep hard - line president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in power for four more years , or to replace him with a reformist more open to loosening the country 's Islamic restrictions and improving ties with the United States .
Ahmadinejad 's leading opponent is Mir Hossein Mousavi , a former Prime Minister of Iran .
Mousavi 's campaign was propelled in recent weeks by young voters using high - tech campaign tactics ( over 66 % of Iranians are under the age of 30 ) .
Iran 's presidential elections are tightly controlled , and , once elected , the office holder has limited power , but it remains the highest position determined by popular vote .
Collected here are several photos from the past few weeks in Iran .

Thanks to a double whammy of disease and bleaching , branched corals have given way to stumpier rivals in most of the Caribbean ’s reefs ( Image : L Alvarez - Filip , N Dulvy , J Gill ( UEA ) , I M Côté and A Watkinson )
In just 40 years , the Caribbean ’s spectacular branched corals have been flattened .
Research reveals that the corals have been replaced by shorter rival species – and points to climate change as at least partly to blame .
Most of the reefs have lost all the intricate , tree - like corals that until the 1970s provided sanctuary for unique reef fish and other creatures , as well as protecting coastlines by sapping the energy of waves .
Coral diversity is important for both the many species that swell on reefs and for coastal protection , says Jennifer Gill of the University of East Anglia and a member of the research team .

She and her colleagues analysed data over the past 40 years from 500 surveys of 200 Caribbean reefs .
They say that the flattening process took place in two main phases .
Firstly , in the late 1970s , a condition called white - band disease swept through the reefs , killing 90 per cent of the most spectacular tree - like elkhorn and staghorn corals .
The second phase , in 1998 , saw many of the remaining tree - like corals being wiped out during a massive bleaching event , probably driven by global warming .
Different corals – fast - growing but short - lived “ weedy ” species – then took over the reefs , outcompeting most of the remaining tree - like corals .
The researchers found that flat reefs now cover 75 per cent of the Caribbean , compared to just 20 per cent in the 1970s .
“ It ’s difficult to see how to reverse any of this , ” says Gill .
The biggest problem , she says , is the sheer density of human habitation .
Across the Indian Pacific , by contrast , where human habitation is sparse , reefs remain in almost pristine condition .
Decline warning
“ The study confirms the dire ecological impacts of the widespread degradation of coral reefs globally , but particularly in the Caribbean , ” says Alex Rogers , a marine biologist at the Institute of Zoology in London .
“ The loss of structural complexity that reefs provide is a huge disaster for the species associated with reefs , ” says Rogers .
“ Coral reefs are probably the most species - rich marine ecosystems and host an estimated 1 to 2 million species , including a quarter of all fish . ”
He says the only answer may be immediate cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide from burning of fossil fuels , which would curb the amount of bleaching and limit acidification of oceans that results when they absorb carbon dioxide .
“ A lethal combination of increased occurrence and severity of bleaching , along with ocean acidification , will mean that already severely damaged reefs will undergo a catastrophic decline in the next 40 years , ” warns Rogers .
A recent assessment of reef biodiversity by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature found that a third of shallow - water corals that build reefs faced extinction – with those in the Caribbean at greatest risk .

Dee Ann Angell was used to the jokes and the sneering she had to put up with at school .
Blonde - haired and blue - eyed , she would be teased because she looked so different from her brown - eyed brunette siblings .
" Did your mother go with another man ? " her friends would say , and she would just laugh and brush it off .
Kay Rene Reed would sometimes hear a rumour in her family that a terrible mistake had been made at birth and she had been switched with another baby .
That explained why she looked so different from her siblings , so the rumour went .
But she too dismissed it and moved on .
Fifty - six years after the two women were born on the same day in 1953 they no longer dismiss anything .
Through DNA testing they now know they are not who they thought they were , that their lives have been led , cuckoo - like , in the wrong nest .
Each weighed about 6lbs ( 2.8 kg ) at birth on 3 May 1953 .
Each was hairless .
They were the only two babies delivered that day at the tiny Pioneer Memorial hospital in Heppner , Oregon .
A nurse took them both to be bathed , sharing the facilities for convenience 's sake , then returning them to their mothers .
They were taken to homes 20 miles apart and in the course of time married and had children and grandchildren of their own .
Their paths never crossed again until earlier this year .
The truth began to emerge last summer when a neighbour of Marjorie Angell , Dee Ann 's mother , divulged a secret she had been carrying inside her for years .
Aged 86 , the unidentified neighbour had waited until all four parents of the women had died , keen to avoid inflicting distress .
Now she came forward and confided in one of Kay Rene 's brothers that while still alive Marjorie had told her that the babies had been mistakenly switched at birth .
When the nurse brought back the babies from bathing them Marjorie had cried out , " This is not my baby ! "
But her protests went ignored , and she had spent the rest of her life privately convinced she was raising the wrong child .
When Kay Rene heard the news it rang a bell for her .
Her own mother , Donalda Reed , who had been heavily sedated giving birth and had never harboured doubts , had only once referred to the rumours that had occasionally swirled around the family .
She told Kay Rene they were not true .
" You are my daughter and you always will be , " she said .
But those doubts were now impossible to put down .
The two women contacted each other earlier this year and arranged to meet .
One of Dee Ann 's sisters , Juanita , joined them and for Kay Rene it was like lightning had struck .
They were identical .
" That 's me ! " she exclaimed , pointing at her natural sister .
Juanita replied : " There 's no point having a DNA test , just look at us ! "
They did go ahead with a test , and as they awaited the results they cracked jokes .
" Who 's my mama ? " shouted Dee Ann , " Who 's my daddy ? " echoed Kay Rene .
The test measured the genetic possibility of Kay Rene being related to her brother and sister : zero .
It also tested the genetic possibility of her being related to Dee Ann 's brother and sister : 99.99 % .
The few weeks since the discovery have been an emotional roller - coaster for both women .
In part it has been a bereavement , a coming to terms with the fact that they will never meet their natural parents , that the lives that had been intended for them have been irretrievably lost .
" It 's sad , " Dee Ann told ABC television today , close to tears .
" I think that I missed out on knowing my own parents , my own family . "
Kay Rene described feeling intense guilt , that she had stolen the other woman 's memories .
When she looked at her family now she felt " I have cheated them - it should n't have been me .
I 'm glad it was because I 've had a wonderful life . "
But another part of the experience has been hugely enriching .
On their 56th birthday earlier this month the two families came together for the first time .
It was as if each woman had been given a gift of a second family .
" We just had a ball together , " Kay Rene said .
There is also the gift of friendship that has been forged between the two .
They call each other " twisters " .
They have shared notes about each other 's lives that have revealed strange intimacies .
Dee
Ann grew up loving horses which was unlikely in her family that had no tradition of riding ; she learnt that Kay Rene had been brought up on a ranch by her father who saw himself as a cowboy .
Kay Rene cracked chewing gum in a distinctive way ; when she met her natural sisters for the first time they did likewise .
The ups and downs continue .
The hospital that made the switch has offered them counselling to ease the trauma , but they politely declined .
" We are old women now , " said Kay Rene .

A chat with Dileep Rao , Dileep Rao interview , Drag Me To Hell , Avatar
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
There ’s something extremely surreal about doing an interview with someone you ’ve known for almost a decade – albeit predominantly virtually – but who has only just now begun to receive acclaim for his career .
Very cool , but definitely still surreal .
I became acquainted with Dileep Rao when he , like my fellow Bullz - Eye editor David Medsker ( a.k.a. the man I still ca n’t thank enough for bringing me onto this site in the first place ) , was a member of the E- mail list dedicated to the Scottish popsters known as the Trashcan Sinatras .
Dileep and I have met a couple of times in person , and it probably goes without saying that we ’re Facebook friends as well , but we ’re not so close that I was n’t shocked when Dileep dropped me a line through Facebook and said , “ Hey , wanna interview someone from the cast of ‘ Drag Me To Hell ’ ?
Because I know someone … ”
And when I checked his IMDb page and found that he ’d also found himself amongst the cast of James Cameron ’s “ Avatar , ” I was , like , “ Dude , how awesome are you ? ”
A few weeks later , the man was strolling the red carpet at Cannes with Sam Raimi …and I was left laughing at the thought that , once upon a time , I ’d believed that Dileep could n’t possibly top the coolness of having been a winning contestant on “ Jeopardy ! ”
Bullz - Eye : So , how ’s it going , Mr. Big Shot ?
Dileep Rao : ( Laughs )
I do n’t know if I ’m a big shot , but it ’s going all right , man .
This is pretty incredible !
BE : I dare say it is .
DR : Yeah , and there ’s some crazy shit in the works , too .
Man…
BE : It ’s funny : before I even told my wife that you were in “ Drag Me to Hell , ” I actually told my friend Michelle Washington , who had drinks with us when you came into Norfolk .
And she said , “ That ’s nuts . ”
DR : ( Laughs )
That is nuts , though !
That ’s hilarious … but she ’s exactly right .
It ’s been a really crazy year and a half , I have to say .
BE : So how did this whole ball get rolling for you ?
Was “ Drag Me to Hell ” first , and then “ Avatar ” ?
" I think my beard ( in ' Drag Me To Hell ' ) is getting a better IMDb rating than I am . "
DR : No , it ’s the other way around !
I shot “ Avatar ” almost completely in New Zealand when I had an audition for “ Drag Me . ”
And I was going to do it on tape , and I shot it on tape with Giovanni Ribisi , one of my co-stars , reading with me .
And then we did n’t finish the shots we needed to finish with Jim ( Cameron ) , and then they said , “ Why do n’t you just go home , and we ’ll call you back in a week or two , and we ’ll shoot that ? ”
And we ’d been down in New Zealand absolutely forever , so I flew home … and I beat the tape back !
So I go on and audition live with John Papsidera , the actual casting director , and lo and behold , Sam decided I was the guy , and we had a little meeting , and we decided what we wanted to do .
And that ’s exactly what we ended up doing .
BE : So I presume that you can tell me all of the spoilers about “ Avatar , ” because I understand Cameron is really good about letting his actors do that .
DR : Oh , yeah .
That man would send solid gold robots to kill me .
( Laughs )
That ’s a Conan O’Brien reference , if you have n’t heard that before .
Uh , yeah , I do n’t think I can divulge much more than that , yes , that ’s the name of the movie , he directed it , and I ’m in it .
That ’s about all I can say .
BE : Okay , I ’ll ask a more generic one , then : how was it working with James Cameron ?
DR : Oh , fantastic .
He ’s a real visionary , a brilliant guy .
The kind of imaginative power that he and Sam Raimi has , it ’s not of the normal sort of “ hey , I think I ’ll make a movie ” variety .
These guys know exactly how to shoot the scenes they want , they know what it ’s going to look like way ahead of time .
They ’re looking way into the future and already thinking about the discussions they ’re going to have with the editor , which in Jim ’s case is mostly himself and in Sam ’s case is Bob Morosky .
These guys are tremendous leaders who synthesize these departments and lead really well .
It ’s the leadership on set that I think is really the hallmark of a great director , because the vision is so clear to them … ( Laughs ) … and I ’ve had the great fortune of working with two of them , so that ’s pretty lucky !
BE : To say the least !
DR : Yeah , Cameron is a really smart , smart man , but he also has a real understanding of the parts of filmmaking that are n’t particularly intellectually driven .
There ’s a lot of it that ’s also driven by trust and faith that something ’s going to happen , that something ’s going to be truthful and interesting , and I think he has a lot of faith in what actors do .
And the technical aspects of it are completely and totally under his command .
BE : Can you speak to who your predominant scenes are with ?
DR : I ca n’t say .
BE : Fair enough .
( Laughs )
I ’m picking my way around , because I certainly do n’t want you to give away anything .
DR : Hey , you can ask me anything , Will .
I ’m not going to be offended in any way .
I ’m just going to tell you that most of it is gonna be “ no comment , ” because there ’s an embargo like it ’s the nuclear draft for what we do at Def - Con 4 .
BE : It ’s funny , because it ’s now been over a year since I talked to Zachary Levi , and even then , he was all excited about how his buddy , Joel David Moore , was just finishing up his work in New Zealand on “ Avatar . ”
DR : Oh , yeah , Joel ’s fantastic .
He ’s a very gifted actor , very funny , and not only does he have pitch - perfect comic timing , but he ’s also got a real palpable sense of drama and truthfulness about him .
He was a real joy to work with and have on set .
I really bonded with him real early on , and I think our work – in the group , with all of us – was pretty strong , and he was a really big part of that .
BE : And I guess you must ’ve gotten along with Giovanni relatively well , if you did the audition with him .
DR : Oh , yeah , he ’s a great guy .
He ’s a sweetheart of a person and a talented fellow .
He ’s got a real understanding of his job , and his professionalism is really something to admire .
But he ’s just so talented and gifted .
There were so many great people on the film .
“ ' The Shining ' is the most psychologically scary film I ’ve ever seen .
It still freaks me out .
There ’s something about Kubrick ’s understanding of the visual cortex perception of images , and the way he strings it together in a narrative structure … the power of that in a horror genre is truly for the ages .
I still get freaked out when I think of that movie . ”
BE : I ’ve seen some of the concept art from “ Avatar , ” and , really , it ’s mindblowing .
DR : Yeah , there ’s some stuff I ’ve seen … like , I do n’t know what is and is n’t real , because some of it makes me wonder where they got it , and others are stuff I would n’t have seen while doing the movie , anyway .
This is a movie that ’s so large in scope .
There are so many departments you never even really interact with you directly , but they interact with you indirectly , so … I have no way to know what ’s what .
BE : Have you seen any of the footage in 3D yet ?
DR : Um … ( Slight laugh ) … I ca n’t comment on that .
BE : ( Laughs ) Ca n’t comment on that , either .
Fair enough , then : when they broached the fact that it was going to be in 3D , what was your reaction ?
Did you have a general opinion of 3D ?
DR : I just have such enormous faith in Jim Cameron , just as a youth , from having seen the movies he made as a young man , and now , as a true artist , how strong his sense of personal relationships and filmmaking technology is .
I just thought that if this guy wants to shoot this movie this way , it must be the best way to make the movie .
It ’s just a kind of …y ’ know , I do n’t think people question an artist when they choose their medium , and he ’s just a guy who really understands on a profound level how films are made and put together , and he decided to do something revolutionary because that ’s generally how he works .
BE : I know Soderbergh has referred to what he ’s seen of the film as “ the craziest shit ever . ”
DR : ( Laughs ) I do n’t doubt that .
I do n’t doubt that he said that .
BE : So how did you make the jump from “ Avatar ” to “ Drag Me To Hell ” ?
DR : Well , after I auditioned and Sam cast me , the timing was sort of such that we were going to start shooting pretty quickly , but we had some time , so I talked to Jim and Jon Landau , the producer of “ Avatar , ” and they said , “ Go ahead and shoot your movie , and if we need you , we need you .
Good luck . ”
So I went and changed my look a little bit , grew a bigger beard … ( Laughs ) … or , rather , grew a beard for “ Drag Me . ”
And I just really started doing research for the role and working hard with Sam .
A lot of the other artisans on the movie , we were putting ourselves in the place of the story , so the story became really real for us , and we worked really hard on it .
That took over pretty quickly , and I was off and running for several months on the picture .
BE : How was Sam to work with as a director ?
DR : Just a sweetheart , a bright light .
He knows what it ’s gonna be , what it ’s gonna look like , how to shoot it…y ’know , the other thing about this movie is that , for him , it ’s a return for him to a genre and a way of filmmaking that ’s the hallmark of his maturation as a young artist .
BE : Yeah , because he ’s certainly done a lot of production of horror stuff in recent years , but it ’s been ages since he ’s directed one .
DR : Right , like you said , as a producer , he ’s overseen many of these films , but he cut his teeth making these movies , so it ’s really kind of amazing to watch a man who ’s worked on such large - scale films as “ Spider - Man , ” “ Spider - Man 2 , ” and “ Spider - Man 3 , ” and all of the other great movies he ’s made .
I think “ A Simple Plan ” might be my favorite of his , although “ Spider - Man 2 ” is also a masterpiece .
But I think that watching him return to this work …he ’s meticulous like Jim is , he ’s a real collaborator , and he really works hard with the cast to get everything proper , everything makes sense , everything ’s motivated correctly , and detail - oriented .
The reason these guys are great filmmakers is that they have great talent , but it ’s not an accident : they also work really hard , they ’re incredibly focused , and they know what needs to have real attention paid to it when it goes in .
As Jim once said to me , and Sam said very similar things to me , “ Some things are n't baked in , and you can change those , no matter how much plasticity you ’ve imposed . ”
And the process for Sam is , I think , very enjoyable , working with the actors and the writer .
He himself was the writer , he and his brother , on this one .
And that collaborative process really means a lot to him , I think .
He ’s a very generous , warm man .
BE : So tell me a little bit about your character , Rham Jas .
On offering " Avatar " spoilers : " ( James Cameron ) would send solid gold robots to kill me .
I do n’t think I can divulge much more than that , yes , that ’s the name of the movie , he directed it , and I ’m in it .
That ’s about all I can say .
there ’s an embargo like it ’s the nuclear draft for what we do at Def - Con 4 . "
DR : Well , we started at the very beginning , asking , “ How does this character really exist in the modern world ?
Let ’s not just talk about the story . ”
So I said , “ I think he ’s probably from India , then he probably went to London and studied for a long time there .
He got a doctorate from studying weird occult beliefs , the beliefs of people that we do n’t always take seriously .
And he would be a professor , sort of an Indiana Jones type for this weird stuff .
Like , when people go , “ I saw a ghost , ” and people laugh at him , he actually goes and documents what the people say .
And he does n’t necessarily believe one way or the other , but he believes in some things that people do n’t believe in , and because of his research and study of this stuff , he seems to have some sort of connection to , like , spiritualism , palm reading , and energistic study .
He has some core belief that the world is larger than the world we know , and that character started for me there , and it made it much more believable that we were dealing with something that was , while fantastic , supernatural , and really goofy in some ways , it had to be less goofy and less impalpable in our process .
So by the research I did and the reading I did , and the work I did with Alison and Sam , particularly , we really came up with a full back story for him and for why he would know what he knows .
BE : I read a review … the “ Variety ” review , actually … which referred to him as “ an in - over - his - head street corner psychic . ”
= DR : ( Laughs ) Yeah , I kind of like that , in a way , because I think we always wanted this dime - story feel to him , like he ’s saying , “ Yeah , I do this , but … ”
The cool thing about him is that he quickly realizes , “ Uh , yeah , okay , I ca n’t deal with this . ”
And he calls in Adriana Barraza ’s character , Shaun San Dena , and they go together on trying to defeat the spirit .
I think the collaborative part of that is kind of cool , too , because it ’s saying , “ Hey , I know enough to know I ’m not able to do this , so let ’s call someone in who can . ”
And that is a very interesting aspect of the character that I built with Sam to be quite humble , and to not take pridefulness in his work , because he is a spiritualist .
He has a kind of immaterialism and a lack of pridefulness to be a humble person .
I think it fits well .
BE : So are you a horror guy yourself ?
DR : Y’know , I think for me…okay , let me answer it this way : I ’m a huge film person , so the horror movies that appeal to me are the ones that have transcended cultishness and are n’t the self - referential stuff .
Like , I ’ve seen many , many horror movies , because as a student of film and an appreciator of filmmaking , some of the most original and do - it - yourself start - up filmmaking is done in the genre .
And I think it ’s really , really cool .
But the ones that have appealed to me the most are the most filmically transcendent .
“ The Shining ” is the most psychologically scary film I ’ve ever seen .
It still freaks me out .
There ’s something about Kubrick ’s understanding of the visual cortex perception of images , and the way he strings it together in a narrative structure … the power of that in a horror genre is truly for the ages .
I still get freaked out when I think of that movie .
But I like all of the classics .
I like “ Creepshow , ” and I like “ Dawn of the Dead , ” and …I like the original “ Halloween , ” partially because I saw it at an age where you ’re just terrified .
You ca n’t see the effects , you ca n’t see the mask , you can just fear the absolute dread .
And I loved the first “ Friday the 13th . ” I liked the first couple , actually , but then after awhile they just became … like , “ Nightmare on Elm Street ” became a place where I stopped watching those kinds of movies .
But I also really liked “ Scream . ” I thought it was fun , even though it was a little tepid and light for a horror picture .
But it ’s still fun , and it had some really great acting , directing , and writing .
Those movies are great .
But …and this is my own personal taste , and I ’m not criticizing anyone else ’s … I never liked the torture - porn kind of horror films .
You take a beautiful girl , and you beat her to death with a hammer for an hour and a half .
I guess that ’s a certain kind of thing … like , you have a family , there ’s a guy with a gun , you do n’t know why he wants to hold you hostage , but he does for an hour and a half ?
That just has limited appeal for me , just because the narrative structure is n’t strong enough for me .
BE : Ironically , the “ After Dark Horrorfest ” films , which Sam helps produce , several of the entries have followed that line of horror .
My wife loves horror films , but when we hit films like that , she ’s , like , “ Uh , no .
That ’s okay .
Let ’s move on to the next one . ”
On his 2002 " Jeopardy ! " appearance : " I assume that , should I set foot on some talk show host ’s stage in the future , they will have contacted whatever clearance house that records everything in history , and they will deliver unto them the tape of me in my fine blue suit , sparring with Alex Trebek . ”
DR : Yeah , yeah , she ’s right .
I share your wife ’s taste .
For me , there ’s something prurient about that , and it ’s also …just as a medium of storytelling , it is n’t that strong visually .
It becomes very personal and it is n’t as fun to watch .
BE : You can respect the horrific aspects , but if you ca n’t actually sit through it …
DR : And you should n’t come out of a horror movie feeling bad about yourself .
You should come out feeling physiologically exhilarating by the hijinks and thrilled by it .
If the story is strong and it kind of catches you , you go for the ride and you come out feeling that sense of , “ They really goosed me , and I feel the adrenaline , and I ’m excited to go talk about this movie over a burger , ” then it ’s done its job .
Then you have a movie that ’s worked on a fundamental level .
And I think that ’s what horror movies owe their audiences as much as any other movie does .
BE : So how far in advance did you find out you were going to Cannes ?
DR : You mean “ Drag Me To Hell , ” or me myself ?
BE : You yourself .
DR : I found out probably the week or two before , and that was because it was sort of up in the air as far as the timing and who was going and what we ’d actually be doing over there .
Because it does n’t help the film if we ’re not given the time to help it .
I ’m just glad that Lorna Raver and I were able to go and really help out .
That was a thrill of a lifetime .
I ca n’t express that more succinctly than that .
Every minute was a thrill , and to be in a place that is a temple of film the way Cannes is … I mean , the audiences at Cannes are so knowledgeable , and the press is so diverse .
It ’s such a huge , international field .
The interests of people are profoundly stated , they ’re very clearly there , and they ’re very forthright in what they believe about filmmaking .
Everyone ’s attitude is pretty clear , and you get into some incredible discussions in the hotel bar , or even with the driver !
( Laughs )
It ’s been eye - opening .
There ’s no red carpet like that red carpet , there ’s no feeling like that ovation when the lights come up and they all stand .
That just does n’t happen very often in life .
It was pretty much a “ pinch me ” moment .
BE : And , plus , if you type in the words “ Dileep Rao Cannes ” into a search engine , you get something like 17,000 hits now .
DR : ( Laughs ) Yeah , whereas before , it probably just said , “ Not ! ”
DR : Uh , yeah , I think it probably did .
( Laughs ) I think my beard is getting a better IMDb rating than I am .
BE : It ’s actually a full thousand points higher than you are .
DR : See , I knew it .
Dammit !
I think it signed on to do “ Clash of the Titans ” and did n’t even tell me !
BE : You know , it ’s funny , but I talked to an actor named Antonio Elias a few days ago , and he’s in the new “ Star Trek ” movie , he ’s only in it during the opening sequence , and yet his IMDb rating was , at least as of when we talked , somewhere in the 1800s .
DR : That is …I mean , if we ’re talking about how bullshit the old Q ratings were , like , “ Alan Alda is # 19 for 1978 , ” I love that kind of shit , that some guy actually sat around and did that .
But this is even more volubly ridiculous , because there ’s an Indian actor named Shelley Malil who …I think he stabbed his girlfriend or some horrific thing ?
And he was the # 1 star on the Movie Meter !
And I ’m thinking , “ That ca n’t be what this thing is for ! ” I mean , yeah , people searched for him to see what he ’d been in and where they ’d seen him because he ’d killed or stabbed his girlfriend .
This is not some actual audience support .
There has to be some way to accurately judge that .
We ’re all thankful for the great database that IMDb is , and I ’m sure that , for less or more , the IMDb STARMeter does track people ’s interest in actors , but just like any statistical study , there can be great volubility just because of a little bit of change .
BE : So how did you make this tremendous jump to “ Avatar ” all of a sudden ?
Because it seemed like you went from doing a couple of bit parts on TV shows to – BAM !
– James Cameron and Sam Raimi !
DR : Well , yeah , and I think that ’s what ’s so interesting about this , because most people think of actors as wanting TV and film roles , and they just decide to do it , and suddenly they ’re doing it .
But acting , for me , has been a lifelong adult pursuit .
I ’ve done it since I was 18 years old , I ’ve done it seriously since I was , like , 24 .
BE : I was going to say , I know you ’ve been pursuing acting as long as I ’ve known you .
DR : Yeah , yeah , I ’ve been acting professionally for a long time , but I ’ve done mostly stage because my interest is in the stage , and the theater has always been very , very important to me .
It ’s the most immediate medium for the actor , you know , and you proceed and do it in front of a live audience , which is a great high wire act and a great safety - less way to do what one loves .
I ’ve always been a dedicated fan of the literary nature of the theater and of how strong the writing is in the theater , generally .
For me , at least for my tastes , I longed to do movies and always wanted to do films , but to be perfectly frank , it ’s not like it ’s easy to get jobs in the movies .
It ’s not easy to get jobs in the theater .
It ’s not easy to get jobs anywhere !
But the theater seemed to offer me more opportunities to do some cool stuff , to do some Shakespeare and some Tom Stoppard .
Some really great playwrights , stuff that I had a real pride in .
So that was a much more natural transition .
The jump to “ Avatar ” is …well , I think Jim was looking for a very specific type of actor and I happened to be that type .
It was n’t even ethnically specific to an Indian guy .
It was actually written ethnically open , I think .
I got this role based on my reading .
He just thought I was the guy…and it went from zero to one hundred miles per hour in a tenth of a second .
I ’m just glad that my training is strong enough , and that the people who taught me how to act taught me well enough that I can keep my freak - out energy low enough to do my job .
But , yeah , it ’s a really amazing bit of good fortune .
I have incredible gratitude and humility towards it , because it could have been anyone else in either one of those cases , but I ’m very fortunate that it ’s me and that I ’ve worked with Jim and Sam .
I ’m blessed .
BE : And with that said , how long do you think it ’ll be before the footage of you as a contestant on “ Jeopardy ! ” will come back to haunt you ?
DR : ( Bursts out laughing )
Well , if it comes back to haunt me , I guess it ’ll be okay if they use the episode where I won .
But if they find the one where I lost …?
I ’m not very proud of that .
But I assume that , should I set foot on some talk show host ’s stage in the future , they will have contacted whatever clearance house that records everything in history , and they will deliver unto them the tape of me in my fine blue suit , sparring with Alex Trebek .
BE : And I ’ll blame myself , because I ’m the one putting it out there on the internet .
DR : Yeah !
Damn you , Will ! ( Laughs ) Dammit !
BE : “ Dileep Rao was on ‘ Jeopardy ’ ?
I gots to see that ! ”
DR : You know where that ’s going to show up ?
In the trivia section of my IMDb listing .
( Laughs )
BE : I wonder if I can add that right now …
DR : You could !
June 2002 , buddy : that ’s when I was on .
And , hey , it was great !
I ’ll tell you something : as an actor , and as most actors know , the surviving until you start to really make enough money to put money aside and think about long - term solvency , that ’s the hardest part of choosing that career .
And “ Jeopardy ! ” was a cash infusion that allowed me to write for a long time – it was like a writing fellowship , so I could write screenplays and teach myself to write – and work out all of my little career things .
I was doing a play on stage when I did it , and it really helped me .
I did n’t drain it completely , but I invested it , and I survived off of it , and I worked a little less on my day job .
I firmly believe it accelerated my development as an actor and a writer .
BE : Thank you very much , Alex .
: ( Laughs ) Yeah , absolutely !

“ My Speech to the Graduates ”
By Woody Allen
First published in the New York Times in 1979
More than at any other time in history , mankind faces a crossroads .
One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness .
The other , to total extinction .
Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly .
I speak , by the way , not with any sense of futility , but with a panicky conviction of the absolute meaninglessness of existence which could easily be misinterpreted as pessimism .
It is not .
It is merely a healthy concern for the predicament of modern man .
( Modern man is here defined as any person born after Nietzsche ’s edict that “ God is dead , ” but before the hit recording “ I Wanna Hold Your Hand . ” )
This “ predicament ” can be stated one of two ways , though certain linguistic philosophers prefer to reduce it to a mathematical equation where it can be easily solved and even carried around in the wallet .
Put in its simplest form , the problem is :
How is it possible to find meaning in a finite world given my waist and shirt size ?
This is a very difficult question when we realize that science has failed us .
True , it has conquered many diseases , broken the genetic code , and even placed human beings on the Moon , and yet when a man of eighty is in a room with two eighteen - year - old cocktail waitresses nothing happens .
Because the real problems never change .
After all , can the human soul be glimpsed through a microscope ?
Maybe–but you ’d definitely need one of those very good ones with two eyepieces .
We know that the most advanced computer in the world does not have a brain as sophisticated as that of an ant .
True , we could say that of any of our relatives but we only have to put up with them at weddings or special occasions .
Science is something we depend on all the time .
If I develop a pain in the chest I must take an X -ray .
But what if the radiation from the X - ray causes me deeper problems ?
Before I know it , I ’m going in for surgery .
Naturally , while they ’re giving me oxygen an intern decides to light up a cigarette .
The next thing you know I ’m rocketing over the World Trade Center in bed clothes .
Is this science ?
True , science has taught us how to pasteurize cheese .
And true , this can be fun in mixed company –but what of the H - bomb ?
Have you ever seen what happens when one of those things falls off a desk accidentally ?
And where is science when one ponders the eternal riddles ?
How did the cosmos originate ?
How long has it been around ?
Did matter begin with an explosion or by the word of God ?
And if by the latter , could He not have begun it just two weeks earlier to take advantage of some of the warmer weather ?
Exactly what do we mean when we say , man is mortal ?
Obviously it ’s not a compliment .
Religion too has unfortunately let us down .
Miguel de Unamuno writes blithely of the “ eternal persistence of consciousness , ” but this is no easy feat .
Particularly when reading Thackeray .
I often think how comforting life must have been for early man because he believed in a powerful , benevolent Creator who looked after all things .
Imagine his disappointment when he saw his wife putting on weight .
Contemporary man , of course , has no such peace of mind .
He finds himself in the midst of a crisis of faith .
He is what we fashionably call “ alienated . ”
He has seen the ravages of war , he has known natural catastrophes , he has been to singles bars .
My good friend Jacques Monod spoke often of the randomness of the cosmos .
He believed everything in existence occurred by pure chance with the possible exception of his breakfast , which he felt certain was made by his housekeeper .
Naturally belief in a divine intelligence inspires tranquility .
But this does not free us from our human responsibilities .
Am I my brother ’s keeper ?
Yes .
Interestingly , in my case I share that honor with the Prospect Park Zoo .
Feeling godless then , what we have done is made technology God .
And yet can technology really be the answer when a brand new Buick , driven by my close associate , Nat Zipsky , winds up in the window of Chicken Delight causing hundreds of customers to scatter ?
My toaster has never once worked properly in four years .
I follow the instructions and push two slices of bread down in the slots and seconds later they rifle upward .
Once they broke the nose of a woman I loved very dearly .
Are we counting on nuts and bolts and electricity to solve our problems ?
Yes , the telephone is a good thing–and the refrigerator–and the air conditioner .
But not every air conditioner .
Not my sister Henny ’s , for instance .
Hers makes a loud noise and still does n’t cool .
When the man comes over to fix it , it gets worse .
Either that or he tells her she needs a new one .
When she complains , he says not to bother him .
This man is truly alienated .
Not only is he alienated but he ca n’t stop smiling .
The trouble is , our leaders have not adequately prepared us for a mechanized society .
Unfortunately our politicians are either incompetent or corrupt .
Sometimes both on the same day .
The Government is unresponsive to the needs of the little man .
Under five - seven , it is impossible to get your Congressman on the phone .
I am not denying that democracy is still the finest form of government .
In a democracy at least , civil liberties are upheld .
No citizen can be wantonly tortured , imprisoned , or made to sit through certain Broadway shows .
And yet this is a far cry from what goes on in the Soviet Union .
Under their form of totalitarianism , a person merely caught whistling is sentenced to thirty years in a labor camp .
If , after fifteen years , he still will not stop whistling , they shoot him .
Along with this brutal fascism we find its handmaiden , terrorism .
At no other time in history has man been so afraid to cut into his veal chop for fear that it will explode .
Violence breeds more violence and it is predicted that by 1990 kidnapping will be the dominant mode of social interaction .
Overpopulation will exacerbate problems to the breaking point .
Figures tell us there are already more people on earth than we need to move even the heaviest piano .
If we do not call a halt to breeding , by the year 2000 there will be no room to serve dinner unless one is willing to set the table on the heads of strangers .
Then they must not move for an hour while we eat .
Of course energy will be in short supply and each car owner will be allowed only enough gasoline to back up a few inches .
Instead of facing these challenges we turn instead to distractions like drugs and sex .
We live in far too permissive a society .
Never before has pornography been this rampant .
And those films are lit so badly !
We are a people who lack defined goals .
We have never learned to love .
We lack leaders and coherent programs .
We have no spiritual center .
We are adrift alone in the cosmos wreaking monstrous violence on one another out of frustration and pain .
Fortunately , we have not lost our sense of proportion .
Summing up , it is clear the future holds great opportunities .
It also holds pitfalls .
The trick will be to avoid the pitfalls , seize the opportunities , and get back home by six o’clock .

One spring afternoon on the patio of a comfort - food spot in Austin , Texas , a jovial , elfin- looking Internet entrepreneur named Thor Muller declared , “ I ’m a collapsitarian . ”
“ Sorry ? ” I asked .
We ’d just met .
I ’d heard perfectly well .
I just wanted to hear him say it again .
The patio was jammed with exuberantly Twittering adults , crisp businesspeople , and rumpled hacker types , in town for the South by Southwest ( SXSW ) Interactive conference .
Muller took his place at a round table , ordered iced tea , and waved over Lane Becker , his rakish partner in a San Francisco customer - service firm .
Adrenaline rising , I geared up .
The indulgence of an all - out cosmological discussion is somehow permissible only during an out - of - town conference , like a one - night stand or ranch dressing .
Becker , Muller explained , was also a collapsitarian .
Becker announced he was short on cash — he ’d maxed two credit cards the night before with a $ 14,000 bar tab .
Wow .
I did n’t bother to conceal my admiration .
“ James Howard Kunstler and Dmitry Orlov are also collapsitarians , ” Muller went on , citing gurus with a fondness for apocalyptic scenarios .
Collapsitarianism , I gathered , involves a desire for complete economic meltdown .
As Becker passed the hat for lunch money , Muller filled me in .
The term surfaced in a January New Yorker piece that quoted Kunstler , author of the peak - oil treatise The Long Emergency and a survivalist novel , World Made by Hand .
( Despite the gist of his work , Kunstler now claims he ’s “ never been any kind of ‘ collapsitarian , ’ period . ” )
The idea nevertheless took flight among bloggers , notably Kevin Kelly of Wired .
Hardcore collapsitarians , these writers purport , agitate for total economic downfall and universal joblessness ; they scoff at mere predictions of catastrophe and apotheosis , demanding their doom , ashes , and phoenix - rise right away .
They ’d like to see the dilapidated systems of America ’s beleaguered economy — finance , for one , but also retail — burn to the ground so that something new , brighter , and more durable might appear .
These old ways , they contend , will self - destruct because of intrinsic design flaws , particularly the creaky command - and - control structures of the pre-Internet era .
At lunch , Becker name - checked All That Is Solid Melts Into Air , Marshall Berman ’s modernist critique .
To its adherents , collapsitarianism suggests a giddy liberation from hope , from futile shoring up of ailing economies like Detroit ’s and the Sunbelt ’s , from bailouts and stimulus plans and climate change and toxic - asset recovery .
On board are said to be Luddites , anarchists , survivalists , green types who see collapse as our comeuppance , critics of American exceptionalism , and even financial - sector employees who just want it all over already .
As Muller ticked off the four sectors he expected­ — no , hoped — would disintegrate , I felt drunk .
Finance , insurance , manufacturing , retail : R.I.P. ( What ?
No journalism ?
I took a deep breath . )
Partly I was high on the mere mention of collapse , that unspeakable notion — and the tantalizing prospect that it might be advocated .
I imagined Victorians felt this way hearing about psychoanalysis :
Sex , the feared thing , could finally be not only spoken of , but actually embraced .
“ It ’s good news , ” Muller explained .
“ We ’re squeezing the industrial era out of our system .
Perceived value is collapsing , leaving only real value . ”
Like many , I do my fair share of fantasizing about sweeping away the phonies .
Yet the “ real value ” line also recalled the rhetoric of goldbugs at the close of the 19th century ; they wanted to purge the nation of postwar fiat cash and eliminate fluctuations in the currency , along with America ’s profligate ways .
They were rich , mostly , and imagined big money - supply contractions that would keep stacks of gold bars expensive and out of reach , so that only responsible , dignified people — high - hatted men like themselves — could get at them .
A moralizing and ungenerous note sounded in the SXSWers ’ end - of - world talk .
People with devalued dollars and flimsy condos , after all , hardly deserve to perish for their illusions .
But I bit back my reservations to bask in the thrill of a new idea .
Becker persuaded Muller to cover his lunch , and he tucked into a massive chicken - fried steak .
Collapsitarianism amused him , but he really wanted to talk about their company , Get Satisfaction — how impressively capitalized it was , how it let people swap info about companies and allowed companies to talk directly to their customers .
Muller persisted .
We have to let collapse come , he told me , and even nudge it along .
“ If you see Humpty Dumpty sitting on a wall , go ahead and give him a good shove , ” he elaborated later .
Once all the rotten and fragile stuff falls to pieces , hardier and healthier and more reasonable ways of organizing experience will emerge , he promised .
Collapse sounds scary , but Muller considers it a desirable stage en route to a “ more delightful , more sustainable world . ”
I wanted to know about this world that would appear when finance and other totems lay in ruins .
Was it millennialism 2.0 ?
Was it different than the off - grid hippies who frolic in Mendocino or the Randian Going Galt movement favored by Fox News pundits ?
( See “ And the Rand Played On . ” )
Muller obliged .
Community gardens , wiki projects , DIY and repair and lending culture — all antidotes to disposability — are hallmarks of what ’s to come , he told me .
Muller uses his iPhone apps for real - world tasks , making the device a level for hanging pictures or a candle for birthday celebrations .
This struck him as quite postapocalyptic .
He also counted customer communities and their stewards among those who would last .
Wait .
Customer communities ?
Where had I heard that before — just minutes before ?
I shot a look at Becker .
Get Satisfaction builds customer communities .
Had I been had ?
Sectors might crumble , Humpty Dumpties might shatter , but a Sand Hill Road favorite that lets customers chat about Whole Foods — that would endure .
Everything clicked .
It was all a sales pitch .
And do n’t millennialists always look to the end - times because they believe they ’re the chosen ones ?
This was Rapture talk .
Muller told me he ’d derived his account of the end of the old - economy sectors from Umair Haque , a “ prophet - economist , ” in Muller ’s words , who had outlined what he called “ the Great Compression ” at BRITE , a branding and technology conference held in New York City in March .
I later read some of Haque ’s work , lately done on behalf of a strategic advisory company called Havas Media Lab .
Its clients are entrepreneurs and investors , who no doubt pay good money for his perversely inspirational talk about how to find gold in the rubble .
But it was sheer conference palaver — ” outcomes , not income … connections , not transactions ” — hardly prophecy or even economics .
BRITE , TED , Davos , SXSW , Ignite : the immovable feasts of the great religio - business calendar , where dapper gents with bubbles and sparkles on their business cards exchange triumphalist ideas by day and then charge $ 14,000 in drinks by night .
What are these conferences , actually , but a relic of the boom days of branding and tipping points and other nifty PowerPointisms ?
Maybe they even caused the recession .
And now collapse is a meme , and DIY a meme — just as the free market was a meme — that raises the tide for some , even as it exists to drown others .
Nowhere in the course of this collapsitarian spiel did there seem to be more than a cursory acknowledgment of the misery of mass unemployment and the vertigo that would befall a nation deprived of the foundations of its economy and cultural identity .
I was further bugged by the realization that none of these collapsitarians is a disinterested academic .
They all come from the land of business 2.0 bigthink .
Even Dmitry Orlov , who lives on a boat with stockpiled propane and espouses bourgeois survivalism , works in advertising .
You may like the idea of pushing eggs off walls , using Freecycle , and getting the most out of your apps .
But do n’t be fooled :
This new collapsitarian scene comes courtesy of the same people who evangelized for the Brand of You and Irrational Rationalism and the bull market .
Their proof of concept is only ever that they themselves are rich .
And while that ’s hard to refute — and really , you look like a resentful nut if you do n’t acknowledge that people with capital are onto something — that something is probably not our next great history - altering idea .
Is n’t it more likely that they just know how to ask for money ?
Muller and Becker ask beautifully , and you ca n’t help but like them .
I paid for my share of the comfort food and got up from the table .
I would stay in touch , I believed .
Muller was going to speak at Ignite , and I planned on studying his speech , titled “ We ’re All Collapsitarians Now ! ”
I resolved never to tell the pair that I doubted their reasoning , their philosophy , their motives .
And why was I being so circumspect ?
Well , because as much as I bridled , they were just so damn convincing .
Maybe , after the collapse , they ’d consider hiring me .
Honestly , iTunes is not the best media player available .
Yes , anyone who bough a Pre and relyed on the music sync to continue working is foolish , but it was a nice feature .
However , now is the chance to see what else is offered .
I use iTunes up until now because my primary media device was a nano .
My nano has seen little action since the 5th of June .
With the Zune HD coming and the lack of any real advantage of having an iPod ( without iTunes ) I am free to shop elsewhere - maybe for a Zune HD or something with Bluetooth Audio .
Do n't get me wrong , I love my iPod , I love my Mac , and am not bashing Apple .
I am looking at how these gadgets integrate into my life .
The iPod has become something that has become more difficult to fit into my life ( no RAM mounts for 4th gen Nano , no use of scroll wheel in waterproof cases or with gloves , no bluetooth audio- even as crappy as BT audio is , no 12V charging ) and iTunes has not kept up with this consumer 's needs ( networking support is junk , no auto - library update , ala watch folders ) .
Without iTunes , it 's time to move on .
I understand Apple 's move , and would do the same in their shoes .

The humble contact lens has long been used to improve people ’s vision , but now researchers have restored sight in patients suffering corneal damage using a groundbreaking technique where contact lenses are cultured with stem cells .
The idea stemmed from the observation that stem cells from the cornea ( the thin , transparent barrier at the front of the eye ) stick to contact lenses .
Employing three patients who were blind in one eye , the researchers obtained stem cells from their healthy eyes and cultured them in extended wear contact lenses for ten days .
The surfaces of the patients ’ corneas were cleaned and the contact lenses inserted .
Within 10 to 14 days the stem cells began to recolonize and repair the cornea .
“ The procedure is totally simple and cheap , ” said lead author of the study , UNSW ’s Dr Nick Di Girolamo .
“ Unlike other techniques , it requires no foreign human or animal products , only the patient ’s own serum , and is completely non-invasive .
Of the three patients , two were legally blind but can now read the big letters on an eye chart , while the third , who could previously read the top few rows of the chart , is now able to pass the vision test for a driver ’s license .
The research team is n’t getting over excited , still remaining unsure as to whether the correction will remain stable , but the fact that the three test patients have been enjoying restored sight for the last 18 months is definitely encouraging .
The simplicity and low cost of the technique also means that it could be carried out in poorer countries .
The procedure also works in patients who have had both eyes damaged .
“ One of our patients had aniridia , a congenital condition affecting both eyes , " said Dr Di Girolamo .
" In that case , instead of taking the stem cells from the other cornea , we took them from another part of the eye altogether – the conjunctiva – which also harbors stem cells . "
Diseases affecting the cornea are one of the main causes of blindness around the world .
The World Health Organization estimates that corneal disease could be responsible for 1.5 million people losing sight in one of their eyes every year .
Although at the moment the treatment can only help people with damage to the edge of the cornea , the researchers say that in the future the technique could be used to help people blinded by other causes .
As well other parts of the eye such as the retina , major organs such as the skin could also be regrown using the technique .
The research team has applied for funds to continue the project .
Given their results to date , we ’d like to see them get it .

Decompilation
Decompilation is the reverse process of compilation i.e. creating high level language code from machine / assembly language code .
At the basic level , it just requires to understand the machine / assembly code and rewrite it into a high level language , but things are not as simple as they seem , particularly when it comes to implementing a decompiler .
Throughout this discussion , we will be using the C language for the high level language , and the 8086 assembly language for the low level language .
The ethics of decompilation
Is decompilation legal , and is it allowed ?
There are many situations when decompilation can be used ...
To recover lost source code .
You may have written a program for which you only have the executable now ( or you got the exe of a program you wrote long back , from someone else ! ) .
If you want to have the source for such a program , you can use decompilation to recover it .
In all rights , you are the owner of the program , so nobody is going to question you .
Just as stated above , applications written long back for a legacy computer may not have the source code now , and you may need to port it to a new platform .
Either you have to rewrite the application from the scratch , or use decompilation to understand the working of the application and write it again .
Say you have code written in some language for which you cant find a compiler today !
If you have the executable , just decompile it and rewrite the logic in the language of your choice today .
To discover the internals of someone else 's program ( like what algorithm they have used ... )
Usually all software are copyrighted by the authors .
This means , copying or expressing the same idea in another program is prohibited .
Hence if you are using decompilation to discover the internals of a program and if that particular part is breaching the copyright of the owner , you are liable for legal action .
However , there are some permitted uses of decompilation , like the first three cases stated above .
Also , decompilation of parts of software which do not come under the copyright laws ( e.g. algorithms ) is permitted .
In any case , it is better to contact your legal advisor if you are doing any serious work with decompilation .
In all practical purposes , decompiling programs which were created by you can't be questioned !
After all , you are the owner of all rights to the program .
But be careful if you are trying it out on someone else 's programs .
Is decompilation possible ?
Let 's take a look at a normal C compiler .
When a C program is compiled , the first stage of the compiler will generate a very rudimentary assembly language output ( or nearly equivalent to it ) , which is nothing but a line - by - line translation of the C source code .
If any optimizations are chosen to be done , the next stages perform the code optimization to replace redundant instructions and improve the overall efficiency of the output program .
This output is then linked with the standard libraries for any library function calls , and saved in the executable format of the platform .
void main ( ) { int i , j , k ; i = 10 ; j = 20 ; k = i*j + 5 ; } ;---- i = 10 ; mov [ bp+2 ] , 10 ;---- j = 20 ; mov [ bp+4 ] , 20 ;---- k = i*j + 5 ; mov ax , [ bp +2 ] mov bx , [ bp +4 ] mul bx add ax , 5 mov [ bp+6 ] , ax Sample C code Possible output of a compiler
( without optimizations )
If no optimizations are performed while the code is generated , it is very easy to understand what the output code does , and an equivalent C code can be written / generated automatically .
Note that we can only generate " an equivalent C code " , and not the " same C code " which was compiled to get this executable .
In other words , it is always impossible to get the exact source code , but we can generate an equivalent program which will function in the same way .
However , things are a bit different if any compiler optimizations are used while building the original executable .
It turns out to be more difficult to understand the flow of the program now , and the more rigorous the optimizations are , the worse are our chances to figure out what the code is doing exactly .
void main ( ) { int i , j , k ; i = 10 ; j = 20 ; k = i*j + 5 ; } ;---- i = 10 ; mov si , 10 ;---- j = 20 ; mov di , 20 ;---- k = i*j + 5 ; mov ax , si mov bx , di mul bx add ax , 5 mov [ bp+6 ] , ax ;---- k = i*j + 5 ; mov ax , 10 mov bx , 20 mul bx add ax , 5 mov [ bp+6 ] , ax Sample C code Possible output of a compiler
( using register variables )
Possible output of a compiler
( using code optimization )
One more factor which joins the opposition is that each compiler generates code in its own way .
There are very few points where all compilers generate similar code .
This means that we need to tailor the decompilation procedure for each compiler , so that if we know which compiler was used to generate this executable , we have a better chance of understanding the code .
For example , the simple " if " statement can be compiled in many ways , like the one given below .
if ( i> 20 ) { j=30 ; } else { j=40 ; } j++ ; cmp [ bp+2 ] , 20 jle lab1 mov [ bp+4 ] , 30 jmp lab2 lab1 : mov [ bp+4 ] , 40 lab2 : inc [ bp+4 ] cmp [ bp+2 ] , 20 jg lab1 jmp lab2 lab1 : mov [ bp+4 ] , 30 jmp lab3 lab2 : mov [ bp+4 ] , 40 lab3 : inc [ bp+4 ]
Sample " if " statement Possible output # 1 Possible output #
2
Some other factors which hinder the decompilation process are
1 . Self modifying code Code written for critical applications like games , where every machine cycle counts for the performance , sometimes self - modifying code is used .
For example , if the same condition is used at many places in a critical loop , it is evaluated once and the code after that is modified to branch to the same location without evaluating the condition again .
But with today 's processor speeds , this technique is fast becoming antique !
2 . User - defined datatypes
User defined data types , like " struct "s , " typedef "s , " union "s and bit - fields add more to the confusion of the decompiler .
Though it is easy to use structures while writing the code , it is almost impossible to figure out if a variable is a part of a structure or is it a basic type on its own , by looking at the compiled output .
3 . Use of processor - specific instructions / optimizations
Inspite of all these reasons , it is still possible to decompile a binary executable ( though not 100 % automated , and not 100 % accurate ! ) .
Carry on reading ...
How to decompile ?
A simple approach to decompile a binary executable , is to first parse it and separate it into functions ( C style ) .
Once we know where the entry point of the program ( " main " for a C program ) , we can start decompiling that function , and any other function it calls .
This way , we can focus on one function at a time carefully .
To use this approach , the first thing that should be known is the entry - point of the program .
For a normal C program , it is the " main " function , and for a Win32 program , it is the " WinMain " function .
But to find out where these functions begin , we must analyze the executable and figure out which compiler was used , because each compiler has its own entry / exit code added to the program which we need not decompile .
If the compiler used is known , we can trace out where the " main " function is starting , and from thereon , till we get a " return " instruction , we can separate out the function .
A simple method to decompile a code snippet
Let 's say we have separated out the instructions for a function .
To understand how this piece of code works , we need to emulate the processor , and interpret each and every machine instruction !
( though it seems a roundabout way , there is nothing called the best method to understand the working of the code , so this is not the only way .
If you think this can be done in some other way , please try it out and i'd be interested to hear about it . ) .
And as we are interpreting the code , we need to combine logical group of instructions into simple high level language statements .
And voila !
We 've decompiled the function !
The high level language statements can be grouped as assignment statements , condition evaluation and branches , and function calls .
While interpreting the machine code for a function , we have to look for instructions which fall in one of these categories , and accordingly generate the high level code .
Understanding assignment statements and expressions
Take a look at the following code snippet .
mov ax , [ bp+4 ] mov bx , 20 mul bx add ax , 4 mov [ bp+4 ] , ax Sample expression eval & assignment .
It is not difficult to understand what it does .
To put it in steps ,
AX is loaded with value from memory [ bp+4 ]
BX is loaded with value 20 AX and BX are multiplied , and the result is in DX : AX ( of which we will ignore DX for the time being ) A value of 4 is added with AX
The result in AX is stored in memory location [ bp+4 ]
And we can easily write a program which will interpret this code .
Let 's say we have two variables wAX , wBX .
The above 5 steps can be translated by our program as
wAX = [ bp+4 ] wBX = 20 wAX = wAX*wBX = [ bp+4] *20 wAX = wAX+4 = ( [ bp+4 ] * 20 ) + 4 [ bp+4 ] = wAX = ( [ bp+4 ] * 20 ) + 4
And if we substitute a variable name " i " for " [ bp+4 ] " , we have arrived at the high level language statement
i = ( i * 20 ) + 4 ;
That was pretty easy , was n't it ?
But then , when do we decide that we have got a full high - level language statement ?
Whenever there is a instruction which stores some value to external memory , it is a full high - level language statement by itself .
Just think about it .
All the following high - level language statements inevitably end with a memory store operation !
i = 0 ; x = i*30 + ( j >>1 ) +( i/2 ) k = ( i & 2 ) + z ;
Understanding condition evaluation and branches
A condition evaluation almost always uses a " compare " instruction .
So while interpreting the machine code , if we get a " cmp " instruction , we translate it into a " if " statement , and the branch instruction that follows this compare will lead us to the block of code which gets executed if the condition is true , and if it is false .
The following code snippet illustrates this .
mov ax , [ bp+4 ] cmp ax , 10 jnz lab1 mov bx , 15 mov [ bp+2 ] , bx jmp lab2 lab1 : mov bx , 20 mov [ bp+2 ] , bx lab2 : Sample condition eval & branch .
When we are interpreting this code and come across the " cmp " instruction , the value in our variable wAX is " [ bp+4 ] " ( which is a memory variable ) .
So we now form a condition between " [ bp+4 ] " and " 10 " .
But what are we comparing for ?
That can be found using the branch instruction which comes next .
Since we find a " jnz " instruction ( " jnz " means " jump if not zero " , or " jump if not equal " ) , we can conclude that this is a equality compare i.e. we are comparing for " [ bp+4 ] !=10 " .
The rest is pretty easy , and after replacing " [ bp+4 ] " with a name " i " , we can generate the C code for this as below .
if ( i != 10 ) goto lab1 ; j = 15 ; goto lab2 ; lab1 : j = 20 ; lab2 :
After a bit of rearrangement , and removing the " goto " statements , we can get the ' beautified ' C code as
if ( i!= 10 ) { j = 20 ; } else { j = 15 ; }
But beware !
Conditions need not always be evaluated using " compare " instructions .
Even arithmetic instructions can set / reset the conditions flag bits in the processor 's FLAGS register , and it is these condition flag bits which are actually used to determine if a branch should be taken or not !
A classic example is the C statement " i-- " , as shown below .
if ( i --) j = 20 ; j++ ; sub [ bp+4 ] , 1 jz lab1 mov [ bp+2 ] , 20 lab1 : add [ bp+2 ] , 1 Sample " if " statement Branch without " compare "
So if we come across such code , we must look at the previous arithmetic instruction , and find out which variable / expression is actually used as the condition .
Interpreting function calls and return values
Function calls are a bit different .
The usual " C " convention of function calling , is to push the parameters ( last parameter first ! ) onto the stack , and then call the function .
The function will read the values from the stack , and the return value is usually placed in some register ( usually the " AX " register ) .
So the trick we can use here is , whenever we find a " push " instruction ( which pushes a value on the top of the stack ) we make a note of it .
And eventually when we reach a " call " instruction ( which is actually a subroutine branch instruction ) , we look at our variables to see what all values / variables have been pushed to the stack , and put them in reverse order to create the high - level C language statement for the function call !
The example for this method is given below .
Please note that the code on the right is obtained after replacing " [ bp+4 ] " with " i " and " [ bp+2 ] " with " j " .
mov ax , [ bp+4 ] ; push ax mov ax , [ bp +2 ] ; push ax call _func mov [ bp+4 ] , ax i = func ( j , i ) ; Sample function call Equivalent C source code .

We 're no strangers to crazy DARPA projects around here , but this one especially strikes our fantastic fancy .
The agency 's researchers are currently undertaking a project -- called Silent Talk -- to " allow user - to - user communication on the battlefield without the use of vocalized speech through analysis of neural signals . "
That 's right : they 're talking about telepathy .
Using an EEG to read brain waves , DARPA is going to attempt to analyze " pre-speech " thoughts , then transmit them to another person .
They first plan to map people 's EEG patterns to his / her individual words , then see if those patterns are common to all people .
If they are , then the team will move on to developing a way to transmitting those patterns to another person .

An asteroid striking our planet -- it 's the stuff of science fiction .
Many movies and books have portrayed this possibility ( " Deep Impact , " " Armageddon , " " Lucifer 's Hammer , " and so on ) .
An asteroid impact is also the stuff of science fact .
There are obvious craters on Earth ( and the moon ) that show us a long history of large objects hitting the planet .
The most famous asteroid ever is the one that hit Earth 65 million years ago .
It 's thought that this asteroid threw so much moisture and dust in to the atmosphere that it cut off sunlight , lowering temperatures worldwide and causing the extinction of the dinosaurs .

So , what if an asteroid were to hit Earth today ?
Chances of an asteroid hitting are pretty small .
NASA has tracked 90 percent of the near - Earth asteroids that are at least a half - mile wide and believes none of them has a significant chance of hitting Earth .
Still there could be some big unknown asteroids out there .
If a mile - wide asteroid hit Earth , it would strike the planet 's surface at about 30,000 mph .
An asteroid that big traveling at that speed has the energy roughly equal to a 1 million megaton bomb .
It 's very likely that an asteroid like this would wipe out most of life on the planet .

It 's difficult to imagine 1 million megatons , so let 's try some smaller sizes .
Let 's say that an asteroid the size of a house crashed on Earth at 30,000 mph .
It would have an amount of energy roughly equal to the bomb that fell on Hiroshima -- perhaps 20 kilotons .
An asteroid like this would flatten reinforced concrete buildings up to half a mile from ground zero , and flatten wooden structures perhaps a mile and a half from ground zero .
It would , in other words , do extensive damage to any city .
If the asteroid is as big as a 20 - story building ( 200 feet on a side ) , it has an amount of energy equal to the largest nuclear bombs made today -- on the order of 25 to 50 megatons .
An asteroid like this would flatten reinforced concrete buildings 5 miles from ground zero .
It would completely destroy most major cities in the United States .
By the time you get up to a mile - wide asteroid , you are working in the 1 million megaton range .
This asteroid has the energy that 's 10 million times greater than the bomb that fell on Hiroshima .
It 's able to flatten everything for 100 to 200 miles out from ground zero .
In other words , if a mile - wide asteroid were to directly hit New York City , the force of the impact probably would completely flatten every single thing from Washington D.C. to Boston , and would cause extensive damage perhaps 1,000 miles out -- that 's as far away as Chicago .
The amount of dust and debris thrown up into the atmosphere would block out the sun and cause most living things on the planet to perish .
If an asteroid that big were to land in the ocean , it would cause massive tidal waves hundreds of feet high that would completely scrub the coastlines in the vicinity .
In other words , if an asteroid strikes Earth , it will be a really , really bad day no matter how big it is .
If the asteroid is a mile in diameter , it 's likely to wipe out life on the planet .
Let 's hope that does n't happen anytime soon !

The western United States used to be known as the frontier , and now that region will provide access to the final frontier .
On June 19 , ground will be broken in New Mexico for Spaceport America , the world ’s first commercial spaceport built for launching private citizens into space .
Groundbreaking ceremonies will include a flyover by Virgin Galactic ’s WhiteKnightTwo , the mothership that will send tourists on their way to space in SpaceShip2 .
Virgin Galactic will be the first – if not most important — tenant of Spaceport America , and already more than 250 people have put money down to take trips to the edge of space as early as next year .
Spaceport America ’s runway is scheduled to be completed next summer .
The terminal and hangar should be ready for tenants in December 2010 , when Virgin Galactic hopes to begin taking tourists to space .
Competitors such as XCOR Aerospace and Armadillo Aerospace are developing spacecraft for $ 95,000 flights .
And as flights become more routine , costs should drop .
Five miles from the terminal is a launching pad for 20 - foot rockets used mostly for science experiments , which has been operational for the past two years .

The Truth About Plastic Bags and Their Impact on Environment
Added by viorel on Jun 22 , 2009 | Visited by 4676 | Voted by 53 persons
Reduction of carbon emissions and tackling global warming is currently one of the most important issues the humanity has to face .
Some countries started taking drastic steps to lower their level of greenhouse gas emissions .
Up till now the most polluting country is the United States , despite the numerous actions and billions of dollars the country invests to decrease its level of emissions .
At the same time the fastest developing country in the world , People \'s Republic of China , is blamed for continuously increasing the level of atmospheric pollution .
With a great pace in the development of different industries , the country \'s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions significantly increased over the past few years .
China\ 's government decided to take important steps to tackle the problem and one of the important steps was the strict limitation of ultra - thin plastic bags .
Over the last year China managed to considerably reduce the pollution level , saving 40 million plastic bags .
Usually plastic bags can be found on country \'s beaches , waterways and at unofficial dumping sites located throughout the country .
The term that was applied to the litter consisting from plastic remains is \ " white pollution\ " .
In January 2008 , the country \'s parliament , the State Council , has forbidden supermarkets , shops and sales outlets to provide free plastic bags with a thickness less than 0.025 millimeters .
In addition , shop keepers and vendors were also warned by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce .
In case they are caught with distributing free plastic bags , they will face a fine of 10,000 yuan , which is around $ 1,465 .
The latest review issued earlier this month by the National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) , showed that supermarkets reduced the level of free plastic bags by 66 percent shortly after the policy was announced last June .
After the prohibition was applied , the country managed to save 1.6 million tons of petroleum , according to the estimations carried out by the NDRC .
Note that before the government imposed the ban , each day about 3 billion plastic bags were used throughout the country , which in its turn generated over 3 billion tons of garbage per year .
Annually the country consumes 5 million tons of crude oil in order to produce plastic packaging .
The results of the ban were also analyzed by the China Chain Store and Franchise Association .
Earlier this month , the organization stated that both foreign and local - owned supermarkets lowered the usage of plastic bags by 80 and 60 percent respectively .
\ " Supermarket consumers are used to bringing along shopping bags and reusing plastic bags .
The awareness of environment is enhanced , \ " said the association in a statement .
It also mentioned that the reduced level of plastic bags did not have any serious impact on the sales in supermarkets .
However , not everybody agrees with the ban .
The environmental group called Global Village , with headquarters in Beijing , found that over 80 percent of retail outlets located in China\ 's rural areas , carried on providing free plastic bags , despite the government ban .
The group\ 's survey also discovered that about 96 percent of all open food markets across the capital of China continued giving away plastic bags free of charge .
Besides , the government \'s policy does not take into consideration plastic packaging that is usually used for raw meat and noodles for hygiene and protection reasons .
After China\ 's commerce administration implemented the ban , 600,000 regulators inspected nearly 250,000 retails stores throughout the country .
They managed to gather 2 million yuan of fines ( $ 293,000 ) .
The ban of plastic bags in China is not a single case of government prohibiting or limiting their use .
In recent year , a number of countries have already implemented plastic bag limits .
For example , back in 2000 in Mumbai , India , officials prohibited stores and markets to provide free plastic bags in order to cut down the continuously increasing amounts of garbage the had been coming from storm drains during the season of heavy rains .
Since then the same strategy was chosen by such countries as Australia , Ireland , Italy , South Africa and several cities in the United States .
Probably the most severe punishment for providing plastic bags free of charge is in Tanzania , where the violator is sentenced for six months in jail and has to pay a fine of 1.5 million shilling , ( $ 1,170 ) .
The Danger of Plastic Debris
Usually it takes a hundred years for plastic remains to decompose and decompose into smaller pieces .
Surely , the time of decomposition varies depending on the type of plastic used in a bag .
Currently the Pacific Ocean features such a large amount of plastic debris that their overall size could reach the size of France and their weight equals about 3 million tons .
The United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) says that plastic remains are quite often digested by wild animals .
Each year one million seabirds face death .
According to the agency \'s report , presented earlier this month , plastic garbage , including plastic bags and polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) plastic bottles represent about 80 percent of all garbage found in the waters of our planet .
Achim Steiner , who currently holds the position of UNEP Executive Director , has suggested that all countries prohibit the use of thin plastic bags .
\ " Some of the litter , like thin - film single - use plastic bags which choke marine life , should be banned or phased - out rapidly everywhere .
There is simply zero justification for manufacturing them anymore , anywhere , \ " he mentioned in a statement .
In addition to littering the water , plastic debris can cause serious damage to boats , fishing gear , as well as agricultural facilities .
It is important to steadily remove plastic bags at the source , which would be much cheaper that later using machines to remove the garbage caused by plastic debris .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Doctors need to stop taking handouts from drug and medical device companies if they want to clean up the perception that industry has too much influence over the practice of medicine , the Institute of Medicine said Tuesday .
A doctor stands with stethoscope in this undated handout photo .
REUTERS / Newscom / Handout
The institute , one of the National Academies of Sciences that advises U.S. policymakers , said doctors need to voluntarily swear off lunches , drug samples and strictly disclose research funding to strengthen protections against financial conflicts of interest .
“ It is time to end a number of long - accepted practices that create unacceptable conflicts of interest , threaten the integrity of the medical profession , and erode public trust while providing no meaningful benefits to patients or society , ” said Dr. Bernard Lo , chair of the committee that wrote the report and professor of medicine at the University of California , San Francisco .
“ We also need more specific disclosure of the financial relationships that doctors and researchers have with medical industries , ” Lo said in a statement .
Concern over research integrity in the United States has become more pronounced following accusations last year by Iowa Republican Sen.
Charles Grassley that prominent Harvard University psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Biederman and others failed to fully disclose payments from drug companies .
The report called for virtually anyone involved in the practice of medicine -- academic medical centers , journals , professional societies , researchers and doctors -- to set up or strengthen conflict of interest guidelines .
Doctors who have any financial ties with industry should disclose them not only to their employers , but also to relevant medical organizations .
The report also called for more uniformity in conflict of interest policies , and said current policies vary widely and many offer insufficient protections .
The report also calls on professional societies , government agencies and groups that accredit medical schools to push for implementation of conflict - of - interest policies , and expose institutions that have not adopted the recommended policies .
While the report calls for new legislation to beef up disclosure of financial conflicts , it also stresses the need for voluntary efforts by medical groups , industry and individual doctors .
“ If medical institutions do not act voluntarily to strengthen their conflict of interest policies and procedures , the pressure for external regulation is likely to increase , ” the committee wrote .

Alcoholics Anonymous is the most widely used treatment for alcoholism .
It is mandated by the courts , accepted by mainstream medicine , and required by insurance companies .
AA is generally assumed to be the most effective treatment for alcoholism , or at least “ an ” effective treatment .
That assumption is wrong .
We hear about a few success stories , but not about the many failures .
AA ’s own statistics show that after 6 months , 93 % of new attendees have left the program .
The research on AA is handily summarized in a Wikipedia article .
A recent Cochrane systematic review found no evidence that AA or other 12 step programs are effective .
In The Skeptic ’s Dictionary , Bob Carroll comments :
Neither A.A. nor many other SATs [ Substance Abuse Treatments ] are based on science , nor do they seem interested in doing any scientific studies which might test whether the treatment they give is effective .
In the current issue of Free Inquiry , Steven Mohr has written a thorough and incisive article “ Exposing the Myth of Alcoholics Anonymous . ”
Mohr characterizes AA as a religious cult .
The founder , Bill Wilson , had a religious experience while under the influence of strong psychotropic drugs .
He had a vision of a bright light and the revelation that he could be saved only by giving his life completely and fully to God – and that an important part of his recovery would be to bring the news of his epiphany and recovery to other suffering alcoholics .
The 12 steps of AA refer repeatedly to God .
They require admitting you are powerless , accepting that only a Higher Power can help you , turning your will and your life over to God , taking a moral inventory , admitting your wrongs , being ready to let God remove your shortcomings , making amends to those you have harmed , improving your conscious contact with God through prayer and meditation , and spreading the word ( proselytizing ) .
Criticism of the religious orientation led AA to switch emphasis from “ God ” to any “ higher power . ”
One member allegedly designated a doorknob as his higher power and believed that praying to the doorknob helped him maintain sobriety .
There are other options for treatment .
Inpatient programs , various medications , Secular Organizations for Sobriety .
Curiously , the best treatment may be no treatment at all .
The 1992 , the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ’s National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey studied 42,000 Americans .
4500 had been dependent on alcohol at some time in their lives .
Of these , only 27 % had had treatment of any kind , and one - third of those who had been treated were still abusing alcohol .
Of those who had never had any treatment , only one - quarter were still abusing alcohol .
George Bush is a well - known example of someone who stopped drinking on his own without attending AA and without admitting that he was an alcoholic .
According to Stanton Peele in Psychology Today ,
the most successful treatments are nonconfrontational approaches that allow self - propelled change .
Psychologists at the University of New Mexico led by William Miller tabulated every controlled study of alcoholism treatment they could find .
They concluded that the leading therapy was barely a therapy at all but a quick encounter between patient and health - care worker in an ordinary medical setting .
The intervention is sometimes as brief as a doctor looking at the results of liver - function tests and telling a patient to cut down on his drinking .
Many patients then decide to cut back — and do !
A Cochrane systematic review confirmed the effectiveness of brief interventions .
Instead of telling people they are powerless , would n’t it make more sense to empower them and build on their strengths ?
Why not tell them they are stronger than alcohol and they can choose not to let it control them ?
Even if you prefer a religious approach , you could pray for God to support your strength to change your own life , taking full personal responsibility rather than passively turning over the responsibility to a higher power .
The old adage “ God helps those who help themselves ” applies .
Instead of the religious model of sin , confession and absolution , what if we avoided harping on the past and started fresh , concentrating on the patient ’s behavior today and in the future ?
Sure , make amends to those you have harmed for the bad things you have done , but why not put the emphasis on doing good things for other people today and tomorrow ?
Instead of being “ ready to let God remove your shortcomings , ” how about taking active steps to improve your own behavior ?
Why not build self - esteem instead of re-visiting past experiences that damaged self - esteem ?
There have as yet been no scientific studies of Secular Organizations for Sobriety , but their approach seems more promising than AA ’s .
More and more physicians are routinely screening all patients for alcohol abuse : every time I go to a doctor ’s office I am asked “ Do you drink ” and “ How much ? ”
By asking everyone these questions we may help prevent some cases of full - blown alcoholism by catching problem drinking early .
More and more doctors are offering the brief interventions that science has shown to be effective .
Surely we can do better than AA .
If three - quarters of alcoholics can stop drinking on their own with no treatment , we should be looking for ways to help them succeed rather than imposing a treatment that has not been proven effective and that may actually make things worse .
Solicitor General Elena Kagan said in the brief to the Supreme Court that her office agreed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit “ that the princes are immune from petitioners ’ claims , ” although she pointed to somewhat different legal rationales in reaching that conclusion .
Ms. Kagan noted that the Supreme Court had historically looked to the executive branch to take the lead on such international matters because of “ the potentially significant foreign relations consequences of subjecting another sovereign state to suit . ”
The government said in its brief that the victims ’ families never alleged that the Saudi government or members of the royal family “ personally committed ” the acts of terrorism against the United States “ or directed others to do so . ”
And it said the claims that were made  that the Saudis helped to finance the plots  fell “ outside the scope ” of the legal parameters for suing foreign governments or leaders .
Justice Department officials declined to address the issue of whether the timing of the brief was related to Mr. Obama ’s trip to Riyadh , but other lawyers involved in the case said the timing appeared to be coincidental .
They said as a practical matter the department , which was invited to state its views in the case in February , needed to do so by this week if it hoped to influence the court ’s decision on whether to accept the case before it leaves for summer recess in June .
William H. Jeffress , a Washington lawyer who is representing Prince Turki Al - Faisal , a former Saudi ambassador to the United States who is one of the princes named in the lawsuit , said the Justice Department came down on the right side of the law in supporting immunity .
Any suggestion that the timing of the brief was influenced by Mr. Obama ’s upcoming visit was “ baseless , ” Mr. Jeffress said , as were the accusations in the lawsuit itself about the Saudi ties to Al Qaeda .
“ Osama bin Laden is a sworn enemy of the royal family of Saudi Arabia , and the idea that they would be providing financial support to Bin Laden is a little absurd , ” Mr. Jeffress said .
The government is about to approve a cash for clunkers bill that offers a $ 4,500 rebate for switching into a fuel efficient car .
So which gas - sipper are you going to buy ?
Here 's a handy guide to figure out which car will be the best for the environment and for gas mileage .
These cars are all small , but they certainly go a ways on a gallon of gas .
Every one of them gets more than 40 mpg .
Or so the manufacturers are telling us .
The Environmental Transport Association , a British charity / lobbying group focused on efficient vehicles , looked at 1300 autos for sale and determined which car was best for the environment .
The criteria for judging included fuel efficiency , emissions , power and noise , to name a few .
When it comes to unemployment , total numbers tell only part of the story .
Projections that the current unemployment rate of 8.9 % will reach 9.8 % next year may seem like a gradual leveling off , but any further rises above today ’s already high levels will be devastating for certain sectors of the population , particularly minority children .
In his new presentation , Sounding the Alarm , EPI President Lawrence Mishel , projects that the poverty among African American children , which was at a staggering 34.5 % even in the comparatively good times of 2007 , will reach 52.3 % as a result of continued job loss .
The African American community has been hit especially hard by the loss of jobs , with unemployment currently at 15 % and is set to rise above 18 % next year , Mishel projects .
Overall , his report estimates that the overall childhood poverty rate in the U.S. will rise from 18 % today to more than 27 % .
I ’m still new at this .
In the past few months , I ’ve been fortunate to attend this year ’s Game Developer ’s Conference and Electronic Entertainment Expo .
I will additionally be present at Comic - Con , Penny Arcade Expo , Blizzcon and ( perhaps ? ) Tokyo Game Show .
I ’ve always been a spectator – it was n’t until this year that I ’ve been lucky enough to be considered a part of the industry .
And during this time , I ’ve mingled with , been courted by , taken shots with , been harassed by , become Facebook friends with and developed friendships with people from the video game companies who make the games that I ’ve been playing all of my life .
I ’ve also snagged some free tote bags and t- shirts .
In spite of my limited time in this wonderful industry , I ’ve learned a few lessons that I do n’t mind sharing with you .
I will most likely expand on these points later ; there ’s no pain in scratching the surface for now .
I was taken aback a bit in learning some of these “ DUH - YOU - SHOULD-ALREADY-KNOW - THAT ” lessons , but bear in mind that the practical is always different from the theoretical .
As a well - respected CEO of a well - respected video game company kindly informed me , “ It ’s entertainment , baby . ”
Nobody gives a shit about your small video game blog .
Pixelated Who ?
It ’s hard to realize this at first , but the first time always hurts .
People will not click to your web site for breaking video game news unless you already have a big name in gaming journalism : Kotaku , Joystiq , IGN , Gamespot , etc .
Should you somehow break a story for your cute little video game blog , it will get swooped away by one of the aforementioned sites and enjoy all of the hits , anyway .
Absolutely no disrespect intended — imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .
If you ca n’t break it , make it .
Seeing as how we have limited opportunity to get in touch with the Public Relations representatives at all of our favorite video game publishers , the question begs : what do we write about ?
It seems that the only way to get anyone ’s attention is to make your own news .
What ?
Original content on the Internet ?
Unfortunately , “ Original Content ” has seemingly transformed into an invitation for top ten lists and galleries of booth babes .
I do n’t mean to quote a woman who makes handbags , but Coco Chanel has a point : “ In order to be irrepplaceable , one must always be different . ”
Our cute little blog wo n’t survive if our main content consists of images from 4 chan and articles inspired by Cracked.com .
Every female in the gaming industry will initially be considered hot ( unless you ’ve insulted their god )
I should add that this opinion is entirely binary .
If you are a female in the gaming industry , you are either ( 1 ) “ every guys dream come true ” ( 2 ) “ the ugliest bitch on the face of this planet . ”
There is nothing in between .
This situation is entirely inevitable – the industry is full of 12 - 34 - year - old dudes who are most likely single and are most likely looking for a cool chick to play video games with , which makes them most likely very horny ( or very angry , if you ’ve insulted their god ) .
What else should we expect ?
Every female in the gaming industry will initially be considered a fake gamer
A female ’s video game skills are always in question : even the famed WoW player May “ Hafu ” Wang and skillful Guitar Hero champion Annie “ Ecstacy ” Leung had to prove themselves at one point .
And while the guys will think that you ’re the hottest piece of ass on the planet , they ’ll refuse to believe that you can blast them with a couple of headshots .
Unfortunately , it seems like the only way for a girl to prove that she really is a gamer is to win a couple of national tournaments or find her way to WCG .
Or maybe , like , pose naked with a Guitar Hero controller or something like that .
You are at all times required to be professional
This is regardless of the hundreds of video games , the dozens of midgets wearing Rabbid costumes , and the several half - naked chicks surrounding you .
Surrendering your professionalism brings you subject to vast criticism from anonymous people on the Internet .
They ’ll insult your integrity , they ’ll question your intelligence , and they ’ll go so far to claim that you are an “ asshat . ”
I ’m a bit confused with how delivering content on button - mashing with whimsical characters and outrageous scenarios can be taken anywhere near the Serious - Business - professional level .
I ’ll re-evaluate this idea when I can take the suggestion seriously – seeing as how it is probably coming from a man who spends most of his time farming for gold with his beloved night elf .
Twenty Nobel prizewinners , including US energy secretary Steven Chu , Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka , and Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai , have compared the threat of climate change to that posed to civilisation by nuclear weapons .
Borrowing a phrase from US civil rights leader Martin Luther King , they said at the end of a three - day climate change symposium hosted by Prince Charles in London : " We must recognise the fierce urgency of now .
The evidence is compelling for the range and scale of climate impacts that must be avoided , such as droughts , sea level rise and flooding leading to mass migration and conflict .
The scientific process , by which this evidence has been gathered , should be used as a clear mandate to accelerate the actions that need to be taken .
Political leaders cannot possibly ask for a more robust , evidence - based call for action . "
The laureates , who included physics and chemistry Nobel winners , called for urgent reduction in emissions .
" Without directing current economic recovery resources wisely , and embarking on a path towards a low carbon economy , the world will have lost the opportunity to meet the global sustainability challenge .
Decarbonising our economy offers a multitude of benefits , from addressing energy security to stimulating unprecedented technological innovation .
A zero carbon economy is an ultimate necessity and must be seriously explored now . "
The St James 's Palace Memorandum urged politicians to make far faster and deeper emission cuts than most countries were contemplating .
" [ There must be ] a peak of global emissions of all greenhouse gases by 2015 and at least a 50 % emission reduction by 2050 on a 1990 baseline .
This in turn means that developed countries have to aim for a 25 - 40 % reduction by 2020 .
A robust measure of assessing the necessary emission reductions is a total carbon budget , which should be accepted as the base for measuring the effectiveness of short - term ( 2020 ) and long - term ( 2050 ) targets .
They also called for an emergency package to provide " substantial " funding to tropical forest nations to help them halt deforestation .
This was a theme that Prince Charles , who was hosting the event , picked up on Wednesday .
He said , " Saving the rainforests is not an option , it is an absolute necessity . "
On Tuesday , Chu stressed the importance of energy efficiency in combating climate change .
They concluded : " The solutions to the extraordinary environmental , economic and human crises of this century will not be found in the political arena alone .
" Global climate change represents a threat of similar proportions [ to that ] threat posed to civilization by the advent of thermonuclear weapons , and should be addressed in a similar manner .
All scientists should be urged to contribute to raising levels of public knowledge on these threats to civilisation and engage in a massive education effort .
" We know what needs to be done .
We cannot wait until it is too late .
We cannot wait until what we value most is lost . "

Our friends over at StangTV.com had the breaking news coverage on this - Ford Racing Releases Twin Turbo Cobra Jet Concept .
I know this is breaking news and this car is still a concept at this point but all I can say is AMAZING !
The concept is built off the highly capable and race proven current Cobra Jet platform .
Ford Racing took off the super charger and decided to throw on a set of Borg Warner turbos .
Mix that with the built Coyote motor and I ’m sure this Mustang puts down some amazing power .
Check out the video and the StangTV.com article for more information .
Be sure to share your thoughts on this new Ford Racing concept Mustang .
“ When a new generation of Cobra Jets arrived four decades later , they immediately began winning with a modern , fuel - injected 5.4 - liter V8 topped with a belt - driven supercharger , ” recalls Jesse Kershaw , Ford drag racing competition manager .
“ Over the past four years , the Cobra Jet has gone on to become both a fan and competitor favorite , the most successful late - model vehicle in drag racing . ”
Mark Gearhart : SEMA 2012 : Ford Racing Releases Twin Turbo Cobra Jet Concept
UPDATE : Ford Racing Cobra Jet Gets The Green Light 6/15/09
Milan , Mich . —
The 40th Anniversary 2008 Mustang Cobra
Jet more than lived up to its billing , joining its historic predecessor — the original 1968 Cobra Jet in winning its inaugural race at the NHRA Winter nationals in Pomona , Calif .
Now , Ford Racing is ready to update the latest Cobra Jet , and is announcing plans to build a 2010 version of the CJ .
The announcement was officially made today at the National Mustang Racing Association event in Milan .
A little more than a year ago , Ford Racing announced plans to build a modern edition of the Cobra Jet .
The limited run of 50 cars sold in less than two weeks , even before the first car was built .
Once again Ford Racing will produce a limited run of 50 2010 Mustang CJs , the minimum number that must be produced in order to receive clearance from NHRA for competition .
Exact specifications are being finalized , but the initial plan is for the ' 10 Cobra Jet to have a 425 - hp 5.4 - liter supercharged engine from the Ford Racing Performance Parts catalog , but with an option to upgrade to an estimated 475 - hp aluminum block engine .
Likewise the 6 - speed manual transmission that was available in the ’08 Cobra Jet will be standard , but an option to upgrade to 5 - speed Liberty manual transmission or a race prepped automatic transmission will be available .
Other ' 10 Mustang Cobra Jet upgrades include an 8.50et NHRA certified roll cage and lightweight racing brakes .
“ I ’ve said from my first day in this job that I wanted Ford Racing to continue to be a ‘ racer - friendly ’ organization , ” said Wolfe .
“ That ’s why we take great pride in being one of only two car companies worldwide that builds ready - to - race cars and sells them as part of our performance parts offerings . ”
Component testing is underway and base pricing will be less than $ 75,000 .
Production is expected to begin during the fourth quarter with delivery expected in early 2010 .
Sportsmen racers interested in placing a pre-order for the ' 10 Cobra Jet should contact their local Ford Dealership .
Under regular development conditions , I rarely use perlcritic .
Most of my Perl : : Critic usage is via Test :: Perl : : Critic for new code and Test :: Perl : : Critic :: Progressive for existing code .
For code that I release to the CPAN , the Perl : : Critic tests are in xt / author so that they do n’t get run as part of normal tests that someone installing the modules runs .
On someone else ’s system , I do n’t know what Perl : : Critic version or add - on sets of policies they have , so those tests may fail there through no fault of my own .
For non-public code , the Perl : : Critic tests are regular tests that get run with all the rest of the tests .
I can do this because I control the specific version of Perl : : Critic that I ’m running and which add - on policies that I ’ve got around .
Perl : : Critic supports the concept of severity levels for policies and , by default , only applies the most severe ones ( severity 5 ) .
I effectively ignore the severities by turning Perl : : Critic ’s strictness all the way to 1 .
Of course , there are policies that I do n’t agree with or cannot use for practical reasons , so I disable those explicitly .
You may have noticed that above I used the word “ tests ” and not “ test ” .
This is because I run Perl : : Critic on my tests as well as my “ real ” code .
The set of policies that I use on tests is different than I use on the rest of my code .
Tests have fewer restrictions on them compared to regular code .
So I have a test that applies to the contents of lib and bin using one perlcriticrc file and a seperate test that runs on the content of the t and xt directories with a different perlcriticrc .
For tests , I disable the POD policies and Subroutines : : ProtectPrivateSubs ( tests are allowed to peek ) .
Sometimes I also disable ValuesAndExpressions :: ProhibitMagicNumbers , though I prefer not to .
( Perl : : Critic actually uses three self - compliance tests : one for the regular code , one for the tests , and one that makes an additional pass over the Perl : : Critic : : Policy subclasses that places some additional requirements on them . )
The sets of add - on policies that I generally use are Perl : : Critic : : More , Perl : : Critic : : Bangs , Perl : : Critic :: Swift , and Perl : : Critic :: Moose .
I ’m thinking about starting to use Perl : : Critic : : Pulp , but I ’d have to disable about half the policies in there .
There are a couple of cases in which I do use perlcritic .
First , if I ’m surveying a codebase that is new to me , I will run perlcritic -- statistics - only over it in order to get an idea of the state of affairs .
Second , presented with a set of code that has a large number of problems that need fixing , after running perlcritic -- statistics - only on it , I ’ll pick an individual policy that I want to fix violations of and run perlcritic -s policy name on the code .
( The long form of -s is -- single - policy . )
I find it easier to fix one kind of problem across all of the files before moving on to another kind of problem than to fix all the problems in one file before moving on to another file .
It starts with Potter , the high paid head of public relations for CIGNA getting out of his corporate office and taking a trip to his native Tennessee :
Potter attended a " health care expedition , " a makeshift health clinic set up at a fairgrounds , and he tells Bill Moyers , " It was absolutely stunning .
When I walked through the fairground gates , I saw hundreds of people lined up , in the rain .
It was raining that day .
Lined up , waiting to get care , in animal stalls .
Animal stalls .
He talks about how a lot of these executives , including himself , are so removed from the real world , that the insured are no more than just numbers .
And that was my problem .
I had been in the industry and I 'd risen up in the ranks .
And I had a great job .
And I had a terrific office in a high - rise building in Philadelphia .
I was insulated .
I did n't really see what was going on .
I saw the data .
I knew that 47 million people were uninsured , but I did n't put faces with that number .
Then he says that everything about Canada and England that was reported in Michael Moore 's Sicko was true and that they made a costly and concerted effort to derail the message of the movie .
We should n't fear government involvement in our health care system .
There is an appropriate role for government , and it's been proven in the countries that were in that movie .
Potter then goes on in a very calm manner to indict the entire insurance industry for putting profit before people .
What 's most revealing is that ultimately all roads lead back to Wall Street .
If an insurance company actually wanted to do good and take care of people they would pretty much go under and be swallowed up , because it 's all just about the profit margins .
In one particularly galling segment , he cites this example .
If one company 's medical loss ratio was 77.9 percent , for example , in one quarter , and the next quarter , it was 78.2 percent .
It seems like a small movement .
But investors will think that 's ridiculous .
And it 's horrible .
Medical loss ratio , of course , being the Orwellian term for the actual HEALTH CARE , meaning the ultimate goal is to have as little percent of each dollar spent go to the treatment of the insured .
They then talk about the revolving door between insurance lobbyists and Washington , and how a lot of these politicians who defend the private insurances are bought and paid for and simply parrot talking points that the PR departments in those companies come up with .
I 'm telling you , the Godfather has nothing on this plot .
I recommend everyone go and watch this video and then forward it to as many people as you can .

Thanks for the rec list , nice to be initiated while howlin ' at the moon .
I really hope that this interview gets watched widely , it 's a pivotal and even transcendent piece of journalism , the ultimate " The Emperor has no Clothes " moment .
While I have my five minutes under the almost full moon , my more eloquent moments often happen at A World of Words .

Update : people in the comments were suggesting that this would be a great time to rewatch Sicko , especially since Wendell Potter has come out to say it 's the ultimate education tool .
Thanks to teh google it can be imbibed in its full length right here .
The other idea was to ask Mike to have public viewing parties .
I do n't know how that would work , but I 'm thinking of the big screens they set up in European downtowns for big soccer games .
Now THAT would be cool .
And if anyone could pull that off it would be Mike .

http://www.youtube.com/...
Last nightran a strange little piece , Renegade Lieberman Works Well With Obama .
It piqued my interest because the only stuff I 've seen on Lieberman lately was how he had joined his GOP allies in urging Obama to " bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran " and then his attack on Obama 's concept of health care reform .
" Seven months after nearly becoming politically irrelevant , Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) is working closely with a president he actively campaigned against and is playing a leading role in moving major pieces of legislation through the upper chamber ... "
Blah , blah , blah and then ' Bottom line , yes , I ’ll continue to selectively support Republicans . '
He supports Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) for reelection and strongly suggests he would have backed him regardless of what political party he belonged to .
" It does n't surprise me in the slightest .
Like Lieberman , Specter also takes immense sums of money from special corporate interests with business before the Senate .
Lieberman accepted $ 2,391,719 from the Medical - Industrial Complex and $ 1,036,302 from the Insurance Industry ; Specter , took in $ 4,026,933 from the Medical - Industrial Complex and $ 1,035,530 from the Insurance Industry -- two of the worst hypocrites and biggest crooks to ever disgrace the U.S. Senate .
Ofthey support each other -- and ofthey both oppose -- violently -- single payer health care reform or even the compromise position of a public option .
And President Obama supports them both .
And if you wonder how bad of a " Democrat " Specter will be should Ed Rendell , Joe Biden and , sigh , Barack Obama manage to put him over on Democratic primary voters , look past even Joe Lieberman to two of the slimiest political operatives anywhere in the U.S. , the Democratic ex-boss of Erie County Steve Pigeon and old pal ( and wife swapper ) Roger Stone .
Why bother ?
Well , glad you asked .
Pigeon , the worst the Democratic Party has to offer , worked with tax evader Tom Golisano to flip the New York State Senate to the Republicans , axing the first African - American Senate leader in New York state history , the express reason for the fence jump by one of the two treacherous and degenerate Democrats who did the switcheroo .
Pigeon is hosting a fund - raiser for Arlen Specter on June 30 in New York City .
Roger Stone , a GOP sleazebag , who threw his own funder for Specter in February was in on the NY Senate coup with Golisano and Pigeon .
Really revolting .
What would you expect from Arlen Specter ?
Just that he 'll show up with Joe Lieberman on one arm and Barack Obama on the other .
Markos has a screenshot of the actual invitation -- in case you want to show up and picket the anti-health care crowd .
By the way , Menendez is privating claiming that no one asked him for permission to use his name .
Markos also mentions how much more attractive Joe Sestak is looking everyday and points out that " it 's not so surprising that snakes without values or convictions end up flocking together .
And heck , with Specter , Pigeon knows he'd have a candidate who would switch parties again in a snuff if it came time to protect the prerogatives of his rich and powerful benefactors . "

The four co-founders of website The Pirate Bay have been found guilty of assisting the distribution of illegal content online by a Swedish court today and have been sentenced to a year in jail and a $ 3.6 m ( £ 2.4 m ) fine .
Charges against the site , which allows web users to access music , movies and TV shows without paying for them and claimed 22 million users during February , were brought by a consortium of media , film and music companies led by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry .
A Stockholm court found the four defendants guilty of making 33 specific files accessible for illegal sharing through The Pirate Bay , which means they will have to pay compensation to 17 different music and media companies including Sony BMG , Universal , EMI , Warner , MGM and 20th Century Fox .
All four have pledged to appeal against the decision though the process may take several years .
One of the defendants , Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi , admitted on Twitter that Pirate Bay had lost its case .
" Stay calm – nothing will happen to TPB , us personally or filesharing what so ever .
This is just a theatre for the media , " he said .
" Really , it 's a bit LOL .
It used to be only movies , now even verdicts are out before the official release . "
Pirate Bay logo
John Kennedy , chairman and chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , said : " We 're very pleased at the verdict of what was a very important case for us .
" It would have been very difficult to put on a brave face if we had lost , but this verdict sends a strong educational and deterrent message . "
The trial began on 16 February in Stockholm district court , when the four co-founders of The Pirate Bay , Fredrik Neij , Carl Lundström , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg and Kolmisoppi , were put in the dock on charges of assisting copyright infringement .
The Pirate Bay does not itself host audio and video files , but provides links to torrents hosted elsewhere on the internet .
Throughout the trial , the Pirate Bay defendants have played up their image as rebellious outsiders , arriving at court in a slogan - daubed party bus and insisting that their position was to defend a popular technology rather than illegal filesharing .
Prosecutors made a major slip - up on the second day of the trial after failing to convince the judge that illegally copied files had been distributed by the site .
They were forced to drop the charge of " assisting copyright infringement " and focus on the lesser charge of " assisting making available copyrighted content " .
They had been seeking SKr115 m ( £ 9.1 m ) in compensation for loss of earnings due to the millions of illegal downloads facilitated by the site .
The trial has further polarised the tech community and the music industry with both sides eagerly awaiting the result , which will be regarded as a precedent for future filesharing cases .
Supporters of The Pirate Bay held a street party in Moscow last night , with organisers saying the trial had proved that the companies behind the prosecution were " motivated only by their greed and inertia , want to prevent people sharing music , movies , or anything , on a purely altruistic basis " .
The chairman of the Swedish Independent Music Producers Association , Jonas Sjöström , said as the trial concluded that the consortium is " tired and sick of services like The Pirate Bay who have no understanding or respect for the creative community , and instead have their own financial interests at heart " .
Meanwhile , Sweden 's National Museum of Science and Technology announced yesterday that it had bought a server owned by The Pirate Bay confiscated by police last year .
The museum paid SKr2,000 for the server and will display it in its archive of illegally copied material .
In 1988 , Moore and Malcolm Sparrow , a Kennedy School professor who was a former detective chief inspector with the British police , asked Kennedy to work with them on a book about new ideas in policing .
“ So that ’s where I got my graduate - school education , ” Kennedy said .
“ I read everything , and talked about this stuff constantly . ”
He had always intended to return to freelance writing , he said , “ but I realized that I was too committed to the work I was doing . ”
He asked Moore if he could become part of the criminal - justice program at the Kennedy School , and Moore hired him , in 1992 .
“ It was just a magical time , ” Kennedy said , of the early nineties .
“ There was a sense that something profound had been figured out , and it was going to change everything .
We had been dead wrong about crime for so long , and we could see we were at a point of transforming these institutions . ”
In fact , nothing changed .
Kennedy ’s timing was terrible .
From 1987 to 1990 , during the peak of the crack epidemic , youth homicides in cities across America rapidly escalated ; in Boston during that period , youth homicides increased two hundred and thirty per cent , and from 1991 to 1995 the city averaged about forty - four youth homicides a year .
Across the country , from the smallest county judgeship to the Presidency of the United States , political races hinged more and more on the question of who could be tougher on crime .
From 1980 to 2000 , the prison population in the U.S. increased from three hundred and nineteen thousand to 1.3 million .
Federal corrections expenditures , driven by new federal drug - sentencing changes , went from five hundred and forty - one million dollars in 1982 to more than $ 6.9 billion in 2006 , and state corrections expenditures that year totalled more than forty - two billion dollars .
California now spends about two and a half times as much per prison inmate as it does per student in the University of California system .
By the mid-nineties , crime rates were dropping in cities around the country , nowhere more dramatically than in New York City , where Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner William Bratton were pioneering the zero- tolerance approach and drawing attention to Kelling and Wilson ’s “ broken windows ” theory by aggressively pursuing minor crimes .
Advocates of longer sentencing and “ three strikes ” legislation cited those measures as the main reasons for the decline .
Subsequent analysis by social scientists has suggested that the increase in incarceration was only a small factor in the great crime decline ; other reasons , such as changing demographics and economic circumstances , and the waning of the crack epidemic , were collectively more important .
Nonetheless , by the late nineties , incapacitation — locking a lot of people up for long terms to prevent crime — was the new ruling principle in criminal justice .
Deterrence , in the classical sense of the word — using the threat of punishment to prevent crime — had become an even smaller part of public policy .
In 1994 , the National Institute of Justice gave a grant to Kennedy and Anne Morrison Piehl , a colleague from the Kennedy School , to work out a problem - oriented approach to youth violence in Boston .
They were joined by Anthony Braga , who was then a doctoral student in criminal justice at Rutgers University .
Kennedy was eager to talk to cops who had the most street knowledge , and eventually he was directed to Paul Joyce , the leader of the police department ’s Youth Violence Strike Force .
Over the next six months , Joyce gradually revealed his methods for dealing with violent gangs .
He had observed that the use of force and the threat of prison seemed to have little effect in deterring gang members ’ behavior .
But certain moral authorities from within the community — clergy , ex-cons , outreach workers with street credibility — could sometimes get through to the offenders , especially when their pleas were coupled with the promise of help .
Joyce had also figured out how to use the gangs ’ own internal dynamics against them .
Joyce was cryptic about this part of his operation ; when Kennedy asked how he had managed to calm down one gang in particular , Joyce would say only , “ We just told them the truth . ”
The truth , it turned out , was that if one more gang shooting occurred , by any one of their members , the whole group was going to take the blame .
“ I just said , ‘ Holy shit ! ’ ” Kennedy told me .
“ ‘ This is incredible !
Do you realize what this means ? ’ ” Joyce ’s techniques , he believed , could be used to formulate a method of “ focussed deterrence ” — a systematic , repeatable version of the ad - hoc working methods that Joyce and his partners had developed in the streets .
Kennedy also discovered that Joyce ’s strike force knew how the victims knew the shooters , and what the beefs between them were .
“ I said , ‘ Oh my God , you know all this stuff ! ’
‘ Sure we know it , ’ Joyce replied .
‘ It ’s just that nobody asked us for it before . ’ ”
In order to broadcast the messages that Joyce imparted informally to gangs citywide , Kennedy , Braga , and Piehl came up with the idea of group forums , or call - ins .
“ We went to the Boston police command structure and presented it , thinking , This is never going to fly , ” Kennedy said .
“ But they heard us out , and then said , ‘ Yep , that ’ll work . ’ ”
The first call - in was in the spring of 1996 , a few months after Joyce had been succeeded by Gary French .
By the second round , that summer , youth homicide had dropped dramatically .
Just eight homicides were committed over the five months following the first call - in , compared with twenty - eight in the same five months of the previous year — a seventy - one - per - cent decline .
In October , there were no youth homicides at all .
Things got so quiet that French thought his pager had stopped working .
“ I almost took my beeper in to have it checked , ” he said at the time .
“ It just stopped going off . ”
The Ceasefire team in Cincinnati came together during the first half of 2007 .
It included members of the police department and the U.S. Attorney ’s office , the district attorney , and the county sheriff , as well as Hamilton County probation and Ohio state parole officers .
It also encompassed an array of social - service providers and a dozen or so outreach workers , who served as liaisons with the gang members .
The cops , social workers , and outreach workers , some of whom were ex-cons , would all have a stake .
The group acquired a name — C.I.R.V. ( Cincinnati Initiative to Reduce Violence ) — offices downtown , and a project manager , S. Gregory Baker , a civilian who handles community relations for the C.P.D. Several former executives from Procter & Gamble , which is based in Cincinnati , volunteered their “ best practices ” management expertise to the group .
Eventually , the C.I.R.V. team numbered almost fifty partner agencies .
“ I ’m saving that one for someone really special . ”

The first Cincinnati call - in was held on July 31 , 2007 , in a large courtroom in the Hamilton County Courthouse .
The C.I.R.V. team assembled in the courtroom first .
Then about thirty men , mostly young , were admitted .
Heads bent , avoiding eye contact , and sullenly postured like the punctuation at the end of a question for which there is no answer —
What the fuck ? — they filed into the benches reserved for courtroom spectators .
A few who were already in lockup wore handcuffs and leg shackles .
They sat down , and the team in the front of the room looked at them .
No one spoke .
Call-ins are intensely dramatic events , like modern - day morality plays .
At the one I attended , there was a palpable , almost evangelical desire to make the experience transformative for the gangbangers .
An older ex-gang member named Arthur Phelps , whom everyone called Pops , wheeled a thirty - seven - year - old woman in a wheelchair to the center of the room .
Her name was Margaret Long , and she was paralyzed from the chest down .
“ Seventeen years ago , I shot this woman , ” Phelps said , weeping .
“ And I live with that every day of my life . ”
Then Long cried out , “ And I go to the bathroom in a bag , ” and she snatched out the colostomy bag from inside the pocket of her wheelchair and held it up while the young men stared in horror .
When the final speaker , a street worker named Aaron Pullins III , yelled , “ Your house is on fire !
Your building is burning !
You ’ve got to save yourselves !
Stand up ! , ” three - quarters of the group jumped to their feet , as if they had been jerked up like puppets on strings .
At the initial call - in , Victor Garcia was the first to speak .
He told the young men that he loved them , that they had value to their community , and that he knew they were better than their violent actions implied .
Afterward , Chief Streicher addressed them , thanking them for coming , and making it clear that “ this is nothing personal . ”
He then delivered the message : “ We know who you are , we know who your friends are , and we know what you ’re doing .
If your boys do n’t stop shooting people right now , we ’re coming after everyone in your group . ”
To reinforce this message at a later call - in , surveillance footage showing some of the invitees selling drugs was projected on a screen at the front of the courtroom .
“ Raise your hands when you see yourselves , ” Streicher said .
One by one , hands went up .
The young men were introduced to the social workers , who were available to help them get jobs and educational assistance , if they called the phone number that had been provided to them in an information packet .
And two mothers of sons murdered by gangs spoke of their pain and loss .
Michael Blass , a public official who was then with the Ohio Department of Public Safety , wrote an account of his experience as an observer at this first call - in .
He described the invitees ’ “ awkward attempts to project confidence , indifference , in some cases , perhaps , hostility .
. . .
These angry young men , used to being in control in the incredibly brutal environment of the mean streets , were noticeably off - balance and unsure of themselves . ”
Blass wrote , “ I saw a few young men choke back tears .
. . .
Over the course of a couple of hours , their facial expressions changed from those of cynicism or polite boredom to attention and curiosity . ”
One young man raised his shackled hands above his head and cried out , “ I never knew there was this much love out there . . . seriously , I never knew it . ”
One of the gang members invited to the meeting was Dante Ingram , twenty - nine , who had been selling drugs and stealing since he was fifteen .
“ That ’s how we was brought up , ” he told me recently .
“ When your mom ’s a crackhead , your dad ’s in the joint , your brother sells drugs , and your best buddy got a Cadillac and Jordans — what else you going to do ?
You got no other role models . ”
In 2006 , Ingram had been caught with a large amount of marijuana and several guns in his house , and sentenced to ten years in federal prison , but it was his first felony conviction and the judge released him on probation .
His probation officer had ordered him to attend the call - in .
Ingram told me that he was more influenced by the community - services aspect of the Ceasefire strategy than by the threat of swift and certain punishment .
“ During the cops ’ presentation , I was n’t really listening , ” he said .
“ Some guys around me were snoring .
They were being the typical tough cops , threatening us and whatnot .
But you got to understand — threats mean nothing to these guys . ”
Ingram kept the card with the phone number .
“ For the next three weeks , I looked at it every day , ” he told me .
Finally , he called , and left Stan Ross , the head of the street workers , a message : “ If this shit is for real , give me a call . ”
Ross called , and within a month Ingram had a job in sales with a telemarketing firm .
Kennedy had cautioned the C.I.R.V. team that the murder rate would fall only moderately after the first call - in ; it was after the second set of call - ins , “ the second turn of the crank , ” as he put it , that the mechanism would really take hold .
By the end of the year , homicides in Cincinnati in 2007 were down twenty - four per cent from 2006 .
The trend continued into 2008 — by April , there had been a fifty - per-cent reduction in gang - related homicides .
Kennedy had made good on his guarantee to the Mayor .
The fourth call - in , held in June , 2008 , was a disaster .
In contrast to the previous call - ins , during which the young men had been split up into smaller groups , this time a hundred and twenty of them were brought together at the same time , in the same room .
In retrospect , this was one of several mistakes that the team made .
“ We lost control of the room , ” Whalen said .
Also , for the first time , the team had n’t rehearsed , and , partly as a result , “ We went off script , ” he said .
Some street workers cursed , and one started flirting with a gang member ’s girlfriend .
( “ Girl , you fine .
What you doin ’ hangin ’ with these thugs ? ” )
Other street workers referred to gang members as niggas , which the cops saw as a violation of propriety and state authority .
Kennedy told me , “ Some people within the group had become hungry for that personal transformation , when the individual offenders jump up and declare themselves done with the thug life , and everyone cries .
At the June meeting , they did n’t get that reaction , and they ended up pushing too hard . ”
In the months after the call - in , the murder rate spiked upward .
“ We almost provoked them to violence , ” Whalen told me .
“ They went out of the room challenged . ”
Streicher threatened to pull the cops off the team if their concerns were not addressed .
The Mayor assured Streicher that the mistakes would not be repeated , and persuaded the police to stay involved .
Thanks to Greg Baker ’s work as project manager , C.I.R.V. did not go off the rails .
The next call - in , scheduled for the fall of 2008 , was moved back to December , in part to give the team a chance to regroup .
For Kennedy , the important thing was that “ the system self - corrected , ” he said .
“ That ’s huge . ”
Since its success in Boston , Kennedy ’s anti-gang - violence strategy has been tried in some sixty other cities .
( Kennedy ’s method should not be confused with one devised in Chicago by Gary Slutkin , a physician and epidemiologist , which is sometimes referred to as Cease Fire .
Slutkin ’s strategy employs community members to mediate potential shootings while also pushing for behavioral change in high - risk individuals and communities . )
Kennedy helped Minneapolis implement a violence - prevention strategy in June of 1996 , and homicides in the summer months fell from forty - two that year to eight in 1997 .
But in Minneapolis “ the team lost focus , ” Kennedy told me , and “ all the complicated parts of the mechanism did n’t mesh . ”
A similar thing happened , over the next five years , in Indianapolis and Stockton , California .
Spectacular early results proved difficult to sustain .
“ Ceasefire takes a lot of manpower , ” Wayne Hose , a former chief of police in Stockton , told me .
“ And you have to have people who believe in it .
You have to have someone who will call the D.A. ’s office and say , ‘ Why are n’t your people coming to the meetings ? ’ ” Even in Boston , Ceasefire did n’t last ; the program was abandoned in 2000 , partly as a result of a personality conflict among team members .
By 2001 , the number of homicides had risen more than a hundred per cent over the 1999 level , and it has remained high .
In 2007 , Gary French began to implement a renewed Ceasefire approach , and so far the results have been promising .
Franklin Zimring , a professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley , who is a leading deterrence scholar , told me that one reason that Ceasefire ’s effectiveness is difficult to predict in any given city is that Kennedy ’s results have not been subjected to a rigorous independent analysis .
“ Ceasefire is more a theory of treatment than a proven strategy , ” he said , adding , “ It ’s odd that no one has ever said , ‘ O.K. , here are the youths who were not part of the Ceasefire program in Boston , let ’s compare them to the youths who were .
And no one has followed up with any long - range studies of the criminal behavior of the group that was in the program , either .
We just do n’t have the evidence , and until we do we ca n’t evaluate how effective Ceasefire really is . ”
When I relayed Zimring ’s comments to Kennedy , he laughed .
“ Frank still does n’t get it , ” he said .
“ There ’s plenty of research , but it ’s not focussed on the impact on the people in the call - ins , because the strategy is n’t just about the people in the room . ”
He added , “ When you have a couple of meetings and homicide city - wide goes down forty per cent , it ’s not because the forty guys you ’ve talked to have turned their lives around .
There are a thousand guys on the street you have n’t talked to .
But the forty get the word out to the thousand — which ruins them as controls for the kind of evaluation that Frank ’s talking about . ”
Perhaps Kennedy ’s greatest success to date has occurred in High Point , North Carolina , a small city , of some ninety thousand people , that is known for producing furniture .
( The entire city smells like varnish . )
The High Point Strategy , as it has come to be known , was aimed at public drug dealing , not gang violence , but the methodology was largely the same .
In 2004 , Kennedy persuaded Jim Fealy , chief of the High Point police , to apply his problem - oriented approach to a long - standing open - air drug market in a neighborhood called West End .
Fealy and his predecessor had tried for years to shut down the market with periodic sweeps and stings .
“ We would go in and arrest ’em , and things would quiet down for a few months , but then new guys would be back , ” he said .
The Reverend Jim Summey , who was at the time the pastor of the English Road Baptist Church , in the center of West End , told me that on Sunday mornings there were so many drug dealers , prostitutes , and johns on the sidewalk in front of the church that worshippers coming for services could n’t steer their cars into the parking lot .
Fealy was seated at his desk when I spoke to him ; a photograph behind him showed him in full SWAT regalia .
“ Everyone knows I ’m as conservative as they come , ” he drawled .
“ My approach as a cop had always been either arrest the problem or scare the problem away with high - profile prosecutions .
You know , ‘ Cuff ’em and stuff ’em . ’
But in West End the problem always came back . ”
When he first heard about Kennedy ’s strategy , he thought it was ridiculous , but he agreed to meet him .
“ David said , ‘ Give me a half hour before you decide I ’m crazy . ’
And at the end of that half hour I was still sitting there . ”
Kennedy ’s strategy not only closed down the West End drug market ; the drug market disappeared the day after the first call - in .
“ We had worked on these problems for twenty years and got nowhere , and in one day it was over , ” Fealy said .
“ In one day .
Honestly , I never would have believed it if I had n’t seen it with my own eyes . ”
It ’s unclear whether any of the dozen or so High Point drug dealers who called the services number ultimately left behind the life of crime .
None of the root - cause problems behind drugs and crime were solved ; drug dealing may have moved indoors , or to other neighborhoods , or to nearby cities .
But public drug dealing never returned to West End , and , once the threat was removed from the streets , the community reclaimed its neighborhood .
Within weeks , residents were planting flowers in their gardens , and in the spring of 2005 the community threw a barbecue for the police .
When I was studying for my Ph.D. , a fellow grad student and I asked our advisor if he could think of one single characteristic that was common to all of the best scientists he knew .
Without too much hesitation , he answered : " Hard work . "
That certainly was n't the answer we wanted to hear -- you mean there is n't some secret recipe to being brilliant ?
And of course hard work is not nearly enough to elevate you to the ranks of the world 's great scientists .
But now that I have marinated for some time in the juices of experience myself , I see the truth of what he was getting at ; there are a lot of smart people out there , so it makes sense that what elevates a few of them above their peers is an extraordinary focus on their work and a great amount of simple effort .
So it should come as no surprise that Isaac Newton , the greatest physicist of all time , was a relentless worker .
In his days at Cambridge , when he focused on the workings of the natural world , he would spend as little time as possible on anything that drew him away from the researches in his rooms .
Over the couple of years he was writing the Principia Mathematica , he took things to extremes , going for extended periods without food or sleep .
( He also , apparently , died a virgin .
Extremes come in many guises . )
Most contemporary physicists have heard that Newton eventually left Cambridge and more or less turned his back on scientific research , to take up activities in later life that we associate with varying degrees of disreputability : alchemy , religious studies , taking a bureaucratic position at the Royal Mint , using the Royal Society to attack his scientific rivals .
Lots of us shrug and agree that many older scientists do all sorts of crazy things , and do n't wonder too much about the details .
Happily , Tom Levenson ( of The Inverse Square , and one of our honored guest bloggers ) has provided us with a fascinating peek into a telling episode in Newton 's later life -- his career as a criminal investigator .
Not really " P.I. " , as Newton was acting in his capacity as a government official , the Warden of the Mint .
The story is closer to something from Law and Order or CSI -- remarkably close , in fact .
In Newton and the Counterfeiter , Levenson tells the tale of how Newton took up what should have been a cushy sinecure , and ended up devoting his extraordinary Newtonian powers to the pursuit and prosecution of one William Chaloner , the counterfeiter of the title .
Poor Chaloner , suffice it to say , never knew what hit him .
I should say right up front that this is not a book about physics .
Some time back
Tom asked me to read some pages from his draft , to make sure the physics was coming out right , but he assured me that physics played a very minor role in the book .
That baffled me a bit , because -- well , it is Isaac Newton , right ?
But this is a work of biography and intellectual history , and offers a fascinating " street - level view " of the dawn of the Age of Reason .
I can recommend it without hesitation to anyone who likes good stories , which I presume is just about anyone .
The book does begin with some stage - setting about Newton 's scientific work in Cambridge -- it is Isaac Newton , right ?
But it picks up when our protagonist finally wrangles a position in London as Warden of the Mint .
Not supposed to be a taxing job ; one of the attractions for Newton was that he was going to have plenty of time available for his research .
Mostly , at that time , on alchemy and religion -- one of the enlightening chapters looks at how Newton actually went about his alchemical work , which is both engrossing and baffling to the modern reader .
History did not cooperate .
The 1690's was a transformative time for the English currency system , including the introduction of paper money , trade imbalances with the Continent , massive debts run up by William III 's wars in France , and an epidemic of counterfeiting and " coin- clipping , " by which people would shave off the edges of silver coins and melt them down to make new ones .
In response , the Mint eventually gave in and undertook a comprehensive re-coinage -- a program that was on track to become a complete fiasco until Newton stepped in .
Remember that he was not simply an abstract theorist ( although he was that ) ;
Newton was an extraordinarily careful experimenter , and he turned his practical side to the problem of re-coinage , with spectacular results .
But the real fun comes in when Newton takes on Chaloner , one of the most notorious counterfeiters of the day .
I do n't want to give away too much , because you really should buy the book .
Suffice it to say that where Newton was gifted with an extraordinary intellect and a relentless work ethic , Chaloner was gifted with what we would today call " balls . "
No scheme was too audacious to be undertaken , no lie was too grandiose to be told , no collection of co-conspirators was too extensive to be betrayed or turned against each other .
Chaloner was a colorful character , whose story would have made entertaining reading no matter what era he was born into .
But he made one unforgivable mistake : he attracted the particular ire of Isaac Newton , who turned the full force of his powers to tracking this miscreant down and bringing him to justice .
Chaloner 's own gifts notwithstanding , it was not a fair fight .
We tend to look at successful people and imagine that they are defined by their sphere of success .
It 's hard for us today to think of Isaac Newton as anything other than a scientist .
But he was good at what he did , whether it was piecing together the mysteries of classical mechanics or paying informers to spy on suspected criminals .
Gil Grissom would approve -- maybe not of all his methods , but certainly of his results .
What 's a nice girl like you doing with an arsenal like this ?
Police seize 20 - year - old guarding vast weapons cache ... including anti-aircraft gun
Smirking for the camera , this is the 20 - year - old woman Mexican police caught guarding an extraordinary arsenal of weapons .
Anahi Beltran Cabrera was seized during a routine patrol in Sonora state , near the U.S. border .
Officers recovered a vast cache of weapons including an anti-aircraft gun capable of firing 800 shots per minute , five rifles , a grenade and part of a grenade launcher .

The cache included an antiaircraft gun , numerous rifles and a large amount of ammunition
They believe the haul belongs to a group allegedly linked to the powerful Beltan Leyva drug cartel .
Cabrera was paraded before the media - along with the weapons she was caught guarding .
The anti-aircraft gun , capable of penetrating armour from more than 5,000 ft away and found attached to the top of a SUV , was the first of its type to be seized by Mexican police .
Large swathes of Mexico have been ravaged by violence with drugs gangs battling for territory .
Cartels have increasingly got hold of higher - powered weapons including military - grade arms such as grenades and machine guns .
This has left police outgunned and many officers have quite following attacks .
Anahi Beltran Cabrera is believed to be linked to the powerful Beltran Leyva drug cartel
Last month , 2,000 soldiers and armed federal police were deployed into the border town of Ciudad Juarez to restore order to the country 's most violent city .
In one month , 250 people were killed by hitmen fighting for lucrative smuggling routes .

July 8 , 2009  --
Federal buildings are virtually unprotected from terrorist attacks , an undercover government investigation has found .
Undercover agents from the Government Accountability Office were able to smuggle liquid bombmaking materials into all ten federal buildings around the United States they tested , according to testimony before a Senate panel Wednesday morning .
Once inside the buildings , the agents assembled the components and walked around several floors of each building -- past field offices for U.S. lawmakers , the Department of Homeland Security , the Justice Department and others .
GAO did not disclose the specific buildings it penetrated .
All facilities penetrated by GAO investigators were considered " Level 4 " high - security buildings – that house more than 450 employees , house major agencies that have national security or law enforcement responsibilities , and might be a likely target for an attack .
Investigators encountered a guard asleep at his post , after taking the powerful painkiller Percocet .
At another facility , they found a guard using FPS computers to operate " a private for - profit adult website . "
GAO investigators also reviewed guard certifications , and found that most lacked at least one certification that should have been required to work as a federal guard .
Federal buildings are protected by the Federal Protective Service , an arm of the Department of Homeland Security .
The service relies heavily on contact guard services , which provide 13,000 personnel to the service .
" It is outrageously unacceptable that federal employees working in federal buildings .
. . are still apparently so utterly exposed to potential attack by terrorists or other violent people , " said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman , I - CT , chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , which held a hearing on the investigation Wednesday morning .
" I cannot fathom how security breaches of this magnitude were allowed to occur , " said Sen.
Susan Collins , R - Maine , the panel 's ranking Republican .
Federal Protective Service : ' Agency in Crisis '
Calling the FPS " an agency in crisis , " Lieberman noted FPS has had serious budget shortfalls , " but that does n't excuse or explain " their inability to protect federal workers and buildings .
GAO 's findings were " disturbing news " that " caused us all grave concern , " said FPS director Gary W. Schenkel in his testimony before the committee .
He listed steps he had begun taking " within three hours " of learning of the reported security lapses .
Schenkel said he had formed a " Tiger Team " of FPS officials to evaluate and improve security at federal buildings , boosted inspections , and warned the companies providing contract guards that lapses were " unacceptable and will not be tolerated . "
" I want to express to you my personal sense of urgency and commitment to the important responsibility I share with the men and women of FPS , in keeping our nation safe , " Schenkel told the senators .
He said he was " confident " FPS guards could " continue to meet the challenges of its homeland security mission . "
Schenkel told the panel he was not contesting any of GAO 's findings .
" I take full responsibility .
I am director of the organization . "

Trans -Atlantic Comparisons ( 3 ) Is the US Really a Nation of God-Fearing Darwin - Haters ?
Is it only Europeans who want to save the environment and only Americans who discount Darwin ?
In the final part of his series on trans -Atlantic differences , American historian Peter Baldwin explains why these stereotypes do n't work - and what the real differences between Old Europe and America are .
Von Peter Baldwin
Long before he became one of the 20th century 's leading thriller writers , Len Deighton was a top food writer .
His famous " cookstrips " , explaining how to cook chicken à la Kiev or baked Alaska in a breezy combination of words and graphics , ran in The Observer for two years .
Eagle - eyed filmgoers can see one of the strips pinned to the wall of Harry Palmer 's kitchen in The Ipcress File , the 1965 movie version of Deighton 's first book .
And if anyone wondered on whom the cool , independent , black - framed - spectacle - wearing Palmer ( played by Michael Caine ) was based , one glance at the cool , bespectacled 36 - year - old L Deighton should have given them the answer .
At the time , it was considered quirky and unnatural for a man to cook for himself at home , but it soon acquired cachet : a female chore was suddenly recast as a male socio- sexual accomplishment .
It was one of the things a chap was supposed to be naturally good at , like driving a car , choosing wine or , as Swiss Toni from The Fast Show would say , making love to a bee - yoodiful woman .
When a collection of Deighton 's cookstrips were published in 1965 , the year The Ipcress File was launched , they were collectively titled Len Deighton 's Action Cook Book .
The cover featured a rugged James Bond type in a purple shirt and shoulder holster , tossing spaghetti in a copper saucepan while a 1960s dolly - bird in false eyelashes and broderie anglaise tenderly strokes his hair .
The image of the home - cooking macho man , as much at home with a caneton à l'orange as a Walther PPK automatic , was born .

Harry Palmer , the gun-toting gourmet , went on to star in five more novels and two more films .
This year , to celebrate Deighton 's 80th birthday , all his books are being rereleased by HarperCollins – and among them will be the Action Cook Book , unchanged in all its retro glory .
It 's a fascinating work , full of nostalgia , with its advice about the importance of buying a fridge , and its assumption ( probably right ) that readers will have no experience of such exotic fruits and vegetables as asparagus , chillis , salsify and pomegranate ( " take a big napkin " ) .
Speaking from his home in southern California , Deighton explained what started his cooking career .
" My mother was one of 16 children ; so there was a lot of cooking to do , and she did her share .
During the war we lived in Gloucester Place Mews in Marylebone .
My father was the chauffeur for a family living in the large house behind us .
Sometimes my mother would cook in its kitchens , but she also cooked in a nightclub off Baker Street .
She 'd come home with jolly stories about the extravagant menu names they gave her simple dishes . "
The Action Cook Book 's fascination for slightly gross foodstuffs ( Brains in Black Butter ?
Sharp and Sweet Tongue ? ) can be traced directly to Mrs Deighton .
" Offal was n't rationed during the war , and my mother resorted to the sort of food she 'd eaten as a child : tripe and onions , brains , tongue and braised rabbit .
I remember those dishes with great pleasure and I can never get them as good as they tasted when my mother served them . "
His kitchen education began shortly after he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in 1952 .
" I was an art student on vacation , and got a job at the new Festival Hall 's restaurant as a temporary kitchen porter .
One day I was mopping the floor when the fish chef asked me if I would do some jobs for him , as his assistant had n't arrived .
My first task was skinning Dover soles .
I must have been a good student because he then showed me how to fillet them .
From then onwards , my days were spent as unofficial assistant to the fish chef , though I was still paid only porter 's wages .
I once asked my chef why he'd chosen me for this sudden elevation .
He said everyone had noticed the way I ' hung around watching the cooks ' .
He was right .
During my student vacations , I continued to work in kitchens in England and abroad , and I not only hung around watching the cooks , I became one of them . "
Was there one chef who influenced him ?
" Philip Harben , " said Deighton .
" He was a short , hyper - active man with a neatly - trimmed beard who'd become a TV star in the 1940s .
His TV series was called The Grammar of Cookery and one of his many books , The Way To Cook , is subtitled ' Common Sense in the Kitchen ' and begins , ' This is not a recipe book . '
Harben persuaded me that French cooking provides the best systematic basis for anyone learning to cook anything .
My mother provided the skills , and my time spent working in restaurants the professional attitude , but Harben was scientific and he was the one who pointed me in the right direction . "
During his six years as a student , punctuated by vocational cheffing , Deighton bought several classic cookbooks .
Because he did n't want to see them spattered with Bolognese sauce , he never took them in the kitchen .
Instead , he wrote out recipes on slips of paper , adding little drawings and diagrams , and pinned them over the cooker .
One evening at dinner , a graphics guru called Ray Hawkey , working for The Observer , walked into Deighton 's kitchen and spotted the fluttering recipes .
Those , he said , could be published if the lettering and drawing were better .
" English newspapers were being drastically revised at the time , " Deighton recalls .
" Ray and Mike Rand were graphic designers and wanted my cookstrips to be part of a new magazine - like look .
The Observer management regarded the changes with dread and would commit to only six strips .
But when they started getting letters from male readers , they extended my contract to 50 strips to make up a course in French cooking . "
Deighton began retrieving the oldest recipes he possessed from behind the flour bin on a high shelf in his kitchen .
It was like strip - mining his past .
Perhaps that 's why he writes in the introduction , " Of all the books I have written , none of them is dearer to me or more personal than this one . "
An extravagant claim ?
" They say that any woman examining the clothes in her wardrobe lives again the highlights of her past .
Well , these recipes do something like that for me . "
He found the recipes all over the place .
A Portuguese fisherman ( in Portugal ) taught him how to cook squid .
A Viennese granny in Hampstead made a brilliant cheesecake before his eyes .
A Hungarian cook in Piccadilly taught him to make strudel dough .
Where did he find the recipe for Chelo Kebab on page 196 ?
" From the Persian chef in a Persian restaurant in the City .
A charming elderly lady doing PR for yoghurt enticed me there with a note saying they had a belly dancer performing , even at lunch time ...
It was irresistible .
And my Calvinist sense of duty ensured that I came away with a recipe from the chef . "
The bulk of his cooking , though , was French .
" Henri -Paul Pellaprat 's book Modern Culinary Art was my Bible and The Art of French Cooking edited by Bart Winer contained the chosen recipes of eight of the greatest chefs of all time .
This was the book I asked Roy Plomley to let me have on Desert Island Discs . "
Reading the Action Cook Book , you 're struck by Deighton 's ahead - of - the - loop sophistication : his keenness on garlic and coffee beans , his contempt for " the stuff marked Pepper that looks like grey flour " , his insistence on using only the best kitchen utensils .
It all goes back to his sentimental education , miles from home , at 17 .
" I was a teenager when I first went to France .
It was 1946 ; the war was a very recent memory .
A French friend of my father had agreed to look after me but was unexpectedly sent somewhere , so I was n't met at the Gare du Nord .
I found myself alone in a Wonderland .
I saw an advert for a hotel that turned out to be a flea - bitten brothel in Pigalle .
I could write a book about that teenager 's fortnight in Paris .
I became a Francophile and food played a large part in my conversion ... "
So , Mr Deighton , I said , there you were in your 20s , a cool , successful young man about town with your bachelor flat in London and your fancy cooking skills .
Were you a big hit with the ladies ?
And were you in great demand among friends of both sexes , for your flashy way with coq au vin ?
" I do n't remember doing much cooking for girlfriends during my student years , " said Deighton guardedly .
" I cooked for myself and my close friends .
The girls upon whom I had designs were taken to restaurants , where I could display my knowledge of French menus .
In those student days , only a few of my men friends were able to cook .
But if they had any sort of apparatus or a stove , I could often get invited and earn my evening meal by cooking for a crowd . "
Yes , yes , ( I persisted ) but when you got the dolly birds with the false eyelashes and the broderie anglaise tops into your kitchen , what exactly did you cook them ?
What constituted the perfect seduction dish ?
Chicken paprika ?
Entrecôte bordelaise ?
Coquilles St - Jacques ?
Deighton 's reply was a masterpiece of understatement .
" Nothing fattening , " he said .
" Nothing I could n't pronounce .
And nothing that might burn or boil over if eating the meal was delayed ... "
( Mental Floss ) --
What do you do when you 've just hanged someone for murder , and then their " victim " pops up alive and healthy a few towns away ?
Justice went thataway for some people convicted of murders they did n't commit .
1 . Not the Marion type
William Jackson Marion and Jack Cameron met at a Kansas boarding house in 1872 .
The two men became fast friends and traveling companions , using Cameron 's team of horses to go from place - to - place to find work .
Along their journey , the two made a brief stop in Beatrice , Nebraska to visit Marion 's in - laws before moving on .
After a few days , however , Marion returned solo , sporting clothes that belonged to Cameron and driving Cameron 's horses .
Then he left town again .
Weeks later , the body of a man was discovered with three bullet holes in his head .
He was also wearing the same outfit that Cameron had worn the day he left town .
Marion immediately became the prime suspect and a manhunt began .
After 10 years of searching , Marion was finally captured in Kansas .
The trial and conviction of Jack Marion was seriously abbreviated .
Marion 's verdict was read after just one hour of deliberation , and he was hanged for his crime on March 25 , 1887 .
Four years later , Jack Cameron reappeared looking for his old friend .
Apparently , he had run to Mexico to avoid a shotgun wedding in Kansas , giving his horses and other possessions to Marion .
Now he'd come back to reclaim them .
The story does end on a ( slightly ) positive note :
Thanks to the work of Marion 's grandson , Elbert Marion , Nebraska governor Bob Kerrey granted Jack Marion a posthumous pardon in 1987 , 100 years after his execution .

2. The Brothers Boorn
In May of 1812 , when Richard Colvin vanished , speculation amongst the townspeople of Manchester , Vermont , was that his brothers - in - law , Jesse and Stephen Boorn , were responsible .
Without evidence of foul play , though , no charges were pressed .
Seven years later , the Boorn Brothers ' uncle had a dream in which Richard said he'd been killed and his body buried in an old cellar on the Boorn farm .
Upon excavation of the cellar , a penknife and a button were found , both identified as Richard's .
But the " evidence " still was n't enough to charge the Boorn Brothers .
Soon after , when a barn on the Boorn farm burned to the ground , many believed it was arson to cover more evidence .
But , again , no charges were filed .
Things finally came to a head , however , when a boy discovered bones under a tree near the Boorn home .
While in custody , Jesse confessed that he and his brother had killed Richard .
But before the trial began , a closer examination of the bones revealed they were n't even human , but those of an animal .
The prosecution carried on , however , for they had the damning testimony of Silas Merrill , a forger , who was Jesse 's cellmate .
Merrill said Jesse had implicated himself , Stephen , and their father in Colvin 's murder .
His testimony mentioned the suspected locations of the crime -- the cellar , the barn , and the tree -- all fitting together in a neat little package .
For his cooperation in the case , Silas was set free .
As the evidence mounted , Stephen confessed as well , telling the same story as Silas , but without implicating his father .
The Boorn Brothers were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1819 .
Jesse 's sentence would later be commuted to life in prison , but Stephen was set to hang .
Rather than sit idly by , Stephen placed an ad in different newspapers explaining his predicament .
The ad included a description of Richard Colvin .
Amazingly , the thing worked !
Someone actually tracked Colvin down , who was alive and well in New Jersey .
The Boorn Brothers were released from prison and petitioned for compensation from the state .
But because they had both confessed to the crime , they received nothing but their freedom .
The Boorn case became the first documented wrongful murder conviction in American history .

3. She Gets Convicted
Zhang Zaiyu disappeared from Hubei Province in 1994 .
A few months later , a woman 's body was found in a lake and Zhang 's family identified it as their missing loved one .
Her husband She Zaiyu was arrested for murder .
For 10 days ,
She was reportedly denied sleep and received severe beatings until he finally confessed to the crime .
Once in court ,
She said the confession had been coerced and that he was not guilty .
He was sentenced to death in late 1994 , but four years later his sentence was reduced to 15 years because the courts felt there was n't sufficient evidence for the death penalty .
Then , in March of 2005 , Zhang Zaiyu resurfaced in Hubei .
Mrs. Zaiyu claimed to have suffered from mental illness and had wandered away from her home in 1994 .
She wound up in Shandong Province , living there and even marrying another man .
Her identity was confirmed through DNA testing and her first husband was released from prison 11 years after he had been convicted .
He then sued the government and received 700,000 yuan ( about $ 102,650 ) in compensation .
But more importantly , She 's case - and that of Teng Xingshan -- helped bring about changes to the Chinese judicial system in 2005 .
Now , capital punishment cases are the sole authority of the Supreme People 's Court , which requires more oversight and investigation before executions are carried out .
4 . The servant and the bloody shirt
On August 16 , 1660 , William Harrison left home in Campden , England , to do business in a nearby town .
When he did n't return , his servant , John Perry , went to look for him .
Perry found Harrison 's shirt covered in blood , along with his hat , which had been slashed by a knife .
Harrison , however , was nowhere to be found .
Authorities immediately suspected Perry , and likely tortured him for answers .
He confessed to a conspiracy involving himself , his mother , and his brother .
According to his statement , Perry claimed that it was his brother who had actually killed Harrison while attempting to rob him .
Despite the fact that all of Perry 's relatives proclaimed their innocence , the entire family was convicted and hanged .
Mrs. Perry , who'd also been accused of being a witch , was hanged first .
Two years later , however , William Harrison returned to England claiming that he had been abducted , taken to Turkey , and sold into slavery .
He escaped when his master died , and his return was publicly lauded .
While Perry 's trial did n't do John Perry ( or his family ) much good , it did have an impact on future cases .
John Perry 's story set a legal precedent in England - " no body , no crime " - that lasted for nearly 300 years .
5 . The professional job
In April 1987 , the dismembered body of a woman was dragged from the waters of the Mayang River in central Hunan Province .
A young woman , Shi Xiaorong , had been declared missing shortly before the body was found , so police believed she was the victim .
According to authorities , the dismemberment looked " very professional " , so local butcher Teng Xinhshan became a prime suspect .
It was speculated that Teng had sex with Shi and killed her when she tried to steal his money .
Teng claimed he had never met Shi , but was found guilty and sentenced to death anyway .
He was executed in 1989 .
Then , in 1993 , Shi Xiaorong reappeared saying that she had been tricked and sold into marriage in March 1987 .
When Teng 's relatives learned that Shi was still alive , they sued the judiciary .
After the case was reopened , Shi testified that she had never even met Teng , and that he had obviously not killed her .
Teng was posthumously exonerated in 2006 .
6. Puppy love
In 1999 , 14 - year old Natasha Ryan vanished from her Queensland home .
No body was ever found , and , after years of searching , her family presumed she was dead .
Their fears were confirmed in 2002 when incarcerated serial killer , Leonard Fraser , was secretly recorded in his jail cell confessing that Natasha was one of his many victims .
In the middle of Fraser 's 2003 trial for the murder of four women , including Natasha Ryan , the authorities received a tip that Ryan had been living with her boyfriend , Scott Black , since her disappearance .
They raided Black 's house , which was less than a half - mile away from her parents ' home , and found Natasha hiding in a wardrobe .
The charges for Natasha 's murder were dropped , though Fraser was sentenced to multiple consecutive life sentences for the other three murders .
Mental Floss : 5 celebrity kidnapping plots
As for Natasha and her boyfriend , he was sentenced to one year in prison for perjury for claiming he did n't know Natasha 's whereabouts .
He was also fined $ 3000 and had to pay $ 16,740 of the costs accrued by police while searching for Natasha .
Natasha only had to pay $ 1,000 fine for causing a false police investigation , though she sold her story to Australian tabloids for much , much more .
The two married in 2008 ; both of Natasha 's parents attended the ceremony .

All About Murder and Homicide • Capital Punishment
However , Linux gives you a much smoother transition from novice to native , with very helpful people to guide you on the way .
You do n’t even notice how much you have learned about software ( without books , and without some ridged corporate dictated curriculum ) until someone you are talking to ( not from the Linux world – usually a Windows IT guy ) says , “ You mean you modified and compiled your own software ?
You know how to program C – I could never ( read : do n’t want to ) learn how to do that …
I ’ll just stick to Windows . ”
Linux ’s learning curve starts a little higher – you really have to be able to install your own operating system and brave enough to try .
Macs have this weird , non -liner learning curve that starts very low and stays shallow for a while , but then gets “ super - steep ” – it is very difficult to be in the tech - savvy but non -pro middle ground .
On a Mac , it is easy to do the small things , but once you become a little more savvy , the Mac is harder to use and harder to learn .
First , I am a Mac user ; I am a Linux user , and I was a Linux user before I was a Mac user .
I manage two Linux servers , and I run Linux on my desktop .
For my laptop , I bought a high - end Mac almost three years ago .
At the time , I had just started using Linux regularly , and was dual - booting my desktop with XP .
I was maintaining a Linux Samba Server ( for a very small office ) , and I wanted something with Bash and X11 without running cygwin .
I wanted everything on my laptop to “ just work ” without running into the issues good laptops have had running Linux at the time .
I was suduced by iTunes and the cool ads , and I wanted to run World of Warcraft without dual booting ( in the cold , dark days when Wine did n’t work as well for games ) .
I spent $ 2000 on a laptop , and I must say I have been quite pleased … until today .
I have resolved to make ( and always make ) everyone I give “ free ” support to ( friends , family ) buy a Mac or Linux box , mostly because I do n’t want to hear the phrase , “ I think I have a Virus ” ever again !
Usually they do n’t – what they have is a lousy Windows driver .
However , if you know what you are doing , Macs Stink !
This is really true if you are into open source software , because it is almost impossible to compile someone else ’s code on a Mac , even if they wrote it for Mac .
For example , I found a bug in FreeOrion while I was playing it on my MacBook Pro .
I looked at the revision logs , and sure enough someone had fixed it .
I did n’t want to completely update to the Trunk , because I was concerned new features would add new bugs .
All I wanted to do was play the game .
I downloaded the file with the fix I wanted , and downloaded the FreeOrion source code for the version I was using .
I patched the source code with diff , and then opened it up in XCode to compile it .
10 errors .
Ok , so there are library dependencies …
It has taken me three hours to find the various dependencies online and install or compile them for mac .
After you find and install them , you have to tell XCode they exist one at a time , where they are , and make sure the version matches EXACTLY with the one the xcode maker was using when he first complied the software .
I ’m still not done with this process , and honestly do n’t know if I will ever get it working right ( or if it is worth the time ) .
Compare this to Linux .
I use Ubuntu .
A year and a half ago , I needed a feature for mod_auth_kerb ( a web - server authentication module ) that someone had posted a patch for online .
I ran apt - get source mod_auth_kerb to download the source code , patched the file , changed the version number in the deb file , and ran debuild .
errors .
Ok , so there are library dependencies …
I ran sudo apt - get build - dep mod_auth_kerb .
It installed all of the libraries for me .
Then I ran debuild again and , presto , I had new debs ( software packages ) ready to be installed with the new feature .
The whole process took about 20 minutes , ten of which was spent waiting for the computer to compile or download a dependency .
Did I mention that the Linux example above was the first time I had ever compiled a package from source to make a change ?
With a process that easy , it certainly was n’t the last .
There were instructions on how to do it online – all I had to do was intelligently follow them .
On a Mac , it is easy to do the small things , but once you become a little more savvy , the Mac is harder to use and harder to learn .
Macs have this weird , non -liner learning curve that starts very low and stays shallow for a while , but then gets “ super - steep ” – it is very difficult to be in the tech - savvy but non -pro middle ground .
Linux ’s learning curve starts a little higher – you really have to be able to install your own operating system and brave enough to try ( even though I think it was Jono Bacon who once said , “ you can stick an Ubuntu CD upside down in a 5 & 1 / 4 inch disk drive and it will install ” ) .
However , Linux gives you a much smoother transition from novice to native , with very helpful people to guide you on the way .
You do n’t even notice how much you have learned about software ( without books , and without some ridged corporate dictated curriculum ) until someone you are talking to ( not from the Linux world – usually a Windows IT guy ) says , “ You mean you modified and compiled your own software ?
You know how to program C – I could never ( read : do n’t want to ) learn how to do that …
I ’ll just stick to Windows . ”
Wait , I ’m not a programmer – I just modified someone else ’s program – it took all of twenty minutes !
I am tired of people telling me that Linux is , “ Of the programmers , by the programmers , for the programmers ” .
No it is n’t .
It also is n’t like commercial software , which is “ Of the ‘ design department ’ , by programmers , for Stupid People ” or “ of the MBAs , by the programmers , for the IT staff “ .
Linux is “ Of the User , By the User , For the User “ .
It does n’t assume you already know everything ( or anything ) – it only assumes that you are a human , and as such , you are capable of learning .
In Linux , moving from novice to expert is a natural progression , without the sharp , ridged lines that separate different types of “ Power Users ” ( IT Staff , Designer , Web Manager , Developer , Home “ Enthusiast ” ) in Windows or Mac .
This is not because you must learn all about your computer to use Linux , but because you can learn a little bit more about your operating system and use that small , little bit of new knowledge in a meaningful and useful way .
You can make changes , starting with small changes , to your Linux , no matter what your interests are .
Sooner or later , some little thing will piss you off , no matter what operating system you are using .
In Mac or Windows , you just have to live with it ( or shell out big bucks for an entirely new system or piece of software ) .
In Linux , you can ( have legal right and the tools needed ) fix it .
So you go online and read a little – maybe post your issue to a mailing list and subscribe to one to listen for a reply .
Someone sends you a command to run that solves that little issue , and you find yourself looking at a blinking cursor on a black screen for the first time ever ( or at least since you installed WINDOWS 3.1 ) .
It ’s not so bad – you start doing little things here and there when it ’s faster or more convent .
You edit a config file to add an apt repository , or pull open the smb.conf file , because you want to let your son access one set of files , from his computer , but not another set .
You start hosting a blog on your own computer and , while setting it up , learn about firewall rules .
Then you patch a simple piece of software from the command line and write your own BASH script with a for loop to do a backup a particular way , and write a macro in OpenOffice .
You start answering more questions than you ask on the mailing lists , and people start admiring your whatever - fu .
Family members ( parents , aunts , cousins ) start asking you all sorts of computer questions , many dealing with Windows , and you start answering them because you actually do know – not the particular Windows issue , but the networking / hardware / software principal behind the problem .
Then someone says to you , that inevitably fateful day , “ Linux is fine for someone like you , but I ’m not a programmer . ”
Someone like me ?
The first time I touched Linux was in college … as a Political Science major .
A Libertarian friend of mine introduced me to it ( we did an internet radio show – he was the “ techie ” ) .
I got my MA in Economics , and fell into IT as a graduate student job : my landlord ’s IT guy quit while I was in the office paying my rent , and I said , “ you know , you can do that with Linux ” .
The thing I hate about Mac and Windows is that they think you are stupid , or pigeonhole you into a “ marketing category ” which they then create and sell software to .
That is why there is no “ easy ” way to patch and build software in Mac ( or Windows ) .
“ Why would you want to ? ” they ask , “ What is the market for that ? ”
Linux makes it easy to grow , because that is what people do when you do n’t actively seek to stop them from growing .
In Linux , there are wonderful tools that make it easy to fix “ that first nagging problem ” , and a huge community that is willing to give if you are willing to learn and try a little .
Users do n’t start fixing things because they “ have to ” , bugs get fixed and features added in Linux by other people all the time , so just like in Windows and Mac , and you are free to just sit and wait a little .
Users start fixing / tweaking things in Linux because they can !
I think all users of any system would prefer to fix at least one little thing themselves rather than submit a feature request / bug report ( if they can / know how ) and wait for someone else to fix it for them .
In Linux , the user can .
Windows is a little better than Mac in this respect .
Apple goes to the community and shouts , “ Hey look , we are based on an Open Source kernel – want to see Darwin ? ”
That does n’t help anyone , especially someone that is n’t already an advanced programmer interested in kernel design .
Windows at least has the tools to write your own macros in MS Office , where you can start out , and then move to the free and easy to use Visual Basic Express when you want to write your first big Application .
That natural path is only there for advanced Excel users , because they are the only people who start wanting to write macros in VBA for that “ something that pisses them off ” .
The path is narrow and not very smooth , with people jumping off when the next step is “ too big ” and outsourcing their desire to the corporate VBA department .
And there is a big hump from messing with a VBA macro to writing an application from scratch in VB .
NET .
Game modding can be another road for teens running Windows , but that knowledge is focused on interface design .
Some games have Python , and that knowledge can progress , but it grows only in one direction – to programming , and not to a general knowledge of Windows , or networking , or operating systems .
( Windows also has so many problems that someone in the family or office will start digging around in the registry when something is n’t working – the law of large numbers guarantees at least some progression into “ Power Users ” , simply because the printer is n’t working from that computer . )
Windows used to be better – around version 3.1 . DOS came with QBASIC , and there were lots of apps you could modify and play with ( anyone make the banana explosion bigger in the gorilla program ? ) .
You could also modify the autoexec.
bat file and graduate to writing your own batch files to do things .
But I was the last year of that generation , and today I turn thirty .
When Windows95 started coming pre-installed on every PC , those that grew up with QBASIC and batch were there to program for it , but there were no new generations of natural tinkerers becoming programmers and IT architects to replace them .
The new generation came up on Windows9X , and they do n’t know squat outside of what is taught in their MIS classes .
Microsoft recognizes the need for “ natural new blood ” , and they have responded with free developer tools .
But they still do n’t have a reason for a user to cross into a little programming , or networking , or system design .
Mac does n’t have that at all ( the programming bit , not the problems bit , though both apply ) .
Even though they come with a free compiler , BASH , X11 , and XCode , all of these things are buried in the “ Utilities ” section , and there are n’t any little programs to play with that jump out at you .
They do n’t get it , and they never will .
They are firmly convinced , as a company and culture , that “ we know what ’s best for the customer and we always will ” .
And , to their credit , they have made a ton of money with that attitude .
But the programmers going to Mac are doing it for one reason – money .
People learn XCode when they get ( or are expecting to get ) paid to do it .
Mac programmers learn from Linux or Windows .
And there it is – the Mac tools are hostile to new users and discourage them from ever becoming something more .
Linux is inviting to intelligent people , offering smooth movement up the knowledge ladder with marginal increases that people take because they want to do some small little thing – they want fix something , and they can .
Linux is a lifelong learning journey which you can take at your own speed , choose your own path , and rest when you want to .
And , there are always friendly fellow travelers – people who have been there before and are willing to point you in the right direction .
So tell your mom to get a Mac ( so you do n’t have to fix it all the time , and she can have her iTunes ) , but buy your daughter a Linux machine , and let her learn and love the learning .
Several news sources are now reporting the name of the suspect in the murder of Dr. George Tiller .
According to KWCH-TV :
Deputy Chief Tom Stolz w/ Wichita Police Dept. says Dr. Tiller died of a single gunshot wound .
The Associated Press says the man detained in the Kansas City area is 51 - year - old Scott Roeder of Merriam , Kansas , according to Law Enforcement authorities in the area .
Roeder has not been formally charged with the killing at this time .
Police say he was arrested without incident after a traffic stop .
Via diarist FreeStateDem , Militia Watchdog previously reported of Roeder :
July 7 , [ 1997 ] , Kansas : Scott Roeder is sentenced to sixteen months in state prison for parole violations following a 1996 conviction for having bomb components in his car trunk .
Roeder , a sovereign citizen and tax protester , violated his parole by not filing tax returns or providing his social security number to his employer .
He was also an active member of Operation Rescue ; in 2007 a " Scott Roeder " posted this on the Operation Rescue website ( which has been down throughout the day , probably more as a result of increased traffic than any sense of collective shame ) :
[ May 19th , 2007 at 4:34 pm ]
Bleass everyone for attending and praying in May to bring justice to Tiller and the closing of his death camp .
Sometime soon , would it be feasible to organize as many people as possible to attend Tillers church ( inside , not just outside ) to have much more of a presence and possibly ask questions of the Pastor , Deacons , Elders and members while there ?
Does n’t seem like it would hurt anything but bring more attention to Tiller .
The Lawrence Journal - World and News relays that Kansas City station KMBC reported a post - it note with a phone number for Operation Rescue in his car at the time of his arrest .
So a bombmaker , tax protester , member of the " sovereignity " movement , anti-abortion zealot and Operation Rescue member : the arrested suspect manages to fit every stereotype of right - wing militia teabagger .
No doubt much more information will be forthcoming later ; Roeder is not expected to be formally charged until Monday .
There will be a candlelight vigil honoring Dr. George Tiller in Wichita at 8:00 pm in Old Town Square .
[ UPDATE by Dana Houle ]
Kossacks have dug out a few more bits of information about Scott Roeder :
NoiseWithdrawal found an article about his 1996 , when he was linked to the Montana Freemen :
A man identified by the FBI as a member of the anti-government Freemen group was arrested yesterday after deputies found what they called a bomb - triggering device in his car .
Scott Roeder , 38 , of Silver Lake , Kan. , was arrested in Topeka and held on charges of criminal use of explosives , driving with a suspended license and failure to carry registration and insurance .
Roeder was stopped because his car did n't have a legitimate license plate .
Instead , it had a tag indicating the driver was a " sovereign " citizen and immune from Kansas law .
The same type of tag is sometimes used by Freemen , whose members in Montana are in the fourth week of a standoff with federal agents .
Roeder 's name is included on an FBI list of Freemen , said Shawnee County Sheriff Dave Meneley .
In Roeder 's trunk , authorities found fuse cord , a pound of gunpowder and two nine - volt batteries , one wired to a switch - the alleged triggering device .
Ammunition and a blasting cap also were found in the car .
And via Twitter from twitter.com / problemchylde and twitter.com / TeresaKopec , on an Operation Rescue website called Charge Tiller ( which in the last 30 minutes or so has been taken down ) , there 's this comment , posted on Monday , September 3 , 2007 , by a Scott Roeder from Kansas , almost certainly the same Scott Roeder alleged to have assassinated Tiller :
It seems as though what is happening in Kansas could be compared to the " lawlessness " which is spoken of in the Bible .
Tiller is the concentration camp " Mengele " of our day and needs to be stopped before he and those who protect him bring judgement upon our nation .
It appears that Roeder decided the he could n't wait for God to pass judgment , so he assassinated Tiller himself .
following up on P ’s recent post about privatizing sewage …
I live near Detroit , so this year has been a doozy .
Not only is Detroit ( and all of SE Michigan ) hit hard by unemployment , foreclosure , restructuring of the automobile industry and long - standing poverty , neglect and racism , but it also recently lost its mayor Kwame Kilpatrick , and city council woman Monica Conyers , both of them because of corruption .
Beyond the blight , Detroit is dealing with regime change , corruption and political instability .
Conyers ’ mistake was taking bribes from the Synagro corporation , the nation ’s largest waste disposal company , who wanted a 25 - year , $ 1 billion contract for handling Detroit ’s municipal sewage .
In what the local media have taken to calling the “ sludge scandal ” ( – go ahead , google it ) , Synagro tried to recruit allies on the Detroit city council through bribery .
Conyers is the only one so far who has copped to bribery charges , but the palm - greasing probably also included a 2003 junket to Hawaii to see a boxing match with Kwame Kilpatrick ( for more , see this story in Detroit Business Magazine Crain’s ) .
Watching the shit hit the fan in Michigan has been sobering .
But its also sobering to learn that Synagro has been greasing politicians ’ palms since 1992 , and has spiraled downwards into a mire of sludge and PR which threatens government and corporate transparency , health and safety , the environment , our food supply , and effective environmental regulation .
The Backstory :
1988 ’s Ocean Dumping
Act made New York City ’s previous waste disposal proceedure ( dumping into the Atlantic ) illegal and obsolete .
By 1993 , the city had set up the world ’s largest solid waste recycling program , the New York Organic Fertilizer Co. , owned and operated by Synagro .
Here the relevant palm to grease was Alfonse D’Amato’s .
The NYOFC produces Class A organic fertilizer – carefully sanitized with heat to kill microorganisms .
But even this highest grade of treated sludge in the land may contain undocumented levels of plastics , heavy metals and other industrial residues – not very well regulated by the EPA , freshly excoriated by the Bush Administration ( see “ Sludge and Scandal , ” 2004 ) .
In 2000 , the Houston Business Journal noted that Synagro became one of the world ’s largest waste management corporations .
The SEC ’s disclosure of all Synagro ’s subsidiaries is pretty sobering .
This Texas company now has subsidiaries in Delaware , Maryland , Connecticut , New York , Rhode Island , California , Michigan , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Arkansas , Florida , North Carolina , Arizona , Canada and Iraq .
Everywhere Synagro goes , there is trouble from the locals .
In 1992 , communities in Oklahoma and Alabama organized to reject New York City waste being used as fertilizer in their regions .
As Joel Bliefuss wrote in his truly muckraking piece , “ The Sludge Hits the Fan ” :
In 1992 , the Water Environment Federation , describing itself as a “ not - for - profit technical and educational organization ” whose “ mission is to preserve and enhance the global water environment , ” received a $ 300,000 grant from the EPA to “ educate the public ” about the “ beneficial uses ” of sludge .
“ The campaign will tie in with the Federation ’s ongoing efforts to promote use of the term `biosolids , ’ ” reported the Federation ’s December 1992 newsletter .
“ Beneficial use ” is the industry euphemism for the practice of spreading sludge on farm fields .
Even before the current push , sludge has been applied to soil for decades .
Milwaukee ’s sewage sludge has been dried and sold nationally for almost 70 years as “ Milorganite , ” a lawn and garden fertilizer .
In 1982 , the state of Maryland banned Milorganite after it was found to contain high levels of cadmium , a heavy metal .
In recent years , other cities have followed Milwaukee ’s example offering varieties such as “ Nu - Earth ” from Chicago , “ Nitrohumus ” from Los Angeles , and “ Hou - actinite ” from Houston .
Milorganite and other commercially - marketed sludge products usually carry labels warning that they should not be applied on food - producing soil .
But most consumers and journalists are unaware that tens of thousands of acres , from Midwest dairy land to Florida citrus groves and California fruit orchards , are already routinely “ fertilized ” with byproducts of industrial and human sewage .
In theory , this approach harkens back to the time - honored natural system of composting .
Of course , the organic farmers of previous centuries did n’t have to worry that their “ night soil ” contained a synergistic soup of dioxins , asbestos , DDT and lead that could contaminate themselves , their groundwater , and their food .
It is , in other words , quite a difficult situation .
Under cover of producing environmentally responsible recycled waste ( a rather progressive , sophisticated organic composting program ) , Synagro helps cities and companies produce waste which is actually a mix of human waste , food waste , garbage , and industrial waste – whatever goes into the sewer .
As Bleifuss points out , “ The environmentally sound approach would have been to develop separate treatment systems for human and industrial waste ” Yeah … but we did n’t do that .
And so he highlights the non-organic , non-fertilizing parts of sludge for his readers :
Polychlorinated Biphenyls ( PCBs ) ;
Chlorinated pesticides — DDT , dieldrin , aldrin , endrin , chlordane , heptachlor , lindane , mirex , kepone , 2,4,5-T , 2,4-D ;
Chlorinated compounds such as dioxins ;
Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons ;
Heavy metals — arsenic , cadmium , chromium , lead , mercury ;
Bacteria , viruses , protozoa , parasitic worms , fungi ; and
Miscellaneous — asbestos , petroleum products , industrial solvents .
Do you want these in your food ?
I do n’t .
Do they maybe help account for all the cases of e-coli in packaged produce recently ?
Could be .
In 2002 , Synagro acquired Earthwise Organics and Earthwise Trucking , which most likely use Class A organic fertilizer like the stuff produced in New York City .
So should we trust that what we ’re getting from Earthwise Organics is really and purely organic ?
Since the 1990s , communities in the Bronx have been organizing to protest the hazards and stench of the New York operation .
In 2002 Synagro settled out of court with the family of Shayne Conner , a New Hampshire man who died in his sleep a month after the spread of such fertilizer on a neighboring field .
In Riverside County , Calif. , a Synagro plant closed Dec. 31 , 2008 after years of complaints about what residents called headache - inducing , property - value - sucking smells , about 50 miles southwest of downtown LA .
In the Bush era , as the EPA eased up on regulation , Synagro captured a larger and larger share of national and international waste management markets .
More and more businesses and municipalities contributed their waste .
This waste was then quietly spirited away by Synagro .
Synagro not only turns waste into fertilizer ( a great idea ) , but also turns fertilizer into a hiding place for many mysterious industrial residues ( a diabolical idea ) .
In 2007 , Synagro was bought out by the giant holding company The Carlyle Group .
Carlyle , it seems , recognized Synagro ’s power to dispose of waste and keep it quiet at the same time .
The buyout , they announced , would be accompanied by making Synagro a private company .
In Dec. 2007 SEIU protested , challenging Carlyle to disclose information about potential health hazards of using treated sludge to fertilize crops ( SEIU Press Release ) .
SEIU convincingly argued that taking the company private would be an excuse for tight - lipped Cheney - esque non-disclosure .
They worried that the terrible secrets in sludge might never be revealed .
Because the EPA and Synagro are n’t too concerned about whether treated sludge is safe , very justified public outcry has set back the long - term prospects of convincing Americans of the safety of organic waste recycling .
The public is scared of sludge now , and with good reason – but they should not fear eating food fertilized by their own waste .
The key for everyone ’s own food safety is to know the difference between Class B and Class A Fertilizers , and to know the difference between organic and conventional produce .
As Bliefuss wrote ,
Currently , “ certified organic ” farmers are prohibited from using sludge on their crops , but the sludge industry is pushing for acceptance by organic farming organizations , and this will be a battleground for industry PR in the future .
The amount of farm acreage dedicated to organic farming is currently very small .
However , said Brian Baker of California Certified Organic Farmers , “ imagine what great PR it would be for the sewage sludge promoters to say that sludge is so clean it can even be certified organic — what a way to `greenwash ’ sewage sludge ! ”
And there you have it !
Greenwashing : the insidious PR move of hiding potential environmental waste under the mantle of organic sustainability .
Synagro helps us see all of the different things that can be privatized : it privatized its annual statements in 2007 , it privatized the waste disposal business , on the vanguard of de-regulation , it privatized waste itself , it privatized information or knowledge about the chemical contents of that waste .
Almost anything can be commodified and privatized – invent a new market out of thin air and someone will usually enclose it , quick .
Worst of all , the poorest people are usually the ones who suffer , albeit in various ways .
In the Bronx , the poorest New Yorkers are afflicted with stench and mysterious questions about heath and safety .
In south - west Detroit , the people are afflicted by the incinerators that Synagro would have replaced , had the dirty contract with the city gone through .
In New York , the people suffer because Synagro is “ working hard ” ( whatever that means ) , while in Detroit , they suffer because Synagro is “ hardly working . ”

One of the key reasons to choose a rapid development philosophy over a waterfall development philosophy is the ability to adapt to changing requirements .
Once you decide to go with some form of rapid development – which should you choose ?
It seems like there are as many options as there are companies utilizing them .
There is no one correct answer .
My advice is to pick and choose what works best for your development team , your product , your customers , and your company .
In addition to adopting a development philosophy that allows rapid change in requirements of your software – be prepared to rapidly change the process itself .
Our process has changed dramatically over my years at Lanit due to new people , new priorities , new technologies , and new tools .
At Lanit , we are currently using a form of Agile software development .
We have very few rigid processes that the design / development team must follow – instead we have a toolbox from which we grab the appropriate tool from in any situation .
Below I will give an overview of a lot of things we do here .
Hopefully some of the things we do will be useful for you / your team .
Planning
Some agile shops will say that you should avoid all planning .
I do n’t think that scales well to complicated problems ( and , I do n’t really believe they do n’t plan – they just have shorter term plans or personal plans ) .
We plan at Lanit – we are just ready for our plans to change at any time .
And , we are careful to scope our plans appropriately – longer term plans are more vague , shorter term plans get more specific .
Vision statements
Vision statements are simple , vague , big picture plans which are useful to guide the smaller picture plans later .
Be careful not to get too detailed so that it ’s easy to adapt .
Company / Strategic planning – Lanit has a vague mission statement that pertains to everything we do , and helps guide our smaller plans .
Basically , we want to write software that improves people ’s lives in a meaningful way .
Product planning – Each product sets forth its own broad goals .
For Foliotek , we want to make the accreditation process easy for schools by providing sensible , clean , and easy to use portfolio software .
We focus on making the portfolio process as simple as possible for students and faculty to ease the burden that adding a portfolio culture to a school can create .
Release planning – Often times , we have a common goal ( or a few goals ) that helps us decide on feature sets for each release we do .
Recently , we ’ve had releases that focused on making the system more maintainable by adopting some newly available frameworks throughout a project .
An upcoming release will focus on adding more interactivity to the system through the use of more client scripting and ajax .
Releases and Feature evaluation
For existing products at Lanit , we develop in 8 week cycles .
If anything takes longer than that to get from idea to release , then we run the same risks of the waterfall model – we either build something that is to late to market ( the market changes between when we plan and when we release ) .
Or , we waste a bunch of effort because we got the plan wrong to begin with , and spent months developing the wrong thing .
As with all rapid development philosophies – the point is to find out as soon as possible when you make a mistake and change course immediately .
Even inside of the 8 week cycle , you ’ll see we allow customers to see and comment on complicated designs sooner .
For existing products – we keep feature wishlists that eventually evolve into planned feature sets for a particular release .
We use FogBugz ( http://fogbugz.com) to store the wishlists , and items move to different projects ( new ideas -> for development ) and releases ( undecided release -> Summer 01 2009 ) as we evaluate the lists .
Keep an ongoing wishlist from customers ( help them succeed with how they want to use the product )
from business team ( help sell the product to new customers )
from support team ( spot trouble spots , ease support burden )
from development team ( more maintainable code , or newer and better technologies )
Shortly before starting to develop a release ( at most a week , so that you have the best possible information ) , pull the most valuable ideas into a release wishlist usually , stakeholders from support / business / dev make a ‘ top ten ’ type list , then combine them to create an initial release list
this is also a good time to completely eliminate ideas from the wishlist that are no longer valid Dev team comes up with very rough estimates to develop ideas Dev , support , and marketing ranks the wishlist based on cost / benefit type analysis ( usually , in a meeting .
also a good time to describe and document the needs of each feature better ) .
Often , the idea is refined or simplified based on discussions in this meeting .
We always try to build the simplest useful version of a feature possible , and only add complexity after people have tried the simple version and more is still needed .
Narrow down the release to a reasonable list based on available time and estimates Dev team works on the list in order of priority – Everyone knows that the bottom items may drop into the next release based on changing circumstances and priorities .
This also allows for new items to be injected at the cost of items at the bottom , and allows more time to think about the expensive , less well defined items that should be further down the list .
Designing / Developing Features
The rest of the work is taking the requested feature and taking it to implementation .
This process has the most variability – some features are small and easily understood , a text description is enough to develop it .
Some features are more detailed or important and require more elaborate designs .
The most expensive features to implement should be discussed with customers at early stages to prevent wasted effort .
So , we never mandate that each feature must go through these steps – the dev team is allowed to determine which tasks are appropriate for the item they are working on .
Feature descriptions – pretty much every feature idea has at least a sentence in FogBugz describing it .
Typically , links to current screens are included ( for “ change ” type requests ) to get everyone on the same page .
Often , the descriptions are detailed during the release feature set prioritization meeting .
Paper sketches – if the feature has a small amount of sophistication , it often useful for the developer to do a rough paper sketch for their own benefit .
This could be a UI sketch , a db model , a flow diagram , etc .
Informal discussion – sometimes , a brief chat about the feature is all that is necessary .
Face - to - Face can be a double edged sword – they can be very powerful for the person that needs help , and very distracting for the other party .
We use yammer ( http://yammer.com) for these kinds of communications so that each person can decide their level of interruptibility ( each user can decide to have an IM - like client open , to get email notifcations , to get daily email digests , etc – and can customize those options based on subject ) .
Many times , we still talk face to face – but we initiate conversations using yammer instead of physically disrupting the other person .
Plain ‘ol Whiteboards ( POWs ) – Sometimes , features are too hard to describe .
Others , the business team only has a need ( this is too slow / complicated ) but does n’t have a clue how it should be solved .
In these cases , it ’s useful to collaboratively sketch ideas at a whiteboard .
POWs can become real , permanent documentation !
We use a few handy tools in combo to make this happen : A digital camera An Eye - Fi ( http://www.eye.fi/) wireless SD card – gets pictures to us without the hassle of a card reader EverNote ( http://www.evernote.com) – archives whiteboard photos .
Allows easily retrieval through tags , and even can OCR / search some handwritten text in a pic .
Integrates with Eye - Fi – so you get a new note with each pic without any hassle .
Synchs across all popular computers and smartphones .
Whiteboard Photo ( http://www.polyvision.com/ProductSolutions/WhiteboardPhotoSoftware/tabid/284/Default.aspx) – software package that takes a photo of a whiteboard and cleans it up a ton – picture ends up looking like it was sketched in paint .
Allows copy - paste – so you can click the photo in evernote , ctrl-c , click whiteboard photo , ctrl-v , clean , and repeat in opposite direction .
Comps – sometimes , the detail needed is aesthetic .
In those cases , someone is commissioned to a more refined Photoshop or Fireworks comp ( often based on a sketch ) .
Paper or digital sketch “ prototypes ” – Sometimes , the feature / ui itself is complicated .
In these cases its useful to get feedback from inside the team and from customers before you write a bunch of code .
Most of the time , you can get the info you need by walking the customer through sketches – either by explaining a flipping through a succession of paper sketches , or by building digital sketches in Fireworks – which can be linked together and allow clicking between screens .
This is a good low cost way to get something that feels a lot like a programmed prototype .
Coded prototype / betas –
When a feature is very interactive , or is highly data driven , etc – sometimes you need something real to evaluate the design .
In those cases we build out the feature as small as possible and release it to a carefully chosen set of customers ( or ourselves ) for “ real ” use – and we tweak it before we release to everyone .
Testing and Maintanance
After the dev team believes it is done , the release is pushed to a testing area .
The main contact for each new feature request is responsible for testing it to make sure that it works properly and fills the intended need .
We usually spend about a week going back and forth with the support / sales teams until everyone is satisfied with the release .
Then , it goes out to our customers .
We ’re not perfect .
Sometimes , bugs get out to the live environment .
For the highest priority issues , the support team can interrupt new development and get an immediate resolution .
Doing this for every trivial issue would severely hamper new development , so we limit these cases to a small number per year .
For all other issues , we have a weekly patch schedule .
Support reports problems ( to another area in FogBugz ) , and we fix throughout the week .
On Mondays , we send the set of fixes all out at once .
To keep the developers sane , we rotate the developer responsible for writing fixes each week .
This schedule allows the dev team to stay focused on making the product better – but also allows the support team to be responsive about issues in the system .
Customers are more accepting of problems when we can tell them when it will be fixed .
“ Green Field ” development
So far , I ’ve focused on how we develop changes and additions for our existing products .
Many of these techniques are also useful for developing brand new products .
Planning new projects can often be more complicated , though , and features are n’t as well understood to begin with .
Many more decisions need to be made .
Brainstorming sessions – Early on , the idea is very vague .
The quickest way to narrow it down into a plan is to get people into a room and come up with ideas .
Be sure to involve potential customers .
We ’ve been very successful by developing “ advisory boards ” of people who are in your market – and allowing them to help brainstorm and design the product .
When they are done , not only does your product fit the market better – but you end up with a group of devoted customers right off the bat since they feel some ownership of the product .
Multi disciplinary team design sessions – IDEO developed a method where you take a problem , and design separate solutions in several small groups of about three or four .
Then , you come back and evaluate as a group and combine the ideas into one solution .
This can be very useful for developing a feature set for a new product .
For best results , each team should have a tech person , a business person , a support person , etc .
User Studies –
The best way to get all of the little details right is to sit down with a real user and watch them try to use your new product .
You do n’t need expensive equipment – just sit down and watch , and take notes or record with a webcam .
You do n’t need a completely functioning system – you can ( and should ) walk users through paper sketches ( what would you click on here – ok , now you see this ) and later have them use sketch prototypes ( click through – ok that would be added here when its a real system ) .
If the system is really interactive , build a simple html / js prototype .
You also do n’t need scientific population samples – any 3 - 5 people you grab ( your spouse , neighbors , friends … ) will catch all of your really important usability problems .
( Updates with a new re-direct for flight447.com , extension of the domain ownership for another 9 years , and the removal of an eBay listing for AirFranceLawSuit.com )
As investigators seek to unravel the fate of Air France flight 447 , there 's been speculation online about an unusual domain name registration made some two years prior to this week 's plane crash , flight447.com .
The mystery of the Air France flight that disappeared this week deepened after news agencies on Wednesday confirmed a previous Air France flight from Buenos Aires to Paris was the target of a bomb threat just days before .
That plane was inspected and arrived without incident .
Now it has emerged that someone registered a domain for the missing plane 's flight number on September 30 , 2007 .
It 's not unusual for individuals to register domain names shortly after news breaks on a big story and then to sell them .
Indeed , a second domain AirFrance447.com was registered the day of the crash , hours after the news made headlines , and a third domain AirFranceLawSuit.com is being auctioned on eBay this week after being registered the day after the crash .
The timing of the two - year - old flight447.com , however , makes it unusual .
The domain which currently points to a search engine currently redirects to karimmovies.com , a site promoting an Israeli - Palestinian love story called David and Fatima about an Israeli soldier 's relationship with a Palestinian Muslim girl .
Both domains are owned by Kari Bian , an Iranian film producer based in the United States .
He 's also listed as executive producer for Secrets of Life , a movie starring Tony Curtis , Vivica Fox , Jon Lovitz and Cheech Marin , and a semi-autobiographical tale called The Iron Man , which is unrelated to the Robert Downey Jr. film and is loosely based on Bian 's life .
When contacted , Bian said that the connection between his registration and the crash is coincidental .
" It 's just an accident ( that there 's a connection ) , " he said .
" I have nothing to do with anything .
I feel really bad for that flight . "
The cause of the crash is still unknown .
Bian also owns a small side business registering domains called Thriftys .
Bian says he buys domain names and owns about 500 of them , which include the names of numerous airline flight numbers as well as the names of cars , flowers , businesses and songs .
He says he created the flight number domains with a program .
" I just put ' flight ' in front of 1 through 1,000 and I register them , " he explained .
He says he did n't buy the flight domains for any particular reason and has no intention of selling flight 447.com now .
" I 'm very busy with my work and my career , " he says .
" I 'm not waiting for a flight to crash so I can go sell it .
I'm a professional businessman and I make movies and it happens that I own this domain name . "
The flight447.com domain , registered to Bian 's company Success Incorporated in Malibu , California , was set to expire on September 30 this year .
But on Wednesday , according to the WhoIs database , ownership was extended until 2018 after Threat Level interviewed Bian .
Another domain related to the Air France flight — AirFranceLawSuit.com — that is up for sale on eBay was registered the day after the crash to Hoda Elkassem .
Elkassem , who lives in the U.S. but is in Kuwait temporarily where her husband is teaching art , responded to an e-mail inquiry from Threat Level .
She 's a pharmacist and the author of two children 's books , Ruqayyah Makes Her Wudhu ' According to the Sunnah of the Prophet and Abdur - Rahman Makes His Wudhu ' : According to the Sunnah of the Prophet as well as an e-book on buying a home without paying interest .
She said she took a break from her pharmaceutical work four and a half years ago to be at home with her children and decided to buy and sell domains " since it is easy and does not require leaving my children . "
She 's given some away for good causes and sold others for as little as 99 cents and as much as $ 1,000 .
She often purchases expired domains or ones with catchy titles .
She bought the Air France domain because she flies frequently over the Atlantic often and could n't stop thinking about the families of the crash victims .
" To not know the fate of your loved ones in my opinion is the worst torture , " she wrote .
Generally she does n't see much action on her eBay listings until the end of the auction , and there are currently no bids on the Air France auction , but she says this one has received a lot more hits than usual and has a number of watchers — people who sign in to eBay to watch the progress of a specific auction .
In the eBay auction listing she wrote :
It is my hope , God Willing , that a group of qualified Attorneys will want to set up this website in order open communication between the 228 families involved and to ensure they get what they deserve for having to go through such unnecessary grief .
Airplanes are built with state of the art technology allowing air traffic controllers to know the whereabouts of all airplanes at all times .
Communication should not have been lost and the family members of the victims should have known the fate of their loved ones immediately .
Elkassem removed the eBay listing after publication of this post ( see her comment below ) .

The Jimi Hendrix Experience – Purple Haze – My Beat ClubAnother great live performance from the legendary Marquee Club in Swinging London !
The Jimi Hendrix Experience performs “ Purple Haze ” , one of his signature songs , exclusively for German television .
Hendrix said that the title of the song was inspired by a phrase ( “ purplish haze ” ) from the science fiction novel “ The Night of Light ” by Philip José Farmer .
But also the music of the song is famous .
Today , the extended dominant guitar chord of the track is also known as “ The Hendrix chord ” .
With this technique Hendrix helped to establish the use of chords in popular music .

Guy builds motorcycle with side - car
Because motorcycle sidecars are meant to be motorcycle sidecars .
François Knorreck , a gentleman from France , has taken motorcycle sidecars ten notches higher with the Snaefell , a Kawasaki - type motorcycle with a Citroën Xantia car as its , well , sidecar .
Yes , like a car on the side .
Literally .
Knorreck , an avid motorcycle buff , reportedly spent ten years , or an equivalent of 10,000 hours , along with approximately 15,000 euros to finish his masterpiece .
The bike and car were assembled from custom parts of other vehicles , and handcrafted by Knorreck himself .
The sidecar can seat two people , and the motorbike - sidecar tandem is fully operable .
As the recession batters city budgets around the U.S. , some municipalities are considering the once - unthinkable option of dissolving themselves through " disincorporation . "
Benefits of this move vary from state to state .
In some cases , dissolution allows residents to escape local taxes .
In others , it saves the cost of local salaries and pensions .
And residents may get services more cheaply after consolidating with a county .

Pastrami is one of the most popular preserved meats .
Pastrami is preserved in much the way that meat has been for thousands of years : in a salt mixture to prevent bacteria from growing .
The great thing about pastrami is that it , like ham , it also tastes great smoked .
Pastrami starts with corned beef ( salted beef with spices ) and is then smoked to add flavor and aid in preservation .
Get the Right Cut of Meat
The basic method for making pastrami from scratch is to start with a mostly trimmed beef brisket .
If you buy a trimmed brisket at the store or from your local butcher , it will have no layer of fat on it .
For the best results , it is best to have a very thin layer of fat on your brisket to make pastrami — about 1/4 inch .
This means separating the flat and the point .
For those who do n't have a lot of experience with brisket , a whole brisket is actually two pieces of meat separated by a thick layer of fat that is referred to as the flat and the point .
Corn the Beef
From this point , you need to corn the beef .
This is done in several different ways .
The easiest and safest , in my opinion , is to use a brine .
The salt - water brine preserves the meat and gives it the texture that we would call corned beef .
The basic brine consists of water , enough salt to float an egg , and seasonings like black pepper , coriander , juniper berries , and garlic , among others .
People who make their own pastrami usually end up with a recipe unique to them .
The beef brisket should remain in the brine and be stored in a cold , dark place for anywhere from seven days to three weeks .
You do need to regularly check on the meat and turn it to prevent spoilage .
No Smokehouse ?
No Problem
Once you have corned beef you need to rinse off the meat .
If you have brined it for a long period of time ( a week or more ) , you might want to soak it overnight in fresh water to lift out some of the salt .
Now , apply a rub and place it in a smoker .
The old - fashioned way of preparing pastrami is to cold smoke it .
This will give it a more pastrami - like texture , but not that many people have the smokehouse to do this .
A modern , " hot " smoker will do the trick .
Smoke your brisket for about 45 minutes to an hour per pound .
Keep this part in mind when selecting a brisket .
A 10 - pound brisket can take 10 hours to smoke .
Once the meat has reached an internal temperature of 165 F ( 75 C ) , it is done .
You do not need to smoke pastrami as long as you would a regular brisket .
The long brining time will make the meat tender .
Safety Precautions
Homemade pastrami is one of those things you need to be careful with .
Because you cure the meat for a long period of time , the risk of spoilage is high compared with other smoked foods .
Make absolutely certain that everything that comes in contact with the meat — including your hands and other utensils — is very clean .
Make careful observations of the meat during the whole process , and make sure that every inch of the meat reaches 165 F ( 75 C ) before you remove it from the smoker .
Pastrami is kind of a hobby , so experiment to find out what works best for you .
We guarantee that once you 've found your method , you 'll never return to store - bought pastrami again .
NKorea missile train on the move : report
SEOUL , June 17 ( AFP ) Jun 17 , 2009
A special North Korean train that last month took a long - range missile to a west coast launch site has recently made a journey to another launch site on the east coast , a report said Wednesday .
South Korea and the United States are wondering whether Pyongyang intends simultaneous launches from both sites or whether the train 's latest journey is just a smokescreen to confuse watchers , Seoul 's Chosun Ilbo newspaper said .
The paper said the train was used in May to transport a missile to a newly - completed site at Dongchang - ri on the northwest coast .
It said the train was also recently spotted travelling from a missile research centre in Pyongyang to Musudan - ri on the east coast , which the North used for its three previous long - range missile launches .
The paper quoted a South Korean government source for its information .
The National Intelligence Service declined comment on what it called intelligence matters .
On Tuesday Chosun said the North has installed a launch structure and completed a hangar at Dongchang - ri .
But it said no radar has yet been set up and no missile has been brought to the launch pad itself , meaning a launch is not imminent .
The North on April 5 staged what it called a satellite launch from Musudan - ri , using a Taepodong - 2 rocket theoretically capable of reaching Alaska .
The US and its allies said the launch was a disguised missile test and the UN Security Council condemned the operation .
The North vowed to conduct more nuclear and missile tests unless the UN apologised , and went ahead with its second atomic test on May 25 .
US and South Korean officials have said it may be preparing another ballistic missile test .
And US intelligence officials have been quoted as saying it may also stage a third nuclear test .
Chosun said Pyongyang appears to have three to four intercontinental ballistic missiles , and may be keeping one or two of them at the research centre in the capital .
MK Michael Ben - Ari calls for Jews to march in Israeli - Arab cities in response to the parade of homosexuals scheduled for Thursday in Jerusalem .
MK Michael Ben- Ari ( National Union ) has called for Jews to march in Israeli - Arab cities in response to the homosexual parade scheduled for this Thursday in Jerusalem .
The so - called gay pride parade in Jerusalem has become an annual source of controversy in the summer in Israel .
Homosexuals claim the right to march freely in Israel 's capital , whereas many people believe the holy city is not the proper venue for such a demonstration .
Ben -Ari this year has proposed a new way to protest the parade , and says that in addition to traditional demonstrations , Jews should object by exercising their right to demonstrate in Arab - Israeli cities throughout the country .
“ There must be one law for everyone , ” Ben - Ari said .
“ The right to march can not be just for left - wing radicals .
It is our right to march , to document illegal construction in Arab cities and to parade with Israeli flags . ”
Ben -Ari’s parliamentary assistants , Itamar Ben-Gvir and Baruch Marzel , spearheaded an initiative to hold an Israeli flag - waving march in the Israeli - Arab city Umm el - Fahm earlier in the year .
The Supreme Court ordered the police on two separate occasions to allow the controversial march to take place .
The activists eventually marched in Umm el - Fahm with a limit of 50 participants on the edge of the city .
They say that now they have set their sights on similar marches in Israeli - Arab cities Taibe , Kfar Lakiya , Nazareth , Abu Rukik , Abu Isa , Irara , Baka el - Arabiya , and Musraifa .
“ The Supreme Court justices have emphasized that with regard to the gay pride parade , the marchers should not pass through the middle of the city in order to balance the interests of the parties , ” the activists said .
“ This year , the police have taken the unprecedented step of allowing the parade to take place in the center of the city , ” they pointed out .
“ We will use this precedent to call for our marches to take place in the center of Arab cities , ” the activists promised .
Faces seem complicated , but they ’re not once you understand how to start off properly and then simply use reference points to figure out
where to put everything .
You can really learn to do this right now , today , and start drawing decent quality Manga characters almost immediately .
To draw a Manga face , the first thing you do is just draw a simple circle , that ’s it .
This will always be the starting point , and this should always be done with an
easily erasable pencil ( you ’ll see why in a bit ) .
The line that you ’re going to draw straight down the middle will help to serve as a reference point .
Now , take note that adult characters have longer chins and more slender faces , whereas children tend to have shorter chins and more rounded faces .
From here , things get a bit more complicated , so grab some paper and pencil(s ) and have a look at this :
If you ’re drawing a child , you should remember that their face needs to be a bit more round , and the eyes should appear bigger
than they would on an adult .
Also , the amount of the face that ’s below the mouth is very minimal , and the bridge of the nose is just barely distinctive .
A quick tip to make a face appear younger and more childish is to position the eyes and ears just below the horizontal line .
One of the most difficult things to do with the
face is drawing the eyes , when doing so remember :
The eyebrow will tend to follow the shape of the upper eyelid to some degree .
The eyes on a Manga face will typically have a top and a bottom with ‘ suggested ’ sides or corners .
Eyes of Manga girls normally have more highlights in them than those of the boys and their eyelashes are also almost always longer .
The upper eyelid usually casts a shadow on the eye itself , regardless of lighting .
The distance from the eyebrow to the upper eyelid should be proportional to the eye ’s height .

Speaking on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” Mrs. Clinton said the United States feared that if the test and other recent actions by North Korea did not lead to “ strong action , ” there was a risk of “ an arms race in Northeast Asia ”  an oblique reference to the concern that Japan would reverse its long - held ban against developing nuclear weapons .
So far it is not clear how far the Chinese are willing to go to aid the United States in stopping North Korea ’s profitable trade in arms , the isolated country ’s most profitable export .
But the American focus on interdiction demonstrates a new and potentially far tougher approach to North Korea than both President Clinton and Mr. Bush , in his second term , took as they tried unsuccessfully to reach deals that would ultimately lead North Korea to dismantle its nuclear arsenal .
Mr. Obama , aides say , has decided that he will not offer North Korea new incentives to dismantle the nuclear complex at Yongbyon that the North previously promised to abandon .
“ I ’m tired of buying the same horse twice , ” Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said last week while touring an antimissile site in Alaska that the Bush administration built to demonstrate its preparedness to destroy North Korean missiles headed toward the United States .
( So far , the North Koreans have not successfully tested a missile of sufficient range to reach the United States , though there is evidence that they may be preparing for another test of their long - range Taepodong - 2 missile . )
In France on Saturday , Mr. Obama referred to the same string of broken deals , telling reporters , “ I do n’t think there should be an assumption that we will simply continue down a path in which North Korea is constantly destabilizing the region and we just react in the same ways . ”
He added , “ We are not intending to continue a policy of rewarding provocation . ”
Say you have some bright idea for the " next WiFi " and you just need a tiny little smidgen of open spectrum in which to deploy the invention that will bring cheap , easy , ubiquitous communications nirvana to everyone .
Can you get it ?
Generally , no .
The US government squats on huge swaths of spectrum , while paid - up license holders ( like cell phone service providers ) control much of the rest .
Slivers of spectrum are left open for unlicensed use , and those tiny bands have produced great big social benefits : wireless baby monitors , wireless phones , and WiFi .
But a set of papers from the New America Foundation argue that the Obama administration should take a different course on spectrum , making it simple for entrepreneurs to launch new wireless devices even in occupied bands .
Their common credo : spectrum is abundant — if you treat it right .
Let 's start sharing .
The virtue of sharing
The problem , as all three papers see it , is the old command - and - control model of passing out licensed spectrum and giving exclusive control of the band to license holders .
This has resulted in spectrum going to federal entities like the Supreme Court , for instance , which has been assigned 13 bits of spectrum ; the National Gallery of Art has 12 , while the Smithsonian has 73 .
And these are bit players .
The Air Force has 28,227 bits of spectrum , while the overall Department of Defense controls the single biggest chunk of spectrum in the country .
These sorts of carve - outs have created a spectrum map of almost unimaginable complexity ( see below for the most recent one from the government ) .
Most of these grants are national , even if the organization in question only uses them in a few miles of space .
They are also exclusive , even if the spectrum user broadcasts only once or week , or only uses specific angles and directions , etc .
All three papers want to move spectrum policy to a " commons " model in which the complete spectrum is mapped to find out how and when each band is actually being used ; unlicensed users could then use many of these bands when they are unoccupied .
Here 's how specific this sort of sharing could be .
Big bands of spectrum are reserved for radar use ( weather , airport control , etc. ) , but radar generally broadcasts from a spinning tower .
Most of the time , then , a radar installation is facing away from any given location .
Using a smart radio with knowledge of the transmitter 's behavior , wireless devices could share the band with the radar systems , shutting down their own transmissions at the precise moment the radar swings round to face them , then resuming as it moves on .
As New America 's Michael Calabrese puts it , " the vast majority of frequency bands are not being used in most locations and at most times . "
Smart radios , comprehensive databases
The solution is smart radios that can operate in many different bands , listening for existing transmissions and going quiet when they are found .
The radios might also tap into a vast database that tells them what spectrum to use or avoid in specific locations of the country ; if the Air Force uses a frequency for missile testing , but only in three US locations , everyone else could make use of the band thanks to the database .
If this sounds a whole lot like the " TV white space devices " that were such a contentious issue before the FCC last year , they should — the idea is exactly the same .
In fact , the new papers could basically be summed up as " white space devices on steroids . "
That is , the same technology would be deployed , but it would n't be limited just to TV bands — devices could use huge chunks of lightly used spectrum thanks to spectrum - sensing tech and a beefed - up white spaces geolocation database .
Calabrese points to a 2004 test showing that even in New York City , most spectrum lies fallow most of the time .
" The highest occupancy on the prime beachfront spectrum below 3GHz was just 13 percent in New York City , " he says , " while the average across locations studied was just six percent . "
Making that spectrum available to other users — possibly even on a real - time micropayment model that reimburses the license holder — would go some way toward creating truly " pervasive connectivity , " says Calabrese .
It 's a compelling vision of the future , but interference concerns are real and license holders will often be loath to share spectrum .
But some wo n't mind .
In fact , the Department of Defense already allows such sharing on certain bands that it controls but uses infrequently .
New America scholars were big backers of the successful white spaces initiative at the FCC and are now pushing their ideas further out into the spectrum map .
With Google 's Eric Schmidt running the think tank and a host of Obama staffers with similar spectrum and connectivity goals , the approach is certainly one that could find favor with the government .
We 'll have a much better sense of how well the geolocation database and spectrum - sensing technologies work on national scale once white space devices go on sale at the end of this year .

What makes me weirder ?
a ) I watched The Bourne Ultimatum and freeze - framed this newspaper shot so I could read the fine print .
b ) I noticed a mistake in grammar , called my husband into the room and excitedly showed him what I ’d found .
For the record , he gave me the same blank stare as the time I made him get in my car without telling him why .
After we drove around for five blocks , I stopped and showed him why I made him come with me .
My odometer turned over to 77,777 miles !
Well , I thought it was something .
Nokia Equipment Used to Monitor Iranians Iran : Latest Victim of World 's Surveillance State Nokia Monitoring Centre Used to Silence Iranians
By now , virtually everyone in the world is aware of the situation in Iran .
While protests in Iran continue , new details of the technology used to monitor its citizens -- filtering the Internet and mobile phones -- is emerging .
( Source : bbc.co.uk )
Nokia Siemens
Network reportedly told the news network BBC that it sold a product called Monitoring Centre , which is used to monitor , control , and read local telephone calls , to Iran Telecom in the second half of 2008 .
Monitoring Centre Blocks or Monitors Communications
Monitoring Centre allows authorities to monitor or block any communications across a network , including instant messages , text messaging , voice calls and web traffic .
It can also be used to interrogate data ( data - mining ) to see the information being passed back and forth .
Nokia claims that their product is only being used in Iran to monitor local telephone calls on fixed and mobile lines .
Right after that claim was made , a Nokia spokesman , who described the system as " a standard architecture that the world 's governments use for lawful intercept , " added that Western governments , including the UK , will not allow you to build networks that do n't have that type of functionality .

Monitor Center Marketed to 150 Countries
Monitoring Centre is marketed to 150 countries around the world by Nokia .
Surprisingly , Nokia does not supply their system to China or Burma .

Millions of Iranians get their mobile phone services through Nokia .
On June 13 , data traffic in and out of Iran that is largely controlled by Iran Telecom , came to an almost complete halt .

U.S. Rep. Thaddeus McCotter , a Republican who represents Michigan 's 11th district west of Detroit , continues to make headlines by taking controversial stances on hot - button issues .
McCotter , along with House Republican Leader John Boehner , issued a statement last week expressing concern that Democrat 's proposed health care legislation may encourage assisted suicide .
" This is very dangerous , " McCotter said Friday .
" We , in Michigan , have already fought back an attempted assisted suicide several years ago .
And yet you see that the people who support this are trying to use this bill to advance this agenda . "
FactCheck.org says that claim , taken even further by former lieutenant governor of New York Betsy McCaughey , is nonsense .
MSBNC 's Rachel Maddow took McCotter to task for the statement on Monday .
On Monday , McCotter became the subject of intense debate here on MLive.com after drafting a House resolution demanding an apology from President Barack Obama for saying a Cambridge officer " acted stupidly " when arresting his friend , Henry Louis Gates , Jr.
McCotter stuck by his guns on that one , reiterating his position Tuesday on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews .
Citi Mortgage writes fixed rate conventional , VA , and FHA mortgages , with fixed rates terms available for 15 or 30 years .
Citi also advertises a variety of variable rate mortgages .
That start with a low , introductory fixed rate for the first 10 , 7 , 5 , 3 , or 1 year , and then reset to a variable rate tied to prime for the rest of the life of the loan .
Citi Mortgage advertises their ARMs as , “ Pay Less Now / Get More Now . ”
Citi also claims to still offer interest - only mortgages , although playing around with the rate calculator at the Citi Mortgage website http://www.mortgage.com/
revealed that interest - only mortgages do not appear to be available at this particular time anywhere in the US .
That ’s not surprising given the current financial condition of the corporation , which is not good , to put it mildly .
Citi Mortgage is a part of Citigroup , one of the major issuers of subprime loans , and one of the most heavily damaged by the housing downturn and the subprime lending crisis .
In November of 2007 Citigroup took a $ 7.5 billion loan from Abu Dhabi on poor terms just to stay afloat after suffering staggering losses .
Shortly thereafter , Citigroup replaced its CEO .
In January of 2008 , Vikram S. Pandit , the new Citigroup CEO , brought all of Citigroup ’s mortgage activities under one entity that today retains the name Citi Mortgage .
Before that , Citigroup also had a subprime lending arm called CitiFinancial , and on top of that , all of its mortgage lending and collection activities were split between its investment and consumer bank divisions .
By bringing all of Citigroup ’s mortgage activity under the Citi Mortgage consumer division , Pandit aimed to reduce confusion and loss , and get better control over the corporations mortgage lending practices .
In March of 2008 , Citibank then announced plans to pare its residential mortgage holdings by 20 % , or roughly $ 45 billion , in an attempt to unload some of its riskier mortgage holdings and thereby reduce its subprime losses even further .
It also cut another 2,000 employees from its payrolls .
More recently , Citi Mortgage ’s parent Citigroup settled out of court on a $ 1.66 billion pay - out for its part it in the damages done to Enron shareholders during the Enron scandal .
It has n’t been a very good year for Citigroup .
Citi Mortgage president Bill Beckman hopes reduce Citigroup ’s mortgage holdings by selling 90 % of the home loans made through his unit by the third quarter of 2008 , and in the meantime by only making new home loans that are not meant to be sold .
In terms of individuals shopping for a mortgage loan right today , what this means is that no matter what Citi Mortgage has up on its public website , it might not be the easiest place to get approved for a new loan .
The real question however is , why would anybody want a mortgage with Citi right now ?
Despite the fact that Citi Mortgage still advertises creative mortgage products on its website , Beckman ’s announcement means that they will be making very few , if any , new creative loans and will be dumping the ones it still has as soon as possible .
Some analysts believe that Citigroup has gotten too gigantic and complex , trying to be all things under one enormous roof , and can no longer manage itself properly .
But grayer and wiser heads in the investing community — like Dave Rosenberg , John Mauldin , Nouriel Roubini , Gary Shilling , Peter Schiff , and Dave Cohen — have a more bearish view .
The financial sector must now deleverage , they argue , which means liquidating assets , repaying debt , saving instead of borrowing , and contracting in general .
In their view , the process will take years , not months , and what we have seen since March is a classic bear market rally .
A comforting 30 % gain in the major stock market indexes since the March lows has given renewed confidence to the “ green shoots ” trumpeters who dominate the airwaves and the press .
Has the most massive money - printing spree in history successfully stimulated the global economy and put it back on an upward course with rising inflation ?
Or are we still in a global downturn , temporarily masked by the stimulus , with prices , wages and employment still falling ?
Consider the data Rosenberg offered in a commentary last week in support of his deflationary thesis :
Residential real estate still sports a 12 - month supply of unsold inventory , and housing starts have staged a very weak recovery this spring .
Every major industry posted a decline in May .
Industrial production had its seventh decline in a row in May , to a level last seen 11 years ago .
The Institute of Supply Management ( ISM ) index , a measure of manufacturing activity and a proxy for tech spending , is still falling .
Employment slid in May to greater depths than were seen in the last two recessions , and “ real organic personal income ” fell for the second time in the last three months .
Ultimately , recessions do n’t end without rising employment , meaning consumers with money to spend .
Prices are generally still falling .
The Producer Price Index ( PPI ) , used to evaluate wholesale price levels , is down 37 % year - over - year “ to a 50 - year deflation low of - 5.0 . ”
There are other signs that this spring ’s green shoots may be browning .
The Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , the Labor Department ’s key measure of inflation , has fallen 1.3 % over the past year , the largest decline in nearly 60 years , mainly due to the 27.3 % crash of the energy index component .
Meanwhile , the consumer remains beaten and bruised .
As my colleague Steve Christ pointed out last week , U.S. household net worth fell by $ 1.3 trillion in the first quarter , and household wealth is down 21.6 % from its 2007 peak .
Commercial real estate is contracting painfully , with prices plunging and vacancies and defaults soaring .
Meanwhile , consumer credit defaults are still rising , even as rising interest rates have snuffed out the resurgence in home - buying .
Liquidity in the credit markets remains a problem as well .
Banks simply are n’t lending out the Fed ’s forced injection of fantasy capital .
Indeed , they are entirely intent on paying it back as quickly as the Fed will let them , on the heels of secondary stock offerings and other measures they have taken to raise capital and reduce their exposure .
( For a personal anecdote , I called Discover two weeks to take advantage of a recent 1.8 % promotional offer on balance transfers they had sent me , and was told that they are n’t accepting any more balance transfers right now , from anybody , period . )
On the whole , I think the case for deflation and contraction is well made .
Commodity Inflation
At the same time , food and energy prices have been rising rapidly .
Oil has rocketed from the low $ 40s to the low $ 70s in just four months , a roughly 71 % gain .
Soybeans rose about 50 % over the same period , with most other grains gaining similarly .
Normally , this would suggest inflationary fears , and indeed it has apparently drawn hedge fund money off the sidelines , out of bonds , and back into energy and commodities .
( Energy analyst Dave Cohen did a great study of speculation in the current commodity cycle last week in “ Bad Signs , New Bubbles . ” )
I do n’t want to make too much of the commodity resurgence , however .
The market continues to price oil inversely to the dollar , and the dollar ’s fall has been echoed almost perfectly by oil prices :
The dollar ’s decline can be viewed as the proper result of printing trillions of dollars out of thin air , without new assets to back it — the inflationary thesis .
Indeflation
On the whole this year is looking a great deal like last year across the energy and commodities sector , with the same sort of inflation .
But there is an important difference this year :
The economy and the consumer are sick , very sick .
Gasoline at $ 3 was a nuisance last year , but this year it really hurts .
Perhaps we should be zooming out on this picture , and considering the affordability of oil .
Consider this 60 - year chart from the blog of “ Mr. Excessive , ” which tells quite a different story :
The affordability of oil , as measured by the S&P500 , peaked in 1999 , and has been in decline ever since .
Oil prices began rising sharply at that time , as the early effects of peak oil began to be seen .
Global conventional oil production has been flat since 2005 , despite a tripling of prices .
So is it inflation or deflation ?
My pal Gregor Macdonald argued this question elegantly on his blog in April , and in a recent conversation asserted , I think rightly , that it ’s not an either - or question .
In fact , we ’re seeing inflation ( of prices ) and deflation ( of assets ) simultaneously .
Investor guru Doug Fabian has termed this “ indeflation ” and Izabella Kaminska of FT Alphaville has called it “ compartflation . ”
Instead of just looking at the dollar and inflation , we should consider that , as former International Petroleum Exchange head Chris Cook argued on The Oil Drum , energy is the only real currency .
Our fiat money is but a distorted representation of it , and that energy is declining in real terms as oil , natural gas , and coal all become progressively harder to extract and of lower energy content .
Are We At An Inflection Point ?
We now appear to be bumping our heads against an invisible ceiling , where the decline in real energy meets our pain tolerance for high prices .
When gasoline hit $ 4 last year , it created real demand destruction because people simply could n’t afford it with their evaporating dollars .
Likewise , the spike in natural gas and coal prices ultimately translated into such high prices for basic building materials like cement and steel that demand was curtailed .
It now seems possible that we have reached an inflection point in economic history , where the price at which energy is high enough to sustain new production is the same price at which things become too expensive , leaving us no option but to downsize .
Academics including Charles Hall , Cutler Cleveland , and Howard Odum have explored the relationship between primary energy and economic growth exhaustively .
Hall and his graduate student David Murphy graphically depict where we are now as follows :
Until we understand this key point , we are going to continue to go through wrenching cycles like we experienced over the last year .
Spiking energy and commodity prices lead to destruction of the economy , which then gathers itself at a lower overall level until prices spike again , and back around the wheel we go .
As energy declines , the ceiling will get lower and lower , and it will take more and more money to buy the same things .
No amount of tinkering with monetary policy can change that .
Unlike money , Btus ca n’t be printed out of thin air .
Unfortunately , neither the Fed nor Congress seems to have learned this lesson .
The Fed still thinks that tweaking interest rates , buying bonds , forcing banks to keep the fantasy money , hiding the stress test results and the like can somehow ease us into a manageable recovery .
A few bright bulbs in Congress suggested last week that we exchange 70 million barrels of light sweet crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) for an equivalent amount of lesser quality heavy sour crude , in an effort to dampen oil prices .
Aside from being a fundamentally bad idea , I continue to believe such a move would be utterly ineffectual .
The maximum official rate at which the SPR can be drawn down is four million barrels per day , but I suspect the actual rate would be far lower .
In any case , the price difference between the two grades of oil is fairly small , and the value of the swap would virtually disappear within a flow of 84 million barrels a day of globally priced oil .
The other bit of new legislation , a “ Cash for Clunkers ” bill that passed last week , also appears to be completely toothless .
I supported the idea until I learned the anemic requirements of this bill , which would offer $ 3,500 vouchers for a mere 2 mpg gain in fuel economy for light trucks and SUVs , and $ 4,500 for a 5 mpg improvement .
Cars would only need to gain 4 to 10 mpg to qualify .
Suffice to say that I still have very low expectations that our national leadership will offer any tangible , effective methods to significantly reduce our consumption of petroleum .
I certainly do not see them coming to grips with the near - certainty that by 2012 , the world ’s oil supply will go into terminal and relentless decline .
Looking internationally , finance ministers for the Group of Eight ( G8 ) expressed concern over the influx of capital into the commodity sector after their meeting last weekend .
In a communiqué , the group stated , “ Excess volatility of commodity prices poses risks to growth .
We will consider ways to improve the functioning and transparency of global commodity markets , including considering IOSCO [ the International Organisation of Securities Commissions ] work on commodity derivative markets . ”
Ministers have asked the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) to suggest new ways to monitor and regulate the oil markets , in an effort to limit speculation and dampen future volatility .
If done very carefully , such an effort could moderate the boom - bust cycles ahead , and give the world a crucial measure of slack in which we can sustain the long term investment horizon needed to transition to a renewable energy infrastructure .
If done hastily or badly , it could starve the energy markets of capital , or cause unintended and probably worse effects .
I think that as it is now constituted , the market is inadequately equipped to face this inflection point of indeflation , and history is no longer a useful guide .
We ’re entering uncharted territory while the risk of peak oil is still priced at approximately zero .
So what does all this mean for investors ?
First , it means long - term investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks is probably not going to be a good strategy for a long time to come ( if ever ) ; it ’s time to play defense and look for low - risk yield .
Second , it means that investing in oil and commodities will continue to be the name of the game for many years , but investors must watch the signs I have identified here carefully to know when it ’s time to dive in and time to jump out as we churn through these cycles under a dropping ceiling .
And third , it means that we all need to learn to live at a lower level , eliminate debt , build savings , and buckle up for a long and bumpy ride .

Still on track here .
Scamps learned to fullscreen Dwarf Fortress and he learned that scratching my computer 's case is a great way to get attention .
Elsewhere in the animal kingdom , Momuz the three - eyed marmot demon fooled the humans into believing she was their skeletal goddess of death , and she took over their civilization after threatening them with violence .
The town 's local warlord apparently did n't like this arrangement , because he asked me , the elven adventurer , to kill her .
I found her sleeping in a little hovel in the early morning and hacked her to death in her sleep , but the humans were n't grateful and tried to kill me !
How rude .
: Fixed a crash related to vermin getting caught in cobwebs , and another series of crashes related to temperature .
The conditions for the different landed nobility to be elevated from your fortress population are in the raws now , as are megabeast and semimegabeast and titan attack conditions .
They can be set based on population , exported wealth and created wealth .
So , for instance , if you run a low - population fort for whatever reason , you can adjust the numbers .
This came up during the course of debugging the landed nobility ... and it turned out the liaison was not coming back in subsequent years because the visiting dwarf lost the position upon leaving the map ... anyway , that 's sorted out .
The current situation is that I expect a ( buggy ! )
Windows release in about a week , with the 40d# merge commencing at that time ( or within a few days of the release ) .
This is a bit of a change of plan , since I was originally going to release for all operating systems at once , but I feel like I 'm going to get even more bogged down if I do n't do it this way and the initial pre-merge release will give us a control to work with in the same way that 40d can be compared to 40d# .
The initial merge release should n't take too long though , and it will be the top priority aside from the worst catastrophic crashes and things of that nature .
I know the merge changes make the game playable for many of you when it otherwise is n't .

The main issue now is a frequent random crash that has appeared that I 'd reeeeaaaaally like to have cleaned up -- we caught one of them just now that happened when an old mayor needed to have mandates cancelled after losing an election .
There still one that happens in younger forts though .
Testers are on their seventeenth version overall , and I imagine it 'll be that way for the rest of you as well once I get it sorted out , bandwidth permitting .
" Stands up " spam in the combat log led to weird repetition of previous announcements ... all sorts of problems with fluid containers ... fixed up some temperature check code that sped things up a bit ... lots of cheese / milk job problems fixed ...

A bit of distraction from military matters -- they started walking into water 6 of 7 deep if there was an available ramp , then scrambled right back out .
Milling jobs were using wooden chests and then calling them wooden bags afterward .
" Skeletal " slugmen and other oddities no longer occur ( you can still get zombies ) .
I got rid of the snow display during world gen , made scorching areas available again , and added parameters and parameter sets to make worlds that are surrounded by water on all sides for people that like that look .
Large Medium Small Smaller Pocket
Large Medium Small Smaller Pocket : Stopped dwarves from deciding to reverse their uniforms / clothing choices in their minds , thinking about how strange it would be to put your socks on over your shoes , and then dropping everything , including stuff they got on right the first time ... various problems with training activities not clearing properly ... cleaned up issues with specific bed assignments ( to positions within a squad ) , changed the sleep schedule options around ...
I also ended up making reclaim civilian , at least for now , since there were too many issues with starting out a bunch of pre-made squads .
This also messed up soldier migrants , but I 've compensated for that by giving migrants higher and more varied skills in general , including the skills of a former soldier at times .
: I 've answered some questions over in the List thread .
: Let 's see ... lakes were extending underground ... like way underground , causing all sorts of magma trouble .
Fixed an arena crash .
I just need to fix up the various equipment / training bugs now .
: I went through the purring maggot process from animal trap capture to storing the milk in barrels in a food stockpile .
Of course , the issue with this has been dwarves just up and eating the maggot at any point in the process .
I changed it so that they would only eat purring maggots if they were starving and nothing else were close by .
I tested the change by having the starving dwarves stand in a meeting zone with the food up in a stockpile to the north .
In between the stockpile and the dwarves , a succulent purring maggot tempted from an animal trap .
They performed well , passing up the maggot for other food .
At the end , there were seven dwarves , five pieces of food , and the maggot .
I made them starve again -- five dwarves ate regular food , the doctor ate the purring maggot , and the fisherdwarf ran downstairs , caught a live cave spider and ate it on the spot .
I also handled a gremlin pathing problem and some strange things like the dwarves tanning mussel shells to make mussel leather .

As usual with recent combat revisions , the results swing back and forth wildly until the result is better than the starting point -- at today 's worst , a human scratched another human in half with his fingernails , but I also had a human hack off a couple hydra heads with an adamantine short sword , and the monster kept coming , which was fun .
Using the instant - butcher command from the arena , we had a skull from each severed head and five skulls from the eventual corpse .
In general , I rebalanced bleeding and handled some other combat problems as well .
It would be cool to have the hydra heads get knocked out one by one if you box them right , but there were some annoyances with that so I 'll handle it when I do brain - death later on ( after this release ) .
For now , hydras get the NOSTUN tag so they do n't get KO'd by a single head 's traumatic experiences .
I gave them NOPAIN and rapid healing as well , for more fun .
I also fixed a bug where the arena slowly heated up to just above the boiling point of water slowly over time if you were controlling an individual creature -- it came from initializing a weather variable wrong in the fake 1x1 world that the arena inhabits .
: I started testing out the hydra this morning and found I could n't quite hack off its heads with an adamantine two - handed sword .
While I was working through the numbers there , I got a crash report which ended up being this horrible intermittent does n't - happen - with - any - debug - information - enabled beast I 've only finished off just now , so I 'll be back at the hydra tomorrow !
I understand what 's happening with the neck severing now so I should be able to get to testing bleeding , KOs , and so on without much trouble .
: Still cleaning things up -- after a day of speed stuff , I fixed the list of available metals for caravans / embark ( there are always things missing like iron or things extra like adamantine ) , fixed some display issues with traction benchs , fixed a problem causing volcanic features to shift away from the reclaim area , stopped demon masters from fighting with their adopted civilians , fixed some text / problems in preferences screen ( " likes ( tree ) fabric " , " cow cow cheese " , " likes ant bone " ) ...
: The next SDL / OpenGL /etc update 40d19 is up .
The download is at the forum thread here .
Let us know how it is performing there .
: Fixed a crash from a weird combination of holding an entity position and recreating a squad and scheduling orders , and the mode in the main screen where you order squads around is finalized now , unless I add an easy order to just " defend the fortress " which seems possible .
The military organization screen is next .
: Military bugs and usability complaints starting tomorrow .
Most recently we fixed demons with disconnected lower bodies ... burrow deletion ... hunter troubles ( poor dwarves clubbing with crossbows are pretty good about safety now ... hunters always seem to become broken ! ) ... lots of buckets filled with water being scattered around that are n't ever used again because they are n't empty ...
: Here 's the March 1 report .
A lot of the item weights were quite strange as I brought up before , so I overhauled the mass system so that things are more consistent and are at least internally represented using real world units .
Tissue by tissue , my embark dwarves were between 43kg ( short and incredibly skinny ) and 122kg ( broad - bodied and very fat ) .
The little bits and severed pieces of arena critters are also weighed out appropriately with respect to missing parts , and trousers do n't weigh a zillion whatevers anymore .
Actually , the capital gamma ( the weight / mass symbol ) is a kilogram now , but we are still using the same symbol at this point .
: I fixed another world gen crash -- one that only happened with ( time - consuming ) optimized compilation and did n't repeat consistently ( rarely , for certains seeds , and for those seeds at different years each try etc. ) , having to do with how the genetic information was passed along .
So that 's good .
Not so good was Scamps 's latest fun idea .
His favorite toy to play fetch with is the stuffed hamster / rodent thing with the fur chewed off that I mentioned before , and we did a few throws in the early morning while I was working on the crash .
The third time he brought the toy , I picked it up by a stubby back leg and threw it out of the room as usual , but this time I was greeted by a spiral of water ... quite a lot of water .
It seems that right after the second throw , he took the toy out to his water dish and soaked it before bringing it to me .
There 's no way for the second throw itself to have bounced and hit his water dish since there 's too much wall in the way , and I confirmed that his water was lower and had been splashed around the floor .
And it 's not like there was a lot of time between the throws ... he just chased the toy , brought it to his water , got it wet and brought it back pretty much .
A troubled boy .
I 'm kind of afraid of his next plan .
: Fixed a crash on the military screen , fixed a problem with arena items disappearing , reorganized the attribute descriptions a bit , made some adv mode keys work that were n't working , fixed some broken ramps in caves ...
I took all of the old underground features that no longer exist out of the site finder , though I did n't do desired updates there yet .
There was kind of a violent explosion of boiling human blood when I was testing a human vs a magma man in the arena ... it was a little weird , but I guess that 's okay .
: Sieging humans brought some war polar bears , and one of them started a camp fire .
Highly trained !
Fixed that up , made the new categories in the labor list light up properly when sub-labors are selected , fixed annoying ant colony display bug ( they were being displayed wherever on the screen ) , fixed that fever bug from the 13th , stopped metal crafters from turning the coal they brought into " large coal gems " , fixed a crash with cobweb placement , got appropriate wilderness creatures to enter the map from liquid / air edges properly , and fixed some of the legends text export information ( still unclear whether that 's going to be replaced / augmented by xml ) ...

Here 's a List thread reply ( 2/22/10 ) .
Cleaning progresses .
Another poison crash and other problems with poisons , stopped the bronze colossus from blowing out some combat variables , fixed some problems with entity material selection , added plaster trading , fixed issues with flying item thieves , slowed down skill / att rusting a bit , some designation coloring and other display issues ...
The animal people will now dip their darts in whatever nasty stuff they can find down there , instead of just venoms from bites and stings .
So any poisonous liquid / dust breath , poisonous secretion or poisonous blood that is around in their cavern will be used .

The next SDL / OpenGL /etc update 40d18 is up ( Mac too ! ) .
There are still some adv mode errors and so on -- the important thing we are checking is the general FPS , since the other problems just have to be worked through on the main merge anyway .
Votes in the poll and comments are helpful .

The missing DF talk segment is up on the DF Talk page with download and transcript .
Main - release DF issues continue to be worked through as well .
World gen crash fixed , various complaints about the military controls addressed ( lots left there ) .
It also called not - yet - placed doors and other buildings " unknown frozen substance doors " , which was n't correct for things like wood or anything else .
I 'm trying to catch up with the future of the fortress questions , but they are outpacing me recently , he he he .
I think I have about a dozen replies left to do .

: Non-programming bug to report : I know a lot of you were disappointed by the latest DF talk .
I was sort of confused by the specific complaints at first , but I actually went back to the transcript today and found that somehow I only managed to send 6 of the 7 recorded segments over to be edited .
The missing segment ?
A 27 minute file starting with " All right , so now we 're going to talk about the future of the artifacts " , which was the main draw of the talk for pretty much everybody .
Sorry for not catching my mistake sooner !
The file is intact , and we 'll try to get that together promptly .
We still had DF bugs to go around .
Liaisons had been hanging out doing nothing , staying in some fortresses for years before moving on , but not all of them .
After a bit of poking around , I found that one of the liaisons that chose to linger was in fact trying to meet with a batman blowgunner far underground .
Apparently any creature that was around on the map before the dwarves that was n't a historical figure was thought to hold every responsibility for every civilization , including receiving diplomats .
The new animal people camps created this situation .
I recently updated the material values in the raws , but it was n't working out .
This is because , despite my attempt to select every material , it only affected the last material on the list for a given creature .
So while dragon teeth were virtually worthless , dragon pus was like creamy gold .
Infect and collect !

Apparently in my previous testing , I have n't had a dwarf with a splint that had time on his hands .
Usually they'd get their splints and then run out of the hospital zone and do their work or grab a drink or whatever .
The latest dwarf , an idler , threw his splint on the ground immediately because it was n't part of what he expected for his normal clothing and because he did n't think his arm was broken at all .
He also threw his wound dressing on the ground .
Fortunately he did n't pull out the sutures .
That 's all fixed .
I also fixed a mood bug that was making them go to the work shops and yell " I must have items ! " instead of being more specific .
And the hospital was n't storing as much stuff as possible in its chests , because it thought spider silk hidden down on levels deep below had already claimed the storage space for raw spider silk suturing .
: Humans stopped using wood at some point in there and were paranoid about building their homes on top of cavern features far below the surface , so I helped them out there .
The first food store I walked into was selling yummy firefly brains , so that still needs a little work .
I forgot to set the boiling point of the gas inside the body of a floating creature , so the poor thing died with the message " < name > has condensed . "
The former gas was in a puddle .
You 'll still be able to get this to happen if you lure them out of the caves onto a glacier .
The feature layers also were n't taking into account the local erosion elevation drops from rivers , so occasionally a stream bed would be floating in the sky above underground features and cave - ins would happen immediately , leaving little spikes of stream bed where the cavern 's columns and walls had been .
: Four crash bugs fixed ( two in each mode ) , smelting jobs fixed ( they stopped appearing on the list ) , fixed a problem loading world gen parameters , hid a lot of announcements that were appearing improperly in adv mode , some grammar stuff ... a few more old hands are checking things out , and apparently there are still plenty of crashes to go around !
People wrestling teeth ... cave crocodile killed 20 of 40 war dogs before going down ... wolf corpse smacked into a zombie wolf 's face , knocking out an eyetooth ( that one is fine , he he he ) ... crossbow bolts failing to penetrate clothing now ...
: Finally handled a world gen crash that has been a problem for a long time .
Earlier I stuck some blind cave fish men ( yes , be prepared ) in the arena to try them out , and they would n't do anything but wander around .
It was frustrating , but after a bit I remembered that they did n't have the EXTRAVISION flag .
Then it was fine !
: Here 's Dwarf Fortress
Talk # 7 , covering artifacts : forum thread , DF Talk page with download and transcript .
: It 's 10:30 AM now , 26 hours after the last entry ... so I 'm going to go ahead and start marking the dev log with the day that it actually is instead of the day that I woke up on .
There is less math that way .
Zach tested out windmills and dye , taking a dimple cup farm up to trading blue trousers to the elves .
It all worked , surprisingly enough .
Poisons had some lingering errors , which I worked on in arena mode for a while .
Two crash bugs fixed up there .
I made a creature earlier with a poison that gives you H1N1 , basically , and there 's apparently a bug with fevers ... they never go down , even after the illness itself leaves the system .
: Ha ha , it 's 8:30 in the morning again ...
I should figure out a way to write the dev log halfway through the day , with a time machine or something .
Anyway , some stuff works better now .
Glass even worked on the first try .
: Today we wanted to see how the hospital zones worked out over there in a real fortress environment , so Zach took his fort and made a dwarf - dropping device .
After a few false starts , we got a dwarf with a compound fracture in his left hand .
One of the caretakers wanted to clean the dwarf off but kept dumping the water next to the dwarf , over and over .
Once that was sorted out , surgery began .
The dwarf Zach had selected did n't have any surgical experience .
As I was watching , blood splattered on the walls and floor , and another dwarf ran over to diagnose the patient again , while the dabbling surgeon moved between repairing the compound fracture and trying to stop bleeding from malpractice .
Eventually it was time to suture up the wound , and the dabbling surgeon did this ... then again ... then again ... our poor patient had four sutures in his left wrist before I got the bug figured out .
Bandaging worked out fine , but I had screwed up the meal requests for patients that can move under their own power , so while the patient was waiting for a splint to be constructed in the workshops the caretakers left him to die of thirst .
I got the splint together just in time , the caretaker put it on correctly , and the patient jumped out of bed and ran to get a drink .
Scamps received many toys today .
We have a few more toys to give him on each of the remaining days of the week .
He enjoyed them very much , but when it came time to play fetch when I was working tonight , he brought his favorite old toy ( which has a lot of its fur chewed off , especially in the throat area ) .

There 's a List thread reply here ( 2/8/10 ) .
One of Zach 's horses was savaged by a nightwing and succumbed to infection two months later .
It did n't go much better down below , where one of his dwarves was taken carp - like from the top of moat by a gigantic beast .
The kiln was busted , and now it 's not .
Some problems with hospital item storage came up .
Zach also found some pigtail trousers that weigh twice as much as a bin of pigtail cloth .
Scamps turned one today !
When we weighed him , he was fourteen pounds .
The birthday party is actually a five day festival ( during which I 'm still working ) , and he 'll be receiving his gifts tomorrow .

The birthday party is actually a five day festival ( during which I 'm still working ) , and he 'll be receiving his gifts tomorrow . :
One of the fun new things down below has some critters in it , but it 's not as fun if the critters are set to be wilderness creatures and so eventually roam off of the map , leaving the fun new thing completely empty .
That 's fixed now .
Brewing stopped producing seeds apparently , and Zach had to turn to the underground critters for food .
Brewing is fixed .
Some job material problems that left products without materials were fixed .
I 'm also working through some ammunition and equipment problems .
I 've been balancing about halfway between stuff I had listed from before and stuff that has come up in more recent testing .
: Zach set up a little fort in part to try out the clothier 's shop , well use and the supposedly fixed caravans .
There was an accident during the well digging , and a couple of dwarves drowned , but the well worked out in the end .
The dwarves could n't recover one of the bodies but they set aside a casket for him .
The caravan arrived properly and Zach traded away the other dead guy 's clothes and some rock toys for pigtail and cave spider silk cloth .
The clothier was completely busted ( the buttons just stopped working ) , but I managed to clean that up .
With the immediate goals checked off , the digging projects moved deeper to test some endgame stuff , but a large underground beast managed to get into one of the stairwells and there were further deaths .
In the meantime , I cleaned up some bugs with the raws , including some trees that dropped gray wood .
: The next SDL / OpenGL /etc update 40d17 is up for Windows and Linux .
Mac has been delayed a bit over some library issues .
You can grab it at the forum thread here .
That thread can also be used to provide feedback .
Remember that this is not the next major version of the game .
40d17 itself is fairly buggy itself due to a massive rewrite that had to be done to support the new input system , but that 's what the thread is for .
Hopefully it 'll all be worked out by the time of the merge .
: I fixed up pack animals and an overall lack of minerals on the map , and 40d17 is alllmost ready .
One of Zach 's dwarves grew attached to his trousers .
Then all of his military dwarves decided not to drink and died of thirst in the barracks while training .
Then it crashed .
The work continues !
Here are some List thread posts :
2/4/10 1/26/10
Here are some List thread posts :
2/4/10 1/26/10 : Zach played around with a couple of forts today .
In the first one , he broke through the rock and found he was in a huge pillar surrounded by an underground lake , so he dug out a shelf and a stairway down and then bridged over to some mushroom - farmable land on the other side .
There was some bizarre table dancing where they 'd drop and pick up their food while slowly eating it .
Then it crashed .
In the second game , he had some werewolf trouble on the surface .
It tore his fisherdwarf 's head off and after he organized the other six dwarves to attack , his carpenter and another dwarf were killed .
The survivors could n't clean themselves up because the pond water was too bloody .
One of the reasons for that was the carpenter -- when he had sorted things out and went to look for the bodies later on , Zach found his rotten corpse down there .
After the fight , raccoons invaded the scene and stole shoes and gloves from the field .
There were only four dwarves left , and hoary marmots began wandering the fort freely .
He had been at the site for a year , but strange bugs with pack animals caused caravans and migrants to be shut off , so he was n't getting anybody new .
I 've got that bug reproducing now , so I should have it sorted out tomorrow , hopefully .
As I 'm writing this dev log entry , Zach 's current project is getting the pond drained to reclaim the skeleton .
I 'm also working on the last bits of the 40d17 stuff ( not the merge , just the next test release ) .

:
Zach 's glacier tiles disappeared as he dug staircases , so he ended up taking apart his wagon to build a staircase down to the rock .
There was a lot of fighting with wolves , and the kill order mostly worked but it kind of acted strange , and eventually he got a crash on the military screen .
On the other hand , I fixed a crash with liquid spilling out of certain unsolid creatures , the problem with booze being ignored and some of the others .
Cats and dogs had four mysterious unattached fingers that moved with them ( just four in total , and they had all of their normal toes , front and back ) due to an extra tag .
I added some more raw error logging there to detect body tags that do n't get attached properly .
: Here 's the February 1 report .
Zach assigned axes to a couple of different dwarves and commanded them specifically to kill a crocodile and a giant toad that were tormenting his civilians .
The missions were successful , but the toad had already killed two civilians .
They were laid to rest in pieces in their coffins .
A sever bug caused those pieces to be somewhat ill - defined as " partial remains " instead of the specific parts .
I 'm testing the fix for that right now .
We also solved the mystery of the crash that has been plaguing him the entire time .
Apparently when critters came wet out of the water and attacked people , some of the water transferred over and cleaned off other spatter on their victims ' inventories , and that routine was n't written correctly to handle the near - simultaneous adding and taking away of inventory spatter .
I think it 's the same as an intermittent crash bug I 've been having for months but could never reproduce reliably , so I 'm happy that one is out of the way .

:
Zach found a cave crocodile and his miners were also harassed by multiple - redacted - ... and meeting zones did n't work .
I 'm not sure exactly what sort of civic project he was working on , but a room ended up flooded and he built something involving a lever trying to get the room dry again .
One gremlin showed up but he chased it off .
Then he found some problems with the Z status screen .
He also set up a magma forge and a magma smelter and got a gold operation up and running down in the depths .
Then it crashed .
I finished some of the lingering 40d17 problems , and I may or may not be back to regular work tomorrow depending on if I 'm needed there again immediately .
: Be taken away by Snatcher , a new Threetoe story .
It has been posted up in the story section and there 's a forum thread as well .
Let 's see , Zach 's dwarves insisted on drinking from a pond instead of drinking their booze , but he managed to melt a dwarf with magma and have the rest killed by underground beasts within ten minutes , which is positive .
Adventure mode was kind of a mess on the other hand ... he somehow started with a complete set of adamantine equipment , with which he could n't injure a mob of leatherclad villagers despite my testing a similar scenario in the arena mode .
I did n't ask him why there was a mob after him .
Prior to that , they sent him to find a demon at a vague location to get a quest ... dunno if that was a bug or not , since I have n't checked the legends .
Anyway , more to do .

: Okay , we 've got a handle on the big 40d17 issues , but it 'll still take some coordinating .
I 'm also working on getting an ugly crash - test copy out to Zach , for which I have to iron out a few of the weird game - breakers so he can even try it ( like , why are the dwarves all moving at 1/3rd speed now even when the FPS is fine ? ) , and then I should be back to the march toward the main release .
: 40d17 was in worse shape than I thought ( my fault ) , so I 'll be continuing to clean that up again tomorrow .
Baughn will have to go through whatever I send him , so we 're delayed overall there and I do n't have a release date for testing on that .
I managed to pull the list thread responses together .
Here are the two new ones along with the others I have n't linked here :
New 1 : 1/26/10 New 2 : 1/26/10 12/09/09
12/08/09 11/17/09
New 1 : 1/26/10 New 2 : 1/26/10 12/09/09
12/08/09
11/17/09 : I 've organized all of the remaining notes ... massive but contained .
I should have everything I need to get 40d17 up , so I 'll be doing that tomorrow hopefully , then I can move on to the hydra testing .
I 'd also like to get the list thread questions up tomorrow or the next day .
I 'll post a link here when it is done .
: For rope ladders / etc. , I did n't want to tackle the two big issues there ( pathing and multi-z buildings ) , so I went ahead with the quick fix , which is allowing you to build stairs most places , including down into an open area .
When I get around to the proper solution , that ability will likely be removed .
In any case , the underground is complete .
There 's still a lot left to do , and I 'll be all over the place fixing this and that , but I should n't be adding anything else giant and new that will further slow things down .
There are a ton of " test this ! " and " do this for this person " notes lying around , and I 've got to go through all of that and plan my route to a release .

Fixing issues with cave ramps took four hours longer than I expected , but I managed to get them working , as well as all the magma features and drainage problems I know about .
This leaves one day to play around with the deep stuff , and then I 'll be to the last part , the ladder issue , which I may or may not do something with .
So the underground stuff on the list should be greened out in a day or two .
For a while now , Scamps has consistently rolled on to his back and stretched out whenever I go into the kitchen .
He meows once then waits .
He is n't begging for food -- he just wants me to go over and rub his belly .
This is called Tummy Time .

This is called Tummy Time . :
I 'm staring at less than a page of notes for the underground now , so I could be done with that by Friday , which would be nice .
The plant growth stuff is all working out , so things like giant tower cap farms should be feasible , once you break into a spore source for them .
The adventurer can interact a bit with the underground , and it might happen away from sites like caves and old fortresses , so I had to create weird invisible sites to store the changes permanently ( not mining yet ) .
There were also a bunch of spatter display problems I fixed .
Next I 'm doing tweaks to cave openings and handling some problems with magma pools and internal volcano generation involving water layers draining down below into the magma and so on .
: I 've been working on the laundry list of map tweaks for the underground .
Next up is testing out underground plant growth over the course of a game , especially as it relates to player - expanded caverns .
Scamps hit 12.5 lbs , he 's still skinny , and not yet one year old .
Maybe he will be a megabeast after all .
: The topic vote for DF Talk # 7 is up , and voting closes Saturday afternoon ( on the 23rd ) .
: Okay , the underground life checks are done .
Gas / liquid leaks from internal tissues of those kinds , getting them to exit the edges of the map correctly underground ( there was a little bit of underground monsters running up out of available stairways to exit from a surface edge , but it was mostly okay and should be fine now ) , checking up on the new titans , etc .
: I 'm hoping to be through with all the life - related checks for the underground tomorrow , which would leave the map - related stuff and that rope ladder issue .
: I 've been steadily working on the email / private message backlog from the holiday illness .
I have 25 emails and 15 PMs left , so hopefully I can have those boxes empty soon , in case you 've been met with silence lately .
I did n't end up with a lot of time , but I got to testing out gremlins as well as making sure that the curious beasts ( beer guzzlers , item thieves , etc. ) work out deeper down .
The gremlins made a few runs on the caged dog I set up as bait for them ( they wanted to spring the dog loose ) , creeping up three underground layers worth of stairs I built for them .
: I finished up the lingering underground civ issues today -- how they are listed in the civ screen , an issue with how critters that become notable are linked to the underground civs , that sort of thing .
: The transcript is up for DF Talk 6 .
I messed around with underground populations a bit more .
I also used the new locations associated with announcements to turn off all of the combat spam in adventure mode for events that your adventurer can't see .
Later we 'll need some general sound announcements for those , perhaps , but collapsing them down to something concise is more than I can do this time around .
I should be done with underground civs tomorrow .
: Ran through some underground invasions , fixing problems as they arose , and did a bit more with underground entity population regulation over long periods of time .
: I fixed up some body problems with the new critters and tweaked some of the combat stuff relating to size .
I still had dizzy - breaks and my - eyes - are - sore breaks , but it was a lot better than when I tried this earlier this month .
: I think I 'm mostly back together now , so we should have regular development logs again since there will be development again .
Here 's Dwarf Fortress
Talk # 6 , covering adventure mode : forum thread , DF Talk page with download .
Scary Zombie - Walk Parades
What would you think of if you saw a horde of zombie marching your way .
I know I would n’t feel comfortable , bearing in mind the amount of zombie movies I have seen .
Nevertheless , this kind of costuming as zombies and organizing mass zombie walk events is quite popular thought the whole world .
You can surely tell that people participating in zombie walks have lots of fun .
The only thing they lack is parade balloons , that they had eaten
If you are thinking about organizing a zombie walk yourself or participating in one , to keep you informed here are some important ( funny ) rules :
Zombie Rules of Conduct
1 . Use the “ haunted house ” rule in that you are not to touch anyone .
2 . Do not attempt to scare anyone who is not a willing participant .
If anyone is freaking out , turn and shamble in the opposite direction .
Avoid confrontations !
3. Stay on the sidewalk unless crossing the street .
When crossing , it ’s OK to “ break character ” and cross quickly .
Think fast “ New Dawn of the Dead ” zombies verses the slower “ Old Dawn of the Dead ” zombies when crossing the street .
Blocking traffic is a crime and anyone doing so could be arrested .
4 . No drugs .
None .
Forget it .
5 . No alcohol outside the bars .
This will get you a nice fine .
6 . No littering , destruction of property , or any other illegal activity .
Pretend the South Side is your own neighborhood and show the utmost respect .
This is something we would like to do many times a year and we do n’t want to ruin it .
Remember , the media will be watching us ( along with the Pittsburgh Police ) and this event could get world wide news coverage .
Let ’s put on a good show .
Keep in mind you might be asked for a picture ID at the bars and your zombie face might not match your picture ID .
If you are refused entry , please understand the doorman is only doing his job .
Please do not attempt to push your way into any business if you are not welcome .
“ We know the optics are bad , ” said Scott Talbott , vice president for government affairs for the Financial Services Roundtable , a trade association in Washington .
“ If you are against a consumer regulatory agency , then everybody will say you ’re against consumer regulation . ”
The proposal would strip away all the consumer responsibilities that are currently assigned to existing bank regulators , like the Federal Reserve , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency .
It would give the new agency marching orders to set standards for traditional mortgages , and the agency would have the authority to demand that lenders offer those kinds of loans or give consumers the chance to opt out of riskier products .
It would also give the new agency the power to restrict or prohibit mortgages that come with hidden fees and steep penalties for borrowers who pay the loan off early .
It would also be empowered to interpret and enforce the new credit card law that Congress passed last month , aimed at restricting banks from arbitrarily raising interest rates .
It would also have examiners , much like existing bank regulatory agencies , who would have the authority to go into specific institutions , issue subpoenas and scrutinize their practices , demand changes and seek penalties .
Administration officials said the proposal would create a “ level playing field ” and provide the same regulation for particular consumer products regardless of what kind of financial institution was selling them .
By contrast , existing regulators have authority over only particular kinds of financial institutions .
The office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates national banks , while the Fed supervises bank holding companies .
Italien schiebt weitere Bootsflüchtlinge ab Italien hat rund 240 weitere Bootsflüchtlinge nach Libyen abgeschoben .
Sie seien im Mittelmeer aufgegriffen worden , erklärte Innenminister Roberto Maroni .
Rom werde an dieser Politik festhalten , solange Flüchtlinge von Libyen nach Italien aufbrächen .
( ap ) Ungeachtet der Kritik von Menschenrechtsorganisationen hat Italien rund 240 weitere Bootsflüchtlinge nach Libyen abgeschoben .
Sie seien im Mittelmeer aufgegriffen worden , erklärte Innenminister Roberto Maroni am Sonntag .
Rom werde an dieser Politik festhalten , solange Flüchtlinge von Libyen nach Italien aufbrächen .
Ministerpräsident Silvio Berlusconi hatte am Samstag erklärt , er betrachte Italien nicht als multiethnische Gesellschaft .
Am Donnerstag hatte die Regierung mehr als 200 Flüchtlinge nach Libyen abgeschoben und damit heftige Proteste des UN - Flüchtlingshilfswerks sowie der Menschenrechtsorganisationen Amnesty International und Human Rights Watch hervorgerufen .
Issue # 30 • November / December , 2004
Solar cooking is a delightful alternative to conventional cooking methods .
The solar cookers available today really work and they deserve serious evaluation by a much larger audience .
For 40 years , small groups of people have been using and refining some very good designs .
But these designs have , for the most part , gone unnoticed even by those involved with alternative energy .
With such a lack of support , you ’d think they would have vanished from view long ago .
But they have n’t .
With the collectors back and the glass removed , it ’s easy to get at the cooked food .
The solar cooker aimed at the sun .

The people who have taken the time to integrate solar cooking into their lives find the motivation to keep refining the designs comes from the tools themselves : solar - cooked foods taste delicious and the ovens are fun and easy to use .
My own involvement with solar cooking began in the mid-seventies .
I found myself drawn to the alternative energy movement .
Those were idealistic and innocent times , but they were also serious and important times .
Started as a hobby
It was during those days that I saw my first solar cooker and began the hobby that led to the cooker described in this article .
I started out building the most efficient styles I could come up with .
Later , while keeping this efficiency , I strove to simplify the building process , the materials needed , and the actual use of the cooker .
The cooker is now basically cardboard , aluminum foil , and glass .
Yet , because of the design , it is remarkably efficient and durable .
It looks so simple now , but you should realize that this simplicity took years of effort and many accidental breakthroughs .
The testing for this cooker is now complete .
What I have included here is a very good starter model that can lead you and your family to a lifetime of enjoyment without threatening your pocketbook .
A solar cooker can easily be built for under $ 10 .
Gathering materials
The first step involves a search for cardboard boxes in your local grocery and department stores .
For the oven box , you are looking for two particular boxes .
These can be rectangular ( easier to find ) or square ( their collectors work better ) .
The smaller of the two boxes becomes the inner box , so it defines the cooking area and the power of the cooker .
For a medium size cooker , the area of opening of the inner box ( length times width ) should equal 120 to 160 square inches , and it should be 9 to 12 inches deep .
The larger box , the outer one , must be two to three inches larger in all directions .
The oven box
For collectors , find four flat pieces of regular ( not double strength ) cardboard from appliance or bicycle stores .
These should be about two feet by three feet .
And gather five to seven more boxes which you will cut up for insulation .
Other things to gather :
Eight ounces of white paper glue ( such as Elmer’s™ ) .
One small roll of 18 ″ wide heavy duty aluminum kitchen foil .
A piece of double strength glass ½ ” larger than the length and width of the inner box ( about $ 2 to $ 3 at a glass store ) .
Buff the edges of the glass by rubbing a rock or metal over them , so they ’re not dangerously sharp .
A small amount of flat black paint .
( For square oven only : )
One yard of elastic band material , say 3/8 ″ wide , from a sewing store .
A baking tin that fits in the inner box , preferably one that puts a slight pressure on the sidewalls , to form a rack .
Some cotton cloth from recycled clothes .
Some string .
Take the outer box and cut up cardboard pieces to fit in the bottom ( cut the cardboard with a mat knife , being careful not to cut yourself ) .
Make these layers thick enough so that , when the inner box is placed in the outer box , the top rim of the inner box is one inch lower than the top rim of the outer box .
The outer box must have two opposite flaps left sticking out .
Tuck the other two between the inner and outer boxes .
The inner box must have all of its top flaps bent out and all the way back so that they fit between the inner and outer boxes .
Now cut more pieces of cardboard to stuff between the inner and outer boxes until the inner box is wedged tightly .
Doubled - over pieces look nicer .
The tops of these filler insulation pieces must be arranged so that , when the glass rests on the top rim of the inner box , it makes a good seal .
( That is , you do n’t want big gaps where the heated air will escape . )
Also , it must be easy to slip a finger under the glass for easy removal .
In use , the cooker will be tilted toward the sun .
Therefore , the sidewall , which will be lower when it ’s tilted , must be arranged so it will support the glass in position .
Here ’s the pattern for the collectors .
The dimensions will depend on the dimensions of your box .
Now paint the inside black .
Optionally , you may cut handholds in the outer box and squirt glue under the cuts to keep them from tearing out .
Note for later :
The box will smoke slightly during the first couple of times it is heated up , but this is just a curing process .
Also , cardboard shrinks slightly when heated , so you will have to repack later to keep the inner box tight .
The collectors
Draw the collectors , as shown , on the four flat pieces of cardboard .
A square cooker will have all four collectors the same size , while a rectangular cooker will have two sizes , based on the length and width of the glass .
The 67° angle can be found using a protractor , or by folding a piece of paper like an airplane , as shown in the diagram .
Arrange the filler pieces so the g lass rests on the top rim of the inner box , and so you can slip a finger under the glass to remove it .
Leave two of the flaps on the outer box out , so you can tie the collectors to them when it ’s windy .
Cut out all four collectors .
Then take a tool with a blunt point and crease a line along the dotted lines .
Bend in on the crease lines .
Next , bend the upper and lower flaps all the way over and glue them down .
Press with weights until the glue dries .
Gluing aluminum foil to the collectors
Roll foil over the collectors , and rub your finger over the side flap bends to show where to cut .
Cut the foil so that it does not quite reach these bends ; it will be easier to center later .
Do not cover the side flaps .
Smear a glue mixture ( two parts water , one part white glue ) over the dull side of the foil , using a piece of cloth and two to three tablespoons of glue mix .
Line up the collector and lower it onto the foil , tap it lightly , and turn it over .
Apply the foil to the side of the collector that is not glued to the bent - over upper and lower flaps .
Being a little off center is okay , but if it ’s off too much , peel off the foil and try again .
Press on the edges of the foil and pull out large wrinkles .
Take a clean cloth and rub outward on the foil to smooth it .
Connecting the collectors
For a rectangular cooker , set collectors out as they will fit on the box and glue the side flaps together on two opposite corners .
When the glue has dried , poke holes in the side flaps on the other two corners , placing holes near the cardboard bend , and tie these corners together with a cotton cord .
When it comes time later to fold the collectors flat and pack them away , the rectangular collectors will be untied and separated into two sets of paired collectors .
You can find the 67° angle by folding a piece of paper as shown here .
For a square cooker , glue two opposite sets of side flaps together , as below .
Then lay them out as they will fit on the oven box .
Cut off the side flaps from one of the unattached corners .
Connect this corner by laying these two collectors next to each other ( about ¼ ” apart ) , with the foil sides down .
Now cut a cloth about 18 ″ x 4 ″ and glue it over this corner , as shown .
When the glue is dry , fold inward on this cloth hinge and arrange the collectors so that the unattached side flaps are on the outside and line up with each other .
Poke holes near the bends of the side flaps , and tie the two segments tightly together with elastic material .
This will allow these corners to separate slightly when the collectors are folded flat , but pulls the corners together when unfolded .
Connect the collector panels with glue and with laces .
The side flaps are glued together with the foil sides facing each other .
The slip - in piece
A slip - in piece made from cardboard and cloth is attached to the upper collector .
This slips between the cardboard filler pieces of the upper sidewall for quick attachment of the collectors to the oven box .
To make it , cut a piece of cardboard 16 ″ one way and the length of the glass the other way .
Crease two lines and bend as shown .
Then cut a piece of cloth six inches one way and the length of the glass the other way , and glue three inches of the cloth inside the folded cardboard ( leave three inches outside ) , as shown .
Next , glue the cloth that was left out to the upper collector ( glue it to the doubled - over lower flap of the collector ) .
On square collectors , this would be to the right of the cloth hinge
Finishing up , setting up
The rack : A dark baking tin is used for a rack to hold food and catch boil - over .
It ’s nice if the rack puts a slight pressure on the sidewalls , for stability .
If the baking tin has handholds , these may be bent for a better fit .
You can also build a rack from wood , or by bending sheet metal .
The glass : Check again to see that it rests on the top rim of the inner box with no large air gap .
The glass will become hot , so handle it by the edges or use a cloth .
Keep the glass clean .
Remember to buff the edges so they ’re not sharp .
Propping the oven toward the sun :
Use rocks or other objects in front and back .
If you use only one , the wind easily tips the cooker .
Aiming :
Use shadows created by the cooker to orient it ; do n’t look at the sun .
Approach the cooker from behind , checking shadows on the sides for east / west adjustments .
Touch the oven box and see where the shadow line from the collectors crosses your arm for up / down adjustments .
Aim the cooker in front of the sun ’s path .
Wind :
Poke holes in the flaps left out of the oven box and also in the collectors on the top and bottom .
Tie collectors to flaps with cotton cord .
To make a cloth hinge for the collectors : First , cut off the side flaps from one corner .
Next , glue the cloth to the panels .
Cooking
Jars : Boil and steam food in recycled jars , half - gallon or smaller in size .
Painting them black will reduce cooking time , but leave a clear strip to see food by using tape when painting .
When cooking , do n’t overfill jars with beans and grains , as these foods expand .
You can poke a hole in the lid or leave it on loose to avoid pressure buildup .
If food is actively boiling , open jars slowly to release any built - up pressure .
I ’ve never broken a jar because of pressure buildup .
If a lid sticks , tap around the edge , or pry up under it , to release any vacuum pressure .
It should then open easily .
Making the slip - in piece .
Hinged collector panels in the folded position .
Attach the slip - in piece to the upper collector .
Learn to cook with more than one jar at a time .
Start with the longest - cooking food , and when it is boiling , add more jars .
Learn which foods ( grains , potatoes , squash , lentils , etc. ) and what quantities of them  you can cook in one pass , so you can cook when you are gone all day .
Learn cooking patterns that fit your lifestyle .
Beans : Use 2 ¼ cups of water for 1 cup of beans .
If you boil them actively over a long time , add more water .
Pintos take the longest .
Grains :
Most grains cook better if you preheat the water in the solar cooker for an hour or so .
Use a two - to - one water - to - grains ratio .
Long grain rice can be put in the cooker in cold water .
Vegetables :
These cook in jars with little or no water , or they can be added to beans and grains .
Potatoes and sweet potatoes cook well on the rack , if lightly oiled .
Otherwise , put them in jars .
Winter squash cooks in its own skin .
Corn on the cob steam - bakes in its own sheath .
Bread : Bread cooks best in dark , one - pound coffee cans .
Oil the cans .
Let dough rise in the cooker without collectors attached , then add the collectors when you ’re ready to bake .
Bread shrinks , so it will come out of the cans with a gentle tapping when it ’s done .
Pizza and pies :
Bake the crust first .
Etc. :
Try jams , cinnamon rolls , cake , corn bread , cookies , and other munchies , as well .
When the food is cooked , you can fold the collectors down over the glass .
This provides good insulation , so the food stays hot until you are ready to eat .
Rebel groups control large parts of the trade , Global Witness says Western mineral firms are fuelling violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo by failing to check where their raw materials come from , activists say .
Global Witness says companies sourcing minerals used in electronic gadgets are buying them from traders who finance rebel and government troops .
It calls for the UK - based Amalgamated Metal Corporation ( AMC ) and others to have assets frozen over the issue .
AMC , whose subsidiary Thaisarco sources tin from DR Congo , denies the claims .
The Global Witness report focuses on the troubled region of eastern DR Congo , where various rebel groups and government troops control large parts of the trade in minerals including coltan , cassiterite and gold .
They use the industry to fund conflicts which have seen some 100,000 people displaced from their homes in recent months , in addition to mass killings and rapes , mostly in North and South Kivu provinces .
Millions ' need mining '
The report accuses Thaisarco and other companies of failing to check the source of the metals that go to its smelters before they end up in electronic goods .
From rebel - held Congo to beer can " Global Witness is calling on the UK government to request that the UN Sanctions Committee add the UK - based entities of AMC and their directors to the list of companies and individuals against whom sanctions should be imposed , " the group said .
It quoted a UN resolution as saying that anyone supporting illegal Congolese armed groups through illicit trade of natural resources should be subjected to sanctions including travel restrictions and an assets freeze .
The report acknowledges that the companies are acting legally , but says some of their suppliers are laundering minerals which come from the military or rebel groups .
AMC has strongly denied the claims , saying it is taking part in an industry - wide initiative started on 1 July this year to trace the source of metals .
The firm said in a statement that it takes its lead from the United Nations .
" If the UN were to decide that a withdrawal from the trade is the most appropriate way forward , then Thaisarco would comply absolutely with their requirements , " the statement said .
" However , it is believed that such an approach would be to the detriment of large numbers of artisanal miners and their dependents in the DRC . "
The firm quoted World Bank data suggesting up to 10 million people rely on mining in DR Congo .

Fierce street battles have trapped Mogadishu residents in their homes Abdullahi Mohamed Hassan is trapped in his home in Mogadishu , surrounded by gunfire and mortar shelling .
The 25 - year - old teacher of English is one of hundreds of thousands of Somali civilians caught up in fierce fighting between Islamist guerrillas and pro-government forces .
Mr Hassan e-mailed the BBC
News website to tell of his ordeal alone without food and water as gunmen and looters circle his home , after his wife and daughter fled the war zone .
This is the worst fighting I have ever seen .
I have been trapped in my home for two days , with no food to eat .
Can you hear the gunfire outside ?
I am afraid for my life .
I am in the middle of a battle zone .
The fighting is intense .
I can't even open my front door .
Never has it been this intense , not in my life .

Imprisoned at the age of 16 for the killing of a high school classmate , Mr. Deskovic , now 35 , filed a habeas corpus petition in 1997 in Federal District Court contesting his conviction .
The court denied the request because the paperwork had arrived four days late .
Mr. Deskovic and one of his lawyers  who he said had been misinformed about the deadline for filing  appealed the decision to the federal appellate court on which Ms. Sotomayor sat .
Ms. Sotomayor , along with the other judge on the panel , ruled that the lawyer ’s mistake did not “ rise to the level of an extraordinary circumstance ” that would compel them to forgive the delay .
There was no need to look at the evidence that Mr. Deskovic insisted would affirm his innocence , they said .
Mr. Deskovic spent six more years behind bars , until DNA found in the victim not only cleared him , but connected another man to the crime .
Habeas corpus petitions are rarely granted , and Mr. Deskovic knew that all along .
Federal judges routinely deny them , including for purely procedural reasons .
But he listened as President Obama , in seeking a new Supreme Court justice , talked about how he wanted a judge with not only great intellect , but also great empathy , a judge who knew how the real world worked and who could apply some common sense .
And so Mr. Deskovic is angry .
All over again .
“ When we filed the appeal , I thought for sure that she and the other judge were going to see the facts of the case , that this was n’t an error of my doing and that upholding a ruling like that would be a miscarriage of justice , ” Mr. Deskovic said .
HOUSE prices are falling at their fastest pace in at least a quarter of a century and there are just half the number of job advertisements as a year ago .
But a Reserve Bank board meeting in Sydney today is expected to conclude that another interest rate cut is not needed .
A survey of detached house prices by the Bureau of Statistics released yesterday found prices fell 6.7 per cent across Australia 's eight capital cities over the year ended March - the biggest fall in the survey 's 23 - year history .
Sydney suffered the second largest annual price fall of 7.3 per cent , second only to Perth , where the abrupt end of the commodities boom dragged house values down 10.1 per cent .
The bureau 's results jar with two other private sector surveys which had suggested house prices began to plateau earlier this year , supported by the boosted incentives for first - home buyers .
By contrast , the bureau 's survey suggested house prices sank another 2.2 per cent in the first three months of this year .
It is possible that because the bureau 's survey does not include semi-detached homes and apartments , only detached homes , it does not fully capture this first - home buyer effect .
Here ’s something pointed out by a guy on Reddit , who took his cue from an entry in the French blog Zorgloob : take a look what happens when you enter sarkozy sarkozy sarkozy ( as in French president Nicolas Sarkozy ) into Google Translate and select a French - to - English translation :
Here ’s some other input that yields interesting output :
Is it an Easter Egg by some politically - minded pranksters at Google ?
Or users abusing the “ suggest a better translation ” feature ?
Or a quirk of the way it translates , which one Reddit reader says is based on training by “ feeding it documents which have been translated into many languages by the likes of the UN ” ?
Mr. Summers suggested that the government ’s ability to require the bonuses be scaled back was restricted by preexisting contracts , even though he did not specify what those restrictions may be .
“ We are a country of law , ” said Mr. Summers , one of several economic officials to hit the Sunday - morning talk show circuit .
“ There are contracts .
The government cannot just abrogate contracts .
Every legal step possible to limit those bonuses is being taken by Secretary Geithner and by the Federal Reserve system . ”
Mr. Goolsbee explained it this way : “ I think the root of the problem has been some of the people have things written in their contract that say , ‘ Look , you sell this much life insurance , you get a bonus of X , ’ and it ’s in their contract and that part ca n’t be changed . ”
Mr. Summers also appeared on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation , ” remaining consistent in his core message about the bonuses : “ It is outrageous .
The whole situation at AIG is outrageous .
What taxpayers are being forced to do is outrageous . ”
Sen .
Mitch McConnell , the Republican minority leader , worried about the message the bonuses send to other companies receiving bailout money .
“ If you ’re going to take the government as a partner , the message here , I ’m afraid , to any business out there that ’s thinking about taking government money , is “ Let ’s enter into a bunch of contracts real quick , and we ’ll have the taxpayers pay bonuses to our employees , ’ ” he said on “ This Week . ”
But Mr. McConnell , a Republican from Kentucky , also criticized the Obama administration .
“ For them to simply sit there and blame it on the previous administration or claim contract  we all know that contracts are valid in this country , but they need to be looked at , ” he said .
“ Did they enter into these contracts knowing full well that , as a practical matter , the taxpayers of the United States were going to be reimbursing their employees ?
Particularly employees who got them into this mess in the first place .
I think it ’s an outrage . ”
A.I.G. , nearly 80 percent of which is now owned by the government , has defended its bonuses , arguing that they were promised last year before the crisis and cannot be legally canceled .
In a letter to Mr. Geithner , Edward M. Liddy , the government - appointed chairman of A.I.G. , said at least some bonuses were needed to keep the most skilled executives .

His reputation as a great general and fearless warrior was sealed in the Second Mysore War when he defeated British forces under Sir Hector Munro at the Battle of Pollilur in 1780 .
With the aid of French officers , he broke through British lines and unleashed 13 offensives until the British officers finally surrendered .
One of them , Captain David Baird , was held prisoner for four years before returning to his regiment and eventually leading the force which defeated Tipu Sultan in his capital , Seringapatam in 1799 .
I am not an economist .
Even as an undergraduate , I did n't take one class in economics or political science .
Instead , I took courses that had more relevance to real life and were of more practical use : The Idealism of Plato , Medieval Proofs of the Existence of God and The Dialectics of Hegel .
I would n't know how to go long , much less short , or the difference between a call and a put .
I 'm not interested in derivatives of securitised , collateralised , complex commercial transactions , and I would n't know asset - backed commercial paper from toilet paper .
With a mind uncluttered by all this expertise , I can see what led to the current global economic meltdown and how to fix it .
Economists and politicians , by contrast , like the generals who are always fighting the last war , are turning to the Great Depression of 1929 - 1939 for guidance .
But even myopic generals have the sense to look to past winning tactics for guidance .
Today 's economists and politicians are adopting the throw - money - at - it strategies that failed to pull the world out of economic depression .
The Great Depression came to an end , not because of strategies formulated by economists , but by the outbreak of the second world war ( when the generals started placing orders for obsolete weaponry of the type that had been used in the first world war . )
Despite all this stimulus , the Dow Jones Industrial Average still did n't return to its 1929 peak until 1954 .
But for Hitler , world leaders could have perpetuated the Great Depression to this day !
What caused the current global financial meltdown ?
The easiest way to explain it is to retell a joke my sister - in - law , a financial adviser , told a group of women 15 years ago .
There was this guy who bought a truckload of sardines at a penny a tin .
He resold them for two cents a tin to somebody else , who resold them for three cents a tin to somebody else , who resold them for four cents a tin to a fourth person .
Shortly after , the market for sardines collapsed and the fourth guy could n't sell them , so he figured he may as well eat them .
He opened the first tin and the sardines were rotten , the same with the second and third .
" Great , " he thought to himself .
" I can give them back and not suffer a loss . "
So he went to the guy who sold him the sardines for four cents a tin and said : " Those sardines you sold me were rotten .
Here they are .
Give me back my money . "
The guy who sold the sardines looked at him with pity and said : " Oh , you do n't understand .
Those were n't eating sardines , those were trading sardines . "
That , in a nutshell , is why we are experiencing a global economic meltdown .
Our economy was based not on producing goods and services people would pay for , but on producing financial transactions .
The purpose of financial transactions should be to enable the creation of goods and services .
When financial transactions become an end in themselves , and goods and services exist only to enable financial transactions ( rather than the other way around ) , as sure as night follows day you are headed towards an economic catastrophe .
When a large part of the gross domestic product of a country consists not of doing something useful but producing financial transactions , that country 's economy becomes a house of cards waiting to collapse .
Banks should be there to lend money to people or corporations who need it in order to establish or expand viable businesses or acquire their products .
If those are the rules of engagement , the banks will be selective in who they lend to and will try to ensure that the people they lend to will ultimately succeed in their business plans .
It will charge interest and other fees for giving a loan or establishing a credit facility and make money in that way .
However , when the purpose of a bank lending money is not to itself make interest and charge fees to its customer but , rather , to sell that indebtedness to some other person or institution who will then repackage it and sell it to someone else , who will then again repackage it and resell it , there is no incentive for the original lender to satisfy itself that the business will be viable .
In a system of financial transactions for the sake of financial transactions , in which performing a useful function becomes some accidental footnote , we 're not talking about an economy , we 're talking about a lottery .
To be sure we do n't call it a lottery .
We call it derivatives , hedge funds , speculative currency trading , the UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index , short to long bond yields .
But basically it 's just gambling .
That is the problem .
The solution is not to print a trillion dollars to bail out those who created the mess so that they can rise again in order to revisit the rest of us with some derivative of the calamity 10 years down the road .
That is nothing but socialism for the rich .
The rich have never cared if they destroyed the rest of us , just as long as they made themselves richer in the process .
Now that they are inadvertently destroying themselves in the process , why should everyone else come to their rescue ?
In Canada , where I live , the federal and one provincial government committed to General Motors the obscene amount of C$ 10.5bn , or 40 % of all the corporate taxes it is estimated the federal government will collect in 2009 .
Canadian taxpayers pay income taxes by making out cheques to an entity know as The Receiver General .
It would save administration costs if we just made them out directly to The Receiver General Motors .
Nor are ill - conceived " shovel ready " construction projects an answer .
A subway or light rail system from nowhere to nowhere might put people to work immediately , but will saddle future generations with the much greater cost of operating something that never made sense to begin with .
The solution ?
The solution is obvious .
We need an economy based not on trading sardines but eating sardines ; one that is not a chimerical fantasy driven by the buying and selling of notional mathematical constructs , but a real economy based on productive labour ; one led not by people who know asset - backed commercial paper , but by people who know their assets from a hole in the ground .
A : I can only look at the evidence .
When the panel asked [ Bush administration Treasury Secretary Henry ]
Paulson in December whether or not the American taxpayer was getting full value when it invested billions of dollars of the original TARP money , he sent a letter back to me that said , " Yes .
These are par transactions . "
That means , in effect , for every $ 100 of taxpayer money that went into those banks , the US taxpayer was getting back $ 100 worth of stock and warrants .
Q : What [ is ] the underlying problem ?
Is it that there are n't the right people at Treasury ?
Or is the lack of transparency and the lack of resolution on the conceptual front , is that an unspoken part of the policy ?
The major problem is that Treasury has not articulated its goals .
And without that , we can't have a robust debate about whether they 're headed in the right direction ; instead , we 're stuck with this more technical argument about the implementation of the [ Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ] or the details of the Capital Acquisition Program .
And that misses the central question of , should we be subsidizing failing banks or liquidating them ?
When we acquire capital , should we exercise more control over the institutions that take the money or less control ?
Those are the central policy issues that the American public has a right to participate in .
We get : " someone will call [ you ] right back . "
Only the call does n't come .
There 's a major problem and a minor problem .
The minor problem is documentation .
I 've spent four weeks now looking for someone who can give me the details of the stress test so that we can do an independent evaluation of whether the stress test is any good .
A : No .
And neither is Treasury .
Treasury has given us multiple contradictory explanations for what it 's trying to accomplish .
Q : Do you have a clear sense of what the overall TARP plan at this point is supposed to do ?
Are you capable of summarizing what it 's supposed to be doing ?
A : There 's no discussion of the overall policy .
Instead , there are specific programs that are announced , and from that , it 's necessary to reason backwards to figure out what the goal must have been .
It 's like a " Jeopardy ! " game .
If this is the answer , what was the question ?
It 's frustrating because without a clearly articulated goal and identified metrics to determine whether the goal is being accomplished , it 's almost impossible to tell if a program is successful .
Q : You 've been quite critical of the Treasury .
What troubles you most about what you 're getting and what you 're not getting ?
Until last year , Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren was perhaps best known for her writing on bankruptcy and consumer finance .
But last fall , she was appointed chair of a newly created Congressional Oversight Panel , which is charged with keeping tabs on the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial sector - an effort formally known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program .
Warren was recently interviewed by Globe deputy editorial page editor Dante Ramos , who prepared the following edited excerpts .
We did an independent valuation of the transactions , crunched a lot of numbers , used a lot of different approaches for how to value the transactions .
And we discovered that for every $ 100 of taxpayer money put into the financial institutions , the taxpayer got back about $ 66 in current value .
Q : So what accounts for the $ 34 difference ?
A : Treasury specifically designed a program that had the effect of subsidizing the financial institutions , and simultaneously represented to the panel and to the American people that there was no subsidization .
Q : So they were n't really telling you the truth ?
A : They said one thing and did another .
Q : It seems that there 's a culture clash .
The public - policy culture says there should be public participation , and the goal is to allocate the benefits and the pain as fairly as you can .
And then there 's the Wall Street culture , which is built upon self - interested institutions maximizing benefit without a lot of outside interference .
Those two things clash pretty strongly in the AIG case .
A : I see this as an insiders / outsiders problem .
The insiders , the investment bankers and other financial services specialists , have a system that works very well for them .
The problem is they 're now using the outsiders ' money to fund that system .
Their system has collapsed .
AIG is not functional without substantial taxpayer dollars .
And the insiders do n't seem to have appreciated the seismic shift in their world when they need money , gifts , subsidies from outsiders .
Anyone who thinks that they can take tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer money and continue to operate business as usual lives in a fantasy world that I do n't understand .
Culture clash ?
No !
This is not a culture clash .
This is not about taxpayers who do n't get it .
This is about people who think [ in a ] fantasy , that their world is prosperous and continues to create value that can be parsed out privately , when they are relying on huge subsidies from the taxpayer .
It 's just wrong !
Q : What 's the connection between the squeeze that consumers are feeling and the financial bailout that you 're now charged with trying to scrutinize ?
A : I bring a very different perspective to the bailout than those who spent the last dozen years in the financial services industry .
I believe that ultimately , the banks exist to serve the American people .
Not vice versa .
We cannot have a vibrant economy without a strong and reliable banking system , but it is impossible to save the banking system independently of saving the American family .
The whole Treasury program began as a top - down analysis : Large financial institutions are at risk of failing ; how can we prop them up ?
We might have asked a different series of questions : Large financial institutions are failing ; how do we make sure that there are some financial institutions to keep the economy going forward while we let the failures go ?
There was a real focus on saving all of the institutions rather than a focus on saving enough of a system to keep it workable for the underlying economy .
Saving everyone is a lot more expensive than saving the minimal number to keep the economy functional .
Every time I do the paperwork for the panel and note a $ 10 billion expenditure , I think about how many schools that might have built , how many hospitals that might have updated .
Those dollars are not just ink on a page .
They 're real .
Q : If at the end of all of this you and your panel have done a good job , what does that look like ?
A : Wow , that 's a tough one .
I suspect it will be a comparative measure .
We will have wasted comparatively less money , and spent more on comparatively more successful programs .
If as the result of our panel 's work , Treasury takes a more comprehensive perspective on how to commit $ 3 trillion of taxpayer money , then we succeed .
Q : And what happens if they keep being unresponsive ?
What can you do ?
A : They 've already changed .
Secretary Paulson asked for $ 700 billion announcing one program , and within weeks had changed directions entirely .
The current Treasury has recognized that as a strategy that will not be tolerated .
Q : Is there anything else that you would want people to understand ?
A : I do n't have a badge and a gun .
The power of this panel is derived entirely from the voice of the American people .
If they stay out of the policy debates , then Treasury can spend at will and reshape the American economy with no one in the room but insiders .
If they are involved , the policies will look different .
It 's the design of the rules going forward that will tell us or that will determine whether we are moving to a cyclical economy with high wealth , high risk , and crashes every 10 to 15 years .
Or whether we will emerge , as we did following the new regulatory reforms in the Great Depression , with a more stable economic system that benefits people across the economic spectrum .
It 's an amazing moment in history .

MI5 secretly tried to hire British men held in Guantanamo Bay and other US prison camps by promising to protect them from their American captors and help secure their return home to the United Kingdom , The Independent has learnt .
One of the men , Richard Belmar , was told he would be paid " well " for his services if he was willing to work undercover for MI5 .
A second detainee , Bisher Al Rawi , was told that if he agreed to work for the security service he would be " freed within months " .
Three other detainees were threatened with rendition and harsh detention regimes if they did not co-operate with their British and American interrogators .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But MI5 failed to honour the promises made by its agents , a former agent has told The Independent .
The source , who is close to the MI5 officers who conducted the interviews , has confirmed that " assurances " had been given to the British men while they were held in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay .
But he said that senior officers in London had cleared the actions of its own officers but later reneged on the promises .
This is backed up by sworn testimony lodged in the High Court from the former detainees .
" [ The agents ] fear they will be hung out to dry .
This is not the first time that field agents have been made to carry the can even when there is a paper trail all the way to the top authorising the action and conduct of the agents , " said the source .
The clandestine recruitment operation was being pursued at the same time that the British Government was supporting American claims that those held at the notorious US naval base represented a serious threat to world security .
Edward Davey , the Liberal Democrats ' spokesman on foreign affairs , said : " These allegations show the extent of MI5 's involvement with those people who were illegally abducted and held in Guantanamo Bay .
It 's increasingly clear that Britain must have known much more about American practices at Guantanamo Bay , including water - boarding , than they are prepared to admit . "
According to papers before the High Court two MI5 officers , known as " Andrew and Officer B " tried to recruit Mr Belmar while he was held by the Americans in Pakistan in 2002 .
He was told that he would have to attend training courses at Thames House , the headquarters of MI5 in London .
And in April 2002 " Andrew and officer B " informed Mr Belmar that he would be returning to England in seven days ' time .
Mr Belmar says on hearing this news he was " extremely relieved and started counting down the days " .
But on the day of his " releases " he was handed over to US military officers and later transferred to Guantanamo Bay .
Bisher Al Rawi claims that MI5 officers visited him at the US naval base in Cuba to offer him a job working for the security services after his release .
The two officers , who called themselves " Martin and Matt " , told him they had " specifically come to see you " .
The court case alleges : " Mr Al Rawi 's shackles and handcuffs were completely removed during this meeting and Martin and Matt brought Mr Al Rawi a McDonald 's meal .
They asked Mr Al Rawi a number of questions , showed him photographs of individuals they were interested in , and had a lengthy discussion with him .
During the meeting a request was made by the men to Mr Al Rawi that he would work for the security services upon being released .
They promised that if he agreed he would be released within a few months .
Mr Al Rawi agreed to these terms . "
The court papers allege that another man , Omar Deghayes , was approached by MI5 while he was detained in Afghanistan in the summer of 2002 .
The agent , who gave his name as " Andrew " , assured Mr Deghayes that if " he helped him and the United States interrogators he would go back home " .
On the basis of Andrew 's assurance , Mr Deghayes agreed to answer Andrew 's questions , it is claimed .
Similar claims over British assurances are made by Moazzam Begg , the former Guantanamo inmate who was released in 2005 .
All five men , and two other former Guantanamo detainees , are seeking compensation from the Foreign Office , the Home Office , MI5 and MI6 and the Attorney General .
A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said that the Government could not comment on on - going legal proceedings .
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department said it has about $ 134.5 billion left in its financial - rescue fund , giving the Obama administration a cushion as it implements expensive programs aimed at unlocking credit markets and boosting ailing industries .
The figure means that about 81 % of the $ 700 billion in the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , has been committed .
It also means that the Obama administration may not have to go to Congress to request additional funds , at least until well into the year .
Many lawmakers who criticized ...
Monthly injections of testosterone lowered sperm count A male contraceptive jab could be as effective at preventing pregnancies as the female pill or condoms , work shows .
The monthly testosterone injection works by temporarily blocking sperm production and could revolutionise birth control , experts believe .
In trials in China only one man in 100 fathered a child while on the injections , the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism reports .
Six months after stopping the jabs the men's sperm counts returned to normal .
Family planning campaigners welcomed the news and said they hoped an injection would give couples more choice and enable men to take a greater share of the responsibility for contraception .
At the moment the onus is on the woman and men do not have that much choice
Fertility expert Mr Laurence Shaw
Send us your comments
But experts said more trials were needed to check the safety of the jab .
Previous attempts to develop an effective and convenient male contraceptive have encountered problems over reliability and side effects , such as mood swings and a lowered sex drive .
Despite the injection having no serious side effects , almost a third of the 1,045 men in the two - and - a - half year trial did not complete it and no reason was given for this .
More choice Lead researcher Dr Yi-Qun Gu , from the National Research Institute for Family Planning in Beijing , China , said : " For couples who cannot , or prefer not to use only female - orientated contraception , options have been limited to vasectomy , condom and withdrawal .
" Our study shows a male hormonal contraceptive regimen may be a potential , novel and workable alternative . "
He said if further tests proved successful the treatment could become widely available in five years from now .
Mr Laurence Shaw , of the London Bridge Fertility Centre and the British Fertility Society , said : " If a male contraceptive like this became available it would be great and would give people another choice .
" It would empower men to make a decision which involves more than just a condom .
At the moment the onus is on the woman and men do not have that much choice .
" But we have been here before with testosterone as a method of contraception .
We need more rigorous safety testing . "
He said in trials , the female Pill was still more effective as a contraceptive than the new jab , but that in real life they might be comparable because it is easier to forget to take a pill .
A spokeswoman from Marie Stopes International said : " This is a very positive step forward .
The more range of contraceptives there are , the better .
" But if this does become available men should still remember that it will not protect them against sexually transmitted infections and they should still use a condom . "
Rebecca Findlay of the Family Planning Association said : " In the past fpa has asked men if they would use hormonal contraception , and a third gave a definite yes they would .
" More research is needed to make sure that any new method is safe and effective , but men will welcome the continued search to give them more control over their fertility and sexual health . "

D - Day snub to Queen : Palace fury as Sarkozy refuses to invite royals to 65th Anniversary
The Queen and other senior royals have been ' snubbed ' by the French over D - Day commemorations
Buckingham Palace voiced anger last night after the French snubbed the Queen over next week 's D - Day commemorations .
Aides said senior royals had repeatedly made clear their eagerness to support the historic 65th anniversary events in Normandy .
But last night French officials crushed any remaining hopes , admitting they had never had any plans to invite members of the British Royal Family .
They said President Nicolas Sarkozy was focused on the ' main event ' of hosting U.S. President Barack Obama .
There was also anger at the British Government for failing to secure a Royal invitation from their French counterparts .
Protocol means they cannot simply invite themselves .
The failure to invite the Queen - who is head of state of both Britain and Canada - will be seen as an insult to the memory of the 17,556 British and 5,316 Canadian troops who died to free France and are buried there .
The figure does not include many airmen and sailors whose bodies were never found .
Ministers had refused even to treat the 65th anniversary as a major event until shamed into a U - turn by a Daily Mail campaign earlier this year .
Senior Buckingham
Palace sources made no attempt to hide their frustration .
One said : ' We have made it very clear from the start we were keen to support the Normandy veterans in any way we could .
No -one is keener to honour their sacrifice .
' There have been several conversations with the Foreign Office but no invitation has been forthcoming .
The Queen meeting British war veterans in Normandy during the 60th anniversary to commemorate the D - Day landings
' We have gone through all the normal channels and had conversation after conversation , but received no feedback .
It is very frustrating .'
President Sarkozy 's officials were dismissive of the whole issue .
A French government source said : ' There were never any plans to invite members of the British Royal Family , although an invitation has been extended to Gordon Brown after he said he wanted to come .
' He will , of course , be concentrating on the British commemorations , away from the American beaches , as is appropriate .
This is very much a Franco - American occasion . '
Best buddies : French president Nikolas Sarkozy has been branded ' Sarko the American ' over his attempts to curry favour with Barack Obama
Mahood
Presidents Obama and Sarkozy will attend the main international events at St Mere Eglise - the first town liberated by U.S. paratroopers - and Utah Beach , one of the two American landing sites .
France 's equivalent of BBC1 plans blanket coverage in a day - long programme called Barack Obama On The Invasion Beaches .
Publicity for it makes no mention of British or Canadian troops .
It says : ' Surrounded by French and American veterans , the presidents Obama and Sarkozy will pay homage to the thousands of Americans who lost their lives on the Normandy beaches in their fight for liberty . '
The French president has been branded ' Sarko the American ' over his attempts to curry favour with Washington .
Relations with the White House have soured in recent weeks , and many believe he is pinning his hopes of repairing them on the D - Day celebrations .
Mr Brown will attend events on June 6 , but is not expected to be at the main gathering of British veterans at Arromanches beach - the last time the dwindling band are expected to march together .
Peter Hodge , secretary of the Normandy Veterans Association , said having the Queen present would have been ' the icing on the cake ' for his members .
He said : ' The veterans have immense respect for her and feel a very special bond .
The fact that she took the salute at Arromanches at the 60th anniversary was very special to them . '
But he said it ' would n't make a scrap of difference ' to most veterans whether the Prime Minister turned up or not .
He said as many as 400 veterans would not be able to make a hoped - for pilgrimage to the battlefields where their friends died because the Government 's offer of help came so late that ferries and hotels were fully booked .
Downing Street insiders said the question of a Royal invitation had ' not arisen ' in discussions with the French .
A spokesman said : ' This is an event organised by the French government .
It is for them to issue invitations .
The Prime Minister is pleased to have been invited and hopes to attend . '
The use of the powerful antibiotic streptomycin as a growth - promoting agent in turkeys also quickly promotes the growth of dangerous streptomycin- resistant coliform bacteria , according to researchers at University of California , Davis .
Perhaps such a finding should be cause for alarm , considering how agribusiness pumps more than 20 million pound of antibiotics into healthy livestock each year , constituting more than 70 percent of all antibiotics used in the United States .
Then again , the aforementioned study was published in 1951 .
Hundreds of similar studies have since been published .
But no one seems to care .
Yet as serious questions arise about U.S. food safety nearly monthly , and with antibiotic abuse rampant and with antibacterial - resistant " super bugs " reaching epidemic proportions , maybe it 's time to rethink the practice of industrial - scale animal production .
Scientists at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and the Pew Charitable Trusts are now calling for a phase - out and eventual ban of antibacterial agents for nontherapeutic use in livestock .
They have taken their cause to Washington this month with ads in the Metro subway system and elsewhere .
Old MacDonald had some drugs
Antibiotics down on the industrial farm serve two purposes .
They make some animals , particularly chickens , grow faster .
Chickens raised the old - fashioned way mature in about 90 days ; industrial farms raise them in 42 days with antibiotics and growth hormones .
Antibiotics also help control the spread of harmful bacteria that is inevitable whenever you cram hundreds to tens of thousands of animals and their waste into cages only slightly bigger than their bodies .
Most antibiotics are given to healthy animals in low doses as a mass prophylaxis , a violation of the basic principle of antibiotic use .
Antibiotics are intended for sick humans and animals and must be given at specific doses for a specific duration or else the bacteria they are killing can develop a resistance to the drug .
In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech , Alexander Fleming , the discoverer of penicillin , warned that antibacterial - resistant strains would develop simply by exposing bacteria to doses insufficient to kill all of them .
This is exactly what agribusiness has done with millions of pounds of penicillin ( now largely ineffective against many of the bacteria it once killed ) and other antibiotics .
Evidence still lacking
The meat industry is correct , however , when it states that there is no firm evidence that its 60 - year - old method of doing business is driving the trend of antibiotic resistance in bacteria sickening humans .
Yes , antibiotic - resistance costs the U.S. health care system $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion per year .
Yes , the actual amount of antibiotics used by agribusiness is unknown for lack of regulation .
Yes , if you sample a manure lagoon , a typical feature on industrial farms , you will find antibiotic - resistant strains of all kinds of nasty bugs .
Yes , flies could transmit that manure to hard surfaces , bodies or food miles away .
Yes , studies have shown upwards of 98 percent of bacteria such as staph and streptococci sampled from the air in hog farms were resistant to two or more antibiotics .
Yes , factory farm workers have high rates of asthma , and residents in surrounding communities have high rates of undiagnosed illnesses .
Yes , nearly 100 percent of residents in communities around chicken and hog farms have antibiotic - resistant bacteria in their guts that came from those farms .
But no , you cannot yet conclude , for example , that hospitals are filthy with multidrug - resistant staph ( MRSA ) because chicken , pork and beef conglomerates are using and abusing antibiotic x , y and z .
Agro-industrial complex
The meat industry argues that its practices have made food more affordable and that reducing antibiotic use will lead to more outbreaks of E. coli , salmonella and the like .
The former is true at the cost of animal abuse and meat quality .
The latter is perhaps true only because of the stressed , cramped conditions that breed bacteria .
The Pew Charitable Trusts reported serious obstacles to its study .
Industry representatives were openly hostile , the report said , and threatened authors that they would withhold research funding at their universities .
So it 's unlikely the Pew commission can make an impact .
As the report noted , just as Dwight Eisenhower warned about the dangers of the military - industrial complex , we are faced with an " agro - industrial complex — an alliance of agriculture commodity groups , scientists at academic institutions who are paid by the industry , and their friends on Capitol Hill .

Bad news for rice in Japan -- the recent tainted rice scandal has dulled the public 's appetite for the staple , and kids these days are consuming less than ever .
In an attempt to revive interest in the grain , agricultural cooperative JA Ugo ( based in Ugo , Akita prefecture ) is enlisting the help of a sweet , doe - eyed anime rice farmer girl .
Designed by eroge illustrator Aoi Nishimata , the original moe character will appear on 10,000 bags of locally grown " Akitakomachi " rice , which will go on sale September 22 .
Some Tokyo department stores have reportedly said the bags seem out of place on their shelves , but JA Ugo believes young people will embrace the design .
The moe rice will undoubtedly sell well , provided it 's free from mold and pesticide .
In recent weeks , consumers have been shocked to learn that moldy rice tainted with the pesticide methamidophos was served to thousands of people at schools , day - care centers and nursing homes and included in a variety of commercial food products .
The tainted rice was originally imported from China for use as a raw material in industrial products such as glue , but was instead distributed as food .
There have been no reports of people getting sick from the tainted rice .

With billions of dollars in federal funds hanging in the balance , President Barack Obama unveiled the Cyberspace Policy Review May 29 at the White House .
During his presentation in the East Room Obama said that “ America ’s economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity ” and that efforts to “ deter , prevent , detect and defend ” against malicious cyberattacks would be run from the White House .
How this debate is being framed however , has a familiar ring to it .
Rather than actually educating the public about steps to prevent victimization , state prescriptions always seem to draw from the same tired playbook .
First , issue dire warnings of an imminent national catastrophe ; second , manufacture a panic with lurid tales of a “ digital Pearl Harbor ; ” third , gin-up expensive “ solutions ” that benefit armies of ( well - paid ) experts drawn from officialdom and the private sector ( who generally are as interchangeable as light bulbs however dim ) .
As Wired magazine ’s “ Threat Level ” editor Kevin Poulsen said during a panel at the Computers , Freedom and Privacy conference in Washington June 3 , “ the threat of cyber - terrorism is ‘ preposterous ’ , ” arguing that “ long - standing warnings ” that hackers will attack the nation ’s power grid is so much hot -air .
Poulsen contends “ that calling such intrusions national security threats means information about attacks gets classified unneccessarily . ”
While the president claims the new office “ will not include –I repeat will not include–monitoring private sector networks or Internet traffic , ” and that his administration “ will preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties that we cherish as Americans , ” the devil is in the details and when they ’re added together “ change ” once again , morphs into more of the same .
As with all things Washington , lurking wraith - like in the background , amidst bromides about “ protecting America ” from “ cyber thieves trolling for sensitive information ” are the usual class of insiders : the well - heeled corporations and their stable of retired militarists and spies who comprise the Military - Industrial - Security Complex .
Take Dale Meyerrose , for example .
The former Air Force Major General served as U.S. Northern Command ’s Chief Information Officer .
After a stint at NORTHCOM , Meyerrose became Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Information Sharing for U.S. Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell , the former NSA Director and ten - year executive vice president at the spooky Booz Allen Hamilton firm .
Last week , Meyerrose told The Wall Street Journal that “ one important challenge will be finding a way to persuade private companies , especially those in price - sensitive industries , to invest more money in digital security .
‘ You have to figure out what motivates folks , ’ he said . ”
He should know .
After serving as McConnell ’s cyber point man , Meyerrose plotted a new flight plan that landed him a plum job with major defense contractor , the Harris Corporation , where he currently directs the company ’s National Cyber Initiative .
Headquartered in Melbourne , Florida , the firm boasts $ 5.4 billion in annual revenue and clocked in at No. 13 on Washington Technology ’s “ 2008 Top 100 Government Contractors ” list , with some $ 1.6 billion in defense - related income .
Under the General Services Administration ’s Alliant contract worth some $ 50 billion , the firm is competeing with other defense giants to provide an array of IT services to various federal agencies .
Major customers include the Federal Aviation Administration , the National Reconnaissance Office and Defense Department .
Let ’s be clear : “ What motivates folks ” is cold , hard cash and there ’s lots of it to go around courtesy of the American people .
The New York Times reported May 31 , “ The government ’s urgent push into cyberwarfare has set off a rush among the biggest military companies for billions of dollars in new defense contracts . ”
According to the Times ,
The exotic nature of the work , coupled with the deep recession , is enabling the companies to attract top young talent that once would have gone to Silicon Valley .
And the race to develop weapons that defend against , or initiate , computer attacks has given rise to thousands of “ hacker soldiers ” within the Pentagon who can blend the new capabilities into the nation ’s war planning .
Nearly all of the largest military companies –including Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics , Lockheed Martin and Raytheon –have major cyber contracts with the military and intelligence agencies .
( Christopher Drew and John Markoff , “ Contractors Vie for Plum Work , Hacking for the United States , ” The New York Times , May 31 , 2009 )
As Washington Technology reported June 1 , Zal Azmi , CACI International ’s senior vice president for strategic law enforcement and national security programs , told the insider publication : “ The timing is perfect .
There is a lot of enthusiasm for it .
“ It ’s a very comprehensive plan .
It lays out a very good strategy . ”
And there you have it .
A Cybersecurity Dream : Bundles of Cash
Although the position of Cybersecurity Coordinator has yet to be filled , its a sure bet whoever gets the nod will be drawn from a narrow pool of security executives , the majority of whom transit effortlessly between the Pentagon and defense corporations .
That individual will oversee billions of dollars in funding for developing and coordinating the defense of computer systems that operate the global financial system as well as domestic transportation and commerce .
Under the administration ’s plan , the Cybersecurity Coordinator will report to the president ’s National Economic Council ( NEC ) and the National Security Council ( NSC ) .
The CSC will be a member of both NEC and NSC , Obama said in his East Room statement , “ an acknowledgment that the threat is both to national security and to the economy , ” The Washington Post reports .
According to the Post , Obama ’s top economic adviser , Lawrence H. Summers , fought for a dominant role for the NEC , ensuring that “ efforts to protect private networks do not unduly threaten economic growth . ”
This however , is unlikely to happen given the make - up of the administration ’s team .
Which raises the question : who exactly were Obama ’s “ private sector partners ” who helped devise current state policy ?
The Cyberspace Policy Review sets the record straight .
The U.S. depends upon a privately owned , globally operated digital infrastructure .
The review team engaged with industry to continue building the foundation of a trusted partnership .
This engage­ment underscored the importance of developing value propositions that are understood by both government and industry partners .
It also made clear that increasing information sharing is not enough ; the government must foster an environment for collaboration .
The following industry groups and venues participated : the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association ( AFCEA ) , Business Executives for National Security ( BENS ) , the Business Software Alliance ( BSA ) , the Center for Strategic and International Studies ’ ( CSIS ) Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency , the Communications Sector Coordinating Council ( C - SCC ) , the Cross - Sector Cyber Security Working Group ( CSCSWG ) , the Defense Industrial Base Executive Committee , the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee ( FBIIC ) , the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council ( FS - SCC ) , the Intelligence and National Security Alliance ( INSA ) , the Internet Security Alliance ( ISA ) , the Information Technology Sector Coordinating Council ( IT - SCC ) , the National Infrastructure Advisory Council ( NIAC ) , the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee ( NSTAC ) , TechAmerica , and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
( Cyberspace Policy Review , Appendix B : Methodology , pp. B 2 - 3. )
A bevy of heavy - hitters in the defense , banking , financial services , intelligence and security industries if ever there were one .
And much like their predecessors in the Oval Office , the Obama administration has failed to “ guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence ” by the Military - Industrial - Security Complex which president Dwight .
D. Eisenhower so eloquently warned against–and expanded –decades ago .
Round Up the Usual Suspects
Who then are the new peddlers of “ unwarranted influence ” ?
Let ’s take a look .
Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association ( AFCEA ) : The Fairfax , Virginia group describes itself as a “ non-profit membership association serving the military , government , industry , and academia ” to advance “ professional knowledge and relationships in the fields of communications , IT , intelligence and global security . ”
AFCEA was founded at the dawn of the Cold War in 1946 .
It serves as an “ ethical forum ” where “ a close cooperative relationship among government agencies , the military and industry ” is fostered .
With 32,000 individual and 1,700 corporate members , AFCEA was described by investigative journalist Tim Shorrock in his essential book Spies For Hire as “ the largest industry association in the intelligence business . ”
Its board of directors and executive committee are studded with players drawn from major defense and security firms such as CACI International , Booz Allen Hamilton , Science Applications International Corporation , ManTech International Corporation , QinetiQ North America , General Dynamics , Lockheed Martin and the spooky MITRE Corporation .
Business Executives for National Security ( BENS ) :
This self - described “ nationwide , non-partisan organization ” claims the mantle of functioning as “ the primary channel through which senior business executives can help advance the nation ’s security . ”
BENS members were leading proponents of former vice president Al Gore ’s defense reform initiative that handed tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to BENS members in the heavily - outsourced intelligence and security industries .
An advocacy group with a distinct neoconservative tilt , BENS “ one special interest : to help make America safe and secure ” is facilitated by executives drawn from the Pentagon .
Its current Chairman and CEO is retired Air Force General Charles G. Boyd who served as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ’s “ defense consultant . ”
Its board of directors and executive committee include members from Biltmore Capital Group , LLC ; Janus Capital Group , Booz Allen Hamilton , Cisco Systems Inc. , Perot Systems Inc. , Goldman Sachs and The Tupperware Corporation (! ) to name but a few .
BENS Advisory Council includes major war criminal Henry Kissinger , former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , former U.N. Ambassador Thomas Pickering , former FBI and CIA Director William Webster , former CIA head honcho Michael V. Hayden and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Peter Pace .
“ Non-partisan ” indeed !
Business Software Alliance ( BSA ) : BSA describes itself as “ the largest and most international IT industry group ” comprised on the “ most innovative companies in the world . ”
Its members are drawn from the top corporations in the computing and software industries and include Adobe , Apple , Cisco Systems , Dell , Hewlett - Packard , IBM , Intel , Microsoft , Siemens and Symantec .
Most of these firms have extensive contractual arrangements with the Defense Department .
Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) :
For decades , CSIS has been a major right - wing think tank closely tied to the defense and security industries .
Since its founding in 1962 by David Abshire and Admiral Arleigh Burke , CSIS has been a mouthpiece for the Defense and Intelligence Complex .
Its current President and CEO , John J. Hamre was a former Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration and was hired by SAIC to work on the National Security Agency ’s scandal - plagued Trailblazer program .
The $ 361 million project to build a new communications intercept system for NSA was described as a “ colossal failure ” by investigative journalists Donald Bartlett and James Steele in a 2007 piece in Vanity Fair .
CSIS was a major behind - the - scenes force urging the 2003 U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq and was an apologist for the Bush administration ’s bogus allegation that the Iraqi government possessed “ weapons of mass destruction , ” citing “ poor intelligence ” rather than political mendacity on a grand scale .
In the aftermath of the invasion , Booz Allen Hamilton organized a “ major conference on rebuilding Iraq that attracted hundreds of corporations eager to cash in on the billions of dollars in contracts about to be awarded by the Bush administration , ” according to Tim Shorrock .
The closed - door event was held in the CSIS conference room and outlined the Bush regime ’s plans for Iraq ’s economic make - over–one that would sell - off state assets “ in a way very conducive to foreign investment . ”
The Obama administration ’s Cyberspace Policy Review has drawn extensively from CSIS ’ Securing Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency report , an alarmist screed that avers that “ cybersecurity is now a major national security problem for the United States . ”
Indeed the CSIS report urges the Obama administration to “ reinvent the public - private partnership ” with “ a focus on operational activities ” that “ will result in more progress on cybersecurity . ”
How might this be accomplished ?
Why by regulating cyberspace , of course !
CSIS avers that “ voluntary action is not enough , ” and states “ we advocate a new approach to regulation that avoids both prescriptive mandates , which could add unnecessary costs and stifle innovation , and overreliance on market forces , which are ill - equipped to meet national security and public safety requirements . ”
But with a dubious track record dating back to the Cold War , and a board of directors manned by multinational defense grifters and neoconservative / neoliberal insiders such as former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn , Henry Kissinger , Richard Armitage , Zbigniew Brzezinski , former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen , James R. Schlesinger and Bush crime family insider Brent Scowcroft , CSIS ’ cybersecurity prescriptions are anything but reliable .
Communications Sector Coordinating Council ( CSCC ) : Created in 2005 “ to represent the Communications Sector , as the principal entity for coordinating with the government in implementing the National Infrastructure Protection Plan ( NIPP ) , ” CSCC ’s “ unique industry - government partnership ” facilitates the “ exchange of information among government and industry participants regarding vulnerabilities , threats , intrusions and anomalies affecting the telecommunications infrastructure . ”
Certainly one “ anomaly ” not addressed by CSCC is the National Security Agency ’s driftnet surveillance of Americans ’ private communications .
A major hub where telecommunications ’ grifters meet , CSCC members include AT&T , Boeing , Cisco Systems , Comcast , Computer Sciences Corporation , Level 3 , the MITRE Corporation , Motorola , the National Association of Broadcasters , Nortel , Quest , Sprint , Tyco , U.S. Internet Service Provider Association , VeriSign and Verizon .
Many of the above - named entities are direct collaborators with the NSA and FBI ’s extensive warrantless wiretapping programs .
Intelligence and National Security Alliance ( INSA ) : As Antifascist Calling reported May 26 , INSA was created by and for contractors in the heavily - outsourced world of U.S. intelligence .
Founded by BAE Systems , Booz Allen Hamilton , Computer Sciences Corporation , General Dynamics , Hewlett - Packard , Lockheed Martin , ManTech International , Microsoft , the Potomac Institute and Science Applications International Corporation , The Washington Post characterized INSA as “ a gathering place for spies and their business associates . ”
According to an INSA paper on cybersecurity , Critical Issues for Cyber Assurance Policy Reform : An Industry Assessment , the group recommended “ a single leadership position at the White House - level that aligns national cyber security responsibilities with appropriate authorities . ”
Among other prescriptions , reflecting the group ’s close ties to defense firms and the Pentagon INSA calls on the Obama administration to “ establish a stronger working relationship between the private sector and the U.S. Government ” (!)
With their members heavily - banking on an expansion of Pentagon development of cyber attack tools , the group calls on the state to “ Incorporate private sector cyber threat scenarios within government cyber - related test beds ( e.g. , DARPA ’s Cyber Test Range ) .
Government cyber - related test beds should reflect private sector operational scenarios , especially to demonstrate how similar threats are detected and deterred , as well as to demonstrate private sector concerns ( e.g. , exploitation of electric utility control system ) . ”
As I previously reported , INSA founding members BAE Systems , General Dynamics , Lockheed Martin and SAIC have all been awarded contracts by DARPA to build and run the National Cyber Range .
Internet Security Alliance ( ISA ) : According to a self - promotional blurb on their website , ISA “ was created to provide a forum for information sharing ” and “ represents corporate security interests before legislators and regulators . ”
Amongst ISA sponsors one finds AIG ( yes , that AIG ! )
Verizon , Raytheon , VeriSign , the National Association of Manufacturers , Nortel , Northrop Grumman , Tata , and Mellon .
State partners include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , Congress , and the Department of Commerce .
Among ISA ’s recommendations for the Obama administration ’s Cyberspace Policy Review was its unabashed claim that “ the diversity of the internet places its security inescapably in the hands of the private sector . ”
When one considers that the development of the Internet was the result of taxpayer dollars , ISA ’s cheeky demand is impertinent at best , reflecting capitalism ’s inherent tendency to “ forget ” who foots the bill !
In this vein , ISA believes that “ government ’s first role ought to be to use market incentives to motivate adhering to good security practices . ”
In other words , taxpayer - financed handouts .
Considering the largess already extended to ISA “ sponsor ” AIG , “ regulation for consumer protection ” that use “ government mandates ” to “ address cyber infrastructure issues ” will be “ ineffective and counter - productive both from a national security and economic perspective . ”
Give us the money seems to be ISA ’s clarion call to the new “ change ” regime in Washington .
And why not ?
Just ask AIG !
The Information Technology Sector Coordinating Council ( IT - SCC ) : According to their website , the IT - SCC was established in 2006 and brought together “ companies , associations , and other key IT sector participants , ” in a forum that “ envisions a secure , resilient and protected global information infrastructure that can rapidly restore services if affected by an emergency or crisis , ” and may “ consider the use of government resources to support appropriate tasks such as administrative , meeting logistics , specifically defined and mutually agreeable projects , and communications support ( particularly in response to government requests or needs ) . ”
With some six dozen corporate members , the majority of whom are heavily - leveraged in the defense and security industries , IT - SCC affiliates include the usual suspects : Business Software Alliance , Center for Internet Security , Computer Sciences Corporation , General Dynamics , IBM , Intel , Internet Security Alliance , ITT Corporation , Lockheed Martin , Microsoft , Northrop Grumman , Perot Systems , Raytheon and Verizon , to name but a few .
One IT - SCC affiliate not likely craving public scrutiny is Electronic Warfare Associates , Inc. ( EWA ) .
According to Wired , one EWA company , the Herndon , Virginia - based EWA Government Systems , Inc. , “ is one of several firms that boasts of making tiny devices to help manhunters locate their prey .
The company ’s ‘ Bigfoot Remote Tagging System ’ is a “ very small , battery - operated device used to emit an RF [ radio frequency ] transmission [ so ] that the target can be located and / or tracked . ”
Allegedly in use along the AfPak border , the devices are RFID beacons planted by local operatives “ near militant safehouses , ” which guide CIA Predator and Reaper drones to their targets .
Sounds like any number of government - sponsored “ mutually agreeable projects ” to me !
The National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee ( NSTAC ) : As Antifascist Calling reported last year ( see : “ Comcast ’s Spooky Employment Opportunities ” ) NSTAC is comprised of telecom executives representing the major communications , network service providers , information technology , finance and aerospace companies who provide “ industry - based advice and expertise ” to the President “ on issues and problems relating to implementing national security and emergency preparedness communications policy , ” according to SourceWatch .
Created in 1982 when former president Ronald Reagan signed Executive Order 12382 , in all probability NSTAC facilitates U.S. telecommunication firms ’ “ cooperation ” with NSA and other intelligence agencies ’ efforts in conducting warrantless wiretapping , data - mining and other illegal surveillance programs in highly - profitable arrangements with the Bush and Obama administrations .
NSTAC ’s current Chair is Edward A. Mueller , Chairman and CEO at Qwest .
The group ’s Vice Chair is John T. Stankey , the President and CEO at AT&T .
Additional corporate members include : The Boeing Company , Motorola , Science Applications International Corporation , Lockheed Martin , Rockwell International , Juniper Networks , the Harris Corporation , Tyco Electronics , Computer Sciences Corporation , Microsoft , Bank of America , Inc. , Verizon , Raytheon and Nortel .
TechAmerica : Self - described as “ the driving force behind productivity growth and jobs creation in the United States , ” TechAmerica represents some 1,500 member companies and “ is the industry ’s largest advocacy organization , ” one that “ is dedicated to helping members ’ top and bottom lines . ”
Indeed , the lobby shop offered lavish praise for president Obama ’s Cyber Security plan .
Calling the administration ’s Cyberspace Policy Review a “ historic step in the right direction , ” one that will “ protect America ” ( wait ! ) “ from a digital 9/11 . ”
Conclusion
The Obama administration ’s Cyberspace Policy Review is a corporatist boondoggle that will neither ameliorate nor frankly , even begin to address the most pertinent cybersecurity threats faced by the vast majority of Americans : hacking and spoofing attacks by criminals .
Why ?
The wretched programs riddled with bad code and near non-existent “ security ” patches breeched as soon as they ’re written are not part of the playbook .
Indeed , the corporations and software developers who ’ve grown rich off of the Internet have no incentive to write better programs !
After all , from a business perspective its far better to terrorize the public into demanding more intrusive , and less accountable , minders who will “ police ” the Internet–for a hefty price .
Australia has one of the most competitive environments when it comes to entrepreneurship and other business ventures which is why you will need to exhaust all options if you want to stand out at exhibits .
Making use of trade show …
China uses the so - called " Great Firewall of China " to control access Access to Google has been disrupted in some parts of China , amid a row over what Chinese citizens should be allowed to view over the internet .
Users reported they could not access either Google 's search engine or its Chinese - language version .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang accused Google of spreading pornography and breaking Chinese law .
The move came as the US called on China to scrap its plan to put net - filtering software on all new computers .
China has demanded that all computers come supplied with software called Green Dam Youth Escort from 1 July , which it says would filter out pornographic content .
Separately , google.com and some of its products , such as its mail service , were not available in China from Wednesday night to Thursday morning Beijing time , according to Chinese portal Sohu.com .
Most users were able to connect on Thursday , though it was unclear exactly how widespread the disruption actually was .
Google said it was investigating the outage .
' Serious violation '
The disruption to Google 's services reported by users in Beijing and Shanghai comes a week after China accused Google of deliberately linking to " pornographic and vulgar " websites and ordered it to stop .
" We have found that Google has spread a lot of pornographic content , which is a serious violation of Chinese laws and regulations , " Mr Qin told reporters on Thursday .
He urged the company to abide by local rules , but said he had no specific details on the outage .
Ron Kirk has now objected to several aspects of Chinese trade policy Meanwhile , the US said China 's proposed internet filter would violate China 's free trade obligations , weaken computer security and raise serious censorship concerns .
" Mandating technically flawed Green Dam software and denying manufacturers and consumers freedom to select filtering software is an unnecessary and unjustified means to achieve that objective , and poses a serious barrier to trade , " said US Trade Representative Ron Kirk .
Trade war ?
The latest comment raises the concern about a broader trade war between the US and China over everything from computer security to chicken poultry imports .
It came a day after it filed an unfair trade complaint to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) over raw material exports .
The US is now complaining that putting such pressure on manufacturers to pre-install or supply the software would violate China 's WTO free trade obligations .
Quentin Sommerville , BBC Beijing correspondent
The software , Green Dam Youth Escort , has been heavily criticised by Chinese internet users , and even parts of the state media .
It appears to have been badly written , and parts of it may have been lifted from a rival US software filter .
Critics says it will put computers at greater risk from hackers .
It works by looking for fleshtones , as well as keywords , but has also been found to block sites which contain lots of the colour pink .
" China is putting companies in an untenable position by requiring them , with virtually no public notice , to pre-install software that appears to have broad - based censorship implications and network security issues , " said US Commerce Secretary Gary Locke .
The Green Dam Youth Escort software was created to stop people looking at " offensive " content such as pornographic or violent websites , China has said .
But China 's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology later said that use of the software was not compulsory and that it was possible to uninstall the program .
Tests carried out on Green Dam outside China also showed that it left PCs open to many different security risks , including being hijacked .
Petitions calling for Green Dam to be scrapped have circulated widely within China , which has the world 's largest net - using population .

) - Today , nearly eight years after the initial invasion of Afghanistan , the country remains unstable at best , and the U.S. is now pouring thousands of new troops into the country , joining the international coalition to combat the Taliban insurgency .
This year , bomb attacks on coalition troops have reached an all - time high - at least 46 American troops killed by IEDs this year , part of the larger figure of 1,249 coalition deaths to date .
On June 25th , U.S. officials announced the launch of Operation Khanjar - 4,000 U.S. Marines and hundreds of NATO and Afghan forces pushing into various parts of Helmand province attempting to secure the area ahead of Afghanistan 's presidential election next month .

The landmark Clean Water Act ( CWA ) was passed in 1972 intending to protect and clean up all of America ’s waterways .
Two relatively recent Supreme Court cases have rolled back protection of American waters by narrowing CWA definitions , and the Obama administration would like to restore the act ’s original intentions .
Â Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) has reintroduced legislation to restore CWA called the Clean Water Restoration Act of 2009 ( CWRA ) .
Rivers , streams and wetlands that were once protected under CWA would be within the scope of CWRA .
Â
There are twenty - three cosponsors for CWRA demonstrating it has broad support .
Image by RonAlmog
CWA was considered to apply to all waterways in America , until two Supreme Court cases interpreted the act . Â
The 2001 Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United States Army Corps of Engineers and the 2006 Rapanos v. United States Supreme Court cases narrowed CWA by ruling non-navigable , intrastate waters were not protected under the law .
Â
This decision has made it difficult to enforce CWA violations by causing confusion as to what waterways are actually protected .
Don Young , executive vice president of Ducks Unlimited , explains :
Existing EPA and Army Corps of Engineers guidance make it clear that a legislative solution must be sought to restore protection to America ’s wetlands .
Many of these wetlands that have lost their protection are critical waterfowl breeding habitats …
The loss of protection for geographically isolated wetlands and the confusion over how to interpret the new guidance is detrimental to people and wildlife .
Â
Alleviating these problems through the Clean Water Restoration
Act eliminates both and will ultimately benefit everyone , from landowners to waterfowlers .
The term “ navigable ” is particularly troublesome , as it exempts 20 million acres of wetlands and half of all streams from protection because they do not harbor boat traffic .
Â CWRA would change “ navigable ” requirement to simply “ waters of the United States .
Â Â SPR Environmental Law Blog clarifies :
One proposal is to replace the plainly confusing reference to â€œnavigable watersâ€ in the CWA with the term â€œwaters of the United States , â€ though any statutory revision would still have to pass muster under the U.S. Constitution by having some relationship to interstate commerce .
Â
The change , however , would likely eliminate the need to link waterways and , especially wetlands , with other â€œnavigableâ€ water bodies .
President Obama sent a letter to both the House of Representatives and Senate urging them to restore federal jurisdiction over all wetlands and streams .
U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , explains :
The Obama Administration has provided a clear call for legislation to ensure that the Clean Water Act continues to be an effective tool to keep Americaâ€™s waters clean and our families healthy .
Â
I look forward to working closely with the Administration and my colleagues in the Senate to enact legislation that protects rivers , lakes and wetlands and keeps Americansâ€™ drinking water safe while providing the clear guidance that farmers , businesses , federal agencies , and state and local governments need .
The letter was signed by Nancy Sutley , the Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality ; Lisa Jackson , the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency ; Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack ; Interior Secretary Ken Salazar ; and Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Terrence Salt .
Without CWRA , we could return to the times of the Cuyahoga River burning and the Great Lakes smelling like cesspools .
The Clean Water
Act is important legislation that needs restoration .
Â
It ’s about birds ; it ’s about clean water ; it ’s about drinking water .
Â CWA was intended to protect all of America ’s waters from pollution , not just those that are navigable .
After cleaning out my closet recently , I re-discovered this little Citizen credit - card sized LCD clock and became amazed all over again .
I ’ve had this little thing for at least 20 years , it was one of the earliest things I ’d purchased in one of my weekend jaunts to NYC .
If I had to guess on the year of manufacture , I would say 1984 .
I presume this little gadget was marketed to the businessman who at the time could not rely on email , online chat or video conferencing to get his job done .
Meetings of international business were always face - to - face and required time - consuming and expensive travel .
So , “ world time ” was a popular feature in clocks and wristwatches .
Not much larger than a stack of credit cards , this little plastic device is controlled by pressure - sensitive membrane buttons to control its LCD readout .
Up top , we see a world map delineated with key time zones .
Beneath is our digital readout which consists of two windows , surrounded by key cities and respective time zones .
If you check the world cities , you ’ll note the clock shows its age with the reference of “ Peking ” .
The primary LCD displays a time zone with respective time .
The lower window displays New York Time , London Time and Home Time ( set to your preference ) .
Why New York and London ?
Perhaps this clock was marketed to businessmen in these regions or perhaps the majority of business travel at the time consisted of these two destinations .
Using & Setting the Clock : By tapping the “ + ” and “ - ” buttons , one can span the globe from Anchorage to Tokyo , displaying each time zone ’s local time .
Hold the “ select ” button down to enter set mode ; tap the “ read / set ” button to change the time , day and date .
Tapping the “ mode ” button displays the alarm time .
I can then tap the “ read / set ” button to turn the alarm on or hold the “ select ” button to set the alarm .
Tapping the “ mode ” and “ read / set ” buttons simultaneously will change my home time to whatever zone I ’m in .
The back of the clock has a stamped “ Made in Japan / Fabrique au Japon ” and the battery compartment .
This clock runs on a CR2016 lithium battery .
The accompanying vinyl protective case should insure this gadget will hold up for another 20 years .
Over the years , with a shortage of other effective psychiatric medications , Seroquel has been prescribed for children with schizophrenia , and bipolar disorder , and for adults with anxiety and depression .
Dr. Alex Walley , a substance abuse specialist with the Boston Public Health Commission , said Seroquel gained street value as the tablets began filling the medicine cabinets of a broader cross-section of psychiatric patients .
Even though the Food and Drug Administration has approved Seroquel for adults with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , psychiatrists are allowed to use their judgment and prescribe “ off - label ’ ’ for other purposes .
In Lawrence , police are investigating relatives ’ accounts in the death of 32 - year - old Roberto Plaza last month that may have been related to his efforts to get Seroquel to help him sleep .
He died of gunshot wounds near a house associated with drug trafficking .
There are no statistics to measure the abuse of the drug , but many clinicians who work in drug treatment programs said they noticed an uptick in Massachusetts over the past five years .
In a 2007 letter published in the American Journal of Psychiatry , Dr. Emil Pinta , who worked with drug abusers in an Ohio prison , said some inmates were known to fake psychotic symptoms just to continue a Seroquel habit to help them sleep .
He urged clinicians to be more wary in prescribing this medication , known by its chemical name of quetiapine , and urged studies “ to explore the addiction potential ’’ of the drug .
Nicknamed Susie Q , Quell , Q , or Squirrel , these pills appear so far to be more psychologically than physically addictive .
The drug , made by AstraZeneca , is often sought on the street by former drug addicts or inmates who were first prescribed them to reduce anxiety while confined in institutional settings .
The street use of Seroquel as a sedative is yet another example of how many prescription drugs cross over into the illicit drug market , creating incentives for dealers to illegally obtain the drug and dangers for users ignorant of its side effects .
If misused , doctors say , Seroquel can heighten the risk of diabetes , heart and blood pressure problems , involuntary twitches , and rapid weight gain .
“ Seroquel puts you to sleep , ’’ said Luis Lopez , 28 , a patient at Men ’s Addiction Treatment Center in Brockton who used to buy Seroquel tablets from drug dealers .
“ We all know from the streets that ’s how it works . ’’
But these days , the use of Seroquel is growing in popularity in a different group : men and women living on the margins who simply want a good night ’s rest .
Seroquel debuted 12 years ago as a novel drug for adult patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , a powerful pill that would help stabilize their emotional lives .
Psychiatrists began prescribing these tablets to others - children with serious mental illnesses and adults with anxiety or depression .
FDA advisory panels , in fact , this year have recommended broadening the authorized uses of Seroquel .
Dr. Joseph Glenmullen , a psychiatrist and clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School , said Seroquel ’s emergence as a street drug is further proof that psychiatrists have to be more careful with their prescription pads , resisting the trend in which “ antipsychotics are being overprescribed for off - label uses . ’’
Some clinicians say they are profoundly saddened by the idea that people on the streets are using a powerful antipsychotic drug just to fall asleep ; even some schizophrenics loathe the drug , saying it makes them feel like a zombie .
“ It ’s not thought of as a fun drug , ’’ said Michael Otto , director of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University .
But Seroquel has its appeal , said a 30 - year - old from Webster who asked to remain anonymous because of his past illegal drug use .
He said he bought Seroquel off the streets because it ’s strong enough to “ take you out of your element . ’’
He said some people mix Seroquel with other recreational drugs to achieve a more calm , measured high .
When he bought Seroquel illegally , it cost about $ 3 to $ 5 for a 200 milligram pill , and was relatively easy to get on the streets compared with other prescription drugs .
The retail price of a 200 milligram pill of Seroquel is about $ 10 , though most people obtain it for far less through insurance or treatment centers .
In New England , the prescription drugs most commonly abused are OxyContin , Xanax , and Vicodin , all of which are controlled substances , said Nancy Coffey , diversion program manager of the Drug Enforcement Administration in New England .
She said the DEA does not monitor Seroquel because it is not a controlled substance .
Officials at AstraZeneca condemned the misuse of Seroquel , which is one of the top - selling drugs worldwide , with more than $ 4 billion in sales last year .
“ Unfortunately , drug abuse extends not just to illicit substances , but also to medicines that are safe , effective , and necessary when used according to doctors ’ prescriptions and advice , ’’ said Kirsten Evraire , a spokeswoman for the company .
She said AstraZeneca supports the efforts of government enforcers to work on the “ misuse and abuse of prescription medicines . ’’
Clinicians at many drug treatment programs and prisons have begun to curb Seroquel prescriptions to minimize abuse .
Nicholas Tenaglia , program director of Men ’s Addiction Treatment Center in Brockton , said the staff noticed a few months ago that many patients were selling their pills , so now they have drastically cut back orders for Seroquel .
The motivation to secretly acquire the pills , he said , is sleep .
“ That ’s what I get 99 percent of the time when I ask someone why they abuse Seroquel , ’’ he said .
“ They say it ’s not to get high - it ’s to knock them out . ’’

The French Hadopi legislation passed last month introduced draconian measures to combat piracy , including a “ three strikes ” regime for persistent copyright infringers .
However , France 's highest constitutional authority today ruled that Internet access is a fundamental human right and killed the three - strikes provision .
Last month , the French Parliament implemented the new ‘ Hadopi ’ law .
Under the new legislation ISPs have to send warnings to alleged copyright infringers , who would eventually lose their Internet access upon receiving their third warning .
In addition , the new law would make it possible to order ISPs to block sites such as The Pirate Bay .
The law goes directly against a decision from the European Parliament , which concluded that disconnecting alleged copyright infringers would violate the fundamental rights and freedoms of Internet users .
Despite public protest , the law was backed by a majority in the French parliament and was adopted quite easily last month .
Now , in an unforeseen turn of events the Constitutional Council , France ’s highest legal authority , took a similar position as the European Parliament .
They deemed the provision that would cause people to lose their Internet access unconstitutional , and stopped it .
Instead , the entertainment industry is only allowed to send copyright infringement warnings , something they ’ve already done in the past .
The role of the High Authority ( Hadopi ) is to warn the downloader that he has been spotted , but not to punish him , ” the Council concluded , arguing that Internet access is a fundamental human right .
The ruling by the Constitutional Council said that people can only lose their Internet connection if a court rules that illegal sharing actually took place .
This also addresses one of the most serious concerns of the public who feared that they might be disconnected based on erroneous evidence .
With the uproar caused in France by the “ three strikes ” law , and the earlier decision of the European Parliament it seems unlikely that other European countries will propose similar measures .
Especially not with two Pirates sitting down in Brussels .
“ Different stakeholders have different views , ” the official said .
China uses a different system from the United States to regulate fuel economy .
China sets minimum standards for each of 16 weight categories and tests only urban fuel economy , not highway driving .

Adjusting for these differences is difficult and controversial .
Mr. An estimated that the average new car , minivan or sport utility vehicle in China already gets the equivalent of 35.8 miles a gallon this year based on the American measurement system of corporate averages and will be required to get 42.2 miles a gallon in 2015 .
By comparison , President Obama announced last week that each automaker will be required to reach a corporate average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 .
The details of China ’s new fuel economy standards may favor domestic automakers at the expense of multinationals , several auto industry officials said .
That is because the new rules call for the steepest increases in fuel economy  as much as 26 percent  for midsize and compact cars , market segments where multinationals are strong .
Subcompacts , a market where domestic automakers are stronger , will be required to increase their gas mileage by as little as 9 percent compared with the existing standards , which took effect on Jan .
1 .
Large cars , minivans and sport utility vehicles will face percentage increases between those extremes .
The Chinese government had already cracked down on these vehicles by setting very high gas mileage benchmarks for them as part of the existing rules .
When told late Wednesday of China ’s gas mileage plans , Michael Dunne , the managing director for China at J. D. Power & Associates , the consulting firm , said that Japanese , Korean and German automakers had models of very small cars that they might start building in China if they have trouble meeting the new standards for larger models .
“ The short - term impact is it would favor the Chinese , no doubt about it , ” he said .
“ Global automakers care so deeply about this market that they ’ll do whatever it takes , and adjust . ”

TORONTO | Former President George W. Bush , appearing Friday with his predecessor , Bill Clinton , in what turned out to be a collegial conversation rather than a spirited debate , once again said he would not criticize President Obama — then proceeded to do just that .
“ International pressure — diplomacy only works if there ’s leverage , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ It sounds wonderful — ‘ Let ’s go talk to people ’ — but you better have leverage in order to make diplomacy work . ”
During his presidential campaign , Mr. Obama vowed to open dialogues with rulers of rogue nations , such as Iran and Cuba .
After taking office , he lifted restrictions on visits to Cuba — a significant shift in U.S. policy .
He also spoke amiably with Venezualan President Hugo Chavez , a vocal critic of the United States .
Asked whether he agreed with opening a dialogue with Cuba , Mr. Bush smiled and said to laughter , “ Thank you for bringing up President Obama . ”

“ Holding that embargo in place is important , ” he said .
By easing it , “ you ’re propping up a regime who puts people in prison based upon their political views .
So my view is , if they empty out the prisons and give people a voice , then we change our strategy with Cuba — but not until then . ”
But Mr. Bush sought to label his criticism as constructive .
“ Anything I say is not to be critical of my successor .
I did n’t like it when my predecessors criticized me .
He never did , by the way , ” Mr. Bush said , nodding toward Mr. Clinton .
“ He was respectful .
Ca n’t say that for every one of them .
And I did n’t appreciate it , and I ’m not going to do the same thing to ” Mr. Obama .
“ There ’s plenty of critics in American society .
I think you heard a few , ” he said again to Mr. Clinton before adding with a laugh : “ I know I did . ”
With North Korea having tested a nuclear weapon and Iran seemingly moving toward acquisition of the world ’s most dangerous weapon , Mr. Bush also said that the United Nations is “ not really meant for problem solving . ”
For his part , Mr. Clinton said that on Cuba policy , he agrees with Mr. Obama ’s secretary of state — who happens to be his wife , former first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ He hit it out of the park with that one , an amazingly wise appointment , ” Mr. Clinton said to laughter .
“ I actually supported what President Obama did , ” he said , noting that he also agrees with the current president ’s plan to engage rogue dictators .
“ We deal with a lot of countries that we do n’t agree with on everything .
I think it would be a terrible mistake , for example , if we were to say walk away from China — they still put people in jail for their political views .
I do n’t agree with that .
“ On the other hand , Cuba ’s our neighbor , they ’re here , they ought to be part of this hemisphere , they ought to be part of our future .
They have done a lot of good things , ” Mr. Clinton said .
The two former presidents , who led the United States for the past 16 years , met Friday at the Toronto Convention Center for an event dubbed a “ conversation . ”
Both looked rested and tan , and both had the crowd in stitches in their opening statements .
“ Welcome to the Bill and George Show , ” Mr. Bush said , drawing more laughs in his opening than his predecessor .
“ Clinton and I used to believe in free speech , ” Mr. Bush said to roars of laughter from a crowd of 6,000 , all of whom paid hundreds of dollars to attend the event .
“ So thanks for coming ! ”
No one will say how much each will take home , but estimates run as high as $ 150,000 apiece for the two - hour appearance .
The estimates may be far too low — 200 people in the front rows paid $ 2,500 each , a total of $ 500,000 , for the privilege of having photos taken with the 42nd and 43rd presidents of the United States .
Although he said “ it ’s hard to go from 100 miles per hour to zero , ” Mr. Bush , dressed in a blue suit with a blue tie and the ever - present flag pin on his lapel , said , “ I do not miss the spotlight . ”
But he did say his life has changed — dramatically .
After leaving the White House , “ I ’m sitting in Crawford , Texas , I have my feet up on the couch , and I said , ‘ Free at last . ’ ”
His wife , Laura , he said , responded : “ ‘ Free to do the dishes , free to mow the lawn . ’
I said , ‘ Baby , you ’re talking to the former president of the United States , ’ and she said , ‘ Yeah , just consider it your new domestic policy agenda . ’ ”
The couple moved to an exclusive enclave in Dallas , and Mr. Bush , former two - term governor of Texas , said he had n’t walked in a neighborhood for 14 years .
Walking his dog , Barney , he said , “ the little fella ’ sees this unbelievably manicured yard and there I was , former president , with a plastic bag on my hand , picking up that which I had dodged for eight solid years . ”
Mr. Clinton , in a light - brown suit with a bright orange tie , said , “ There is no job description for a former president .
“ I ’m amazed President Bush is here , ” he said .
“ It takes a while , actually , to figure out you ’re not president anymore . ”
He said “ nobody plays a song when you walk into a room now , ” noting that “ Hail to the Chief ” once rang out on his every entrance .
“ It ’s totally disorienting ; I was lost for three months . ”
There are , he said , pluses and minuses of leaving the presidency .
“ The great thing about not being president anymore is I can say whatever I want , about anything , ” he said , but he noted that now , “ of course , nobody really cares what I say . ”
“ And now I have the worst of all worlds — my wife has become the secretary of state , so no one really cares what I say — unless I mess up , ” he said to laughter .
The two former presidents later sat in large , green leather chairs to answer friendly questions from a moderator , former Canadian ambassador to the United States Frank McKenna .
They mused over just a few hand - picked questions on Cuba , Afghanistan , Iraq , AIDS , Rwanda , Darfur , same - sex marriage and the new passport requirements at the U.S. - Canadian border — to which both professed little knowledge .
Mr. Bush , a Republican , and Mr. Clinton , a Democrat , differed most on Iraq .
“ We should ’ve concentrated on Afghanistan , ” Mr. Clinton said , who noted he had supported a resolution in Congress to employ force .
In perhaps the most vehement disagreement of the afternoon , Mr. Bush said , “ I do n’t buy the premise that our attention was diverted .
“ I think it ’s false — in fact , I know it ’s false , I was there .
Getting rid of Saddam Hussein made the world a more peaceful place , ” he said to hearty applause from the audience of Canadians , who have been steadfast U.S. allies in the Iraq war .
Mr. Clinton expressed remorse for not doing more as president to prevent the 1994 tragedy in Rwanda , when some 800,000 people were killed in a 100 - day period .
“ I have no defense .
We did not even have a meeting on it in the White House , ” he said , calling it “ one of the greatest regrets of my presidency . ”
Asked about genocide in Darfur , where an estimated 400,000 people have been killed , Mr. Bush said , “ The first option is , let ’s go get ‘ em . ”
But there was a consensus in the White House , he said , that the United States not act unilaterally , that it would be “ another invasion of another Muslim country . ”
Privately , he has expressed frustration that foreign leaders , including in the United Nations , failed to step up .
“ The U.N. is a vital institution , but it is not really meant for problem solving , ” Mr. Bush said to laughter and applause .
He also defended Mr. Clinton on Rwanda , saying , “ I think you ’re being a little tough on yourself .
You ca n’t just pick up the phone and say , ‘ 20,000 troops . ’ ”
On the issue of same - sex marriage , Mr. Bush said he does n’t agree with the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act.
But Mr. Clinton said his view on the issue is evolving , although he deferred to the states , saying , “ I was hoping we ’d stay away from national amendments . ”
Mr. Clinton praised his successor for his efforts on AIDS in Africa and also for what he said was “ the most racially and ethnically diverse Cabinet of anyone in history . ”
But by then , after the last question of the day , people in the audience were streaming out the doors .
Kyle Ratham of Toronto said he had hoped for more .
“ I thought they were going to debate , not agree on everything .
I ’m disappointed . ”
Outside , several hundred protesters behind barricades across the street grouped the two presidents together .
“ Bush and Clinton : War Criminals Not Welcome in Toronto , ” said one large banner .
The crowd chanted .
“ Arrest George Bush , ” while some protesters held signs that said , “ Clinton ’s Sanctions Killed 1,000,000 Iraqis . ”
To people pouring out of the convention center , one protester yelled : “ You ’re on the wrong side of the street ! ”

Rush Limbaugh reacted to the news the news that Al Franken has been certified the winner of the Minnesota Senate race by the state Supreme Court by comparing the Minnesota recount to the recount in the Iranian presidential election .
He claims this election was stolen from Coleman .
I believe that Limbaugh loves the GOP more than he loves America .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Limbaugh said , “ Look at this from Iran ’s press run television , state run media in Iran .
Ahmadinejad gains votes in recount , just like in our country .
It happened just like in our country .
Norm Coleman wins in Minnesota in a recount , so they keep having recounts , and Al Franken wins , so they have the recount in Iran and shazam Ahmadinejad gained votes . ”
Advertisements
Of course , Rush ’s version is n’t exactly how it happened .
Franken won the original recount , and has continued to win recounts as Norm Coleman , likely at the request of the national GOP , has continued to drag this process out .
Franken will be the 60th Democratic senator , so the GOP is trying to block seating him for as long as possible .
Can you believe the patriotism of Rush Limbaugh ?
He is now comparing the democratic process of the United States of America to a rigged election in Iran .
The opposition in Iran would love to have had the opportunities that Norm Coleman has had .
Even though it has taken months , the Coleman / Franken contest is an example of democracy in action .
I never used to believe the stuff about Limbaugh hating America , but comments like this really make me wonder if he does love the GOP more that his own country .
The simple answer to that question is that you do not if you are simply taking the pictures for your own pleasure but it ’s the polite , safe , and proper thing to do , especially if you are in a foreign country .
There could me many reasons why someone does not want their picture taken .
There may be local customs , folkways , and mores against having one ’s picture taken .
There are some Native American people who believe that having their picture taken steals their souls .
You could also put yourself in physical danger by photographing people without asking their permission first .
For example , let ’s for the sake of discussion say , you photograph a person wanted by the police for murder , you could become his / her next victim .
Not likely , but it could happen .
Get into the habit of always asking permission before photographing people or their property .
If you intend to use the pictures as stock photos or for publication , you need to get the proper release form signed every time .
I ’m not going to get into model and property release forms here because I ’ve covered that on my blog , The Freelance Writer / Photographer http://thefreelancewriterphotographer.blogspot.com/.
I ’m simply going to offer you a few guidelines for getting permission in this article .
For now I ’m going to assume and , yes , I do know what can happen when we assume anything , that you are shooting the pictures for your own pleasure and have no intentions of using them for any commercial endeavor .
ï‚·
It ’s not practical to ask everyone for permission to photograph him or her if you are shooting pictures on the street or at some large event like a concert .
I always get permission to photograph the person who will be central to my photograph but seldom as permission of those who are minor participants .
I always ask permission to photograph the central subject of my photo especially if I ’m in a foreign country .
I try to behave the way I would expect them to behave towards me if they were visiting my country .
ï‚·
There are many ways to get someone ’s permission to shoot their pictures when a signed release is n’t needed .
Often simply raising your camera and smiling at them will get you the go ahead nod .
This work especially well when there is a language barrier .
Of course , if you have intentions to sell or publish the photos you will have to approach the person (s ) to get the proper release (s ) signed .
ï‚· Some people may give you the nod to go ahead even when they do n’t want their picture taken simply because they do n’t want to be rude .
This situation often arises when you are traveling in foreign countries because most people do n’t want to appear rude to visitors to their country .
Be aware of this and be on the lookout for it .
If someone appears uneasy in anyway about having their picture taken , simply move on without taking their photograph .
ï‚· Do your homework before traveling to another country .
Research the country ’s people and their social customs and taboos so you will know what ’s expected of you .
Knowing these things ahead of time will not only keep you from offending people with your photography , it will keep you from dressing or acting inappropriately in other ways as well .
ï‚· I never ask permission to photograph stage performers at any performance where photography is allowed because they expect to be photographed .
ï‚·
On the other hand , I often get invited back stage to take photos simply by asking ahead of time and offering the performer a free set of the photos you take .
Politeness and consideration can get you into photo ops where most amateur photographers do n’t get .
ï‚· Be especially careful when photographing children .
I always look for a parent or guardian and get their permission before photographing a minor child if a parent or guardian is present .
Most parents are flattered with having their child ’s picture taken as long as you ask first .
Their concern over having a stranger photographing their child without permission is understandable , especially in today ’s crime ridden society .
UNHEALTHILY pale lettuce can make even the best salads look wan and unsavoury .
But a couple of days under weak ultraviolet light before you pick it can make the lettuce more palatable .
Tests at a US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) lab in Maryland show that an LED radiating just a few milliwatts in the UV - B band stimulates red-leaf lettuce to make the antioxidants that give it its characteristic colouring .
Growing crops in greenhouses , done to supply fresh greens all year round , blocks the UV in sunlight that normally prompts lettuce and other crops to make antioxidants outdoors .

The secluded mansion north of London had 10 - 12,000 staff in WWII A silk scarf bearing the image of a horse race was a suitably cryptic gift for a Polish mathematician to receive from a British code - breaker .
The Poles had got there first - that seemed to be the message .
Dillwyn " Dilly " Knox was delighted with the Polish copy of an Enigma - a top secret German military cipher machine .
But his meeting with code breakers in Poland in July 1939 - just weeks before Hitler invaded their country - had initially put him in a sour mood .
He had been struggling to figure out the machine 's wiring - a key part of the complex jigsaw puzzle called Enigma .
Marian Rejewski , a talented Polish mathematician , had guessed correctly that the wiring connections between the machine 's keyboard and encoding mechanism were simply in alphabetical order .
Of course , there were numerous other problems to solve , but Rejewski had made a major breakthrough , by devising equations to match permutations in the machine 's settings .
Unsung heroes
For decades after the war the contributions of Rejewski and other Polish cipher experts to the Allied victory over Nazi Germany went unrecognised .
ENIGMA MACHINE
Dutch invention , first used by German military in 1926 Typewriter - style keypad used to input plain text Encryption done by three or more rotors and electrical plugboard Daily instructions for settings , known as " key for the day " Each message also had " message setting " chosen by sender Receiving operator used message setting to recover signal on his Enigma Morse code signals intercepted by British But Bletchley Park , the nerve centre of Britain 's wartime code breaking operations , has just held its annual Polish Day - a celebration of the Polish achievements that laid the foundations for British success in cracking German codes .
The fictional film Enigma , made in 2000 , had dismayed Poles by neglecting these achievements and portraying a Pole as a traitor .
It has taken a long time to establish the historical facts , but the picture is much clearer now , in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II .
" This event is tremendous - we 're very pleased that the British remember the Poles , " said Derek Celinski , a Polish army veteran who survived the Nazi destruction of Warsaw .
One of the lessons the British learned from the Polish experience was the importance of engaging the country 's best mathematicians in the code - breaking project .
While British code - breakers were undoubtedly bright - Knox was a translator of ancient Greek poetry - they were not necessarily mathematicians .
Dancing in the park : Many Poles were among the Polish Day visitors Polish historian Eugenia Maresch says that Alastair Denniston , the first director of Bletchley Park , was inspired by his meeting with the cryptologists at Pyry , the small Polish decoding centre in woods outside Warsaw .
There the Poles divulged their methods and Enigma secrets to British and French intelligence .
The Poles were already deciphering Enigma messages in 1933 , Mrs Maresch explained , whereas the British did not seriously turn their attention to Enigma until the Spanish Civil War in 1936 , when the Axis powers ' aggression started threatening British interests in the Mediterranean .
Polish expertise Rejewski was the brightest of three top Polish mathematicians who were recruited for code - breaking , Bletchley Park historian Frank Carter says .
The other two were Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Rozycki .
They had graduated from a University of Poznan cryptology course , set up by Polish officer Maksymilian Ciezki , who had been trained by the Germans before Poland became independent in 1918 .
Bletchley Park has a replica of Turing 's " Bombe " - the originals were destroyed Although Zygalski and Rejewski were smuggled out of fascist Spain by British agents during the war the veil of secrecy meant they were not allowed to join the Bletchley Park team , Mr Carter explained .
German changes to the Enigma machines during the war meant much greater resources were required to crack them , and that was where the inventiveness of Alan Turing and the other British code - breakers was key .
The Enigma configurations changed daily - and the " key for the day " could be any one of about 364,000 million possible settings .
" Many Enigma keys were never found , " Mr Carter told the BBC .
" Probably less than 25 % of the naval codes were broken , but it was still a significant success .
" The easiest was the German air force - they were n't as security - minded and made blunders .
They were broken daily . "
Turing created the " Bombe " at Bletchley Park - a more sophisticated decoding machine than an earlier Polish machine called the " Bomba " .
The Polish machine exploited a weakness in the German " indicators " - the starting positions for sending Enigma messages .
But when the Germans changed the indicator system in May 1940 the Polish method became redundant .
The British " Bombes " however did work , based on " cribs " - recurring patterns in German secret messages , such as the words " special arrangements for " .
The German naval codes were the hardest to crack - and that mattered hugely while U - boats were wreaking havoc , torpedoing Allied ships in the North Atlantic .
But Bletchley Park 's work is reckoned to have shortened the war by as much as two years .

Renewable energy —
By Stephanie on May 22 , 2009 at 6:43 am
Great news on the global climate change front : this week a significant drop in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions was announced by the United States Energy Information Administration ( aka EIA ) .
Such a large decline in greenhouse gas emissions ( preliminary data shows a 2.8 % drop in a single year ) has not been seen since 1982 .
Since we ’re all about the good environmental news , this is definitely worth highlighting !
The flagging economy probably gets credit here , however .
People cannot financially afford to drive big , gas guzzling cars or keep the thermostat at the same levels as previously enjoyed .
Looking to save a buck or two has resulted in American consumers taking a good hard examination of their greedy energy usage , and to cut back .
If only we could say that its all about people cutting back for the environment ’s sake !
The Vulcan Project has developed a cool , interactive map to show where in the U.S. carbon emissions are highest :
As CO2 levels fell , it ’s surprising to learn that Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) actually went up a little over 1 % last year .
Nonetheless , overall energy demand fell by 2.2 % , according to the EIA .
And , if you love statistics as much as the next environmentalist , then how about this ?
CO2 intensity ( the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per GDP unit ) also went down nearly 4 % .
Talk about trends in the right direction !
In fact , since 1990 , CO2 intensity has continually declined by over 29 % .
Even coal - based emissions are falling , due in part to more wind energy generation .
Since the electric power sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases , the onus is on them to cut more – quickly and deeper .
So far , so good .
This news is encouraging , regardless of the overall reason for the drop in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions .
Call it the economy , or perhaps a little of an Inconvenient Truth finally sinking in .
We ’ll take it .
Stay tuned , the EIA will release a full greenhouse gas inventory , which will show more specific trends , causes and effects , later this year .
The great carbon credit con :
Why are we paying the Third World to poison its environment ?
In the fields around this giant chemicals factory in Gujarat , the barren soil smells of paint stripper and the water from the well makes you gag .
So why has it been given tens of millions of pounds of taxpayer - funded UN ‘ green reward points ’ , which are traded hungrily on the financial markets at huge profit ?
Farm worker Radha in the cotton fields beneath Gujarat Fluorochemicals : she claims her plants have been affected by chemicals from the nearby factory
The farmers , faces wizened and browned from hours in the harsh Gujarati sun , lower a bucket into a well .
It ’s a solid - brick cylinder 100 ft deep .
The sun is high in the sky , beating down on the scorched earth .
In the baked fields , maize and cotton have been planted .
But none of the crops look very healthy .
Leaves are wilted and tinged brown .
Nothing has been watered for months .
Radha , a tough , sinewy widow and the only female farmer here , says that the well , which draws from deep groundwater , used to adequately supply the village and surrounding farms .
‘ We have plenty of water – but water is the problem , ’ she says .
As the bucket returns to the top , we can make out a white , almost oily - looking film on the surface of the liquid , which has formed little snowflake shapes .
She scoops up some water and asks us to smell it .
It has an odour so acrid it catches in the back of our throats , making us cough .
‘ We ca n’t irrigate our crops with it , ’ she says .
‘ It ’s the water of death .
It kills most crops we put it on . ’
‘ Gone bad , ’ says the man who brought up the pail .
Collecting polluted water in Ranjit Nagar , a few miles from the fluorochemical - manufacturing plant
Radha makes a derisive gesture across the fields .
Her calloused , cracked fingers bear testimony to a lifetime of weeding , planting and hoeing .
She is 40 but looks closer to 60 .
Since her husband died eight years ago , she ’s had to feed herself and her six children .
Perhaps it ’s necessity that ’s made her more outspoken than her male counterparts .
‘ A few years ago , I grew spinach , potatoes , lots of different crops .
Now … look at my plants .
Weak , useless . ’
We ’re in a field of cotton that should be ready to harvest .
But there ’s nothing to reap – just a few little tufts that blow mockingly in the breeze .
Radha picks up a handful of soil .
The surface has a faintly visible white crust , as if talcum powder has been sprinkled over it .
Hold it close and it has the same caustic smell as the water , a bit like paint stripper .
Overlooking the fields like a hulking metal skeleton is the factory the villagers claim has polluted their water and land .
The plant , owned by Gujarat Fluorochemicals ( GFL ) , produces refrigerant gases for air - conditioning units and fridges .
We can't irrigate our land with it - it 's the water of death .
It kills the crops we put it on
But this is much more than a tale of big business versus poor farmers in the Third World .
GFL is part of a worldwide carbon - trading scheme , centred in London , which is supposed to be helping to save the planet from global warming .
On paper the scheme , which was ratified under the Kyoto agreement and supervised by the UN , looks like an efficient way to cut global carbon emissions .
However , a Live investigation has exposed a series of major failings and loopholes in the scheme .
Four years ago , GFL installed technology to reduce the greenhouse gases it produces and was given a vast financial reward by the UN ; a UK company was also given considerable sums for investing in the project .
However , far from being a flagship green factory , GFL stands accused of poisoning the local environment .
Our own extensive tests by an independent laboratory showed dangerous contaminants in the land and water around the factory – chemicals that match those pollutants produced by GFL .
Interviews with the people living nearby reveal their livelihoods and health have been severely affected .
We found that the auditors who were supposed to verify the carbon savings were paid for by GFL , a stipulation of the scheme , and they checked only for greenhouse gases , caring little about other pollution .
Gujarat 's chief minister Narendra Modi admits carbon credits can be a ' good business opportunity '
In a further ironic twist , we discovered that GFL used some of the money it gained from the UN to build a factory making Teflon and caustic soda –both processes are massively polluting .
Meanwhile in the UK , one of our biggest industrial companies is able to claim it has off - set its own pollution by supporting GFL , yet it remains oblivious to and unconcerned about the serious accusations being made against the Indian factory .
These hypocrisies are n’t isolated to GFL .
The UN carbon off - setting scheme is filled with similar examples of companies with poor environmental and human rights records being financially rewarded .
As you dig below the surface it would appear that the UN programme – with backing and finance from Britain – is as polluted as the questionable companies it chooses so generously to reward .
In the middle of the City of London is a large anonymous - looking building , home to the European Climate Exchange ( ECX ) .
About 98 per cent of the carbon - emissions trading in Europe is done in this office , with more than 25 million tons of carbon traded daily .
Last year this market was worth £ 80 billion worldwide , and it ’s set to grow to £ 97 billion this year , despite the recession .
Chief executive Patrick Birley meets us in the glass - panelled reception .
He points out where climate protestors camped on the doorstep during the G20 protests in March .
‘ I care just as passionately about saving the planet as they do , ’ he says .
‘ But the difference is that I believe environmentalism and capitalism can converge . ’
Inside his office the trading screen flashes with yellow , red and green figures .
In the office next door , traders bash the phones doing deals for clients all over the world .
It ’s no different to any other busy trading floor , except no one here is selling an actual commodity .
Here traders sell our planet ’s future in the form of carbon credits .
These are part of international attempts to limit greenhouse gases , and each credit represents a ton of CO2 .
Companies that cut their emissions gain credits .
If , on the other hand , they exceed their quotas , they have to acquire credits .
The credits are traded on markets such as the ECX and have become such an established part of the financial world that trading involves Europe ’s biggest banks , including RBS and Barclays .
Until the global slowdown , carbon was one of the most profitable ‘ commodities ’ , nearly doubling in value between 2007 and 2008 .

But concerns are now being raised about this market approach to controlling emissions , with heavily polluting companies seemingly being financially rewarded .
The hulk looming above Radha ’s fields was the first factory in the world to profit from the UN scheme , and is something of a flagship project .
Yet for the villagers , the scheme is rewarding the very factory that ’s brought them misery .
‘ The carbon - credits business operates rather like the financial - services industry did , ’ says Kevin Smith of campaigning watchdog Carbon Trade Watch .
‘ Insufficient scrutiny and transparency , dodgy projects getting money when they should n’t be .
And we all know the consequences of what happened in financial services .
But this is potentially much more serious , because unlike the Government , nature does n’t do bailouts . ’
Gujarat Fluorochemicals is hidden deep in the Indian countryside , and an army of uniformed guards huddle around the metal gates at the entrance .
The gates are constantly being opened to let in a stream of white tankers .
When we try to take photographs , we ’re swiftly moved on by the aggressive guards .
The factory was built in 1989 .
A by - product of its production of refrigerant gases is a greenhouse gas called HFC23 ; it ’s one of the most dangerous gases in terms of global warming .
One ton of HFC23 is equivalent to 11,700 tons of carbon .
Under the UN credit scheme , GFL installed new technology to capture and recycle HFC23 .
The technology was provided in 2005 by the UK ’s largest chemical and oil corporation , Ineos , formerly part of ICI .
Both GFL and Ineos benefited handsomely .
Nita , eight , who lives in the village of Nathkuva close to the GFL factory , was born without an elbow joint
By installing the technology , GFL made € 27 million in the last quarter of 2006 – triple its total earnings for the same period the year before .
The jump in earnings was due to the carbon credits that the company sold on the carbon market .
Ineos was also given a substantial number of credits for helping a company in the developing world cut its emissions .
Ineos was free to then sell those on or to use them to help meet UK government limits on its own emissions .
The project is just one of many that have occurred across the developing world since the UN credit scheme began in 2005 , most benefiting factories in India , China and Latin America .
Over half of the Indian industries given the credits are based in Gujarat , India ’s most heavily industrialised state .
We arrive in Gandhinagar , the state capital , to meet Gujarat ’s controversial right - wing chief minister , Narendra Modi , who ’s tipped by some as a future Indian prime minister .
Modi tells me he plans to make Gujarat one of the most environmentally friendly places in the world .
‘ You can have big industry and be green , ’ he says .
‘ You talk to the industrialists today and they all speak the same language .
They care about the environment because they know they have to . ’
He does , however , admit that carbon credits can be a ‘ good business opportunity ’ .
‘ It ’s a typical Western capitalist system , cash - and profit - based .
In the East we think differently ; caring for nature and the environment is something that comes naturally to us .
But of course we ’ll take the carbon - credits money if it is offered to us .
Why would n’t we ? ’
Why not indeed ?
To answer that question , the following day we take a battered local taxi out to some of the villages surrounding GFL , a three - hour journey .
On the way we pass factory after factory , many of them new , some of them in receipt of carbon - credit money , lots of them belching out dirty black smoke .
So much for Modi’s ‘ green ’ Gujarat .
The road turns from Tarmac to dirt track and we reach a large village of wooden thatched huts called Ranjit Nagar .
Women sit outside , clanking metal cooking pots over small fires .
They ’re all curious about the arrival of a car , but immediately suspicious when we start asking questions .
They ’re afraid of the corporation and are n’t prepared to speak until they ’re reassured that we ’re genuinely interested in their stories and not spying for the company .
A mustachioed man called Vijay comes forward .
He explains that scores of villagers are sick with joint aches , bone pains , unexplained swellings , throat and nerve problems and temporary paralysis .
The farmers ca n’t put any names to their illnesses and , as low - caste dalits ( or untouchables ) , most of them are too poor to access proper medical services .
A thick film of choking pollutants on the surface of water in a nearby store
‘ We did n’t have these illnesses before this factory came .
When the wind blows the gas this way , mostly at night , it hurts our throats and eyes and burns our crops .
We ’ve lost six healthy children .
They go giddy , they fall and die .
We were carrying one child out the door to the hospital and she just died in her mother ’s arms . ’
Vijay shows me various wells and water pumps around the village .
At one , women are washing clothes , while others fill containers with water to drink .
As at Radha ’s well , the water smells caustic .
‘ It ’s the only water we have , so what else can we do ? ’ says one woman .
At two other villages we hear similar tales .
On three occasions we are presented with children who have missing joints – symptoms synonymous with long - term flouride poisoning .
One little girl was born without a fully formed elbow joint .
Her arm hangs limply by her side .
We ’re also told of a baby born with no joints at all , who died when only eight days old .
Mahesh Pandya was an environmental engineer who turned activist 13 years ago after meeting these villagers .
A group had made complaints to the Gujarat High Court claiming GFL was making them ill and damaging crops .
Pandya was asked by the court to sit on an expert witness panel , which discovered fluoride poisoning in people , land and animals caused by air and water pollution .
It discovered toxic effluent in the water stream and evidence of toxic waste not being properly disposed of by GFL .
The documents presented to the court have been seen by Live .
They recommended that GFL pay compensation and that villagers be diagnosed and monitored regularly .
None of the recommendations have been carried out .
The villagers have become so frustrated that they have now made a formal submission to India ’s Human Rights Commission requesting an investigation .
For the sake of objectivity , Live took its own samples of water from Radha ’s well , Vijay ’s village pumps and two other locations , as well as soil samples .
We had them tested at an independent government - registered laboratory in India .
The results were shocking .
They revealed dangerously high levels of fluoride and chloride – fluoride in the water was more than twice the international acceptable limit .
All the water fell well below any safe drinking standards and the soil had worryingly high levels of these chemicals .
A man with health problems in the village of Ranjit Nargar
We showed the results to environmental specialist Hiral Mehta .
‘ High flouride levels cause skeletal fluorosis in which people complain about joint pain , backache and rigid bones , ’ she says .
‘ The crop deterioration is another impact .
Your tests confirm previous investigations . ’
GFL claims it recycles or evaporates all the water it uses .
But campaigners say its ‘ evaporation pool ’ is n’t functioning properly , and that water leaks into the surrounding land .
There are also claims that flouride - contaminated effluent is n’t cleaned up properly before being disposed of .
Indeed , in 2004 the Gujarat Pollution Control Board warned GFL it was failing to provide proper facilities ‘ for storage , transport , handling and disposal of hazardous waste ’ .
It ’s not just a problem of contaminated water .
On November 30 2005 , just weeks before the company joined the carbon - credits scheme , there was a serious accident at the factory .
In the middle of the night factory alarms started ringing .
Villagers say that as they ran from their homes their eyes streamed , their throats burned and they struggled to breathe .
When they returned the next day they found several dead cattle that had bled at the nose and the mouth .
The villagers marched en masse to the factory and in the resulting scuffle two security guards were injured and GFL called the police .
They arrested 84 people – including women and children .
Today , 22 men still have charges outstanding against them .
‘ Our children live in fear because they hear us talking about our fears every day , ’ says a farmer .
‘ We all know the name Bhopal ( a 1984 industrial disaster in central India that claimed up to 10,000 deaths ) .
We think we ’ll be next . ’
‘ Carbon credits are a farce , a scam , ’ says environmental activist Pandya .
‘ It gives money to an industry that never was and never will be green .
When we saw GFL had become the first scheme to profit from carbon credits I was in shock .
When did this factory suddenly become green ?
I can tell you when – when it got paid to pretend it was . ’
In Gujarat shanty houses stand next to 21st century factories , many of which have been given carbon credits
It takes several phone calls and emails before Deepak Asher , one of GFL ’s directors , agrees to meet us – for lunch at a nearby five - star hotel .
He dismisses the villagers ’ allegations and at first even claims not to remember anything about the 2005 accident .
Eventually he admits , ‘ There was a leak caused by a gas tanker that toppled over , but it was all sorted quickly and it was quite a small event . ’
As for pollution , Asher is adamant the factory is n’t responsible for the villagers ’ complaints .
He says he ’s ‘ heard local stories about bitter water ’ , but insists the factory has conducted its own ‘ fully scientific tests ’ which prove the fluoride occurs naturally from fluoride deposits 60 miles away .
No other investigation – and there have been many , including the State Court panel and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board – has backed up this theory .
Indeed , we were told that if the fluoride came from natural deposits it would affect a much wider area , and not be concentrated in the villages around the factory .
Despite repeated pressing , Asher refuses to provide a copy of GFL ’s findings , citing that it ’s not information in the public domain .
‘ We are the only factory in the area and because of that we are a visible target .
The farmers do n’t understand what we do and they blame us unfairly for everything that goes wrong .
We ca n’t employ everyone locally because we need to bring skilled labour from outside , so they become resentful . ’
Live put its findings to GFL ’s British partner , Ineos .
A spokesman says links between the companies are limited and states that Ineos was unaware of previous local complaints against GFL .
Ineos also insists that under the terms of the carbon - credit relationship , it is only responsible for the technology it supplied and not for the rest of GFL .
Any possible water pollution or leaks of gases other than HFC23 , it states , is not its responsibility .
‘ Our relationship with GFL is confined to a relatively small project governed by the auspices of the UN , which is subject to regular independent third - party auditing , ’ says a spokesman .
‘ Therefore , we ’re confident that this project operates and is managed in a manner consistent with our ethical standards . ’
And the technology they provided to GFL has cut HFC23 emissions , something the company has since had certified by external auditors .
But emissions of other gases have n’t been audited , as they do n’t fall under the scheme .
This , say campaigners , is one of the flaws .
‘ How can one bit of the same factory be deemed green if the rest of it is clearly not ? ’ says Mahesh Pandya .
‘ The factories getting carbon - credits money were the serious polluters .
But how can you reward them for stopping polluting in one area , when they pollute in another ?
' And who were the victims of all the previous pollution they caused ?
The local farmers .
Surely they are the people who deserve to be compensated with the carbon - credits money .
Why does it all go into the pockets of the industry that caused the damage in the first place ?
‘ GFL has been polluting the surrounding soil and water for years , and villagers have been fighting them in court for the past 15 .
So how can Ineos claim not to know or care ?
Incidents like the gas leak make it even worse . ’
Globally , the overall impact on the environment is ambiguous .
Since developing countries do not yet have any national caps on emissions , companies can take the handsome payments they receive from carbon cuts in one plant and use the money to build new polluting factories .
Bulldozers develop the river bank while the smokestacks that litter the skyline pump black fumes into the air
Wider criticism of the carbon scheme is growing .
Kevin Smith from Carbon Trade
Watch says , ‘ The carbon market is riddled with projects like GFL .
It ’s not like this project is the bad apple – the whole barrel is rotten .
Time and again we ’re seeing evidence of gross injustices being carried out – people being evicted to make way for dams and waste incinerators being built in residential areas .
Carbon trading has been the subject of a very slick PR campaign portraying it as the answer to climate change , so investigations such as this are very important . ’
One of the main problems is the lack of accountability .
The companies receiving carbon credits are subject to international auditing .
But in many cases auditors do n’t make on - site visits , and the companies receiving credits pay the auditing firms a fee for their service , which is largely based on information the company itself provides .
Conservative MP
Tim Yeo is Chairman of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee , which in 2007 produced a report describing the UN ’s Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) as ‘ significantly flawed ’ .
He said our findings showed the importance of effective checks on companies involved in the scheme .
‘ Because of the sums of money involved and the way the CDM works , it needs very rigorous policing , ’ he says .
‘ There may well be cases where that ’s not happened .
Individual schemes are scattered all over the world , sometimes in inaccessible places .
The degree of transparency and scrutiny often falls short of what is necessary . ’
Pandya shows me a file of newspaper cuttings advertising public consultations – a requirement by companies in the scheme .
But most of the notices do n’t have a time or address , meaning the public ca n’t turn up .
The published announcement , however , is often enough for the auditor to tick that box .
GFL ’s auditor ’s concern is only with greenhouse gases .
They never visited the surrounding villages .
They did n’t talk to Vijay or Radha .
They did n’t assess whether there were other pollution problems , because under the scheme that ’s not taken into account .
Dr Alison Doig , senior climate - change advisor at Christian Aid , says , ‘ Live ’s investigation highlights exactly what ’s wrong with this flawed system , which is focused only on exchanging carbon credit globally , with no accounting for other environmental or social damage .
All carbon credits are doing is making some companies rich , while doing nothing to prevent global pollution .
It needs either abolition or total reform . ’
Back in the UK , we tell Patrick Birley at the European Climate Exchange what we found in India .
‘ The carbon - credits system is in place to reduce carbon emissions , not to save bunnies or solve all the world ’s problems , ’ he says .
‘ Is this system perfect ?
No .
Are some companies bending the rules ?
Probably .
Is that fair ?
No .
But without big industry on board , saving the planet is going nowhere .
At least this is a start . ’
THE GREAT CARBON CREDITS MERRY-GO-ROUND
In theory the carbon - credit trading scheme is a thoroughly modern and intelligent approach to reducing world pollution .
The graphic above explains the system – in a nutshell , rich First World companies are financially encouraged to help poorer Third World companies clean up their manufacturing processes .
They do this by accepting ‘ carbon caps ’ , or limits , which if exceeded can be replenished by purchasing carbon credits – via specialist traders – from manufacturers in the developing world .
In practice , however , there are loopholes that seriously threaten the schemes ’ credibility .
The most significant are these : they take into account only greenhouse gases , money made through trading credits can be used to expand a business so increasing pollution and , perhaps most questionably , auditors of the scheme are paid for by the companies .
CARBON CREDITS OR TOXIC DEBTS ?
Carbon credits have become such a profitable commodity that market speculators – hedge funds , banks and pension funds – have enthusiastically bought into them .
Traders buy and sell credits issued by both the UN and EU schemes .
For trading purposes , one allowance or Certified Emission Reduction
( CER ) is equivalent to one ton of CO2 emissions .
These credits can be sold privately or on the international market .
Louis Redshaw , head of environmental markets at Barclays Capital predicts that ‘ carbon will be the world ’s biggest commodity market – and it could become the world ’s biggest market overall . ’
But that was before the recession .
A global fall - off in manufacturing means that companies are producing far less carbon .
In recent months , companies in this position have dumped their credits on the market .
This has not only provided heavily polluting firms with funds to plug gaps in their balance sheets but has also pushed down prices .
Carbon has now dropped to such a level it ’s cheaper to burn polluting fossil fuels and buy up credits than find ways of reducing emissions .
Would cosmic rays turn a man into a fantastically stretchable being , human torch or just plain ( orange ) rocky thing ?
That 's a question that NASA may be about to answer , as they test the body 's endurance to space radiation .

If you 're wondering how NASA scientists plan to test the limits of radiation tolerance , you may be happy to know that they 're taking the Mythbusters approach , and just planning to shoot a dummy with a high energy proton beam until things go wrong , according to Space.com :
The " Phantom torso " dummy consists of natural bone , simulated skin and organs , and real human blood cells .
" We put blood cells in small tubes in the stomach and in some places in the bone marrow , " said Francis Cucinotta , chief scientist for NASA 's Radiation Program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
" One of the questions we have is whether the less shielded parts of the bone marrow will be [ much harder hit ] . " ... Apollo astronauts had a near - miss between the Apollo 16 and 17 missions to the moon , when an erupting sunspot unleashed a record - setting barrage of solar radiation in 1972 .
Researchers plan to recreate that event 's effects at NASA 's Space Radiation Lab at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , New York , by using a high - energy beam of protons on the European Space Agency 's Phantom Torso , named Matroshka .
Matroshka also has a NASA counterpart named Fred .
Both dummies have flown in experiments aboard the space shuttle and the International Space Station to show how chronic exposure to background radiation affects the human body .

If they do n't become super - elastic , then I 'm at least hoping that one of the dummies will develop the potential to turn green and super - strong in the event it ever gets angry .

Alleged internal documents and sensitive information from Twitter and its employees might be posted today on ne Graphic : Diego Aguirre ws sites and other Web outlets .
The source of this information is a French hacker who goes by the name of Hacker Croll .
The cybercriminal claims to have accessed personally sensitive information for several Twitter employees including personal accounts on PayPal , Amazon , AT&T , MobileMe , Facebook , business Gmail accounts , and the Web registrar account for Twitter.com , according to the French blog Korben .
Hacker Croll has also distributed some alleged internal documents to news sites and blogs , including a complete Twitter employee list and salary information ; food preferences of Twitter employees ; confidential contracts with companies such as Nokia , Samsung , Dell , AOL , Microsoft , and others ; a contact list of notable Web and entertainment personalities ; meeting reports ; applicant resumes ; and the original pitch for the infamous Twitter TV show .
After the news of the security breach became public , Twitter co-founder Evan Williams was contacted by TechCrunch to confirm the document theft .
Williams reportedly confirmed that Twitter did suffer an attack several weeks ago , but the event was not related to the attack in April when a hacker gained access to several high - profile user accounts and Twitter 's administrative functions .
The April hack was also committed by a cybercriminal going by the name of Hacker Croll .
Williams told TC the company is familiar with the list of information Hacker Croll obtained , and countered some of the hacker 's claims .
The Twitter co-founder confirmed the hacker gained access to his wife 's Gmail account -- where some of Williams 's credit card information was stored -- as well as an administrative employee 's Gmail account and a number of personal accounts of other Twitter employees .
Williams says Hacker Croll did not gain access to William 's Gmail account , and that Twitter has now taken further security measures to guard company property and internal documents .
Journalistic Dilemma
Things became more complicated when Hacker Croll e-mailed a compressed file of 310 alleged internal Twitter documents directly to TechCrunch .
The blog says it spent some time reviewing the information , and intends to publish some of the documents they obtained over the course of the day on Wednesday .
TC founder Michael Arrington says the site will not publish any sensitive information such as pass codes or personally embarrassing information ; however , TC will publish a variety of alleged documents including " financial projections , product plans and notes from executive strategy meetings , " and the original pitch for Twitter 's reality based television show .
" There is clearly an ethical line here that we do n't want to cross , " Arrington wrote in a blog post , " and the vast majority of these documents are n't going to be published , at least by us .
But a few of the documents have so much news value that we think it 's appropriate to publish them . "
Ethics Fallout
Britain's Guardian newspaper reporting on this story said it would not link to TC stories about the Twitter hack for legal reasons .
An online poll regarding the fate of the Twitter documents is also taking the temperature of Internet users .
At the time of this writing , 56 percent of the 622 respondents were against TC releasing the documents , while 32 percent were in favor , and 12 percent did n't care .
Many tech blog readers are also opposed to TC 's decision .
Readers said it was unfair for TC to publish the documents because they were unjustly " stolen " from Twitter , and therefore the data is out of bounds for publication .
To defend TC 's decision , Arrington paraphrases a comment from British newspaper magnate Lord Northcliffe who famously said , " News is what somebody somewhere wants to suppress ; all the rest is advertising . "
The site is arguing that if information lands in a journalist 's inbox it's fair game , no matter how the data was obtained .
It 's important to emphasize that TC has said it will not reprint any material that could compromise company security or potentially damage a person 's safety or career by revealing sensitive information .
Should the Information be Posted ?
The other issue is that news organizations are not in complete control of this alleged information , since Hacker Croll has the documents as well .
If the anonymous hacker wanted to do so , he or she could easily publish this information to his or her own blog or Website .
It 's also possible this information is in the hands of Wikileaks , but that site is unlikely to publish the information since it deals only with information of " political , diplomatic or ethical significance . "
If further news organizations obtain this information , they are likely to follow a similar path to TC or perhaps choose not to publish the information at all .
So the issue may not be what TechCrunch , the Guardian , PC World , or other news outlets will do with the information , but what Hacker Croll will do .
That may turn out to be nothing , according to Korben , who posted an alleged quote from the hacker who claimed to have breached Twitter staff accounts to teach Twitter a lesson about security , and demonstrate how easily security questions and passwords can be broken .
These claims of exposing security flaws are similar to boasts made by someone going by the name of Hacker Croll during the Twitter.com hack .
At that time , the hacker claimed he or she was able to access Twitter 's administrative accounts simply through " social engineering . "
Webmail Security
Last year , University of Tennessee at Knoxville student David Kernell was arrested on charges he hacked into a Yahoo Mail account used by then - vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
The e-mail messages obtained from the hack were eventually posted by Gawker , and were potentially damaging for Palin .
Kernell 's trial is set to begin on December 16 .
The Palin account was hacked by using Yahoo's password recovery page , similar to the ploy Hacker Croll used earlier this year to gain access to Twitter user and administrative accounts via Yahoo Mail .
That process seemed very simple , but what 's strange about the hack of Twitter 's Gmail accounts is that Google 's security process is not as simple as Yahoo 's allegedly was at the time of the Palin hack .
On the password recovery page , Google asks you for your username , and then requires you to enter a CAPTCHA .
Then Google sends a link to the e-mail address you originally entered when you signed up for a Google account .
If you do n't have access to that account , Google will not allow you to access your account by answering your security question until 24 hours after you 've received the security e-mail at your alternate account .
Yahoo Mail currently uses a similar password recovery method .
It 's not clear if this security measure was in place at the time Hacker Croll accessed the Gmail accounts associated with Twitter , but it does serve as a reminder that you must keep your information up to date and choose a security question that will be difficult for a hacker to figure out .

TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
For those who dismiss Miss Universe contests as parades of vacuous beauties in bikinis gushing about world peace , Japan has an alternative .

The Miss Universe Japan pageant , which selects who will represent the country on the global stage , is creating a new daredevil beauty queen through a punishing boot camp that would make many men cry .
The ideal contestant is modeled on the exotic , rough - and - tumble vixens of the James Bond 007 movies : seductive but also packing a decent right hook .
“ Traditional beauty contests are tacky .
They do n’t belong to this millennium .
They are from my grandmother ’s time , ” Miss Universe Japan ’s creator Ines Ligron told Reuters .
“ It ’s degrading to women to be judged on having perfect boobs and legs .
I ’m trying to prove you can win with your personality and intelligence .
“ I want to create ‘ Bond ’ girls .
A Bond girl is sexy , strong .
She is sensual , intrepid .
She can do anything .
And of course she has to have a killer body ! ” added the Frenchwoman , who launched her answer to the more traditional beauty competition in 1998 .
Ligron said she has been inspired in recent years by Halle Berry ’s bikini scene in the 007 movie “ Die Another Day ” and Angelina Jolie ’s Lara Croft character in “ Tomb Raider . ”
Her methods have culminated in Riyo Mori ’s crowning as Miss Universe in 2007 , a year after Kurara Chibana finished runner - up .
Mori and Chibana both got lucrative modeling contracts .

“ The Miss Universe directors always ask me ‘ Where did you find these girls ?
They ’re fierce !
That ’s always the word -- ‘ fierce ’ , ” Ligron said .
“ I want to change the perception of beauty . ”
‘ WORLD ’ IS NOT ENOUGH
Emily Miyasaka will look to continue Japan ’s success at this year ’s Miss Universe in the Bahamas in August after winning the Japanese qualifier earlier this week .
The 24 - year - old looked exhausted backstage after Monday ’s competition , as Ligron ’s training is often harsh .
At this year ’s boot camp , finalists went rock - climbing , tried base jumping and bashed each other around in jujitsu classes .
“ We ’ve also had the girls jump out of trees , ” said Ligron .
“ Swimming with crocodiles was another idea .
We also ran up and down 50 floors at Tokyo Midtown ( building ) .
They were destroyed . ”
A samurai sword - wielding Chibana was a big crowd favorite in Los Angeles three years before losing out to Puerto Rico ’s Zuleyka Rivera .
A major celebrity in Japan , Chibana has also made TV documentaries as a reporter in Uganda , Vietnam and Cambodia .
“ I think being a beauty queen just for the sake of it is a waste of time , ” said the 27 - year - old .
“ Miss Universe should be a stepping stone .
I want to go into politics in the future . ”
The Okinawa - born Chibana wants to become Japan ’s first female prime minister .
“ It could happen , ” she said .
“ But I want to do it through my own efforts and not just because I was second in Miss Universe . ”
As for her election manifesto ?
“ World peace is definitely up there ! ” Chibana said with a laugh .
Editor ’s note : Iason Athanasiadis was jailed from June 17 to July 5 in Tehran ’s Evin prison after covering Iran ’s presidential elections .
ISTANBUL | From the days of the shah , Evin prison has had a fearsome reputation in Iran as the place where political prisoners are taken for rough interrogation and even execution .
But the facility in northern Tehran appears to have been eclipsed since the disputed June 12 presidential election by perhaps dozens of informal detention sites spread throughout the Iranian capital and suburbs .
As thousands of Iranians turned out again Thursday to remember victims of the crackdown , several recently released prisoners said they were kept inside industrial containers , storerooms and a former Revolutionary Guards arms factory .
These places have been hastily converted into holding areas for many of those arrested in pro-democracy demonstrations .
Iranian officials have acknowledged that terrible abuses were committed in such places and that four Iranians have died in detention .
Among them was the son of an aide to Mohsen Rezaie , a former commander of the Revolutionary Guards and a presidential candidate , who died in Kahrizak , a facility in southern Tehran .
Reacting to harsh criticism from within Iran and abroad , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday ordered the closure of Kahrizak .
The government also released 140 prisoners .
Tehran - based journalist Hanif Mazruaie , in an interview with the Persian service of the BBC , said detainees had told him of being held in a poorly ventilated container in Kahrizak alongside 40 others .
Guards who brought detainees there on July 9 , the 10th anniversary of 1999 student riots , “ stripped them naked , struck them with pressured water and hit them violently with cables , ” Mr. Mazruaie told the BBC .
Another recent detainee , who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals , told The Washington Times that security forces “ herded us blindfolded into what I thought was a stadium , where they beat us solidly for three days and threatened to execute us .
They said to us that since we havent been registered officially , we dont exist so they could execute us . ”
Female prisoners emerging from Tehran ’s jails have complained that male guards beat them , pulled their hair and were in constant physical proximity with them despite Islamic laws that dictate prisoners be separated by sex and dealt with by same - sex guards .
Other prisoners have reported being held in police stations and being exposed to degrading practices such as being forced to lick toilet bowls , according to an unverified report published by a reformist news site called Mauj-e Sabz-e Azadi .
Hadi Ghaemi , a spokesman for the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , said Kahrizak had been used in the past for “ moral re-education ” of people found to have committed un -Islamic behavior .
He said it was unclear where the three other detainees had died .
Mr. Ghaemi said a recently released detainee told him that he was taken to four different places in eight days and that the first two were “ completely informal . ”
“ By the time he got to Evin , he felt safe , ” Mr. Ghaemi said .
He declined to name the detainee to protect him from further punishment .
Mr. Ghaemi said the regime was trying to replicate the crackdowns of the 1980s when the government executed numerous opposition supporters in Evin , but that it has been forced to back down and go on the defensive in the face of popular outrage .
“ The day and age of the population is very different now , ” Mr. Ghaemi said , noting that details of mistreatment have spread around the world .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she “ deplored ” the reported abuse of political prisoners in Iran .
“ We believe that it is imperative for [ Iran ] … to release political prisoners and treat them appropriately and humanely , ” she said .
The crackdown also has caused outrage within the Iranian political establishment .
In a letter to the outgoing minister of intelligence , Mehdi Karroubi , a cleric and presidential candidate , asked :
“ Is what is happening today … compatible with current Islamic laws in the country and democratic rules and culture ? …
I ask you whether ‘ prison ’ has a specific definition in the Islamic Republic of Iran or whether people can be kept in mosques , schools and cellars of offices and ministries without the knowledge of their families and defense lawyers and even the judiciary for days . ”
The letter was printed in the reformist newspaper E’temad-e Melli on Sunday .
Mehdi Khalaji , a specialist on Iranian politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , said “ the main reason behind [ Ayatollah ] Khamenei ’s order to close Kahrizak was to prevent the majlis [ parliament ] from doing an investigation on it like it is planning on investigating some detention centers . ”
Among the most notorious holding centers are the Gohardasht prison in the satellite town of Karaj and a site simply known as Minus 4 in the basement of the Interior Ministry in central Tehran .
Kazem Jalali , a spokesman for a parliamentary committee investigating prison conditions , has said he would be seeking access to Minus 4 .
Also known as Rajaee Shahr , Gohardasht has a large criminal ward and a high concentration of members of the Mujahideen-e Khalq , a Marxist - Islamist opposition group that was banned in the early years of the Islamic republic for waging an armed guerrilla campaign .
“ Important political prisoners are taken there and punished by being put in the open ward with common criminals , ” said one activist who requested anonymity .
“ Its the new Evin . ”
It used to be that political prisoners were taken to Section 209 of Evin , but “ the international community has put so much pressure on Iran that 209 has become a less threatening place , ” said a young leftist activist , who asked to be identified only by his first name , Hassan , and has spent time in the prison .
“ They ’ve painted it green , collapsed two isolation cells into one larger one and generally cleaned it up , ” he said .

On his radio show today Rush Limbaugh went after MSNBC’s Ed Schultz for showing his support of Sonia Sotomayor .
Limbaugh called Schultz ’s The Ed Show , “ a show named after a horse . ”
He also said , “ I think they brought the horse out of retirement to host it . ”
Do we really want to make this about looks , Rush ?
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :

Limbaugh said , “ Now there ’s a show on MSNBC named after a horse , The Ed Show , the talking horse .
I think they brought the horse out of retirement to host to show , and the horse , Mr. Ed is talking to a former CIA agent Jack Rice about the Sotomayor hearings and Mr. Ed , the horse , says to the CIA officer I think you come from a profession where keeping your cool is pretty important , did she pass the test today ? ”
Here is the segment that Limbaugh is referring to ( Rice is at the 10:10 mark ) :
Ed Schultz has been mocking Limbaugh for months , and apparently , Limbaugh just realized that Ed Schultz has a TV show .
Let ’s face it , The Ed Show is doing better than 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. was in that time slot , but Schultz ’s show is usually in next to last place in the cable news 6 PM ratings .
It is not exactly a ratings juggernaut .
I would have thought that Limbaugh would have gone after Keith Olbermann first .
Rush Limbaugh is not one to be insulting someone else ’s looks .
Limbaugh is n’t exactly any sort of prize himself .
He definitely has a face for radio .
I am not a big fan of Ed “ single payer ” Schultz .
I do n’t think his style translates that well to television .
He is not as smooth or as interesting as Matthews , Olbermann , and Maddow , but he tries , and he does bring a dose of blue collar liberalism to MSNBC .
Ed has finally made the big time .
He is on Rush Limbaugh ’s enemies list .
As far as Limbaugh versus Schultz is concerned , my opinion is that it always better to look like a horse than to sound like an ass .

Hannity investigates Sonia Sotomayor ’s most controversial case !
That is a lot of front page space , many of which were main headlines , devoted to smearing Sonia Sotomayor .
I ’d like to point out an example of Fox News bias and unfair reporting , specifically the “ Wise Latinas Better Than White Males ” headline made to look like a quote with the “ Sotomayor : ” preface .
The actual quote is , “ I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n’t lived that life . ”

21 - year - old Karen Gillan has been named as the new companion for series five of Doctor Who .
The Scottish actress will star alongside Matt Smith , who takes over from David Tennant as The Doctor in series five of the long - running cult show .
" I am absolutely over the moon at being chosen to play the Doctor 's new companion , " said Gillan .
" The show is such a massive phenomenon that I can't quite believe I am going to be a part of it .
Matt Smith is an incredible actor and it is going to be so much fun to act alongside him – I just can't wait to get started ! "
Gillan previously appeared in Who as a soothsayer in the series four episode ' The Fires of Pompeii ' .
Her other credits include The Kevin Bishop Show , Rebus and Stacked .
Of Gillan 's casting , new executive producer Steven Moffat said : " We saw some amazing actresses for this part , but when Karen came through the door the game was up .
Funny , and clever , and gorgeous , and sexy .
Or Scottish , which is the quick way of saying it .
A generation of little girls will want to be her .
And a generation of little boys will want them to be her too . "
Rumoured contenders for the role of Matt Smith 's assistant had included Lily Allen , Kelly Brook , Georgia Moffett and Skins star Hannah Murray .
Filming on the new series will begin in July for transmission around Easter 2010 .
Tennant 's final episodes will air this Christmas .

First off , thanks to Abel Pharmboy ( a pseudonym ) at the blog Terra Sigillata , whose blog post you should read .
Although you would n't know it from the original diary , the AP article is in fact critical about the free pass ( scientifically , and on a regulatory basis ) given to " alternative medicine " .
For example :
An Associated Press review of dozens of studies and interviews with more than 100 sources found an underground medical system operating in plain sight , with a different standard than the rest of medical care , and millions of people using it on blind faith .
This hits the nail on the head regarding how people address many " alternative " therapies : they have faith that they work , regardless of the evidence .
And the AP article points out that big businesses profit on this faith , without even being required to show the safety that " Big Pharma " does .
As Abel says :
Like " Big Pharma , " there really is such an industry as " Big Woo " that co-opts a little science with classic marketing techniques : " Herbals are medicines , " with good and bad effects , said Bruce Silverglade of the consumer group Center for Science in the Public Interest .
Contrary to their little - guy image , many of these products are made by big businesses .
Ingredients and their countries of origin are a mystery to consumers .
They are marketed in ways that manipulate emotions , just like ads for hot cars and cool clothes .
Some make claims that average people can't parse as proof of effectiveness or blather , like " restores cell - to - cell communication . "
The AP article is quite even - handed .
It points out that :
Mainstream medicine and prescription drugs have problems , too .
Popular drugs such as the painkillers Vioxx and Bextra have been pulled from the market after serious side effects emerged once they were widely used by consumers .
But at least there are regulatory systems , guideline - setting groups and watchdog agencies helping to keep traditional medicine in line .
The safety net for alternative medicine is far flimsier .
I stand by what I said elsewhere :
" Alternative Medicine " , when proven to work , is simply called " medicine " .
" Alternative medicine " is otherwise treatments that are either : ( a ) unproven , in which case their supporters should seek definitive trials comparing them to standard treatments , or no treatments at all ; ( b ) proven not to work , in which case those who promote their use are at best uninformed or at worst quacks and frauds ; ( c ) unprovable , because they rely on some supernatural effect .
( Often , in this last case , proponents invoke the word " quantum " in explaining the unobservable / unmeasurable effects . )
There are problems in considering " alternative medicine " as a different animal than medicine .
One major problem is that it leads to different standards of proof that something works .
This has been unfortunately institutionalized the NIH 's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine .
Here 's the conclusion from an article in the journal Science ( Marcus and Grollman , Science , 313 5785 ; 301-302 , in case the link does n't work for you ) concludes as follows :
Conclusions
We believe that NCCAM funds proposals of dubious merit ; its research agenda is shaped more by politics than by science ; and it is structured by its charter in a manner that precludes an independent review of its performance .
The central issue is not whether research into alternative therapies should be supported by NIH .
In view of the popularity of alternative therapies , it is appropriate to evaluate the efficacy and safety of selected treatments .
The issue is that the administration of research by NCCAM falls below the standards of other NIH institutes and that the evaluation of alternative therapies could be performed by mechanisms that are already in place at NIH .
We do not question the qualifications or integrity of Stephen Straus and his staff .
However , because of the constraints under which it operates , NCCAM is unable to implement a research agenda that addresses legitimate scientific opportunities or health - care needs ( 30 ) .
Applicants for NCCAM grants must follow the center 's guidelines that stipulate which therapies are eligible for study .
In contrast , applicants to NIH institutes can propose any project that may provide new insights into human biology or the pathogenesis or treatment of disease .
Oh , and for the discussion , can we keep on topic ?
Read the full AP article at the link , come back , and discuss .
Let 's avoid all assertions of authority by visiting instructorship or the like , or any claims of genius by public acclamation , like my new all - time favorite diarist response to a comment ( emphasis , and redactions in brackets , are mine ) :
From a commenter
To me , you appear prima facie to be a self - proclaimed genius who dismisses or insults anyone who disagrees with you or even asks a question .
You might as well be Korzybski with his " General Semantics " or L. Ron Hubbard with his " Scientology " or Nikolai Tesla or Buckminster Fuller or Ayn Rand .
You think you have the answer and anyone who disagrees with you is obviously an idiot .
You remind me of my absolutist grandfather ( who was a preacher who did n't allow any disagreement ) .

UCLA has appealed state regulators ’ findings of serious workplace - safety violations in the fatal burning of a staff research assistant last year in a lab fire .
The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health found last month that Sheri Sangji , 23 , was not properly trained and was not wearing protective clothing Dec. 29 when an experiment with air - sensitive chemicals burst into flames .
University officials say they have made the required changes and have paid the more than $ 31,000 in fines assessed by regulators .
Kevin Reed , vice chancellor for legal affairs , said the May 26 appeal will allow UCLA to stipulate that it admits no fault in connection with Cal / OSHA ’s findings , a move aimed at limiting the university ’s liability .
Advertisement
The appeal is necessary to make clear “ that there was no citation or finding that can be used against the university in any future proceeding , ” Reed said in a statement .
Such proceedings might include lawsuits by labor unions or criminal action by prosecutors , Reed said in an interview .
Cal / OSHA officials have said they routinely present their findings in death cases to district attorneys for review .
Workers ’ compensation rules may limit the family ’s legal options .
But Sangji ’s sister , Naveen , said the family is pushing for an investigation by the district attorney .
More than 1,300 people have signed an online petition urging one .
“ We would like to see the district attorney take this up , ” said Naveen Sangji , a Harvard medical student who has been critical of the investigations by UCLA and Cal / OSHA .
“ It is time for an independent party to step up , someone who is not affiliated with UCLA . ”
Advertisement
Among other things , Cal / OSHA cited UCLA for not addressing deficiencies noted in an internal safety inspection two months before the fatal fire in professor Patrick Harran ’s organic chemistry laboratory , where Sheri Sangji worked , including a finding that workers were not wearing lab coats .
When the lab fire occurred , Sangji was transferring about 2 ounces of t- butyl lithium from one sealed container to another when a plastic syringe came apart in her hands , spewing a chemical compound that ignites when exposed to air .
The flash fire set ablaze her rubber gloves and synthetic sweater , causing serious burns over nearly half of her body .
She died 18 days later .
Cal / OSHA ’s $ 31,875 fine included $ 18,000 for Sangji ’s lack of a lab coat , which might have kept her highly flammable sweater from catching fire .

Reed said in his statement that many of the corrective measures ordered by UCLA inspectors had been completed before the Dec. 29 fire but were not properly documented .
“ Accordingly , the campus filed a technical appeal on these limited grounds , ” he said .
Although UCLA ’s appeal asserts that none of the safety orders cited by Cal / OSHA were violated , Reed said the legal maneuver “ does not question the serious nature of the issues ” the safety regulators raised .
“ On the contrary , ” he said , “ it is UCLA ’s goal to operate a laboratory safety program that is a model for other universities , and the campus implemented multiple and far - reaching improvements as a result of the comprehensive review ordered by the chancellor after the accident . ”

A simple string substitution library that supports " $ " - based substitution .
Substitution uses the following rules :
" $ $ " is an escape ; it is replaced with a single " $ " .
" $identifier " names a substitution placeholder matching a mapping key of " identifier " .
" identifier " must spell a Haskell identifier .
The first non-identifier character after the " $ " character terminates this placeholder specification .
" $ {identifier} " is equivalent to " $identifier " .
It is required when valid identifier characters follow the placeholder but are not part of the placeholder , such as " ${noun}ification " .
Any other apperance of " $ " in the string will result in an error being raised .
Here is an example of a simple substitution :
import qualified Data.ByteString .
Lazy .
Char8 as B import Text .
Template context = Map.fromList . map packPair where packPair ( x , y ) = ( B.pack x , B.pack y ) helloTemplate = B.pack " Hello , $ name !
Want some $ {fruit}s ? " helloContext = context [ ( " name " , " Johan " ) , ( " fruit " , " banana " ) ] main = B.putStrLn $ substitute helloTemplate helloContext
MOSCOW / AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s state anti-monopoly service launched a probe of Microsoft Corp over cutbacks in supplies of the Windows XP operating system in Russia , it said on Thursday .
Microsoft Corp 's Windows XP software products are displayed at a shop in Seoul November 8 , 2004 .
REUTERS / You Sung-Ho
The agency said it thought Microsoft had violated antimonopoly legislation by cutting delivery of Windows XP to Russia both separately and pre-installed on personal computers , as well as in its pricing policy on the product .
“ Analysis of the market for various operating systems shows that the transfer to the new Windows Vista operating system is occurring while demand for the previous operating system , Windows XP , continues , ” the service said .
“ Demand for separately packaged and pre-installed versions of Windows XP is also confirmed by retailers and the number of orders from the government . ”
It said it would consider the case on July 24 , 2009 .
Microsoft ’s Moscow office said it had not received an official query from the anti-monopoly service .
“ We ( have ) always answered antimonopoly service questions in full and intend to continue this practice in future , ” Microsoft spokeswoman Marina Levina said by telephone .
The anti-monopoly service is regularly in contact with Russian companies but full - scale investigations are not common .
The suit bears no immediate resemblance to past antitrust claims against Microsoft , target of a U.S. antitrust lawsuit in the United States a decade ago , and which was fined 500 million euros ( $ 708.4 million ) by the European Commission in 2004 for anti-competitive behavior in media player and server software .
The commission later fined Microsoft an additional 900 million euros for non-compliance but the software maker is appealing against that ruling .
NEW DELHI : India has asked the Chinese government to take action against bootleggers who are making fake drugs and shipping them abroad with ` Made in India ' tags as a tactic to cover the origin .
The commerce department has lodged a complaint with the Chinese embassy here and the Indian embassy in Beijing has been asked to push for action against the impostors .
The Indian action comes after Nigeria 's pharma regulator reported the detention of a large consignment of fake drugs for treating malaria .
The consignment carried ` Made in India ' labels but was produced in China .
A laboratory test of the consignment of Maloxine and Amalar tablets proved these were fake .
Had the drugs flowed into the market , over 600,000 lives would have been affected .
After getting information from Nigerian authorities , the Indian high commissioner in Nigeria indicated that the consignment containing drugs were produced , packed and shipped from China .
Fake Chinese drugs with ` Made in India ' tag hurts reputation of Indian pharmaceuticals industry and is expected to give rise to more trouble for genuine Indian consignments to Africa and elsewhere transiting through Europe .
The government is making efforts at brand promotion of Indian pharmaceuticals and generic drugs in Africa .
An Indian delegation recently met African health ministers and officials to assure them that genuine Indian generic pharma was as safe as patented versions and was available at more reasonable prices .
The African ministers were also informed that the Indian government had launched a massive offensive against manufacture and sale of spurious medicines .
Drug Controller General of India regularly conducts on - the - spot inspections and lift samples at random .
A study of samples of drugs tested all over the country in the last 4 - 5 years revealed that about 0.3 % to 0.4 % of around 40,000 samples fell within the category of spurious drugs .
My wife and children surprised me with the single greatest Father ’s Day gift any comic book geek could dream of .
My wife commissioned local artist , Billy Penn ( Hot Shot & Mighty Girl , Savage Dragon ) , to do a comic book cover featuring me .
Behold the astonishing result …
Click the image for a larger version .
On the left is me as I currently am , on the right is me as I was 20 years ago , hence the title , “ Shag of Two Eras ” .
In the middle in mortal peril are my nine year old step - son and three year old daughter .
An amazing illustration !
My family presented me with an 11×17 framed print of the cover on Father ’s Day morning .
I was totally stunned .
Even now , hours later , I ca n’t take my eyes off it .
What an incredibly thoughtful gift to give to a comic book geek like me .
In case you ’re not familiar with the homage , check out the cover of Flash # 123 below ( September 1961 ) .
This is one of the most important comic books in publishing history .
Just for reference , here are pictures of me nowadays and back in 1988 .
I ’ve known the artist , Billy Penn , for over 15 years .
He shopped at the comic book store I managed when he was in high school .
Now he ’s a high school art teacher himself .
He ’s incredibly skilled and has a few published works , including Platinum Studio ’s Hot Shot and Mighty Girl original graphic novel , and a back - up story in Savage Dragon # 130 .
I ’ve always been impressed with the way he draws faces .
They are so wonderfully expressive !
I ’m amazed at Billy ’s attention to detail in the commission he did for my wife !
He reproduced so many details from the Flash cover while making them specific to me .
Some fun details that you might miss include : the shape of the comic logo , the ONCE UPON A GEEK circle in the top left , the date and the comics code authority seal , the body language of the Flashes and the two Shags , the skyline of my hometown in the background , all the goofy 80 ’s trappings legitimately worn by me back then , and the accuracy of my children ’s eye color and clothing .
As I mentioned , I was completely surprised and stunned .
What an unbelievable gift !!!
Its comic books and my children … all rolled up into one .
My wife is an amazing woman .
This is a gift I ’ll cherish forever .
Less than 2C
Arctic sea icecap disappears , leaving polar bears homeless and changing the Earth 's energy balance dramatically as reflective ice is replaced during summer months by darker sea surface .
Now expected by 2030 or even earlier .
Tropical coral reefs suffer severe and repeated bleaching episodes due to hotter ocean waters , killing off most coral and delivering a hammer blow to marine biodiversity .
Droughts spread through the sub- tropics , accompanied by heatwaves and intense wildfires .
Worst - hit are the Mediterranean , the south - west United States , southern Africa and Australia .
2C-3C
Summer heatwaves such as that in Europe in 2003 , which killed 30,000 people , become annual events .
Extreme heat sees temperatures reaching the low 40s Celsius in southern England .
Amazon rainforest crosses a " tipping point " where extreme heat and lower rainfall makes the forest unviable - much of it burns and is replaced by desert and savannah .
Dissolved CO2 turns the oceans increasingly acidic , destroying remaining coral reefs and wiping out many species of plankton which are the basis of the marine food chain .
Several metres of sea level rise is now inevitable as the Greenland ice sheet disappears .
3C - 4C
Glacier and snow - melt in the world 's mountain chains depletes freshwater flows to downstream cities and agricultural land .
Most affected are California , Peru , Pakistan and China .
Global food production is under threat as key breadbaskets in Europe , Asia and the United States suffer drought , and heatwaves outstrip the tolerance of crops .
The Gulf Stream current declines significantly .
Cooling in Europe is unlikely due to global warming , but oceanic changes alter weather patterns and lead to higher than average sea level rise in the eastern US and UK .
4C-5C
Another tipping point sees massive amounts of methane - a potent greenhouse gas - released by melting Siberian permafrost , further boosting global warming .
Much human habitation in southern Europe , north Africa , the Middle East and other sub- tropical areas is rendered unviable due to excessive heat and drought .
The focus of civilisation moves towards the poles , where temperatures remain cool enough for crops , and rainfall - albeit with severe floods - persists .
All sea ice is gone from both poles ; mountain glaciers are gone from the Andes , Alps and Rockies .
5C -6C
Global average temperatures are now hotter than for 50 m years .
The Arctic region sees temperatures rise much higher than average - up to 20C - meaning the entire Arctic is now ice - free all year round .
Most of the topics , sub - tropics and even lower mid-latitudes are too hot to be inhabitable .
Sea level rise is now sufficiently rapid that coastal cities across the world are largely abandoned .
6C and above
Danger of " runaway warming " , perhaps spurred by release of oceanic methane hydrates .
Could the surface of the Earth become like Venus , entirely uninhabitable ?
Most sea life is dead .
Human refuges now confined entirely to highland areas and the polar regions .
Human population is drastically reduced .
Perhaps 90 % of species become extinct , rivalling the worst mass extinctions in the Earth 's 4.5 billion - year history .

Witnesses have described scenes of utter devastation after a passenger jet exploded and ploughed into a field in north - west Iran .
All 153 passengers and 15 crew were killed when the Russian - made Caspian Airlines Tupolev jet crashed 16 minutes after take - off .
It was on its way to the Armenian capital Yerevan , and many of the passengers were Armenian or Iranians of Armenian descent .
Witnesses said the plane burst into flames before falling out of the air , and shattered into small pieces as it ploughed into farmland .
Apart from a wing there was barely any sign of the plane and only a few body parts scattered around the deep trench which the impact left in the field .
Authorities say the wreckage and corpses were totally consumed by the flames .
Among the dead were eight members of Iran 's national junior judo team and two coaches , and , reportedly , the head of Georgia 's diplomatic mission in Tehran .
Weeping relatives and friends gathered at Yerevan airport where a notice on a wall listed people who were on board .
Doctors treated relatives for shock and heart problems .
Fina Karapetian , an Armenian in her 30s , said her sister and two nephews , 11 and 6 , were on board the crashed plane .
" I heard everyone in the aircraft has died .
What will I do without Armen and Vahe , " she said , before fainting .
Iranian television showed footage of debris and body parts and a smoking trench with mangled pieces of metal scattered around .
Senior Iranian provincial official , Sirous Saberi , said the aircraft had had technical problems and tried to make an emergency landing .
" Unfortunately the plane caught fire in the air and it crashed , " he said .
A witness said he had seen the plane 's left engine on fire in the air , state broadcaster IRIB said .
But state radio said the pilot had made no mention of any technical problem in a taped conversation with a control tower .
" On board the plane there were 151 adults , 2 children and 15 crew members , " Caspian Airline 's representative in Yerevan Arlen Davudyan said at the airport .
" Fifteen or sixteen minutes after take - off the plane fell near the Iranian city Qazvin about 150 kilometres north of Tehran , " he said , adding it was a Tu-154 .
He said the cause of the crash was not clear nor had the black box been found .
SLEEPY EYE , Minn. , May 20 ( UPI ) --
An arrest warrant was issued for the mother of a Minnesota teen after the pair missed a court hearing on the son's fight against chemotherapy , police said .
Colleen Hauser and her son , Daniel , 13 , have been missing from their Sleepy Eye , Minn. , farm since Monday after they went to a medical appointment that indicated the son's cancer was worsening , the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported Wednesday .

Only the boy 's father , Anthony Hauser , was in court Tuesday for the hearing called to review a court - ordered X - ray to assess whether the younger Hauser 's Hodgkin 's lymphoma was getting worse .
The father said he did n't know the whereabouts of his wife or son .
Brown County , Minn. , District Judge John Rodenberg ruled last week Daniel Hauser must receive chemotherapy even though the treatment goes against the family 's spiritual beliefs and wishes .
The Hausers belong to the Nemenhah , a quasi-American Indian group favoring natural remedies and opposes medicine that attacks or harms the body .
The warrant was issued so police nationwide can apprehend Colleen Hauser , Brown County Attorney James Olsen said .
While she could be arrested for failing to appear in court or violating a court order , Olson said the goal of the warrant is to find the son , not punish the mother .
If Daniel Hauser is found , the judge ordered he be placed in foster care and evaluated by a cancer specialist immediately , Olson said .
During the trial , doctors testified the teen had as much as a 90 percent chance of survival with the treatment and a 95 percent chance of death without it .
He received one of seven recommended rounds of chemo - therapy after his cancer was diagnosed in January , but did n't show up for the rest .
Without a public option , the other parties that comprise America ’s non-system of health care — private insurers , doctors , hospitals , drug companies , and medical suppliers — have little or no incentive to supply high - quality care at a lower cost than they do now .
Which is precisely why the public option has become such a lightening rod .
The American Medical Association is dead - set against it , Big Pharma rejects it out of hand , and the biggest insurance companies wo n’t consider it .
No other issue in the current health - care debate is as fiercely opposed by the medical establishment and their lobbies now swarming over Capitol Hill .
Of course , they do n’t want it .
A public option would squeeze their profits and force them to undertake major reforms .
That ’s the whole point .
Critics say the public option is really a Trojan horse for a government takeover of all of health insurance .
But nothing could be further from the truth .
It ’s an option .
No one has to choose it .
Individuals and families will merely be invited to compare costs and outcomes .
Presumably they will choose the public plan only if it offers them and their families the best deal — more and better health care for less .
Private insurers say a public option would have an unfair advantage in achieving this goal .
Being the one public plan , it will have large economies of scale that will enable it to negotiate more favorable terms with pharmaceutical companies and other providers .
But why , exactly , is this unfair ?
Is n’t the whole point of cost containment to provide the public with health care on more favorable terms ?
If the public plan negotiates better terms — thereby demonstrating that drug companies and other providers can meet them — private plans could seek similar deals .
But , say the critics , the public plan starts off with an unfair advantage because it ’s likely to have lower administrative costs .
That may be true —
Medicare ’s administrative costs per enrollee are a small fraction of typical private insurance costs — but here again , why exactly is this unfair ?
Is n’t one of the goals of health - care cost containment to lower administrative costs ?
If the public option pushes private plans to trim their bureaucracies and become more efficient , that ’s fine .
Critics complain that a public plan has an inherent advantage over private plans because the public wo n’t have to show profits .
But plenty of private plans are already not - for - profit .
And if nonprofit plans can offer high - quality health care more cheaply than for - profit plans , why should for - profit plans be coddled ?
The public plan would merely force profit - making private plans to take whatever steps were necessary to become more competitive .
Once again , that ’s a plus .
Critics charge that the public plan will be subsidized by the government .
Here they have their facts wrong .
Under every plan that ’s being discussed on Capitol Hill , subsidies go to individuals and families who need them in order to afford health care , not to a public plan .
Individuals and families use the subsidies to shop for the best care they can find .
They ’re free to choose the public plan , but that ’s only one option .
They could take their subsidy and buy a private plan just as easily .
Legislation should also make crystal clear that the public plan , for its part , may not dip into general revenues to cover its costs .
It must pay for itself .
And any government entity that oversees the health - insurance pool or acts as referee in setting ground rules for all plans must not favor the public plan .
Finally , critics say that because of its breadth and national reach , the public plan will be able to collect and analyze patient information on a large scale to discover the best ways to improve care .
The public plan might even allow clinicians who form accountable - care organizations to keep a portion of the savings they generate .
Those opposed to a public option ask how private plans can ever compete with all this .
The answer is they can and should .
It ’s the only way we have a prayer of taming health - care costs .
But here ’s some good news for the private plans .
The information gleaned by the public plan about best practices will be made available to the private plans as they try to achieve the same or better outputs .
As a practical matter , the choice people make between private plans and a public one is likely to function as a check on both .
Such competition will encourage private plans to do better — offering more value at less cost .
At the same time , it will encourage the public plan to be as flexible as possible .
In this way , private and public plans will offer one other benchmarks of what ’s possible and desirable .
Mr. Obama says he wants a public plan .
But the strength of the opposition to it , along with his own commitment to making the emerging bill “ bipartisan , ” is leading toward some oddball compromises .
One would substitute nonprofit health insurance cooperatives for a public plan .
But such cooperatives would lack the scale and authority to negotiate lower rates with drug companies and other providers , collect wide data on outcomes , or effect major change in the system .
Another emerging compromise is to hold off on a public option altogether unless or until private insurers fail to meet some targets for expanding coverage and lowering health - care costs years from now .
But without a public option from the start , private insurers wo n’t have the incentives or system - wide model they need to reach these targets .
And in politics , years from now usually means never .
To get health care moving again in Congress , the president will have to be clear about how to deal with its costs and whether and how a public plan is to be included as an option .
The two are intimately related .
Enough talk .
He should come out swinging for the public option .

I ’ve always associated Topps with their amazing baseball cards but I had no idea that they ever did anything this clever :
In 1983 they had a series of “ Video Arcade Gum ” which came in individual boxes that were shaped like ( you guessed it ) video arcade games !
I ’m surprised that this product never took off because I do n’t remember seeing it back in the day .
The games they featured included Donkey Kong , Q*bert , Zaxxon , Frogger and Centipede .
The quality of these package designs looks great :
These are the selling points from the sales sheet : “ Now kids can own a miniaturized version of their favorite Video Arcade Machines ” :
The point of purchase display they came with also looks amazing as well :
I wish these were still on sale today !

ASIA'S SITE - MAKING INFO !
OK , so maybe you wanna be a webmaster , or maybe you just wanna make your site look identical to mine .
( you laugh , but I 've seen sites that cut and pasted entire pages of mine , right down to the purple rain background and beating hearts - and then just stuck in their own text ! )
Well , I 'll take it as a compliment , but the truth is , it 's really not that hard to do your own page !
There is n't a thing on this site that I did n't do by hand myself , and although it can get time - consuming , HTML looks more intimidating than it is .
Unfortunately for those of you looking for a big shortcut , I do all my HTML in notepad .
I find the HTML website - making programs to be a waste of time and money .
I swear , HTML is so simple and easy to learn , that by the time you struggle through working the website - making program , you could have just typed it out in notepad yourself .
( I found that out the hard way ! )
But whether you do your pages by hand or with a program , you gotta get the book " Creating Cool Web Pages with HTML " ...
" CREATING COOL WEB PAGES WITH HTML " by Dave Taylor -
This book was my bible for many months , and I still consult it whenever I have a question .
Website - helper programs come with either no instructions , or they 're written by people who program security for the Pentagon for fun .
So if you are a real beginner , you gotta have this book , ' cause Dave will explain all the gobbledygook to you in plain english .
Without his book , I would have given up on the whole webmaster thing in frustration , and my site would n't be here !
Even more advanced site - makers can pick up neat tips and tricks here , since it covers everything from defining the basic HTML words , to beginning cgi-scripting , from teaching you what a .gif is , to making your own image - maps .
Most people do use some sort of software to help them in their early site - making endeavors , and I tried that route as well .
As a complete newbie , I went to the store and bought random stuff that looked like it might help : MICROSOFT FRONTPAGE - great for beginners !
You do n't need to know any HTML at all , and you can still make a decent site with this .
It 's a WYSIWYG ( What You See Is What You Get ) program , which means you place everything where you want it on the screen , and the program writes up the HTML for you .
You can view the HTML anytime , which helps you learn as you go .
It 's also supposed to send and retrieve your pages from your site , but I was never able to figure that part out .
When you get more advanced , Frontpage still has two very handy uses .
It 's a great time - saver for making big annoying tables ( or tables within tables ) , and it makes transparent gifs instantly , which means no more cheesy square pictures !
SOFTQUAD's HOTMETAL PRO - assumes you 're already familiar with the HTML language .
This program is a little more versatile than Microsoft FrontPage , because you manipulate the actual HTML , but you better know how to get what you want , since you 're working with little HTML tags instead of a WYSIWYG screen .
HotMetalPro also points out errors it finds in your HTML coding , but as new HTML words and phrases evolve , the program quickly becomes obsolete , restricting your ability to use the latest cool stuff on your page .
I found that once I was familiar enough with HTML to use HotMetal Pro , I could program more quickly and with less hassle on a blank notepad page .
NETSCAPE 3.0 GOLD - another WYSIWYG program created for beginners .
What I liked about Netscape is that you work on your page online , so your page looks just like it will to everyone else with Netscape ( this eliminates the occasional ugly surprise when you see your page live online for the first time ) .
But Netscape is missing something that beginners really like - a good instruction manual .
I floundered around in a giant guessing game for hours , until the final straw , when I realised that Netscape was making assumptions and changing some of my HTML behind my back - making me waste more time fixing everything .
I dashed back to the simplicity of Microsoft FrontPage .
There are n't too many things to learn with HTML , so one of the big differences between a boring site and an attention - getting site is what you can do with Photoshop .
ADOBE PHOTOSHOP - this program is heralded by pros as the best ( and it is ) , but not necessarily for beginners , because ( a ) it 's very , very expensive , and ( b ) it 's like buying a nuclear power plant for a kid who wanted a test tube kit .
I had Adobe for a year before I was able to make any good use of this giant , confusing collection of bells and whistles , and only after I had mastered other , easier photoshop programs first .
Shelling out the bucks for this is not a shortcut to cool graphics ; you have to acquire the skills , patience , and know - how first .
Just as I got comfortable with Adobe 3.0 , they released 4.0 ( of course ) .
I rushed to get my paws on it , but do n't waste your dough .
There 's nothing awesome on it ; they just moved everything around to annoy me , and make it seem new .
" PHOTOSHOP FOR DUMMIES " by Deke McClelland - if you have n't checked out the " Dummies " series yet , you 're missing out !
I have a bookshelf lined with various dummies books , because they really kick butt .
They talk to you like I do , in plain English , with a sense of humor , so you do n't get bored .
Photoshop for Dummies is a comprehensive guide that explains what all those little icons and thingys in Photoshop are for , and how to use them .
I had Photoshop for two years and never figured out what half the stupid buttons were supposed to do , so reading this book was like solving the mysteries of Stonehenge !
" DESIGNING WEB GRAPHICS " by Lynda Weinman -
This book is great for tips and tricks on making all sorts of cool graphics for your site .
It 's got all the basics , like the difference between ' gifs ' and ' jpgs ' , and more advanced stuffs , like working with hexadecimal colors .
It also teaches different ways to compress your graphics , working with tables , and making icons , logos , and buttons , and more .
This book is very , very helpful !
And to make those neat little moving things I have all over my site , I use :
GIF ANIMATOR !
( also called ' Gif Construction Set for Windows ' 95 ' ) -
One of the handiest , awesomest free programs around , this is what I used to make the little beating hearts , and the electric dividers on my pages !
You can download Gif Animator for free from their site !
You can also make neat little banners that scroll across the page with this !
If you have n't given up hope on the whole idea of ever being a webmaster yet , why not check out my buddy 's site The HTML Temple !
His site delves more deeply into the actual HTML programming language , with tips and tricks for both newbies and more advanced webworkers !
Wow - Lots of info for an adult site , huh !
So now you can pretend you were just doing legitimate research for work , right ?
LOL !
Good luck on your site !

Men At Work had two number one singles in the US A music publisher that says Australian band Men At Work stole a melody from a children 's song in hit Down Under has won the first stage of a court battle .
Larrikin claims the flute riff from the 1981 hit is stolen from Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree , written by Marion Sinclair for the Girl Guides in 1934 .
The band disputed Larrikin 's claim that it bought the song 's copyright in 1990 .
But a judge in Sydney has ruled that the publisher does own the song , clearing the way for a plagiarism case .
Larrikin Music is suing Sony BMG and EMI for breach of copyright and is seeking royalties from the hit 80s song .
The publisher began the action after the alleged similarities were pointed out in a music quiz programme shown in Australia in 2007 .

They had also argued that the Kookaburra copyright was never properly signed over by Sinclair - who died in 1988 - and still belonged to the Girl Guides movement .
No date has been set for the next hearing .
Down Under , a number one in Australia , the US and the UK , tells the story of an Australian backpacker touring the world .

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland /23
by Michele Simionato
May 19 , 2009
Summary
In episode 19 I noticed that the R6RS module system allows for separate compilation , but I have not mentioned the subtilities associated with it .
This episode discusses the topic , the concept of visit time and the intricacies of the " import " semantics .
Advertisement
Separate compilation and import semantics
Scheme is all about times : there is a run-time , an expand - time , and a discrete set of times associated to the meta - levels .
When separate compilation is taken in consideration , there is also another set of times : the times when the libraries are separately compiled .
Finally , if the separately compiled libraries define macros which are used in client code , there is yet another set of times , the visit times .
To explain what the visit time is , suppose you have a low level library L , compiled yesterday , defining a macro you want to use in another middle level library M , to be compiled today .
The compiler needs to know about the macro defined in L at the time of the compilation of M , because it has to expand code in M .
Therefore , the compiler must look at L and re-evaluate the macro definition today ( the process is called visiting ) .
The visit time is different from the time of the compilation of L as it happens just before the compilation of M .
Here is a concrete example .
Consider the following low level library L , defining a macro m and an integer variable a :
# !r6rs ( library ( experimental L ) ( export m a ) ( import ( rnrs ) ( sweet - macros ) ) ( def- syntax m ( begin ( display " visiting L
" ) ( lambda ( x ) # f ) ) ) ( define a 42 ) ( display " L instantiated
" ) )
You may compile it with PLT Scheme :
$ plt-r6rs -- compile L.sls [ Compiling /usr / home / micheles / gcode/scheme/experimental / L.sls ] visiting L
Since the right hand side of a macro definition is evaluated at compile time the message visiting L is printed during compilation , as expected .
Consider now the following middle level library M using the macro m :
# !r6rs ( library ( experimental M ) ( export a ) ( import ( rnrs ) ( experimental L ) ) ( m ) ; this line is expanded at compile - time ( display " M instantiated
" ) ; at run -time )
In this example the compiler needs to visit L in order to compile M .
This is actually what happens :
$ plt-r6rs -- compile M.sls [ Compiling /usr / home / micheles / gcode/scheme/experimental / M.sls ] visiting L
If you comment out the line with the macro call , the compiler does not need to visit L anymore ; some implementations may take advantage of this fact ( Ypsilon and Ikarus do ) .
However , PLT Scheme will continue to visit L in any case .
The mysterious import semantics
It is time to ask ourselves the crucial question : what does it mean to import a library ?
For a Pythonista , things are very simple : importing a library means executing it at run-time .
For a Schemer , things are somewhat complicated : importing a library implies that some basic operations are performed at compile time - such as looking at the exported identifiers and at the dependencies of the library - but there is also a lot of unspecified behavior which may happen both a compile - time and at run-time .
In particular at compile - time a library may be only visited , i.e. its macro definitions can be re-evaluated - or can be only instantiated , or both .
Different things happens in different situations and in the same situation different implementations can perform different operations .
The example of the previous paragraph is useful in order to get a feeling of what is portable behavior and what is not .
Let me first consider what happens in Ikarus .
If I want to compile L and M in Ikarus , I need to introduce a helper script H.ss , since Ikarus has no direct way to compile a library from the command line .
Here is the script : $ cat H.ss #!r6rs ( import ( rnrs ) ( experimental M ) ) ( display a ) Here is what I get : $ ikarus -- compile - dependencies H.ss visiting L Serializing " /home/micheles/gcode/scheme/experimental/M.sls.ikarus-fasl " ...
Serializing " /home/micheles/gcode/scheme/experimental/L.sls.ikarus-fasl " ... Ikarus is lazier than PLT : for instance , if you comment the line invoking the macro in M.sls and you recompile the dependencies , then the library M is not visited .
Both PLT and Ikarus do not instantiate L in order to compile M ( it is not needed ) but Ypsilon does .
You may check that if you introduce a dummy macro in M , depending on the variable a defined in L ( for instance if you add a line ( def - syntax dummy ( lambda ( x ) a ) ) ) then the library L must be instantiated in order to compile M , and all implementations do so .
Let us consider the peculiarities of Ypsilon , now .
Ypsilon does not have a switch to compile a library without executing it - even if this is possible by invoking the low level compiler API - so we must execute H.ss to compile its dependencies : $ ypsilon -- r6rs H.ss L instantiated visiting L M instantiated 42
There are several things to notice here , since the output of Ypsilon is quite different from the output of Ikarus $ ikarus -- r6rs - script H.ss L instantiated 42 and the output of PLT : $ plt - r6rs H.ss visiting L visiting L L instantiated M instantiated 42
The first thing to notice is that both in Ikarus and in PLT we relied on the fact that the libraries were precompiled , so in order to perform a fair comparison we must run Ypsilon again ( this second time the libraries L and M will be precompiled ) : $ ypsilon -- r6rs H.ss L instantiated M instantiated 42 You my notice that this time the library L is not visited : it was visited the first time , in order to compile M , but there is no need to do so now .
During compilation of M macros has been expanded and the byte - code of M contains the expanded version of the library ; moreover the helper script H does not use any macro so it does not really need to visit L or M to be compiled .
The same happens for Ikarus .
PLT instead visits L twice to compile H.ss .
In PLT all dependencies ( both direct and indirect ) are always visited when compiling .
Only if we compile the script once and for all $ plt - r6rs -- compile H.ss [ Compiling /usr / home / micheles / gcode/scheme/experimental / H.ss ]
[ Compiling /home / micheles/.plt-scheme/4.1.5.5/collects/experimental/M.sls ] visiting L visiting L the visiting L message will not be printed : $ plt -r6rs H.ss L instantiated M instantiated 42
More implementation - dependent details
Having performed the right number of compilations now the output of PLT and Ypsilon are the same ; nevertheless , the output of Ikarus is different , since Ikarus does not instantiate the middle level library M .
The reason is the implicit phasing semantics of Ikarus ( other implementations based on psyntax would exhibit the same behavior ) : the helper script H.ss is printing the variable a which really comes from the library L .
Ikarus is clever enough to recognize this fact and lazy enough to avoid instantiating M without need .
On the other hand , Ypsilon performs eager instantiation and it instantiates ( once ) all the libraries it imports ( both directly and indirectly ) , even at compile time and even in situations when the instantiation would not be needed for compilation of the client library .
As you see , Scheme implementations have a lot of latitude in such matters .
The implementations based on psyntax are the smartest out there , but begin smart is not always the same thing as being good .
It is good to avoid instantiating a library if the instantiation is really unneeded ; it is bad if the library has some side effect , since the side effect will mysteriously disappear .
In our example the side effect is just printing the message M instantiated , in more sophisticated examples the side effect could be writing a log on a database , or initializing some variable , or registering an object , or something else .
For instance , suppose you want to collect a bunch of functions into a global registry acting as a dictionary of functions .
You may do so as follows : ( library ( my- library ) ( export ) ( import ( registry ) ) ( registry - set ! ' f1 ( lambda ( x ) ' something1 ) ) ( registry - set ! ' f2 ( lambda ( x ) ' something2 ) ) ... )
The library here does not export anything , since it relies on side effects to populate the global registry of functions ; the idea is to access the functions later , with a call of kind ( registry - ref < func - name > ) .
This design as it is is not always portable to systems based on psyntax , because such systems will not instantiate the library ( the library does not export any variable , nothing of the library can be used in client code ! ) .
This can easily be fixed , by introducing an initialization function to be exported and called explicitly from client code , which is a good idea in any case .
Analogously , a library based on side effects at visit time , i.e. in the right hand side of macro definitions , is not portable , since systems based on psyntax will not visit a library with macros which are not used .
This is relevant if you want to use the technique described in the You want it when ?
paper : in order to make sure that the technique work on systems based on psyntax , you must make sure that the library exports at least one macro which is used in client code .
Curious readers will find the gory details in this thread on the PLT mailing list .
Generally speaking , you cannot rely on the number of times a library will be instantiated , even within the same implementation !
Abdulaziz Ghuloum gave a nice example in the Ikarus and PLT lists .
You have the following libraries : ( library ( T0 ) ( export ) ( import ( rnrs ) ) ( display " T0
" ) ) ( library ( T1 ) ( export ) ( import ( for ( T0 ) run expand ) ) ) ( library ( T2 ) ( export ) ( import ( for ( T1 ) run expand ) ) ) ( library ( T3 ) ( export ) ( import ( for ( T2 ) run expand ) ) ) and the following script : #!r6rs ( import ( T3 ) ) Running the script ( without precompilation ) results in printing T0 : 0 times for Ikarus and Mosh 1 time for Larceny and Ypsilon 10 times for plt - r6rs 13 times for mzscheme 22 times for DrScheme T0 is not printed in psyntax - based implementations , since it does not export any identifier that can be used .

Product Reviews / Main Nibbles / Meat & Poultry Best Value Steak Cuts The World ’s First Steak Guide To “ Sustainable Steaks ” Excludes Tenderloins , Strip Steaks & Rib Steaks
CAPSULE REPORT :
We are automatically programmed to think of tenderloins , strip steaks and rib steaks as “ the best . ”
But are they ?
Two master butchers from the gourmet butcher shop , The Healthy Butcher , explain why you get more bang - for - the - buck with other delicious cuts .
Overview
Rating System
The Winning Steaks
What We ’ve Learned From The Rankings A steak guide without the coveted New York strip steaks , rib steaks , and filet mignon ?
Ludicrous ?
Well , not from our standpoint — “ our ” meaning any self - respecting butcher shop that has the availability , nay , we say pleasure , of buying whole animals , not just boxed muscles .
Let ’s clear the air right off the top :
We have excluded the three most expensive steaks , the bread and butter for most butcher shops , from our list for the following reasons :
To celebrate the meat .
Since industrialization in the meat industry kicked in — roughly fifty or so years ago — and the mass production of cheap boxed meat became commonplace , omnivores have become creatures of habit .
To see these same three cuts on every restaurant and steak house menu , and to see these steaks take up the majority of display space in virtually every grocery store and butcher shop is , frankly , appalling and boring .
We hate to break the news to anyone who thinks otherwise : A cow is not a walking loin .
We owe it to our local farmers , the farmers who have a passion for what they do and how they do it , to explore their products in their entirety .
Appreciation and exploration of whole animals is the sustainable way to eat meat .
Less - marbled cuts are more flavorful .
Although a certified organic , locally raised , well - marbled , and dry - aged New York Strip† or Rib Eye steak is pretty much a piece of heaven ( we ’re not going to say otherwise ) , there is lot to be said about the flavor in tougher cuts of meat that is not present in the more tender cuts .
Many argue that fat content is the sole factor in the determination of flavor , but chefs and food scientists have known for decades that there is an inverse relationship between flavor and tenderness , i.e. tougher cuts , regardless of fat content , are more flavorful .
To this day , it is still a mystery , scientifically speaking , as to why tougher cuts tend to have more flavor .
Our theory is that the increased flow of blood to a well - used muscle develops its meaty taste ( or beefiness , in the case of beef ) .
In any case , tougher cuts benefit from a fullness of flavor that is simply not present in the more tender cuts .
† NOTE :
The same cuts of meat are often known by different names — none more so than the popular Boneless Strip , Kansas City Strip , New York , New York Strip , Shell Steak or Top Loin .
If it gets confusing , see our Beef Glossary Better value .
The value , meaning bang - for - your - buck , is higher for any steak on our list than for a Strip Steak , Rib Steak or Tenderloin .
In fact , we could have just as easily named our list a “ Value Steak Guide . ”
We thought the term “ sustainable ” more accurately links your buying decisions to the farmers ’ reality .
The best way to treat our list of steaks is to print a copy , stick it to your fridge and systematically , over the course of the summer , try each cut .
You may very well rank the steaks differently ; truth be told , and despite our repeated recommendations , number 9 and 10 on our list consistently out - sell number 1 .
Listen to the experts :
The Boneless Blade Steak at the right ranked number one in flavor and price / value .
Pick one up the next time you go shopping for steak .
How We Rated The Steaks
We used four factors to come up with our Top 10 list : flavor , tenderness , price and personal opinion .
If Einstein taught us anything , it ’s that we needed some markers for the objective categories , to which all cuts are judged relative .
So this is what we came up with : Flavor : Rated from 0 to 10 , with 0 being the least flavorful cut of beef ( which we deemed to be the Eye of Round ) and 10 being the most flavorful cut of beef ( which we deemed to be the Beef Shank ) .
There are several cuts we could have chosen to be the least and most flavorful ; the point is , the least flavorful is one that is very low in fat , not on the bone and is a muscle that does little work .
Conversely , the most flavorful cut is one that has ample fat content , benefits from being on the bone ( especially marrow bones ) and benefits from being a muscle that is used often .
Rated from 0 to 10 , with 0 being the least flavorful cut of beef ( which we deemed to be the Eye of Round ) and 10 being the most flavorful cut of beef ( which we deemed to be the Beef Shank ) .

Conversely , the most flavorful cut is one that has ample fat content , benefits from being on the bone ( especially marrow bones ) and benefits from being a muscle that is used often .
Tenderness : Rated from 0 to 10 , with 0 being the toughest cut of beef ( which we chose to be the Beef Shank , assuming it was cooked with dry heat like the other steaks it is being compared to ) and 10 being the most tender cut of beef , the Tenderloin .
Rated from 0 to 10 , with 0 being the toughest cut of beef ( which we chose to be the Beef Shank , assuming it was cooked with dry heat like the other steaks it is being compared to ) and 10 being the most tender cut of beef , the Tenderloin .
Price : Ahh .
For price , we had to kick up our creativity a notch .
The percentages shown in the price columns below are the percentage savings from a either New York Strip or Rib Eye steak , calculated by the following formula : ( Price of NY Strip or Rib Eye per lb ) minus ( Price of Cut We Are Comparing per lb )
( Price of NY Strip or Rib Eye per lb )
So , for example , there is a 57 % savings over a New York Strip Steak by purchasing a boneless blade steak .
The percentage was then divided by 10 to yield a number between 0 and 10 , to be consistent with the 10 - point scale for the other categories .
Just like rating a wine , you need to know the price prior to rating it :
Ultimately is it worth the price , or more accurately , is it high in value ?
But , unlike wine — that ranges in price from less than $ 5 to more than $ 5,000 per bottle — it would n’t be obvious to a reader of the list , relatively speaking , if we just plopped in $ 1.80 / ounce in one line , and $ 2.75 / ounce in another line .
The differences seem almost negligible .
We decided to measure value as the percentage savings over the pinnacles of steaks — the New York Strip Steak and the Rib Eye .
In our store we price these two steaks equivalently .
We ’re not quite sure why these steaks are differently priced in grocery stores .
To us they ’re worth the same : Give up a little tenderness for the sake of more flavor in a rib steak , or give up a little flavor for the sake of more tenderness in a New York Strip Steak .
Personal Rating :
For the only subjective category , our Head Butcher Ryan Donovan and our Head Chef Jonathan Abrahams , were each asked to rate the cuts from 0 to 5 on purely a personal preference .
The two values added together yield a 0 to 10 point rating consistent with the other categories .
The Winners Boneless Blade Steak
Thin Flank Steak or Vacio
Tri Tip Steak
Skirt Steak
Brisket Flat Iron Steak
Flank Steak
Top Sirloin
Sirloin Tip
Eye Of Round 1st Place ~ BONELESS BLADE STEAK
Boneless Blade Steak
The Blade is truly an overlooked gem .
It is located in the chuck ( or shoulder ) , which is the primary weight - bearing muscle group .
More specifically , it is located in the Bottom Blade section ; we point this out simply to differentiate it from the Flat Iron steak ( another steak in this list ) that is cut from the Top Blade section in the chuck , and is a little less tender .
As a rule , meat from the chuck primal , although always flavorful , is usually tough and best for braising or stewing .
The Blade is an exception to the rule and is surprisingly quite tender ; in fact , the Boneless Blade Steak is cut from the exact same muscle as the premium Rib Eye steak that is more than twice the price .
The only “ catch ” to this phenomenal steak is that there ’s a seam of cartilage running through the center ; but for a 57 % savings off a New York , we ’ll gladly take the extra step of slicing the cartilage out before serving .
Other Names Book Steak , Butler Steak , Lifter Steak , Petite Steak , Paleron ( French ) , Copertina di Spalla ( Italian ) , Paletilla , Planchuela , or Parte Superior de la Paleta ( Spanish ) .
Average Size * Average Blade Steaks are .75 lb ( 340g ) , but any size thickness can be cut on request .
Cooking Method Braised blade is absolutely to die for , but superb results can be achieved on a grill by seasoning , searing over high heat , then lowering the heat slightly until the steak is cooked medium - rare .
Tent with foil and let sit for 5 minutes before carving .
Do n’t forget to cut along the center cartilage and remove it before serving .
Score 2nd Place ~ THIN FLANK STEAK or VACIO
Thin Flank Steak The Thin Flank is situated in the Flank primal , but it is a very different cut from the “ Flank ” that everyone knows ( just look at the photos of the two cuts — the Flank Steak is below — to see the obvious differences ) .
Essentially , it ’s the cow ’s tummy muscle .
Other Names Vacio ( Argentina ) , Bavette ( France ) , Costine di Pancia ( Italy ) .
Average Size * One Thin Flank is roughly 2.75 lbs ( 1.2kg ) , but it can be cut and sold in smaller pieces .
Cooking Method
In Argentina , a Vacio would be thrown on a grill once the wood has burned down and left to cook for a long time : South Americans are champion slow grillers !
Our dry - aged Thin Flank / Vacio can be grilled simply by seasoning , searing , then slow grilling over medium heat to a medium - rare .
Let it sit for at least 5 minutes , then slice it thin and across the grain .
Because of its large size , this is a terrific party steak ; you can feed a lot of people with just one .
Score 3rd Place ~ TRI TIP STEAK or ROAST
Tri Tip Steak
The Tri Tip comes from the bottom section of the sirloin ( versus the # 8 choicer below , Top Sirloin , which comes from the top section of the sirloin ) .
This is a popular cut in the west ( especially California ) and many meat packers still ship their Tri Tip there , making it less frequently found in the Eastern parts of the U.S. or in Canada .
( Do n’t forget , most butchers and grocers deal strictly with pre-cut “ boxed ” meat , so their choice of cuts may be limited , depending on the distributor . )
Other Names Triangle Steak or Roast , Punta en Triangulo ( Spanish ) .
Average Size * 1.75lbs ( 790g ) .
Cooking Method
If the Tri Tip has been trimmed of all fat , ask to have another one cut for you , leaving the fat cap ( in the photo above , the fat cap is on the bottom side and is not shown ) .
Season , sear both sides , then cook on a lower heat with the fat side up until the center of the steak is medium rare .
The Tri Tip is a perfect party steak because : ( a ) it ’s fairly large , and ( b ) the steak will vary in thickness from fairly thin to very thick , so by cooking the steak to a medium rare in the center , people who enjoy their meat more on the medium - well side can cut at one end , while the rare lovers can cut at the other end .
The grain is fairly obvious in this muscle , so be sure to cut against the grain .
Ask your butcher to show you the grain if it is not obvious to you .
Score 4th Place ~ SKIRT STEAK
Skirt Steak Skirt is one of the most flavorful of all steaks .
It is situated in the short plate section of the beef , which is the inside of the rib on the chest .
There are two types of skirt : Inside and Outside .
It ’s a coin toss as to which is better ; Inside Skirt is great because it does n’t have as much membrane to be removed , but Outside Skirt is a little thicker and a bit less stringy .
Skirt is the meat originally used for both fajitas ( which means “ belt ” in Spanish and reflects the shape of the skirt ) and Philadelphia cheese steak sandwiches .
Other Names Philadelphia Steak , Bavette Aloyau or Hampe ( French ) , Falda , Entrana ( Chile ) .
Average Size * Outer Skirt 10.5 oz ( 300g ) , Inner Skirt 16.7oz ( 475g ) .
Cooking Method Season and cook quickly over high heat .
Skirt has a very pronounced grain ( just look at the photo ) .
If cooked rare , sliced thin and against the grain , you will have as fine a piece of beef as you can find .
Score 5th Place ~ BRISKET Brisket
The brisket is the front portion of the beef breast that lies between the front legs .
Brisket is the cut of choice for Texas slow - smoked , pit - cooked barbeque .
The only reason the brisket is not # 1 on our list is ( a ) it ’s not really a steak , and ( b ) it takes a long long time to grill — we ’re talking on the order of 15 hours .
When it comes down to it , a properly slow - smoked brisket is as good as it gets in the beef world .
Other Names Poitrine Gros Bout ( France ) , Petto ( Italy ) , Pecho ( Argentina ) .
Average Size *
A whole brisket , point and 1/2 " fat cap left on , weighs between 10 to 12lbs ( 4.5 to 5.5kg ) .
Of course , any smaller size can be cut .
Allow about 1 /2lb per person to allow for trimming and shrinkage .
Cooking Method Brisket can be braised ( like a pot roast ) , poached ( as with corned beef ) , or hot - smoked ( like southern - style barbeque , the reason this cut is on our list ) .
There are more opinions and debates about how to properly smoke a brisket than any other cut .
In our opinion , best results come from brining for 24 or more hours ( the brine being a salt - based mixture that is best applied if injected into the brisket with a sryinge ) , dry rubbing with a mixture of spices , then slow grilling for 10 to 15 hours at around 180° to 200 °F .
The brisket is ready when it is falling apart , or “ fork tender . ” Score 6th Place ~ FLAT IRON STEAK
Flat Iron Steak
The Flat Iron sits in the Top Blade section of the chuck , on the other side of the shoulder blade from where our # 1 pick , Boneless Blade Steak , is located ( in the Bottom Blade ) .
As compared to the Boneless Blade Steak , the Flat Iron is also very flavorful , slightly tougher , has no cartilage running through it and is a little more expensive .
Other Names Flat Iron is often confused with the Boneless Blade Steak above , even though they are two distinct steaks .
Average Size* .5 to .7lbs ( 220g to 320g ) , a perfect size for one steak per person .
Cooking Method Same as Boneless Blade Steak .
Flat Irons are usually thinner than Blades , so less cooking time is required :
The steak will likely be finished after a good sear .
Slice across the grain and serve .
Score 7th Place ~ FLANK STEAK
The Flank Steak is easily distinguished by its longitudinal grain ( see photo ) .
Marinade can penetrate Flank Steak without the meat losing its firm texture because it is relatively thin and porous .
Flank has a moderate amount of fat , a great beefy flavor , and no connective tissue .
Other Names London Broil , Bavette Flanchet ( France ) , Pancia or Bavetta ( Italy ) , Bife de Vacio ( Argentina ) , Bife do Vazio ( Brazil ) , Palanca ( Chile ) , Dunne ( Germany ) .
Average Size * 1.75lb ( 790g ) .
One large Flank will serve about four people .
Cooking Method Similar to the Thin Flank Steak or Vacio , season , sear , then cook at medium or medium - high heat until medium - rare .
Tent with foil and let sit for 5 - to - 10 minutes , then slice thin across the grain .
Score 8th Place ~ TOP SIRLOIN STEAK
Top Sirloin Steak
The Top Sirloin comes from the Sirloin section of the beef , which falls between the lean and tough Round and the luxuriously tender Loin primals .
Do n’t be fooled by the 8th place ranking : The Top Sirloin is a wonderful steak .
The only reason it is n’t at the top of our list is because its higher price pushed it down .
That being said , at a 26 % savings from the New York , this is a magnificent steak , both tender and flavorful .
Other Names Coulotte , Bifteck ( French ) , Bife ( Argentina ) , Bistek ( Chile ) .
American retail butchers often call this steak Chateaubriand , but we feel that French name should be reserved for the large butt end section of the Tenderloin .
Average Size * From 1lb to 1.75 lb ( 454g to 790g ) , depending on whether it is cut from the loin side or the round side .
Generally , one Top Sirloin can feed 2 to 3 people .
Cooking Method Season , sear and cook at medium - high heat until medium rare .
Also note that a Top Sirloin Roast makes for a great barbecue roast .
Score 9th Place ~ SIRLOIN TIP
Sirloin Tip
The Sirloin Tip is the continuation of the sirloin muscle that is the source of Top Sirloin steaks ( see # 8 above ) .
However , because the tip is situated in the Round primal , it is tougher and leaner .
As far as extra - lean steaks go , this is the best it gets .
Other Names Knuckle Steak , Breakfast Steak , Tranche Grasse ( France ) , Rabadilha ( Portugal ) , Bola de Lomo ( Argentina ) , Patinho ( Brazil ) , Posta Rosada ( Chile ) .
Average Size* 1lb ( 450g ) per steak .
Cooking Method Season , sear and cook to medium - rare over medium - high heat .
Do not overcook !
Score 10th Place ~ EYE OF ROUND
Eye of Round Rounding out our Top 10 list is the Eye of Round .
The Eye is the leanest muscle in beef , which probably explains its popularity among our health - conscious customers .
It comes from the Round Primal , and because it is a well - used muscle , it is a bit chewy .
If you ‘re looking for a lean , small steak that is unbelievably economical , this is a good choice .
Other Names Tranche or Piece Ronde or Roti de Boeuf ( French ) , Girello or Magatello ( Italian ) , Peceto ( Argentina ) .
Average Size * Average .5lb ( 220g ) per steak , but it can be cut thinner or thicker to preference .
Shown in the diagram is a 3 - peppercorn - encrusted Eye.
Cooking Method Since the Eye of Round has so little fat , it is best not to cook it past rare or medium - rare .
Season , sear and cook to medium - rare over medium - high heat .
Score * Average size for The Healthy Butcher ; average sizes may vary regionally .
What We Learned From The Rankings
This was an exercise for us as well as for you .
Here ’s what we learned .
Price was obviously a significant factor that tipped the scales ( no pun intended ) .
The least expensive steak , the Boneless Blade Steak , took the top rank .
And the most expensive steak on the list , the Top Sirloin , placed only eighth .
Using the wine analogy again , it became obvious that for a $ 10 bottle , the Blade was as good as it gets , but more was expected from the Top Sirloin , being a $ 20 bottle .

The rankings also show the importance of fat .
Is it a surprise that the three leanest cuts in our Top 10 are numbers eight , nine , and ten ?
Fat plays multiple roles in meat .
First , it improves tenderness by acting as a lubricant between meat fibers , making the fibers easier to pull apart .
Second , fat carries flavor compounds .
In fact , if all fat were removed from meat , it would be difficult to differentiate between several types of red meat because they would taste so similar .
And third , fat stimulates the flow of saliva , which has the effect of further stimulating taste .

Most important to understand with our Top 10 list is that all of these steaks are sustainable steaks .
These cuts represent a whole animal , excluding the oversold and premium - priced loin and rib sections .
No matter which cut you choose from the above list , you can feel comfortable that not only are you being frugal , you are supporting sustainable farming .
The results of sustainable eating trickle down to everything from helping the farmers ’ livelihood to improving local groundwater .
Eat well , do well .

PeePoo :
It ’s in the Bag ?
Save a life .
Give a PeePoo bag
Go to peepoople.com and you wo n’t find a joke .
Trust me , I kept looking .
There are no people pooing , or poople peeing , or a sketch comedy troupe of bathroom humorists .
Actually , the site has a different goal in mind , and that is to save the world .
We ’ve thrown this number out before – 2.6 billion people in the world do n’t have access to proper wastewater management systems .
Either their toilets do n’t flush or they do n’t have access to toilets .
And as PeePoople so eloquently illustrates , many of these people are from third world countries in which waste management generally means shitting in a river and watching it float downstream .
More so than the Neorest , the makers of this poop - related contraption take themselves too seriously .
It is a biodegradable bag in which one pees and poops .
Obviously the creators knew this to be true when they named their invention , and I ’m sure once they started marketing it they immediately regretted copyrighting the name “ PeePoople . ”
There ’s something not quite right about a young African girl looking downtrodden and helpless , holding a bag she ’s about to poop in with a Swedish - designed logo exclaiming exactly what that bag is for .
There ’s something not quite right about their web content , too :
“ The Peepoo bag is personal as in personal computer , it is mobile as in mobile phone and micro as in Microsoft . ”
Apparently it is part of the new wave in technology .
Oh , woops , it ’s just a bag people shit in .
Seriously , why all of this high - concept description ?
Philanthropists do n’t need to be convinced that these countries need help .
And I doubt the thought of an iPhone Poop Bag will draw any investors .
Stick to the point – 2.6 billion people need a sanitary waste removal system .
PeePoople is the answer ( apparently ) .
But they try so hard !
“ The Peepoo bag offers a high degree of contemporary status . ”
What ?
‘ Yes , now that I shit in a bag , I ’ve moved up in the world ! ’
My favorite part of the site is the “ List of Triggers for Invetsting ( sic ) in a Toilet . ”
Number 19 is “ being able to increase my tenant ’s rent . ”
Reason number two to invest in a toilet is to “ gain prestige from visitors . ”
Imagine a house guest coming over and asking to use the bathroom .
They walk in and realize they must do their business in a bag .
They are instantly impressed .
The main reason these bags are a viable solution to this crisis is unclear when you visit the site .
You have to dig a bit to find that the inner lining of the PeePoo bag is coated with a thin film of “ urea . ”
This non-hazardous chemical is a natural fertilizer , and it breaks down the enzymes in the feces or urine to inactivate the diseases within in a short amount of time ( 2 - 4 weeks , compared to 1 - 2 years ) .
So that ’s why PeePoo bags are good !
Not because of the fancy flash website or graphic printed on the bag , or the ‘ contemporary status ’ it gives its users , or the mobility and personal freedom it allows .
It actually helps prevent the spread of waste - related diseases .
And here I thought all of its Swedish creators were just IKEA rejects clinging onto fake luxury products .
Time for a little inspiration .
Package design can be tricky , but as you can see here , sometimes it can be relatively simple and still come across as being elegant .
Sometimes , less is more …..
Here are over 100 examples of package design that either has a minimal style , or a typographic based solution .
It may become little complex to design package designs for bottles of different geometrical shapes .
If you like these and you 'd like to learn more about package design , TheDieline.com and LovelyPackage.com are the places to visit .
A big thanks goes out to them for a lot of the images you see here .
A simple and clean package design with little information on the front side of the bottle .
Excellent calligraphic font has been printed on the bottle keeping the size of text and contrast in consideration .
It is not necessary to print all over the place .
Instead , you can just choose to print on a little part of the bottle placing the text and graphics in proper orientation .
The text and other graphics have nicely covered the entire package space making it more easy and entertaining for the viewers to check onto it .
The designer has designed the package designs for bottles of all the sizes and it is absolutely amazing .
It is not necessary to cover all the space without taking other aspects into account .
Selecting the perfect place and orientation for the text to be inserted in really important and nice contrast should be established between different points and places .
The most important information related to the product must be clear and prominent so that the user can explore the package design further .
Logo is placed at the edge , clip art is inserted on one side and text has been placed on the other side of the product .
Similar to the previous one but this bottle is of less size .
The important information has been showed as of big size and highlighted with different colors .
Other important information such as copyright information and trademark have also been covered nicely .
Background colors look to be transparent and beautiful .
When there is a bulk of information to be covered , there must be proper sequence and size of the text should be selected carefully .
With the background of dense black , the text must be highlighted as dense white color .
All the information has been graded according to the level of importance and the name of the company is shown laterally .
The orientation of the text varies according to the size and shape of the product .
The color of the text should be selected carefully so that it is visible whether the bottle is filled up with liquid or empty .
The color of the text matches with the color of the cap of bottle .
One should be considerate about each and every little aspect while designing a package design .
A formal packaging with all the information written in a formal way .
Products which require high care must contain formal packaging .
Similar to the previous ones but they are bit larger so they can contain more information .
Amazing contrast has been established between background , text and the strip .
But the design still looks to be sleek and smooth .
The color of the bottles look similar to the color of snooker balls .
When you have got little information to show to the viewers , it is a perfect decision to get more creative with all the aspects .
The more smoother the color , the more it shines and more beautiful the color packaging looks to be .
As long as the text is of proper size and orientation , it will look to be really good on all types of shapes and surfaces .
It is necessary to indicate what the box contains so that people may consider it to repair or be cautious before using it for some purpose .
Nice geometrical figures , logos and calligraphic fonts have been calibrated to indicate the quality of product as packaging is really important to the success of any product when launched in the market .
Some people get easily impressed with the packaging and prefer to buy that product .
The color of the packaging is often used to indicate the type and kind of product .
The quality of the colors and contrast indicate the quality of the content that the product may contain .

Signifying a formless haze of computing power and storage that is somewhere " out there , " computerdom 's current buzzword is as difficult to get one 's arms around as a real cloud .
A seemingly limitless pool of processors and memory and disk space , and you just scoop out what you need .
Sounds great , does n't it ?
Of course , it 's not that simple .
You do n't just grab a handful of virtual computers and toss them after your data .
They have to be configured .
If you need an n- tier system , you 'll have to assemble the virtual networking components to tie them all together .
In short , managing a herd of virtual systems in the cloud is no less difficult than managing a herd of physical computers .
[ Is your head in the clouds ?
Do n't be fooled .
See InfoWorld 's Busting the nine myths of cloud computing and What cloud computing really means . ]
The four products in this roundup are designed to simplify the life of a cloud - based virtual - machine wrangler .
To varying degrees , and in varying environments , each provides tools for creating , deploying , and managing collections of cloud - machines .
The products are the AppLogic platform from 3tera , the Elastic Computing Platform ( ECP ) from Enomaly , the Infrastructure and Middleware on Demand ( IMOD ) system from Kaavo , and RightScale , from the company of the same name .
The 3tera and Enomaly offerings are tools for building your own private or hosted clouds .
The Kaavo system works with third - party cloud services such as Amazon EC2 .
And RightScale works with both private clouds and third - party cloud services .
3tera AppLogic
The 3tera AppLogic system is its own cloud .
That is , you do not run it on a third - party cloud provider such as Amazon EC2 ; you run it on hardware hosted by 3tera , or you provide the hardware and 3tera builds the cloud .
AppLogic is referred to as a " meta - operating system . "
At its heart , it is Red Hat Linux running a specially configured Xen hypervisor .
More precisely , it is a cluster of interconnected systems running Red Hat Linux , Xen , and the AppLogic orchestration system .
AppLogic can run on a remarkably spare piece of hardware .
Minimum requirements are a 1GHz processor , 512MB of RAM , and 80 GB of disk storage .
Of course , this is the barest of beginnings ; a single backbone of an AppLogic system can consist of up to 128 machines , and backbones can be combined to form overall networks of thousands of machines .
Assuming you do n't have the space in your basement for your own AppLogic system , 3tera already has datacenters in North America , South America , Europe , Japan , and Singapore .

Circumcision Doesn't Lessen HIV Transmission
It may help men , but does not appear to lessen HIV transmission from to women .
July 18 , 2009 --
THURSDAY , July 16 ( HealthDay News ) -- Circumcision does n't reduce transmission of HIV from infected men to women , says a study that included 922 HIV - infected men in Uganda .
The men , who were uncircumcised before the start of the study , were randomly selected to undergo immediate circumcision or circumcision after two years .
The study also included HIV - uninfected female partners of the men .
The women were checked for HIV infection at six , 12 and 24 months .
The study was stopped early due to " futility . "
The final analysis of 92 couples in the intervention group and 67 couples in the control group showed that 18 percent of women in the intervention group became infected with HIV , compared with 12 percent of those in the control group .
Cumulative probability of HIV infection at 24 months was 22 percent among women in the intervention group and 13 percent among those in the control group .
While these results were n't statistically significant , they were sufficient to stop the study , said Dr. Maria J. Wawer of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and colleagues .
" Circumcision of HIV - infected men did not reduce HIV transmission to female partners over 24 months ; longer - term effects could not be assessed .
Condom use after male circumcision is essential for HIV prevention , " they concluded .
The findings appear in the July 18 issue of The Lancet .
The study results should n't deter programs working to increase circumcision services for men at risk for HIV , wrote Dr. Jared M. Baeten of the University of Washington in Seattle and colleagues in an accompanying commentary .
Involving women in decision - making about circumcision provides an opportunity to educate men and women about the risks and benefits of circumcision and to target risk - reduction counseling efforts to serodiscordant couples , where one partner is HIV - positive and the other HIV - negative , they noted .

BOGOTÁ , Colombia 
With their condemnation on Sunday of the coup ousting President Manuel Zelaya in Honduras , governments in the Western Hemisphere from across the ideological spectrum found a rare issue around which they could swiftly arrive at unity .
At the same time , from the Obama administration ’s measured response to the reaction of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela , who put his military on alert over an apparent affront to the Venezuelan ambassador in Honduras , the responses both revealed and disguised fissures over different forms of democratic government that are taking root in the region .
On the one side are countries like Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador , where voters have given much greater power to their populist presidents , partly by allowing them to extend their time in office and sometimes eroding the function of Congress and the Supreme Court , institutions portrayed as allies of the old oligarchy .
On the other side are nations of varying ideological hues , including Brazil , Latin America ’s rising power , where resilient institutions have allowed for more diversity of participants in politics , ruling out the so - called participatory democracy that Mr. Chávez , the Venezuelan president , has been eager to promote in the region .
Mr. Zelaya himself pushed this tension with institutions to its limits in his clash with Honduras ’s judiciary last week over his call for a referendum intended to clear the way for term limits to be eased .
On Sunday , the Supreme Court of Honduras said that the military had acted in accordance with the Constitution to remove Mr. Zelaya .

The footage filmed by Gemma Atkinson
guardian.co.uk
A woman is to challenge the Metropolitan police in the high court , claiming she was handcuffed , detained and threatened with arrest for filming officers on her mobile phone .
Lawyers for Gemma Atkinson , a 27 - year - old who was detained after filming police officers conduct a routine stop and search on her boyfriend , believe her case is the latest example of how police are misusing counterterrorism powers to restrict photography .
Atkinson 's mobile phone recorded part of the incident at Aldgate East underground station on 25 March , one month after Section 58 ( a ) – a controversial amendment to the Terrorism
Act – came into force , making it illegal to photograph a police officer if the images are considered " likely to be useful " to a terrorist .
Atkinson handed the footage , in which an officer can be heard telling her it is illegal to film police and demanding to see her phone , to the Guardian and said she was seeking to challenge the force in a judicial review .
The incident was captured on CCTV .
The opening part of the mobile phone clip shows two uniformed police officers searching her boyfriend , Fred Grace , 28 , by a wall in the station .
Atkinson said she felt that police had unfairly targeted Grace , who did not have drugs in his possession , and decided to film the officers in order to hold them to account .
Seconds later , an undercover officer wearing jeans and a black jacket enters the shot , and asks Atkinson : " Do you realise it is an offence under the Terrorism Act to film police officers ? "
He then adds : " Can you show me what you you just filmed ? "
Atkinson stopped filming and placed her phone in her pocket .
According to her account of the incident , which was submitted to the Independent Police Complaints Commission that night , the officer tried several times to forcefully grab the phone from her pocket .
Failing to get the phone , he called over two female undercover officers from nearby .
Atkinson said he told the women : " This young lady had been filming me and the other officers and it's against the law .
Her phone is in her right jacket pocket and I 'm trying to get it . "
An argument ensued , Atkinson said , and five police officers – four of them undercover – backed her into an alcove , insisting they had the right to view her phone .
She said she was detained there for about 25 minutes , during which her wrist was handcuffed and a female officer told her : " We 'll put you under arrest , take to you to the station and look at your phone there . "
A second female officer approached her and said , incorrectly : " Look , your boyfriend 's just been arrested for drugs , so I suggest you do as we say . "
Atkinson claims the male undercover officer who initially approached her repeatedly threatened her with arrest , stating : " We believe you filmed us and that 's against the law so we need to check your phone . "
When Atkinson protested , the officer replied : " I do n't want to see myself all over the internet . "
After officers made calls to the police station , possibly for legal advice on the situation , the handcuffs were removed and Atkinson was released .
She said the officers walked away – all but one of them refused to identify themselves to her .
" I felt totally helpless , " she said .
" I was being restrained and I felt that no one was listening to me .
During this whole thing I was saying , ' This is a breach of my civil liberties – you can't do this to me , I 've done nothing wrong ' . "
Atkinson 's solicitors , Bhatt Murphy , believe that faulty guidance to officers about how counterterrorism laws apply to photography in public places may have contributed to her treatment .
Last week , after notification from Bhatt Murphy that they would seek a judicial review of Atkinson 's case at the high court , the Met released the guidance it gives officers .
The force instructs officers that when searching people under the Terrorism Act , they " have the power to view digital images contained in mobile telephones " .
It adds that the new offence relating to photographing officers does not apply in normal policing activities .
However , the Met 's guidance , which has been criticised by human rights lawyers and the National Union of Journalists , has not been endorsed by the Home Office , which is drafting its own legal advice for police .
The Met 's guidance is different to that issued by the National Policing Improvement Agency , which specifically advises that " officers do not have a legal power to delete images or destroy film " , and suggests that , while digital images might be viewed during a search , officers " should not normally attempt to examine them " .
A Met spokesman confirmed they had received Atkinson 's complaint .
Introduction and background
If you 've read any book on getting into the game industry , every single one of them will urge you to join a modding or indie group as the best way to get noticed and develop a portfolio .
As the " why " has already been extensively covered , I wo n't be rehashing that here .
Unfortunately , books usually stop there at the " why " , and do n't talk at all about the " how " .
Having personally wasted a lot of time in indie groups that were bad for a variety of reasons , I hope to teach people new to the scene on some of the things to watch out for when considering a group .
The indie world is chock full of wasted effort , and you will inevitably have a lot of your time wasted as well .
For every shining pearl of a team out there , there are many pieces of coal ... or worse .
I first started doing personal game projects in elementary school .
Unfortunately , that 's not to say that all of the time I spent between then and now was valuable or efficient .
Like Jonathan
Blow , my first years had no internet and no teachers -- it was very slow going .
If in any way you can attach yourself to a mentor in any capacity , it will be an amazing change in your learning / productivity .
I did n't start joining indie groups until after college , which is my biggest career regret , hands down .
Nowadays , trying to balance a full time job , girlfriends , family , and other responsibilities , along with finding time to do an indie game on the side plus volunteering design / programming time in Microsoft Game Studios is quite the chore .
I 'd give anything to have started back when I was living with my parents and did n't even have to worry about cooking for myself .
The first groups I joined taught me most of the items I hope to pass on to you in this article .
They all had heart , and lots of dreams , but very rarely did they have sufficient talent , dedication and management .
I spent easily a year and a half spinning my wheels , going from group to group , before I found a really good one .
On the side , I was doing personal projects , but never could even give them the full attention they deserved since I was split between that and the other groups .
In the beginning , I jumped in too freely , getting a design assignment or two , churning out multi-page design docs overnight , and then sitting on my thumbs for weeks until the group folded , or I left , realizing they 'd never be in a position to use the ideas .
As I became more jaded , I learned to be more skeptical , to wait longer before bothering to produce work , and to think harder before joining a team .
By the end , before I found the group I 'm in today , I was talking to three to five groups at once , watching them and evaluating , waiting to see which teams would produce content first , or do something to really make me believe that they would stick together and get something done .
If I had been more selective from the very start , I wonder where I 'd be now and what I 'd be working on today .
The group I finally settled into grew into ToltecStudios.com , where we 're currently working on Phase 4 of The Ball , for the MakeSomethingUnreal.com competition .
They had already won first place prizes in Phase 1 of the competition .
Like I 'll advise in this article , I joined in a cross-role as a programmer , even though I was really looking to join as a designer .
The team was led by Hourences , the award winning and reknowned level designer from the UT world , and were a fairly small team with an interesting idea that they did n't let get too large .
Even though I already had a dedicated designer position in another team at the time I joined The Ball , that had some exceptional artists and dedicated leadership , and a decent chance of finishing a project , it was something I was willing to let go for this new team .
That 's simply how important it is to actually finish projects .
I was more sure about The Ball than the old group , and it turned out to be the right choice .
While art / sound producing roles always have something to show even if the project fails , programmers and designers do not .
In my old role , over half a year later now , I 'd still not have anything to show for it .
But now in this new group , when my programming duties are finished , I get to spend my extra time on design , in a group that never would have taken me ( or anyone ) as a designer otherwise .
On The Ball , I 've learned a ton about the Unreal Engine , which specifically gave me the skills I needed when my mentor at Microsoft Game Studios needed help doing some work on Gears of War 2 .
Under him , I got to participate pretty deeply as both a designer and programmer , and meet and indebt myself to some very experienced , and very influential people .
If it were n't for joining The Ball as a programmer , even though I wanted to be a designer , I would never have been able to take advantage of this opportunity .
I now present these notes to you , in hopes that you can shave off some of that time in learning how to find a good indie group .
If you 're just starting out , it might be the biggest time saver of your future career .
My last year and a half , while eventually fruitful and very educational , would have been incredibly different , and incredibly more productive if I had an article like this to read when I first began as well .
( CNN ) --
Twenty milligrams ; that 's the average amount of carbon emissions generated from the time it took you to read the first two words of this article .
How green is your website ?
Calculating all the factors involved in a website can be tricky .
Now , depending on how quickly you read , around 80 , perhaps even 100 milligrams of C02 have been released .
And in the several minutes it will take you to get to the end of this story , the number of milligrams of greenhouse gas emitted could be several thousand , if not more .
This may not seem like a lot : " But in aggregate , if you consider all the people visiting a web site and then all the seconds that each of them spends on it , it turns out to be a large number , " says Dr. Alexander Wissner - Gross , an Environmental Fellow at Harvard University who studies the environmental impact of computing .
Wissner - Gross estimates every second someone spends browsing a simple web site generates roughly 20 milligrams of C02 .
Whether downloading a song , sending an email or streaming a video , almost every single activity that takes place in the virtual environment has an impact on the real one .
As millions more go online each year some researchers say the need to create a green Internet ecosystem is not only imperative but also urgent .
" It is part of the whole sustainability picture , " Chris Large , head of research and development at UK - based Climate Action Group , told CNN .
" Scientists are saying to us that we have 10 years to take some serious action to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change so taking some sort of initiative is absolutely vital . "
A number of studies have highlighted the growing energy demands of computers .
A 2007 report from research firm Gartner , for example , estimates the manufacturing , use and disposal of information and communications technology generates about two percent of the world 's greenhouse gases -- similar to the level produced by the entire aviation industry .
Watch the report on efforts to turn tech green »
Anti-virus software firm McAfee reports that the electricity needed just to transmit the trillions of spam emails sent annually equals the amount required to power over two million homes in the United States while producing the same level of greenhouse gas emissions as more than three million cars .
" Most people do n't appreciate that the computer on your desk is contributing to global warming and that if its electricity comes from a coal power plant it produces as much C02 as a sports utility vehicle , " said Bill St. Arnaud of Canarie , a Canada - based internet development organization .
" Some studies estimate the internet will be producing 20 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases in a decade .
That is clearly the wrong direction .
That is clearly unsustainable , " added St. Arnaud .
What do you include when working out IT 's carbon footprint ?
Calculating the carbon footprint of the entire web however is not as easy as measuring the greenhouse gas emissions of a car .
Data centers -- massive buildings housing hundreds , if not thousands , of power hungry servers storing everything from Facebook photos and YouTube videos to company web sites and personal emails -- are often labeled as the worst offenders when it comes to harming the environment .
In 2002 , global data center emissions amounted to 76 million tons of carbon dioxide -- a figure that is likely to more than triple over the next decade , according to a 2008 study by the Climate Group and Global e-Sustainability Initiative ( GeSI ) .
The footprint of network infrastructure , which is responsible for transporting information from data centers to personal computers , mobile phones and other devices , is harder to pinpoint .
However the same study estimates fixed broadband accounts for around four million tons of carbon emissions and could account for nearly 50 million tons of emissions by 2020 .
The manufacturing , transport and use of personal computers and laptops also has what some say is the most significant impact , producing roughly 200 million tons of emissions in 2002 .
As millions of people buy new laptops and computers every year , this figure could triple by the end of the next decade , according to the Climate Group report .
And it is also true that , like driving a car compared to taking public transportation , some online activities produce more greenhouse gases than others .
More electricity is needed to store , transmit and download a video compared to a simple email , for example .
A single search using Google releases 0.2 grams of C02 into the atmosphere , according to Google .
" And what that includes is the energy that we at Google use to be able to receive your search , process it and then send it back to you , " Erik Teetzel , one of Google 's " green " engineers , told CNN .
" If people are counting things outside the activity that we do , then we do n't have control over that so we do n't factor that into the equation , " said Teetzel .
" We can measure exactly the number of queries that we service and come up with a very accurate estimate and answer from measured results of our actual emissions or energy use per query that we serve . "
The drive for energy efficiency
Citing competitive reasons , Teetzel declined to divulge Google 's annual power bill , yet he said the internet company has been taking steps to make its main six , five megawatt server farms green as well as the other , smaller data centers it has around the world .
It is doing this by using more renewable energy , recycled water and efficient software that requires less electricity to run .
" From a business perspective , it makes sense to get the most what you want to call useful work done using the least amount of resources , " said Teetzel .
" Our energy efficiency efforts really did stem from us making our business more competitive . "
A number of other companies are also working to take the various pieces that comprise the infrastructure of the internet in a more sustainable direction .
Wissner - Gross of Harvard has a company called C02Stats that enables businesses to monitor and manage the environmental impact of their web sites and then purchase renewable energy certificates based on their sites ' monthly carbon footprint .
Netherlands - based Cleanbits lobbies web sites to go green by either by purchasing carbon offsets or switching to green hosting providers , like AISO.net , a solar - powered data center based in California .
And , like Google , Yahoo also incorporates renewable power and other efficiency measures in its data centers .
However as more of the world joins an age characterized by global flows of information and communication , some say the role the internet plays in making the lives of millions not only more efficient but also environmentally friendly should not be discounted .
" I do n't think we 've done a good deal with articulating the fact that IT is inherently an efficiency tool , " said Teetzel .
" That is why you and I use the internet now to find out a lot of information that would have previously been found by us getting in a car and driving somewhere . "
" It is a little bit unfair to say that you have this huge carbon cost of the IT industry without articulating the fact that in many , many cases it offsets what I would call heavier , more carbon intense activities that we do in our daily lives , " he added .
" Moving electrons is far more efficient than moving atoms .
It is actually a paradigm change . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - California ’s newly adopted low - carbon fuel standard may mark the beginning of the end of ethanol ’s coveted status as the sole U.S. alternative motor fuel .
The U.S. state with the most cars late on Thursday approved the world ’s first - ever regulations to slash emissions of planet - warming carbon dioxide from vehicle fuels .
The ruling , which will be subject to further studies , will not kill the ethanol industry .
But it sets the bar higher for cleaner development of corn ethanol , which enjoyed an investment boost over the last few years thanks to generous federal incentives and mandates calling for increasing amounts of the fuel to be blended into gasoline .
The measure also sets the stage for emerging alternative fuels -- such as cars that run on compressed natural gas and electric vehicles like plug - in hybrids that run on both gasoline and rechargeable batteries -- to compete with second - generation ethanol .
That fuel , known as cellulosic ethanol , is expected to be made in commercial amounts from non -food feedstocks like switchgrass and fast - growing trees .
“ The ruling is the first sign that the ethanol industry could be brought out of its honeymoon phase , ” said Sander Cohan , an alternative motor fuels analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc in Boston .
“ First - generation ethanol , especially corn ethanol , is a poster child for who might be put at a disadvantage . ”
To give fuel producers time to adjust , the bulk of the carbon limits required under the regulation do not go into effect until 2015 .
But analysts said California has fired the first shot in a battle that could widen in coming years .
At least 11 other states in the U.S. East are considering adopting a low - carbon fuel standard for cars by the end of the year .
In addition , the main climate bill being considered in the U.S. Congress seeks to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from fuels .
California ’s regulators ranked 11 different ways of making corn ethanol .
They found that traditional distilling methods used in the Midwest , accounting for the bulk of U.S. supplies , emit the most carbon over a lifecycle measured from production to combustion .
The state gave much better carbon savings scores to corn ethanol made in California with a distillery fired by a blend of natural gas and crop waste , also known as biomass .
In the race to make ethanol , little regard has been paid to emissions of the distillery itself .
A handful of nearly 200 plants are fired by coal , the most carbon - heavy fossil fuel , while many others have been slow to convert to biomass .
Cellulosic ethanol faired better .
“ The standard is favorable to cellulosic and to plug - in hybrid development , but not favorable to U.S. - produced corn ethanol , ” said Divya Reddy , an analyst with the Eurasia Group in Washington .
Cars fueled by compressed natural gas , which are not yet widely available , scored slightly better than California - made ethanol , and vehicles that run on batteries , which also are just beginning to be made in the United States , scored much better .
LAND USE
The ethanol industry challenged California ’s findings , and said it would fight the regulations .
The ethanol industry ’s biggest objection is that the standard calculates an indirect carbon footprint attributed to land - use changes from the clearing of grasslands and forests to cultivate corn .
Nathan Shock , a spokesman for private company Poet , the largest U.S. ethanol producer , said those land - use calculations are unfair because the rule as currently written applies to biofuels alone , putting ethanol at a relative disadvantage .
Bob Dineen , head of ethanol industry group the Renewable Fuels Association , said the ruling could hurt investments in the development of next - generation ethanol .
Paul Winters , a spokesman for the Biotechnology Industry Association , said the ruling could hit investments by the biggest producers of corn ethanol into cellulosic .
Some traditional ethanol makers have plans to make cellulose - based fuel using readily available crop waste like corn cobs and stalks .
But as the ethanol industry argues its case , natural gas and battery - powered cars will likely make inroads in replacing petroleum , Cohan said .
“ The strength of the low - carbon standard ... is that it forces attention toward non-agricultural alternative fuels that will likely play a role in any sort of alternative fuel mix , ” he said .
Scientologist macher John Coale hatched a crazy plan to forge an alliance between Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin , Politico reported this morning .
In a rare — solitary ? — display of good judgment , Palin turned him down .
Coale proposed the idea in February , while tagging along with his wife , Fox News ' Greta van Susteren , to Alaska to shoot a promo for the Palins .
He wanted Palin 's political action committee — the creation of which Coale had masterminded — to make a symbolic $ 5,000 donation to the Clinton campaign to help her retire her debt .
Coale also tried to set up a meeting between Palin and Bill Clinton , which seems like an insane thing to do if the idea was to get Hillary to like Sarah .
The meeting never took place , which is just as well , because the Palins are preposterously fertile and she would almost certainly have gotten pregnant .
After repeated nudging by Coale , who describes the Alaska governor as a friend , Palin directed a staffer to turn him down via e-mail : " While we appreciate your efforts and recognize that a friendship with the Clintons is appropriate , the governor believes ( and I concur ) that using SarahPAC to pay down Hillary 's debt is not a prudent use of the money .
Contributors who chose between heating their homes and sending in a contribution because they believe in Sarah would be crushed . "
Politico's account certainly looks like a deliberate attempt by Palin to distance herself from Coale — whose history of attempting to infiltrate and co-opt the political system on behalf of Scientology might make the Republican Party 's Christian base uncomfortable — and from van Susteren , whose close relationship with the Palins has been attracting some unwanted attention of late .
The story obviously came from the Palin camp :
Her aides are quoted on the record speaking dismissively of Coale and seem to have provided Politico with e-mails , and Coale comes out looking like a bumbling dreamer with no political acumen .
The story also blames Coale , by implication , for a series of scheduling snafus shortly after the election in which Palin accepted mainland speaking engagements and , after being accused of trying to spend too much time in the spotlight and not enough in Alaska , reneged on them .
Indeed , the story describes Coale as a " onetime " adviser to Palin in the lead .
Ouch !
Norway 's largest Internet provider ‘ Telenor ’ was dragged to court by the movie and music industries last month , after it refused an earlier request to disable customer access to The Pirate Bay .
Today , Telenor explains why it did n't cave in to the legal pressure and says it wants the courts to rule on the issue instead .
This spring IFPI gave Norway ’s largest Internet provider Telenor an ultimatum .
The music industry group demanded that the ISP should block access to The Pirate Bay within 14 days – or face legal action .
Telenor ignored the legal threats and IFPI kept its word and took the ISP to court .
IFPI and representatives from the movie industry argue that Telenor is willingly infringing copyright by allowing its customers to access the prominent BitTorrent tracker , but Telenor disagrees with this assessment .
In a public announcement today Telenor explains why .
“ If Telenor were considered complicit in any illegal activities online , we would have to block access to websites and customers on any suspicion of illegal activity .
Telenor would then act as some sort of private police or private censorship authority , which would be very worrisome in light of important issues such as freedom of speech , ” Telenor writes .
Blocking websites upon request from the entertainment industry is “ unacceptable ” according to Telenor .
The ISP agrees that piracy is a problem and they do n’t support customers who engage in these activities , but they are refusing to censor the Internet without a court order .
“ Instead of demanding that Internet providers censor the Internet and monitor the content that ’s transferred , Telenor believes that the best way to decrease illegal file sharing is to put more effort into making legally downloadable content available . ”
The entertainment industries should find ways to monetize legal content in a way that satisfies both the copyright holders and customer .
Blocking access to websites instead would “ violate principles which constitute important prerequisites for any democracy ” .
It is good to see that an ISP like Telenor is willing to go to court to protect their rights and those of their customers , instead of taking the easy route and giving to the wishes of the copyright lobby .
Telenor rightfully emphasizes that the entertainment industry should focus on the source of the problem by developing legal alternatives that satisfy the need of their customers , a position also held by EU Commissioner Viviane Reding .
Even if IFPI wins in court , blocking The Pirate Bay is not going to be very effective .
There are several ways to get around it and thousands of other BitTorrent sites .
On top of that , the new owners of the site plan to get rid of all the copyrighted content indexed by the site .
Butter chicken ( aka “ Murgh makhani ” ) is an extraordinarily popular Indian dish that can be found at the top of menus in restaurants around
the world .
Butter chicken originated in Delhi , during the reign of the Mughal Empire .
According to a documentary by the Discovery Channel , the murgh makhani curry was invented by a person employed amongst the kitchen staff of a famous Indian restaurant called
Moti Mahal located in Daryaganj , the central region of Delhi .
Even though its ’ general recipe is widely known , the actual flavor can vary from restaurant to restaurant due to slight variations in the recipe made by various chefs .
Butter chicken is usually served with naan , parathas , or roti flat - bread , or steamed rice .
In the video below that was actually made by Tamarind Restaurant in London , we see Head Chef Alfred Prasad demonstrating precisely how to make this dish .
Tamarind is one of London ’s top restaurants , and only one of five Indian restaurants in London to receive a Michelin star ( to put that in perspective , there are only 98 restaurants to receive one star in the U.K. out of 5,500 entries , 11 received two stars , and just three got 3 stars –the best possible rating ) .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A top Federal Reserve official warned on Tuesday not to take recent gains across a range of asset prices as proof the U.S. economy is on the verge of a strong recovery .

“ The panic ’s hasty retreat should not be confused with robust recovery , ” Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh said in prepared remarks to the Institute of International Bankers annual meeting in New York .
“ The rather indiscriminate bounce off the bottom -- across virtually all assets and geographies -- may be more indicative of a one - time reset , which may or may not be complete . ”
Warsh said private demand , the true arbiter of economic performance , “ remains weak ” even while government spending has surged , and the the jobless rate is likely to peak at a higher rate , and linger longer at those high rates , than in recent recessions .
“ The ‘ jobless recovery ’ may prove to be a familiar and vexing refrain , ” he said .
“ I would expect business capital expenditures and consumer spending to continue to disappoint for the next several quarters , ” Warsh added .
Rising exports will also not provide an easy way for the U.S. economy to return to growth , he said .
“ The global economy runs the risk of being mired in a period of slower growth for several years to come . ”
RISK OF RISKING RATES
Looking forward , the Fed “ will not ... compromise price stability ” by monetizing large U.S. budget deficits , he said , warning that higher interest rates were a risk .
“ Financial markets may extract penalty pricing if fiscal authorities are unable to demonstrate a credible return to sustainable budgets , ” the policy - maker said .
The Fed will be operating at a time when political pressures call for “ still more - aggressive macroeconomic policies , ” Warsh noted .
Warsh did not foresee the fast end to the recession that many economists now anticipate , but looked for the huge fiscal and monetary stimulus to finally kick in .
“ On balance , I would not be surprised if these countervailing forces -- unprecedented public support and underwhelming private demand -- fight to a draw by the fourth quarter , ” he said .
STABILITY AT A COST ?
Warsh also warned of a trade - off between policies designed to create stability , especially after the tumult of the past couple of years , and the overall prospects for the U.S. economy .
“ Stability is a fine goal .
But it ’s not a final one , ” he said .
“ We must be wary of macroeconomic policies that -- in the name of stability -- may have the effect of lowering trend growth and employment rates . ”
In particular , to the extent that changed policies reduce potential growth , or raise the natural rate of unemployment above the 5 percent rate assumed for many years , “ it is more difficult to make good and timely policy , ” said Warsh .
An Iranian Caspian Airlines passenger plane has crashed in northwest Iran , with all of the 168 people aboard , 153 passengers and 15 crew members , presumed dead , informs Interfax news agency .
Teenagers Judo national team members who were going to participate in a preparing camp before the Hungary world championship ( August 5th ) were aboard on the crashed plane and they all lost their lives in the accident .
All the members who are in the photo died in plane crash .
This photo belongs to the last practice of Judo Teenagers National Team which has been taken a night before flight .
I was amazed to see an article on the Scientific American web site that advocates organic farming as the way forward .
It is unusual to see such a clear endorsement of organic growing by such a respected organisation .
What they say is that the run off from lawns , gardens and farm land pollutes local water courses , rivers and eventually the sea .
A 2007 study of pollution in rivers around Portland , Oregon found that wild salmon there are swimming around with dozens of synthetic chemicals in their systems .
And they do n’t stop there and cite evidence of the side effects of GM crops
Another recent study from Indiana found that a variety of corn genetically engineered to produce the insecticide
Bt is having toxic effects on non-target aquatic insects , including caddis flies , a major food source for fish and frogs .
There are the inevitable comments about how unbalanced the response is with one commenter saying it is not ‘ scientific ’ and should be removed .
I guess the truth hurts !
It also dents the profits of the huge multi-national agrochemical companies who do not want to see alternatives to their toxic , chemical soaked farming .

President Obama has committed 17,000 additional troops to Operation Enduring Freedom , our misadventure in Afghanistan .
His generals do n’t know what to do with those troops when they get there ; they ’re not even sure what troops to send .
Someone on Obama ’s sprawling national security team should have told him it ’s a bad , bad idea to send troops into a combat zone without a well - defined task and purpose .
Ronald Reagan ’s 1983 end zone fumble in Beirut should serve as a shining example of that maxim , but today ’s defense hierarchy is n’t keen on learning from the past .
Neocon luminary Fred Kagan , chief architect of the surge strategy , taught military history at West Point for a decade , which shows you how little regard the Army has for the subject .
The Keystone Kollege of Armed Konflict Knowledge that all our generals seem to have attended does n’t place much importance on coherent strategy making , either .
Who ’s on First ?
As investigative historian Gareth Porter revealed recently , Obama was willing to go along with the full 30,000 troop escalation monty for Afghanistan until the Joint Chiefs admitted they did n’t have an end game in mind and General David McKiernan , commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan , could n’t tell him what he planned to do with the extra troops .
Back in the day , all those four - stars would have kept smoke grenades handy so they ’d have something to blow up the boss ’s skirt if he asked a hard question .
Things changed over the last eight years .
McKiernan must have made the sound of one jaw dropping when he heard a commander in chief ask “ why ?
” Talk about shock and awe .
Defense secretary Robert Gates and his rear echelon commandos have been working on an Afghanistan strategy for dog years and still have n’t hit the dartboard .
One segment of the security brain trust thinks the center of gravity in Afghanistan is the Taliban .
Joint Chiefs chairman Admiral Mike Mullen says the Afghan people are “ the real centers of gravity . ”
Senator John Kerry says the center of gravity in Afghanistan is in Pakistan .
Let ’s hope Obama stays mindful of Kerry ’s track record vis -à - vis winning strategies .
Like most military matters , the center of gravity concept is broadly misunderstood , especially among the military ’s top brass .
Clausewitz dictated that the center of gravity must be “ the point against which all our energies should be directed .
” For his admonition to have any meaning , centers of gravity must be related to our objectives .
Hence , the enemy center of gravity is the main obstacle between us and our goal and is the thing we must defeat , destroy , annihilate , deceive , bypass , sucker punch , pacify , erode , eradicate , and otherwise put the whammy on in order to achieve victory .
Once we formulate a reasonably concrete and achievable goal , the center of gravity becomes relatively easy to identify .
Unfortunately , the “ concrete and reasonable goal ” factor has been AWOL since the neoconservative movement turned U.S. foreign policy into a radical equation .
We wo n’t make western democracies out of either of our Bananastans .
We wo n’t eliminate corruption in them .
We wo n’t stem opium production .
If we effect regime change we ’ll just be swapping out puppets .
It ’s too late to keep them from becoming failed states because they already are .
We might make things so Afghan girls can go to school , but that ’s a cockamamie reason for a bankrupt hegemon to wage war , especially given that half the kids in urban America do n’t finish 12th grade .
Young Mr. Obama has said he wants to ensure that Afghanistan — and by extension Pakistan — ” cannot be used as a base to launch attacks against the United States .
” That at least reflects a legitimate U.S. security goal , which is more than you can say for any of the gas his generals have been passing off as strategic acumen .
Unfortunately , as objectives go , it ’s so unrealistic as to be downright hallucinatory .
If you can launch an attack on the United States from atop the Himalayas along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan , you can launch one from any spot on the surface of the earth , or buried beneath it , or floating above it .
We ca n’t draft enough people to occupy that much territory .
We Do n’t Know
We do n’t know the enemy .
The term “ Taliban ” describes an array of groups with different leaders .
Warlords and drug lords are a whole separate power paradigm : some are aligned with one Taliban or another , some are n’t .
The line between good guys and bad guys in the Bananastans is wafer thin ; the official governments and their agencies are hardly more than sanctioned gang bangers .
Then there ’s the average Joe Bananastan who ’s just fed up with the U.S. air strikes on all the weddings he goes to .
And , oh yeah , none of those people had anything to do with 9/11 .
Air strikes have , however , “ heightened the threat ” of al Qaeda “ to Pakistan as the group disperses its cells [ there ] and fights to maintain its sanctuaries .
” That ’s according to the New York Times , the newspaper of record whose sources for that factoid were “ senior analysts and officials of Pakistan ’s main spy service ” who “ spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with the agency ’s policy . ”
Great .
Caesar’s .
Ghost .
Anonymous Pakistani intelligence officials are to reliable sources what Pig Latin is to Latin .
Equally unreliable and equally anonymous CIA officials recently told NPR that their airstrikes in Pakistan have “ decimated ” al Qaeda leadership and that they now foresee a “ complete al - Qaida defeat ” in the region .
That ’s a remarkable conclusion considering that the CIA ’s best sources of intelligence on Pakistan are Pakistani intelligence officials .
It does n’t take a bloodhound to sniff two separate agendas here .
Despite knowing nothing about ourselves and even less about the enemy — Sun Tzu ’s recipe for disaster a la king — Obama is going ahead with the Bananastan escalation his feckless generals and defense secretary have recommended .
Obama says “ the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan demands urgent attention and swift action .
” He probably feels pressured to shoot first and think later , but that ’s never a good idea .
I ’m not a world - class military historian , but I ’m a fair one , and I know of no instance in war where doing nothing proved to be an inferior course of action to doing something stupid .
The closest thing we have to legitimate security concerns in the Bananastans are that evildoers might get control of Pakistan ’s nukes and the oil pipeline that runs through Afghanistan .
There ’s a very simple military solution to both of those problems : blow up the nukes and blow up the pipeline .
Blowing stuff up is the one thing Obama ’s generals know how to do real good .
In a March 6 interview with the New York Times , Mr. Obama said he is considering a plan to “ reach out ” to moderate elements of the Taliban .
That ’s a fantastic idea , and the best possible way to reach out would be to have our troops line up and shake the hand of each and every one of those mother ’s sons and then climb on a plane for home .

Our thoughts on the study on nutrition in organics in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
We are optimistic that improved support of organic nutrition research – including the increase of organic research funding in the 2008 Farm Bill , and the work of organizations like The Organic Center – will show that nutritional advantages are another reason that organic agriculture is better than conventional .
Our shoppers choose organic food for many reasons – to avoid synthetic pesticide residue , because it is often fresher and better tasting , and because organic farmers grow in earth - friendly ways that support the environment .
Nutritional quality is one of many potential variables related to the advantages of organic food , but for us , there are already plenty of well - documented reasons to choose organic .
The authors of this study examine the abstracts of 50 years of nutritional studies , looking for differences in nutrition between organic and non-organic foods , and conclude that there are n’t any major differences .
They do n’t rule out the possibility that there could be nutritional advantages , but acknowledge that none has been demonstrated so far .
This is n’t a surprising finding , since until very recently , there has been very little governmental or non-profit support of academic nutrition research focused directly on organic agriculture .
In general , most nutrition research has not differentiated between organic and conventional crops .
As Stonyfield Farm President and CE - Yo , I believe that a new study dismissing the health benefits of organics does in fact mislead an increasingly savvy public by ignoring documented health and environmental benefits of organic .
The supreme irony is that this study is getting an enormous amount of media attention in part because of heightened consumer awareness of where our food comes from , thanks to the popularity of the documentary “ Food , Inc. ” and the discussion it ’s triggering across the country .
“ Food , Inc. ” lays bare just how bankrupt and dangerous our current food system really is , and what we are allowed to know about it .
The result is that consumers are looking more critically than ever at studies like this .
I agree with the Organic Center ( TOC ) , a non-profit industry think tank , that the authors of the United Kingdom ’s Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) study used old data and flawed logic in reaching the conclusion that organic food is no healthier than conventional .
TOC alleges that the UK study actually downplayed the positive findings which favored organic food and did not measure important nutrients such as antioxidants .
There are compelling studies that have shown organic foods higher in beneficial antioxidants , substances or nutrients in our foods known to slow or prevent heart disease , diabetes and some forms of cancer .
A 2007 Newcastle University ( UK ) study concluded organic fruit and vegetables contained up to 40 % more antioxidants than non-organic varieties ; organic milk contained more than 60 % more antioxidants and healthy fatty acids than conventional .
A 2007 study by the University of California found organic tomatoes had elevated levels of up to 97 % of two types of antioxidants .
Of greater concern to me is the fact the FSA ignores the environmental and related health benefits of an organic farming system that avoids the use of millions of pounds of toxic persistent pesticides , herbicides , fertilizer and other chemicals that leach into soil , water and air .
The man leading the FSA review actually stated the differences in nutrient content found between organic and conventionally produced food were “ unlikely to be of any public health relevance . ”
Tell that to the people who suffer a variety of health issues shown to be linked to pesticide use .
Public health is exactly what ’s at stake here .
I believe studies like the FSA report need to look beyond the dinner plate and recognize that organic farming ’s avoidance of chemicals offers health benefits beyond nutrition … for the rest , go to Huff Post Green ( you wo n’t have to go far , I know ) .
And here ’s the Organic Trade Associations ’ rather weak - kneed response ( to my mind ) .
They accept many of the charges , and simply argue around them .
Yes , organics are part of an ecosystem , and ca n’t be measured on nutrients alone .
But I ’d like to see us argue on the points we ’ve been attacked — that organic food is in and of itself not measurably better than chemical - pesticide - sewage grown “ conventional ” food .
Organic Trade Association : Organic products offer many benefits to consumers

( 413-376-1220 ; [ email protected ] ) GREENFIELD , Mass . ( July 31 , 2009 ) —
In response to recent publicity concerning an article in - press for the next issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , the Organic Trade Association ( OTA ) reminds consumers that organic has a great story to tell .
“ The broader question is about what is health and what is nutrition , and is n’t it more than just nutrient density , ” said Marion Nestle , Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition , Food Studies and Public Health at New York University , in reference to recent buzz about the article , “ Nutritional quality of organic foods : a systematic review . ”
“ Does n’t a food system that avoids the use of pesticides , synthetic growth hormones and antibiotics while building healthy soil and protecting natural resources promote health and nutrition ?
I certainly think so . ”
She added , “ I ’m surprised that investigators of this caliber would focus so narrowly on nutrient content .
There is no reason to think that organic foods would have fewer nutrients than industrially produced foods , and there are many ... for the rest , click here .
Here ’s one more :
I ’m in London and today ’s tabloid Daily Express has a headline in type two inches high : “ ORGANIC FOOD NO HEALTHIER . ”
The article begins , “ Eating organic food in the belief that it is good for your health is a waste of money , new research shows . ”
Really ?
This surprising statement is based on the conclusions of a lengthy report ( pdf ) just released from the British Food Standards Agency , Comparison of composition ( nutrients and other substances ) of organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs : a systematic review of the available literature .
This report , done by excellent researchers at the prestigious London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine , looked at the results of 162 studies comparing organic to conventionally grown foods for their content of nutrients and other substances .
Although it found higher amounts of some nutrients in organic crops , it found higher amounts of others in conventional crops , and no difference in others .
On this basis , the report concludes :
There is no good evidence that increased dietary intake , of the nutrients identified in this review to be present in larger amounts in organically than in conventionally produced crops and livestock products , would be of benefit to individuals consuming a normal varied diet , and it is therefore unlikely that these differences in nutrient content are relevant to consumer health .
In a statement accompanying release of the report , the Food Standards Agency says :
The Agency supports consumer choice and is neither pro nor anti organic food .
We recognise that there are many reasons why people choose to eat organic , such as animal welfare or environmental concerns .
The Agency will continue to give consumers accurate information about their food based on the best available scientific evidence .
Fine , but do animal welfare and environmental concerns not matter ?
The authors of the report summarize their findings in a paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
The paper concludes :
On the basis of a systematic review of studies of satisfactory quality , there is no evidence of a difference in nutrient quality between organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs .
The small differences in nutrient content detected are biologically plausible and mostly relate to differences in production methods .
Oh ?
I thought that ’s what organic foods were about – production methods : no antibiotics , hormones , pesticides , herbicides , chemical fertilizers , irradiation , genetic modification , or sewage sludge .
I thought better production methods were the precise point of organic foods .

The Organic Center Challenges New Study Results ; Defends the Nutritional Superiority of Organic Foods
An advance copy of a study appeared yesterday that will be published in the September edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
The published paper , “ Nutritional quality of organic foods : a systematic review , ” was written by a team led by Alan Dangour at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .
The study , commissioned by the U.K. Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) , claims that there are no differences in nutritional quality between conventional and organic foods .
. The Organic Center ’s chief scientist , Dr. Chuck Benbrook , has written a strong response questioning the methodology and challenging the findings of this study , and we wanted to let you know where you can access it , as you may be responding to media and other inquiries in this regard .
C lick here to see Dr. Benbrook ’s full response to this controversial study
According to Dr. Benbrook , the U.K. research team reported finding statistically significant differences between organically and conventionally grown crops in only three of thirteen categories of nutrients .
Significant differences cited by the team included nitrogen , which was higher in conventional crops , and phosphorus and titratable acids , both of which were higher in the organic crops .
As most scientists regard elevated levels of nitrogen in food as a potential cancer - causing agent , this finding of higher nitrogen in conventional food favors organic crops , as do the other two differences .
Despite the fact that these three categories of nutrients favored organic foods , and none favored conventionally grown foods , the London - based team concluded that there are no nutritional differences between organically and conventionally grown crops .
However , a team of scientists convened by The Organic Center ( TOC ) carried out a similar , but more rigorous , review of the same literature .
The TOC team analyzed published research just on plant - based foods .
Results differ significantly from the more narrow FSA review and are reported in the study “ New Evidence Confirms the Nutritional Superiority of Plant - Based Organic Foods , ” which is freely accessible on the TOC website ( http://www.organic-center.org/science.nutri.php?action=view&report_id=126 ) .
The TOC findings are similar for some of the nutrients analyzed by the FSA team , but differ significantly for two critical classes of nutrients of great importance in promoting human health – total polyphenols , and total antioxidant content .
The FSA team did not include total antioxidant capacity among the nutrients studied , and it found no differences in the phenolic content in 80 comparisons across 13 studies .

A new standoff was brewing in Honduras as the country 's recently deposed president vowed to return , while the new provisional government said it would arrest him if he set foot back in the country .
Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya appears Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly .

Political turmoil has swept this Central American nation of 8 million people following a military - led coup Sunday that ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya .
Troops entered the president 's residence and sent him out of the country in exile .
A veteran legislator , Roberto Micheletti , was sworn in that same day as provisional president with the support of congress .
Roberto Micheletti , the veteran legislator who was sworn in that same day as provisional president with the support of congress , was adamant that Zelaya would not return to power .
" He already committed crimes against the constitution and the laws ; he can't return to be president of the republic , " Micheletti told reporters Tuesday .
" He can no longer return to the presidency unless a president from another Latin American country comes and imposes him with arms . "
Micheletti added , " If there is an invasion against our country , we have seven - and - a - half million Hondurans ready to defend our territory and our laws and our homeland and our government . "
However , Zelaya still vows to defy the provisional government .
" I am going to return on Thursday because they expelled me by force , and I am going to return as always : as a citizen and as president , " Zelaya said at a U.N. news conference shortly after the world body unanimously adopted a resolution that he should be restored to power .
Zelaya , speaking to the U.N. General Assembly , called the resolution historic .
" Your servant has several accusations against him in Honduras , " Zelaya said .
" But nobody has given me a trial .
Nobody has convened a tribunal . "
Meanwhile , Micheletti's provisional government said Zelaya would be arrested if he returned .
" As soon as he arrives he will be captured , as we already have the arrest warrants ready , " new Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez Colindres told CNN en Español .
Zelaya would face charges of violating the constitution , corruption and drug trafficking , among others , Ortez said .
The deposed president said he would travel to Washington to attend a meeting of the Organization of American States .
He also is expected to meet Tuesday evening with Tom Shannon , the top U.S. official on Latin America .
Even as Zelaya spoke at the United Nations , his opponents held a large and noisy rally in Tegucigalpa , the capital of Honduras .
Crowd members waved blue and white Honduran flags and signs denouncing Zelaya .
Roberto Micheletti , the new provisional president , briefly addressed the crowd Tuesday afternoon .
He vowed that the next national elections , slated for November , will be held as planned , and that a new president will be sworn in as usual in January .
Gen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez , the top Honduran military commander who had butted heads with Zelaya , also spoke at the rally .
By removing Zelaya , the armed forces were only complying with their constitutional duties , he said .
Before he spoke , the crowd chanted in support , " Armed forces !
Armed forces ! "
Zelaya supporters also were active Tuesday , with three major public - sector labor unions launching a general strike , a union official told CNN .
About 100,000 workers joined the strike , said Oscar Garcia , vice president of the Honduran water workers union SANAA .
That number could not be independently verified .
" It will be an indefinite strike , " Garcia said .
" We do n't recognize this new government imposed by the oligarchy , and we will mount our campaign of resistance until President Manuel Zelaya is restored to power . "
Also on Tuesday , the U.S. State Department said it was reviewing its aid to Honduras as it works with regional partners on a deal to restore Zelaya to power and quell political unrest in the country .
State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the U.S. was reviewing whether Zelaya 's ouster met the legal definition of a " coup " before any decision was made .
" Because of the situation and the very dramatic nature of the events there and our profound concern about what 's going on there , I think we 're looking at a number of aspects of our cooperation , " Kelly said .
The State Department has also issued a travel alert due " to the current unstable political and security situation in Honduras . "
The alert " recommends that American citizens defer all nonessential travel to Honduras until further notice . "
In another development , two U.S. military officials in Washington confirmed to CNN that U.S. helicopters will fly over southern Honduras on a humanitarian relief mission Tuesday .
The officials said there is great sensitivity to any public appearance by the U.S. military in the country .
The U.S. military also postponed some planned exercises with the Honduran military until the situation in the country settles down , according to the U.S. Southern Command .
" We have postponed certain activities , " Maj. D.L. Wright , Southern Command spokesman , told CNN .
Wright said this decision would be in effect for at least two to three weeks , or " until the political situation settles . "
Zelaya was overthrown early Sunday when the Honduran military arrested him and flew him to Costa Rica .
Micheletti , president of the Congress , was sworn in as provisional president later Sunday .
The United Nations , OAS and most nations in the Western Hemisphere , including the United States , have condemned the ouster and demanded that Zelaya be restored to power .
The World Bank said Tuesday it would freeze funds to Honduras until the crisis is resolved , and the United States said it is reviewing its aid to the Central American nation .
The U.S. joined many other nations in co-sponsoring Tuesday 's U.N. resolution .
Zelaya had been at odds with the other branches of government over a referendum he wanted to hold Sunday .
The Honduran Supreme Court had ruled that the referendum was illegal , and Congress had voted not to hold it .
The high court also had overturned Zelaya 's dismissal of Honduras ' top general , who said the military would not participate in the referendum .
The court ordered that the general be reinstated immediately .
Zelaya disregarded those actions and vowed to hold the vote anyway .

In a radio address Tuesday , Micheletti said Zelaya would be arrested if he came back .

Micheletti also told Honduras ' representatives at the United Nations and OAS to quit speaking against the new government or they immediately will be removed from their posts .
They are not authorized , he said , to speak for the Honduran government .
In another development , two U.S. military officials in Washington confirmed to CNN that American helicopters will fly over southern Honduras on a humanitarian relief mission Tuesday .
The officials said there is great sensitivity to any public appearance by the U.S. military in the country .
Three Black Hawk helicopters are scheduled to leave an air base at Soto Cano in Honduras and fly south to Nicaragua .
They will be used to support the USNS Comfort , which is conducting a medical relief mission .

“ One of the greatest tragedies in mankind 's entire history may be that morality was hijacked by religion . ”
― Arthur C. Clarke
In an obscenity first , a U.S. comic book collector has pleaded guilty to importing and possessing Japanese manga books depicting illustrations of child sex abuse and bestiality .
Christopher Handley , described by his lawyer as a " prolific collector " of manga , pleaded guilty last week to mailing obscene matter , and to " possession of obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children . "
Three other counts were dropped in a plea deal with prosecutors .
The 39 - year - old office worker was charged under the 2003 Protect Act , which outlaws cartoons , drawings , sculptures or paintings depicting minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct , and which lack " serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . "
Handley 's guilty plea makes him the first to be convicted under that law for possessing cartoon art , without any evidence that he also collected or viewed genuine child pornography .
He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison .
Comics fans are alarmed by the case , ( .pdf ) , saying that jailing someone over manga does nothing to protect children from sexual abuse .
" This art that this man possessed as part of a larger collection of manga ... is now the basis for [ a sentence ] designed to protect children from abuse , " says Charles Brownstein , executive director of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund .
" The drawings are not obscene and are not tantamount to pornography .
They are lines on paper . "
Congress passed the Protect Act after the Supreme Court struck down a broader law prohibiting any visual depictions of minors engaged in sexual activity , including computer - generated imagery and other fakes .
The high court ruled that the ban was overbroad , and could cover legitimate speech , including Hollywood productions .
In response , the Protect Act narrows the prohibition to cover only depictions that the defendant 's community would consider " obscene . "
" It 's probably the only law I 'm aware of , if a client shows me a book or magazine or movie , and asks me if this image is illegal , I can't tell them , " says Eric Chase , Handley 's attorney .
Chase says he recommended the plea agreement ( . pdf ) to his client because he did n't think he could convince a jury to acquit him once they 'd seen the images in question .
The lawyer declined to describe the details .
" If they can imagine it , they drew it , " he says .
" Use your imagination .
It was there . "
The case began in 2006 , when customs officials intercepted and opened a package from Japan addressed to Handley .
Seven books of manga inside contained cartoon drawings of minors engaged in sexually explicit acts .
One book included depictions of bestiality , according to stipulations in Handley 's plea deal .
Frenchy Lunning , a manga expert at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design , was a consultant in the case .
She says the books were from the widely available Lolicon variety – a Japanese word play on " Lolita . "
" This stuff is huge in Japan , in all of Asia , " Lunning says .
Handley , she adds , " is not a pedophile .
He had no photographs of child pornography . "
Handley remains free pending a yet - to - be scheduled sentencing date .
Mike Bladel , a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of Iowa , declined to state what kind of sentence the government would seek , but claimed there were hundreds of obscene panels in the seized manga .
Chase says he 's hoping the judge will take into account the circumstances .
" He was a prolific collector , " says the lawyer .
" He did not focus on this type of manga .
He collected everything that was out there that he could get his hands on .
I think this makes a huge difference . "

V - Vehicle Company , a startup automaker announced it will move into a former General Motors plant in Monroe Lousiana to build environmentally friendly vehicles , state and company officials announced today .
The San Diego - based firm founded in 2006 by Frank Varasano , a former executive at Oracle Corp. , will employ about 1,400 people once production of the car starts , the company said .
We 've designed and engineered this car from start to finish to give the U.S. consumer a quality car with great value made right here in America , Varasano said Wednesday in a statement posted on the Lousiana Economic Development website .
The car will be designed by Tom Matano , the designer of the Mazda Miata .
Production of the vehicle will begin in about 18 months , according to V - Vehicle Vice President , Horst Metz , the Associated Press noted .
Investors in the company 's project include venture capital fund Kleiner , Perkins Caufield & Byers and energy investor T. Boone Pickens .
Watch the video below where Indiana Gov. Bobby Jindal introduces V - Vehicle 's project .

Establish internal policies and procedures .
After you and your client sign the contract , be sure to keep it handy .
Refer to the contract to manage your internal team , even if it ’s a team of one .
This will help maintain a professional relationship with your client .
In our experience , it ’s mostly been the buddy - to - buddy or “ bro deal ” projects that take a turn for the worse due to a lack of professionalism .
Determine who is responsible for each deliverable , what are the deadlines and milestones your team needs to hit .
When you set up the various tasks for your team members , make sure they ’re tracking their time against each task , and accurately recording their activities every day .
If they spend an hour on design and an hour in a conference call with a client , those should be two separate time - item entries .
Falling behind just one day , letting small bits of time slip between the cracks , or incorrectly categorizing time entries can produce fissures in a project .
Make sure everyone understands what their part of the project entails , including the client ’s feedback .
Then hold each one accountable for their work and deadlines .
In the case of subcontractors we have found them most productive when we encourage them to track their time in our web - based task management system because it results in more collaboration and them getting paid sooner .
This will help you down the road when the client asks you where you are in terms of budget , or if she wants to know why a particular aspect of the project took so much time .
You ’ll have the information you need at your fingertips — often it is the client ’s own requests that ring up a lot of time , and unless you track and document that time , you ’ll have a hard time justifying your invoices .
I ca n’t say this enough .
Accountability is one of the key components to keeping clients happy and getting paid .
Freelancers should follow these guidelines as well .
You would n’t allow another designer to spend twice the allotted time on a project assuming that someone else will “ make up their time ” in development , but it ’s much easier to convince ourselves that we will somehow manage to “ make it up later . ”
This often results in missed deadlines and twice the work for the same price — never a winning deal .
At Pelago , we keep track of our people .
Since we ’re a small business , we have weekly meetings at the local diner ; where we go over each project , touching base with each member of the team to see how things are going and if there are any issues the rest of the team needs to be aware of .
A followup meeting on Wednesday usually gets us over the hump and keeps the ball rolling until the end of the week .
How Pelago learned this the hard way :
Several years ago , one of our developers informed a client their web site was going to be the “ Ferrari ” of web sites , with all of the latest and greatest features .
Once informed of this conversation we pulled the e-brake and reviewed the contract with the client to explain why that was n’t the case , explaining to him that he ’d been misinformed .
The damage had already been done , however , and the client could not understand why he was n’t getting everything promised to him by our developer .
Despite a well articulated and agreed upon contract , the client demanded that we stay true to “ our ” word .
Needless to say , the relationship did not end well .
Adam , also known as Geva Binyamin , is already home to about 3,500 settlers Israel has approved the construction of 50 new housing units in a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank .
Officials said the homes would house settlers being moved from a nearby unauthorised outpost and were only the first part of an expansion plan .
The move runs counter to a demand by Israel 's major ally and backer , the US , that it stop all settlement activity on occupied Palestinian land .
It came hours before Defence Minister Ehud Barak was due to fly to the US .
Correspondents say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reluctance to comply with a freeze on building in settlements puts him on a collision course with the US .
Israel argues that settlements must be allowed " natural growth " , although recent official statistics showed many new homes are purchased by newcomers from Israel or abroad .
The Palestinian Authority says settlements - which are illegal under international law - are one of the biggest barriers to peace , and has vowed to stay away from negotiations until building work is frozen .
Mr Barak will hold talks in the US with President Barack Obama 's Middle East envoy , George Mitchell .
Mr Netanyahu and Mr Mitchell were due to meet in Paris last Thursday , but their talks were cancelled .
Unauthorised Israel intends to remove about 200 people from the Migron outpost - deemed illegal by Israel as it is built on private Palestinian land - and re-house them in Adam settlement , north of Jerusalem .
Demolition work has failed to uproot settlers from the place they call Migron
The disclosure comes in an affidavit from the Defence Ministry to the Israeli Supreme Court in response to a court case brought by the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now .
The document speaks of a master plan to build 1,450 more residential units at Adam , but only 50 of these have been given the go - ahead .
Any additional units would require separate approval from the Defence Ministry , the document said .
A Peace Now spokesman said moving settlers from the small unauthorised camp on a hilltop to a 3,500 - strong settlement established by the government sent the wrong message .
" ( Settlers ) who set up illegal outposts and threatened to use violence if evicted have benefited because the outcome will be that their original settlement will have grown 30 - fold , " said Yariv Oppenheimer .
Lawyer Michael Sfard , who acts for the Palestinian landowners , told the BBC : " It is outrageous that this is how the government deals with outposts : providing outlaws with a new house . "
He also described the government 's announcement as an " act of panic " , before the final hearing on the fate of Migron is due to be held next Monday .
The Israeli authorities have repeatedly removed structures from the Migron site , but settlers have always returned to rebuild them .
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , occupied by Israel in the 1967 war .

Source verification of digital information has risen to prominence with the Iranian election protests that have been ongoing since Saturday , 13 June , 2009 .
This does not just apply to alleged information distributed through social media , of course , as it also applies to mainstream media who , like the BBC , have been found to use doctored photos of protests showing a massive rally for Mir Hosein Mousavi that was actually a rally in support of the winning candidate , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
In an attempt to convince rapid readers who do not make time to fact check , or cannot check facts , it has become a habit for some who use Twitter to precede their tweet with the word , “ CONFIRMED , ” without any indication of how the information was confirmed , when , and by whom .
“ Citizen journalism ” and civil society politics are both going to get damaged unless we take away some lessons from this conflict .
One of the recurring problems , having now spent some more time viewing YouTube and flickr streams for the Iranian protests , is that of verifying visual documentation .
One can lie with images just as easily as one can lie with words and statistics , and there is no returning to the optimistic and naive positivism of the 19th Century when it comes to the then widely assumed veracity , accuracy , and verisimilitude of the mechanically produced image .
The latest example I have seen is of an apparently desperate effort to come up with some sort of evidence to support Mousavi ’s still unproven claims of electoral fraud , now a week later .
One YouTube video ( below ) , which is usefully blurry and does not indicate time , location , or indicate who the person involved may be , tries to show a single person in a room marking some ballots , which could well have been facsimiles produced with a colour printer .
This is supposed to show us that votes were fabricated , and , that the perpetrators were foolish enough to record themselves doing it and then even more foolish to lend their video to others .
It does not show the ballots being stuffed in boxes , nor is their any evidence that this was recorded during the elections .
Keeping in mind that there is absolutely no fool proof mechanism for averting any doubts about the credibility of one ’s video , especially when using digital media and some wonderful special effects packages that anyone can master — see this video …
there are some basic steps that any person can take to boost the credibility of a video , especially when the video is meant to document an event of critical importance with sharp disputation concerning the numbers of protesters , their location , and so forth .
If too many doubts accumulate , then the authorities , and the mainstream media , can begin to poke holes into any claim of a mass movement taking shape on the streets .
In that spirit , let me offer some suggestions for your consideration , and please feel free to add , detract , and amend , in your comments below .
1. AUTHENTICATE THE DATE / TIME OF YOUR PHOTO / VIDEO .
Activist photo and video developed to document and support a protest movement does not need to be pretty or experimental — so do not be shy of having your video or photo camera impose its date stamp and time counter on the image .
In video , leaving the time counter running is very important as it can be used as evidence of when a video was edited , and how much was left out .
Date stamps can be altered in - camera of course , so I would also recommend that one learn a lesson from hostage takers and kidnappers : show a close up of the masthead , date , and main headline of a leading local newspaper , and then zoom out slowly to show the subject of your video — let ’s say it is a protest march .
One of the main problems with the Tehran protest videos , and the mainstream media have been quick to point this out repeatedly , is that one does not know for certain on which day a video was taken , and the difference can between the events of one day and the next can be of critical importance .
Some Middle Eastern journalists have been quick to analyze protest photographs and found in some cases that pre-election rally photographs were being recycled and used to show evidence of support for Mousavi ’s post-election protests .
2. THE WEATHER .
As has already been done with videos on YouTube , concerning the especially momentous events of this very day in Tehran , some have said “ it is raining in Tehran , your video shows sunny skies ” .
To further authenticate the date that a video was taken , especially when the video is distributed online ( which affords for additional documentary evidence ) , provide a link to a weather service that indicates the weather conditions for that location on that day .
3. THE SURROUNDINGS .
A video showing people at eye level , rushing past , while panning the camera , obscures the location of the event being recorded .
Slow down .
Get an unusual or well known landmark that can be associated with that location , within the frame of your image .
Even better is visual information on features of the surroundings that can be used to attest to time and place ( garbage that has not yet been picked up , broken street lamps , etc. ) .
You want people to know that your video was taken on X Street in Y City ( on Z Day ) , so they cannot claim it is taken from somewhere else , perhaps more obscure and less politically relevant location .
4. TAKE IT EASY !
The camera is not meant to be an extension of your flickering eye movements , accompanying your eyes in whichever direction they move .
In other words , do not use your camera to look .
Too many videos are out there that show a rapid sweeping from side to side , even up and down , blurring and obscuring everything , and revealing little to nothing .
Pause and gain control .
Keep the camera study , and do not think that your eye must remain glued to the viewfinder at all times .
5. GETTING A VIEW OF THE SIZE OF A DEMONSTRATION .
One of the first things that will be disputed is how many people came out to protest , where the quantity can then be assigned with a qualitative assessment : “ So few people , it must be that they are losing support or have lost credibility ” .
Being able to convincingly show how many people are at a protest march can involve incredible leg work .
Here are a number of options , and the more of these that you can follow the better ( and note that some apply to video only ) :
( a) Get to a high location , like the roof of a building , or the top of a hill .
First , try to see if you can fit everyone within a single frame , the whole mass .
Second , position your camera at the front of the march , hold it steady , and do not move until the end of the march passes by .
This allows reporters and others to do a much more accurate headcount .
Let others edit the footage for the purpose of fitting it into a news slot or whatever , but do not stop recording at any point , and do not edit the footage that you supply to news media .
( b) If using a video camera , at street level , get to either the very front or the very back of the march , and slowly walk the entire length of the march with your camera facing the protesters .
I prefer to do things the harder way , which can be a real physical struggle , and that is to start from the back and walk to the front : that way only the backs of the heads of the protesters are recorded , which makes it more difficult for the authorities to identify people than when you get them full face .
If using a photo camera , get segments of the march , and use those at the back of the segment in one photo for the front of the segment of the next photo , so that some sort of seamless continuity can be reconstructed .
If using a cell phone video camera , you will likely not have enough storage space to follow this option , therefore try ( a ) above .
If anyone can think of other ideas to add , or would correct or amend what is presented above , or even argue that some of the options above should not be used , please provide feedback below .

CAIRO – In remarks being translated live for broadcasts and Webcasts in every major language , President Barack Obama said Thursday that the United States wants “ common ground ” and “ a new beginning ” with the Muslim world , where America ’s image plummeted with the Bush administration ’s response to the 9/11 attacks .
“ Much has been made of the fact that an African - American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected President .
But my personal story is not so unique , ” he said in the Grand Hall of Cairo University .
“ The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America , but its promise exists for all who come to our shores . ”
The 55 - minute speech was remarkable and historic not so much for the delivery or even the words , but for the context , the orator , the moment .
Obama included blunt talk about the United States , Israel , Iraq , his predecessor and al Qaeda .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ I am aware that some question or justify the events of 9/11 , ” he said , speaking before a red curtain and six pairs of U.S. and Egyptian flags .
“ But let us be clear : al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The president , who left the room to applause from an audience carefully chosen to reflect diverse perspectives , invoked the “ Holy Koran ” twice , and the “ Holy Bible ” once .
“ It ’s easier to start wars than to end them ” he said .
“ It ’s easier to blame others than to look inward ; to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share .
But we should choose the right path , not just the easy path .
There is one rule that lies at the heart of every religion – that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us .
[ Applause ]
This truth transcends nations and peoples . ”
[…]
Conservative critics seized on a passage in which he said : “ Given our interdependence , any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail .
So whatever we think of the past , we must not be prisoners of it .
Our problems must be dealt with through partnership ; progress must be shared . ”

LOS ANGELES , May 16 ( UPI ) -- New Miss USA Kristen Dalton says the recent controversy surrounding Miss California Carrie Prejean has helped the Miss Universe Organization .
The 2009 Miss USA Pageant winner said the media fallout from Prejean 's pageant comment against same - sex marriage will likely mean increased ratings for the annual fashion event in 2010 , E !
Online reported Friday .

" I really think that it 's great for the Miss Universe Organization , because it 's given us a lot of publicity , " Dalton said .
" And there 's gonna be a lot of people watching this Miss USA pageant next year . "
Dalton also defended Prejean 's right to voice her opinions in such a public forum , while also clarifying her own position on gay marriage .
" Everybody has the right to vocalize their own opinion , " Dalton said .
" Me personally -- I think that everybody deserves equal rights , it 's really as simple as that . "
E! Online said Prejean was allowed to keep her Miss California crown despite her comment and the recent release of topless lingerie photographs she posed for when she was only 17 .
Crust Pants .
What are they ?
Where do they come from ?
Where do they go ?
Chances are , if you are living in the USA and not in Minneapolis or Portland , you will have no idea what this article is talking about .
Do n't be afraid , loyal reader , and follow me on a wonderful journey through one of the many fashion subcultures of a musical subgenre of a musical subculture known as punk .
You have probably guessed that the " crust " in " crust pants " is referring to crust punk , that subgenre easily related to people whose main interests are dogs on ropes , panhandling , riding the rails , and stabbing Jack Control .
Believe it or not , there are crust fans outside of these pathetic examples of humanity - whether they are more or less pathetic depends on what side you 're on .
We 'll start with " What are they ? " - crust pants are generally black jeans ( some exceptions are made on the darker end of the blue spectrum ) that have been deconstructed to the point of appearing to be constructed entirely of patches - a punk quilt , made into pants , if you will .
Now you may be saying , " where did these come from ? " - a good question .
Historians point to somewhere in the UK in the late 70s , early 80s .
Original crust pants were smeared with jam , to stiffen them up and increase dark shininess ( sources available on request ) .
What happens when you get married , have a kid , move somewhere where there 's no good gigs , or just graduate university ?
What are you supposed to do with your crust pants ?
Some people sell them on internet auction sites , fetching upwards of $ 200 if they 're lucky , while others seem to appear on homeless men in Japan , so they just go to the trash .
You see , there 's no glory in wearing another man 's crust pants ( or another woman 's crust skirt ) , you make your own , you live with them , you die with them , and in between you never wash them but , according to my research , you do occasionally wear other pants to go to work or whatever norms do .
That 's right : I did research on this .
No half - baked pseudo myspace - blog personal article writing at Terminal Boredom , no sir .
We 're academics with university degrees and student loan payments !
The following interviews were held at Practice space / Recording Studio / Live House " Iko Iko " in the America Village section of Osaka , Japan on the night of Saturday , February 28th .
The event in question was a regulation crust gig with the following bands : PATRONAGE , KUTSUJOKU , STRANGE FACTORY , DEATH DUST EXTRACTOR , HATSURI , and DEVASTATED GOES .
I interviewed some band members as well as regular fans with a set of seven questions specifically about their crust pants : A : Name ?
B : Age ?
C : Age of your crust pants ?
D : Do you own more than one pair ?
E : Do you wear them every day ?
F : What are the advantages / disadvantages to crust pants , if any ?
G : Do you have a favorite hole / tear / patch on the pants ?

CRUST PANTS HOW - TO Do It Yourself for Punx by Toyokatsu 1 .
You have to use slim fit , black pants for this .
Stretch is best !
If you can't find something in your size , just go with whatever works .
No matter how many you make , crust pants usually take about five years to find their best size .
So grab what you 've got and let 's get going !
2 . Next up , cloth .
You need cloth .
Gather up stuff from wherever you can .
Sakana from ZYANOSE used his school uniform .
He had lots of fabric , but because of using it , he always acts like a stupid middle schooler .
Be careful !
Do n't buy new fabric - use stuff you are n't wearing now - old work clothes , sweatpants , whatever .
This is important .
3 . Now we 'll start cutting it all up !
Takayama from FRAMTID 's really pretty crust pants look like something from a high fashion boutique - they 're stupid !!
He 's stupid !!
You do n't want people writing stuff like this about you , so cut however you want .
We 'll start with your pants .
Open up some holes in each leg - high on the right leg and again around the shin on the right leg .
High on the left leg with some smaller holes underneath it .
Do n't touch the shin area .
Now you want to start cutting up your fabric into various shapes and sizes .
Remember : do n't be too perfect about it - whatever shapes and sizes you make will be okay .
Do it at random .
It takes some real " sense " to get it right , but it 's not that hard .
Try changing some colors - but if you overdo it , you 'll ruin the look !
To be sure , use black as your main color .
Throwing in too much detail is out - it 'll look unnatural or strained .
Do n't make yourself look like a cosplayer .
That 's the stupidest looking thing .
4 . Now let 's add some sexiness !
Attach a zipper !
Fat zippers , skinny zippers , it 's all good .
Next , patches !
Put a patch of your favorite band in a place where everyone can see .
But , it 's no good if you put too many patches on , so be careful .
You do n't want to look like an F1 car , after all .
5 . Atmosphere .
Let 's make you look creepy .
Smear some ink on the pants .
Originally , E.N.T. used coal tar all mixed together in big globs .
Since we 're noisecore , look like you slept in the dirt .
After you 've finished applying various earthen materials , splash some bleach on the pants .
Now they 're starting to look like crust pants !
6 . The last step .
Go to a show !
You need to expose these to all the blood , sweat and tears that you can .
If you stand in the back all the time , there 's no way your pants will look as good as if you 're up front enjoying yourself and shedding as much sweat as possible .
Enjoy your punk life and live it up !
Same goes for your leather jacket and boots - do n't be afraid to get them dirty with other peoples ' juices .
7 . Truth is , you 'll get a girl with these !
Hahhaa !
They 'll know you made these and be into you .
I think they 're easily the number one punk item .

Officials with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said Thursday they have scheduled a Sept. 2 parole hearing for Atkins in Los Angeles .
But Atkins , who gained infamy for her role in the 1969 slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and others in a bloody two - night rampage in Los Angeles , may get one last chance to convince state parole officials she should no longer be kept behind bars .
Last year , doctors diagnosed Susan Atkins with terminal cancer , prompting a failed bid by the convicted murderer and Charles Manson follower to receive a " compassionate release " from state prison .
Atkins has served 38 years in prison , longer than any other female prisoner , officials said .
Before last year 's attempt , she was most recently considered for , and denied , parole in 2000 .
In early 2008 Atkins was diagnosed with brain cancer .
With one leg amputated and the other paralyzed , Atkins has only six months to live , doctors say .
Atkins petitioned for so - called compassionate release , igniting a debate about when mercy is appropriate .
Those backing her release argued unsuccessfully that the cost of keeping Atkins in prison , which by now could be well over a million dollars , should have favored her release because it would save the state substantial amounts of money .
Others , including former Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi , said it was a question of mercy and told The Times it was wrong to say " just because Susan Atkins showed no mercy to her victims , we therefore are duty - bound to follow her inhumanity and show no mercy to her . "
But most were unwavering in their contention she should die in prison considering her crimes .
Tate , the wife of film director Roman Polanski , was 8 1/ 2 months pregnant when she and four others were killed at her hilltop home in Benedict Canyon .
The actress , who was stabbed to death , had begged Atkins for her life .
" She asked me to let her baby live , " Atkins told parole officials in 1993 .
" I told her I did n't have mercy for her . "
Atkins was housed at the California Institution for Women in Corona from April 1971 until March 2008 , when she was transferred to a local hospital for treatment .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip released three leaders from the rival Fatah faction of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , hours after they were arrested for questioning , Fatah officials said on Saturday .
The Hamas - run Interior Ministry in the Gaza Strip said the Fatah men were detained for questioning after holding an “ illegal factional meeting . ”
Fatah officials later confirmed that the three men had been released .
They said among those held was Abdel - Rahman Hamad , a former minister in the Palestinian Authority , who had been meeting fellow Fatah members in the city of Gaza .
Hamas and Fatah will meet on April 1 in Cairo for a new round of Egyptian - brokered unity talks aimed at healing a rift that has been widening since the Islamists group seized the Gaza Strip in 2007 from forces loyal to Abbas .
The Palestinian president later set up a new administration in the West Bank , where Fatah holds sway .

Downgrade your package and reduce add - on options .

Transportation
1. Get Rid of Your Car
Do you need a car ?
If there are alternatives that do n’t cost you too much time or money , it might be worth getting rid of your car altogether .
For example , living in New York City , it might be easier and cheaper to take the subway , bus , or walk .
When you get rid of your car , you eliminate a lot of related expenses , e.g. , car payments , insurance , repairs , registration , taxes , inspection , tickets , gasoline , etc .
2. Maintain Your Car
That check engine light on your dash and that rattle in your muffler will cost a lot more tomorrow than it will today .
Nip costly parts and labor charges in the bud while you have the cash , rather than waiting until your car breakdown and it becomes an emergency ( and possibly needing to take out a loan ) .
Stay on top of the service schedule .
Change your oil as needed .
Keep your tires properly inflated and rotate them regularly .
3. Walk More
Hoofing it two blocks to the grocery store for that jug of milk will get you some exercise , ease off the environment , and put off your next trip to the gas station for a bit longer .
Try it — you might actually enjoy the fresh air .
More Ideas
Switch to a less expensive car .
If you use your car regularly and ca n’t get rid of it , it might be more practical to switch to a less expensive one .

Practice Hypermiling .
For example :
Do not accelerate to red light , stop sign or traffic jam ahead Drive at the speed limit and accelerate slowly to save gas
For example : Gasoline :
Fill your car up when you ’re down to a quarter tank of gas .
You wo n’t be stuck going to the nearest , most expensive gas station when your car is on empty .
Use GasBuddy.com to search for the lowest prices on gas , or buy them from Costco and other warehouse clubs .
Stop using premium gas .
Unless your car needs the higher octane , you ’re just throwing away money .
Higher octane does n’t give you more horsepower .
Health
Eat healthily .

Buy from Amazon Wireless .
Amazon Wireless offers a lot of choices that are often cheaper than a store - bought phone .
Food and Household Items
Food prices could be a significant portion of your budget , and the bad news is that they are not getting any cheaper .
Depending on where you live and the selection of local stores , some food can be extraordinary expensive compared to the norm .
The good news is that you can still keep food expenses manageable if you follow these easy to follow tips .
1. Plan Your Shopping Trip
If you plan your grocery shopping carefully , you can significantly reduce your costs for three reasons :
Make a list of what you want to buy before you buy , helps you stop impulse shopping .
Buy items in bulk when it makes sense saves you money .
Comparison shopping helps you get the best value for your money .
For instance , Costco offers a much better value than our local supermarket for fruits , vegetables , and meats .
Instead of buying everything from the local supermarket , we plan a trip to Costco about twice a month and buy most of what we need in bulk , and limit local supermarket shopping to things that run out in between , or things that are easily perishable .
2. Eat More Vegetables
Vegetables are on average cheaper than meats .
It certainly is not practical for a family to suddenly switch from meat - based meals to vegetarian meals just to save money .
However , making vegetables a larger part of each meal , or even planning one vegetarian meal per week is not out of reach for most families .
3. Drink Water
A soft drink at a restaurant can add upwards of $ 3 to your tab , buying sodas for your home is not much cheaper either .
Not to mention that no calorie - free drink quenches your thirst better than pure , natural H2O .
Adding a decent water filter to your tap or a filter pitcher to your fridge will keep you more hydrated , healthier , and a little bit wealthier .
4. Start Your Meals with a Soup
Soups are easy to make , and one pot can last several meals .
You can cook once in a large quantity and save the rest for other days .
They are also great at curbing your appetite and cut down your overall food expenses .
Now that we are going into the winter months , they are also great at keeping you warm and comfy .
5. Bring Your Breakfast and Lunch from Home
Eating out daily adds up very quickly .
Even relatively cheap breakfast and lunch could easily add up to $ 15 per day — that ’s $ 75 a week !
A loaf of sliced bread is only $ 2 - 3 , and a jar of peanut butter could last you the entire month .
In short , your monthly breakfast cost could be as little as $ 10 - 15 .
The same bread could be combined with lettuce and sliced ham to make lunch sandwiches .
You could easily save $ 150 or more a month this way .
If you do n’t want to make lunch every day , just cook a little extra dinner each night and pack the leftover for lunch .
6. Minimize Food Waste
This one is obvious .
Everything we buy is almost always too big , and this includes the food that you buy in restaurants .
Most entrees you buy today can feed two people … at least .
Unfortunately , this tends to create bad habits that get carried to the home front .
If you find yourself pitching a bit of food into the garbage each night , it ’s a good time to start adjusting .
7. Use Up Your Pantry and Freezer
Another area of waste , and probably a bigger one , is stockpiling too much food and not be able to use them all before they expire or go bad .
If you find yourself with a stuffed refrigerator or pantry and have to empty them out every once in awhile , reconsider your grocery shopping plan and adjust downward .
Take a close look at your pantry and freezer , then plan your meals around it .
If you are bolder , plan your meals around the stuff that is about to go bad .
Mix and match older food with fresh food to keep your meals palatable .
Your pantry and your pocketbook will thank you .
8. Clip Coupons
Take advantage of discount coupons and membership cards .
Stores offer coupons and discounts to loyal members all the time ; you just have to keep your eyes out for these special deals and take advantage of the savings .
With coupons and discounts , you will have to be a little more flexible with your meal plan , but it ’s well worth it .
For online purchases , check out Rakuten ( you can save money on your purchases and make money by inviting others to join )
9. Membership Cards
Use a member card from your grocery store of choice .
For example :
Target and Lowe ’s offer 5 % discount if you use their credit card
CVS and other stores offer discounts and deals when you use a member card at the checkout .
Many stores offer a club card or membership card .
More Ideas
Eat out less or go to less expensive restaurants .
Drink less alcohol .
Avoid buying sodas and snacks ( aka junk food ) .
Make your own coffee in the morning .
Start an edible garden .
Instead of spending money maintaining flowers and bushes , use that effort toward growing a garden that you can eat , e.g. , lettuce , tomato , and many herbs are some of the easiest edible plants to grown in your yard .

This is an email that has apparently been making the rounds in the general aviation community :
As the days go by I find myself more and more apprehensive about the drift of America toward becoming what , not to mince words , can be described as a “ police state . ”
To the average citizen this drift is not yet all that obvious , as except for the now - familiar hassle of taking a commercial airline flight most people can go about their daily activities without interference .
The average citizen , therefore , reacts to this police state notion with something ranging from a shrug to an outright “ B.S. - what ’s he talking about ? ”
Where the drift is showing up is not yet in the world of the average citizen but on the powerless fringes of society … affecting only those who , in the judgment of the “ authorities , ” lack the political muscle to fight back .
What follows is a perfect example .
A tiny minority of Americans , a minority of which I am a member , are airplane pilots and owners .
We own and operate small propeller - driven aircraft , used primarily for personal recreational travel .
In other words , for fun .
I compare us to RV owner - operators , as these airplanes are equivalent in price range to the RVs and campers so many Americans own and enjoy .
Just like the RVers we airplane operators have historically enjoyed the freedom of travel our machines can provide .
In other words , we have been able to get in our airplanes and go somewhere without seeking permission from some government security agency .
This is all changing .
Utilizing their seemingly unfettered authority to do anything that strikes their fancy without oversight by anyone , Homeland Security has instituted a requirement that private aircraft operators seek government permission each time we propose to take off if we are planning to depart for Canada , Mexico or the Caribbean .
We must provide advance detailed information about where , when , and who , including the names , social security numbers , addresses , etc. , of all persons who will be in the aircraft .
The justification for this , they say , is that we , our spouses , family or friends might be on their mysterious and top secret “ No Fly List . ”
The most significant aspect of this is that Homeland Security has indicated that this is a preliminary step toward their ultimate objective of requiring this data submission prior to EVERY aircraft takeoff in America , regardless of destination .
Keep this in mind as we continue .
It is important to understand that this requirement breaks entirely new ground .
While ENTERING any country requires formalities , never , ever , has it been necessary to seek and receive government permission to LEAVE America , the “ land of the free , ” much less to travel within its borders .
And never , ever , has it been proposed that such permission is somehow necessary to preserve “ national security . ”
This is a requirement only previously seen in Iron Curtain dictatorships .
Another entirely new and very unsettling aspect of this program has just surfaced in the form of several incidents in which citizens who filed the required information and received official permission to depart the USA have been detained as they were preparing to take off and had their personal aircraft , luggage , wallets , purses , etc. , searched by government agents .
In one particularly frightening case ( Long Beach , California ) the airplane was blocked in by multiple vehicles with red lights and sirens and the occupants forced from their plane , hands on their heads , by “ screaming ” agents from several agencies pointing drawn weapons .
In this and all the other incidents , after extensive searches the agents told the citizens it had been just a “ routine ramp check ” and departed , leaving the shaken travelers to repack their belongings .
This activity , totally unrelated to traditional arrival customs checks , also breaks new ground .
On the face of it , it seems to clearly violate the Fourth Amendment of our Constitution , as it is not a match for any of the situations Courts have ruled would make this type of warrantless “ random stop and search ” activity permissible .
Complaints to Homeland Security higher ups about these “ routine checks ” were answered by spokeswoman Kelly Ivahnenko with a statement that said , and I accurately paraphrase , “ we maintain we have this power and authority , you can expect we will continue to do it whenever and wherever we wish , and there is no requirement that we justify ourselves or explain our reasons . ”
This answer itself is , in my opinion , even more frightening than screaming gun-wielding agents .
Having an American bureaucrat maintain that their police organization possesses unlimited discretionary authority should give pause even to the most passive among us , as it is exactly what the Geheime Staatspolizei ( Gestapo ) said when anyone complained .
Overrides of our Constitutional rights by authorities are supposed to be backed by Supreme Court rulings based on clearly articulated justifications , not on the whim of some unelected bureaucrat .
What does this mean to the average citizen ?
Yes , you do n’t own an airplane and , OK , you really do n’t give a [ bleep ] about how airplane owners are treated .
But consider this :
Do you own an RV ?
A car or van ?
All the “ justifications ” being used to restrict , control and harass aviation people would apply equally to anyone who travels in RVs , cars , vans , busses , trains , bicycles or what - have - you .
And if you think that if unchecked it will stop with airplane owners , well , I fear you are sadly mistaken .

Gary Silow , a Philadelphia - area lawyer and Aipac member at the convention , said he was deeply troubled by the potential for renewed discussion of what he said was the offensive “ dual loyalty ” issue .
In Mr. Silow ’s view , “ the fact that they came after Aipac was what was really disturbing . ”
Like many at the convention , Mr. Silow said he was relieved at the move for a dismissal .
More than half the members of the House and Senate attended Monday night ’s dinner , which featured the group ’s “ roll call ” in which the lawmakers all rise .
It is a conscious  and effective  effort to demonstrate the group ’s influence on Capitol Hill .
Even as the charges were dismissed , the issue of Aipac ’s role in the capital ’s political life surfaced again in recent days with the disclosure that Representative Jane Harman , Democrat of California , had been overheard in 2005 on a government wiretap offering to help reduce the charges .
Ms. Harman , who has denied she intervened in the Rosen - Weissman case , was greeted with sustained applause when she appeared on Sunday morning .
The site of the conference , the Washington Convention Center , is conveniently , and symbolically , about equally close to the White House and the Capitol , the two objects of Aipac ’s muscular demonstration .
Along with 6,000 delegates , mostly Jewish , leaders of the two branches of government have been attending the convention to offer praise for Aipac and support of Israel , both in generally unreserved language .
The roster of scheduled guests from Sunday through the meeting ’s conclusion on Tuesday included Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ; Senator John Kerry , the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee ; Newt Gingrich , a former House speaker who remains an important Republican voice ; and Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , who has longstanding ties to Israel .
The group also heard from the new Israeli prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu ( via satellite ) , and the new opposition leader , Tzipi Livni , and the president , Shimon Peres ( in person ) .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor said Monday that her hotly disputed judicial philosophy is , in fact , quite simple : Remain faithful to the law .
Judge Sonia Sotomayor speaks Monday to the Senate panel considering her nomination to the Supreme Court .

" In the past month , many senators have asked me about my judicial philosophy , " Sotomayor told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during her opening statement at her confirmation hearings .
" It is simple : fidelity to the law .
The task of a judge is not to make law , it is to apply the law .
And it is clear , I believe , that my record ... reflects my rigorous commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its terms , interpreting statutes according to their terms and Congress 's intent and hewing faithfully to precedents established by the Supreme Court and by my Circuit Court .
In each case I have heard , I have applied the law to the facts at hand . "
Sotomayor said the " process of judging is enhanced when the arguments and concerns of the parties to the litigation are understood and acknowledged . "
That , she noted , " is why I generally structure my opinions by setting out what the law requires and then explaining why a contrary position , sympathetic or not , is accepted or rejected .
That is how I seek to strengthen both the rule of law and faith in the impartiality of our judicial system . "

Sotomayor argued that her " personal and professional experiences help [ her ] listen and understand , with the law always commanding the result in every case . "
Watch Sotomayor 's remarks to the Senators »
Some of Sotomayor 's critics have argued that she has allowed her rulings to be swayed by factors such as ethnicity and race .
Sotomayor , a federal appellate judge , would be the first Hispanic justice on the Supreme Court if her nomination is approved by the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate .
She would be the 111th person to sit on the nation 's highest court , and the third woman justice .
Watch Sotomayor take the oath »
Sotomayor , her foot in a cast from breaking her ankle a week after President Obama nominated her in May , sat impassively as senators detailed a deep divide between majority Democrats and minority Republicans on whether she is the best choice to fill the vacancy left by Justice David Souter 's retirement .
In an emotional moment in the beginning of her remarks , Sotomayor singled out her mother , who attended the hearing .
" I am here today because of her aspirations and sacrifices , " she said .
" Mom , I love that we are sharing this together . "
Watch Sotomayor credit her mother »
The first Supreme Court confirmation hearing of the Obama presidency began Monday with leading Democrats and Republicans signaling a fierce ideological debate over Sotomayor 's qualifications to sit on the high court .
It attracted a packed gallery and was disrupted three times by protesters shouting anti-abortion sentiments .
Democrats praised Sotomayor 's extensive experience as a judge , which they called the most by any Supreme Court nominee in a century .
They insisted her record showed she has been a modest jurist who consistently applied the rule of law .
" Judge Sotomayor 's journey to this hearing room is a truly American story , " committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , said after gaveling the first session to order .
" Let no one demean this extraordinary woman . "
Leahy also ripped conservative " ideological pressure groups " for " distorting " Sotomayor 's record and opposing a woman who " will be a justice for all Americans . "
He noted she was first nominated to the federal bench by a Republican president , George H.W. Bush .
Watch Leahy praise Sotomayor »
However , Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the committee 's ranking Republican , said Sotomayor represents the kind of activist judge that threatens the traditional foundation of the U.S. legal system .
Sessions , a former attorney general in his home state , challenged the attribute of empathy cited by President Obama in nominating Sotomayor .
" Call it empathy , call it prejudice , call it sympathy -- whatever it is , it is not law , " Sessions said .

In particular , Sessions quoted Sotomayor from past speeches in which she said a wise Latina woman should be able to reach a better ruling than a white man , saying it showed an inherent bias .
" I want to be clear : I will not vote for and no senator should vote for an individual nominated by any president who is not fully committed to fairness and impartiality toward every person who appears before them , " Sessions said .
Watch Sessions call Sotomayor nomination " critical " »
Other Republicans conceded that Sotomayor was likely to win confirmation because Democrats hold a majority in both the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate , but questioned whether her judicial philosophy was for activism or applying the rule of law .
" Unless you have a complete meltdown , you 're going to get confirmed , " Sen .
Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , said .
He described Sotomayor as " someone of good character , " but he questioned her " wise Latina " comment as a possible indication of bias based on gender or race .
Watch Graham tell Sotomayor Republicans are " unnerved " by her speeches »
" If I said anything remotely like that , my career would have been over , " Graham said , adding that " it just bothers me when somebody wearing a robe takes the robe off and says their experience makes them better than someone else . "
Democrats called such concern unjustified , saying Sotomayor 's record showed she was fair in applying the law as written .
Read about some of Sotomayor 's key rulings »
" I 'm not sure how many of this panel can sit here today and seriously suggest that she comes to the bench with a personal agenda , " said Sen.
Charles Schumer of New York , noting her history showed no pattern of favoritism or bias for anyone .
Other Democrats complained that Chief Justice John Roberts , nominated by Republican President George W. Bush in 2005 , has been a conservative activist on the Supreme Court .
Find out how Sotomayor compares to current justices »
Sen . Sheldon Whitehouse , D - Rhode Island , quoted CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin 's statement that " in every major case since he became the nation 's 17th chief justice , Roberts has sided with the prosecution over the defendant , the state over the condemned , the executive branch over the legislative and the corporate defendant over the individual plaintiff . "
" And is it a coincidence that this pattern , to continue Toobin 's quote , has served the interests and reflected the values of the contemporary Republican Party ? "
Whitehouse said .
" Some coincidence . "
Three brief outbursts occurred as different Democratic senators gave opening statements .
In one , an unidentified man shouted : " What about the unborn , senator ?
Abortion is murder .
Stop the genocide of unborn Latinos . "
Another , later in the session , repeatedly shouted : " Abortion is murder . "
While the nation 's newest senator , Al Franken of Minnesota , made his inaugural committee statement , a woman and man shouted " you 're wrong " at his reference to a woman 's reproductive health and rights .
The woman , Norma McCorvey , is better known as " Jane Roe " from the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade .
McCorvey , once a supporter of abortion rights , was the lead plaintiff in the 1973 ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion .
In all three cases , Leahy immediately ordered the protesters removed from the hearing room .

If history is a guide , Sotomayor appears certain to get Senate approval with mostly Democratic support .
When she won Senate confirmation for the federal appellate court in 1998 , there were 29 " no " votes , all cast by Republicans .

The retriever sat alertly as Mr. Montalvan , an Iraq war veteran with severe post - traumatic stress disorder , reached for a vial of pills , lined a half - dozen on the table and took them one by one .
The dog had gotten what he wanted :
When the last pill was swallowed , he got up and followed his master out of the kitchen , tail wagging .

A pair of Salisbury High School students armed with blue and black spray paint decorated the school 's brand new artificial turf field and running track with lewd images , racial slurs and other sexual imagery , police allege .
Brett M. Gladfelter , 19 , and Matthew J. Madochick , 19 , allegedly parked Madochick 's Jeep on a street near the high school stadium late on March 9 , hopped a 6 - foot fence and painted a host of words , pictures and remarks on the $ 800,000 field , according to court papers .
The pair left with the paint cans and showed up for school drunk at 7 a.m.
March 10 , police allege , joyriding through the parking lot in Madochick 's Jeep .
They yelled and honked as they tore through the lot , police said .
More than 30 interviews with students and staff led police to Gladfleter and Madochick .
The teens allegedly gave police inconsistent stories about their whereabouts that night and Gladfelter finally admitted his guilt , police allege .
Total damage to the field and track was less than $ 5,000 , according to court papers .
The teens remain free since all charges against them -- institutional vandalism , criminal mischief and defiant trespass are summary or misdemeanor offenses .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
There were 13 unlucky cities with unemployment rates topping 15 % in April , and another 93 saw joblessness climb above 10 % , according to a government report released Wednesday .
Nine of the baker 's dozen are in California , a state ravaged by the housing meltdown and an unparalleled state budget crisis .
Officials are now scrambling to close a $ 21.3 billion shortfall in order to pass a budget before the new fiscal year begins July 1 .
By comparison , only seven cities reported unemployment rates above 10 % in April 2008 , the Labor Department said in its report .
April 2009 was the fourth consecutive month that unemployment rose in all of the nation 's 372 metropolitan areas compared with the same month in the prior year , the report said .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases monthly metropolitan - area data , lagging behind national unemployment statistics which this month showed the jobless rate was 8.9 % in April .
A new nationwide report for May comes out Friday .
The April report is slightly better than March 's survey , which said that 109 metropolitan areas reached unemployment rates of 10 % or higher , with 18 of those at 15 % or more .
The data is not seasonally adjusted , and that could account for some of the difference , the BLS said .
Jobless in Elkhart : ' collective consciousness '
Elkhart - Goshen , Ind. , posted the biggest year - over - year increase in April -- 12.7 percentage points .
Residents are feeling the crunch of the 17.8 % unemployment rate .
" It 's on the news and in your ears here , " said resident Alan Steele , business adviser at Indiana Small Business Development Center .
" It 's part of the collective consciousness , " he added .
" I truly can't recall the last time I went through a workday without hearing about the job situation here . "
Layoffs and closures in manufacturing have hit the city hard , Steele says .
He said he sees many people interested in starting their own businesses , or ramping up time spent on side projects .
" Losing your job is not the best reason to start a business , which we tell them , " he said .
" But in some cases they 're just trying to take control of the future . "
Other hard - hit cities
El Centro , Calif. , continued to have the highest rate of any metropolitan area at 26.9 % .
The town is located near the Mexican border and relies on agricultural employment , according to economists .
As a result , the area 's jobless rate tends to rise and fall depending on the farming season .
For areas with 1 million or more residents , Detroit was the worst hit , posting a rate of 13.6 % .
Portland , Ore. , showed the largest increase , jumping to 11.6 % from 4.7 % in April 2008 .
The least affected of the big cities was New Orleans , at 5.3 % .
At 3.2 % , Iowa City , Iowa , reported the lowest overall rate in the country .
The number of metropolitan regions that had unemployment rates under 7 % dropped sharply to 117 from 347 in April 2008 .
Only 31 areas reported unemployment rates below 5 % in the current report .
A total of 33 metro areas registered unemployment rates that were at least 6 percentage points higher than a year ago , and another 44 areas ' increases were 5 to 5.9 percentage points .

How did we come upon this goldmine of information ?
Well , let 's just say a close friend of ours has an uncle who works at Nintendo , and he 's ready to spill it all .
SA : So what exactly is your uncle 's role in the Nintendo organization ?
Guy Whose Uncle Works for Nintendo :
My uncle is one of the main guys .
He invented Mario .
He lives in Japan and he knows the president of Nintendo .
The president of Nintendo is named Ryu Nintendo and he invented the first Nintendo , which was a robot that did math .
My uncle works on all the games and makes up how the levels look , and he knows all the cheat codes and can get extra men in any game .
He gets to play all the games before they come out and he gives them all to me when he beats them .
SA : The big question on everyone 's mind : any new additions to A - list Nintendo franchises coming up in the next year ?
GWUWFN : I get all the games early and I 've played the next Mario and the next Zelda .
The next Mario is inside a space station and it has 100 worlds .
There 's a third Mario brother named Dillon because my uncle named him after me .
You fight aliens and you can get an alien suit .
I have the original Super Mario World game from Japan and Mario has a gun in it but they can't release it in America like that because a kid in Japan killed his sister .
I know a cheat code so Mario can have a gun but my uncle said if I told anyone it , he would n't give me games anymore .
In the next Zelda you play as Zelda and there 's a cheat code so you 're totally naked .
SA : Can we have that code ?
GWUWFN : Well , the game is n't out yet so if I told you the code you could n't do anything with it .
Maybe ask again when the game comes out .
Zelda is totally hot and naked and you can make her have sex with a dog .
SA : Big N sometimes catches flak for being " kiddie . "
Does this mean Nintendo is moving into more mature games ?
GWUWFN : Yeah , they are making a Playboys game too .
I 've played it and it's like Mario but your guy goes around and collects Playboys and then every time you get one you can open it and read the Playboy and it shows all the naked ladies and everything .
Pamela Anderson is naked in it .
You put the controller on your pants and if you get a boner you lose the game .
They released it in Japan but they had to take it out of the stores because it was too sexual and it made all these kids have sex at school .
If a girl plays it she has to get naked to win .
It 's called Playboys Castle Quest .
SA : Any plans for new Nintendo hardware coming down the pike , or are they still committed to the Wii ?
GWUWFN : They made a new Nintendo called the Nintendo X and it 's 100 - bit .
Like how the regular Nintendo is 8 - bit and the Super Nintendo is 16 - bit , this one is 100 - bit and the graphics are so good it looks like a movie and you think it 's real .
They released it in Japan and a kid died because his guy died in the game and his body thought it was real and his heart stopped .
It got banned in Japan for being too real .
SA : Any word on the launch title lineup for the Nintendo X ?
GWUWFN : They have a new Street Fighters game and it has all the guys in Mortal Kombat in it , plus you can be Batman , Robocop , Luke and Darth Vader .
And you can send Nintendo a picture of your face and you get to be a character in the game .
I got to play it and I was so good they told me I could be in the tournament in Japan but my mom said no because I have school , but they said I would have won .
They also made a game called Blood Quest and you play a guy with a sword hand , and it has so much blood that a kid saw it and got scared to death and they banned it in Japan .
SA : With your uncle 's industry connections , he must hear things about what the competition is up to .
Any news from Sony or MS ?
GWUWFN : They said the Sega Genesis is 16 - bit but my dad has taken it apart and there are only 12 bits .
It ca n't do as many colors which is why they can't make Mario games on it .
It does n't have 3D processing bits like the Super Nintendo 's special chips for Pilotwings .
Sega sucks .
The Nintendo X is going to kill Sega when they see how real it looks .
My uncle has the Genesis II and it only looks barely as good as the Super Nintendo .
They 're going to release it as soon as kids figure out that the Genesis is only 12 - bit , and then they 'll go like " oh , here 's one that 's really 16 bit " but by then it will be too late and the Nintendo X will come out .
SA : A ny final insider tips from your uncle that you 'd like to spill ?
GWUWFN : Yeah , but do n't tell anyone because my uncle could get fired , but when you start Mortal Kombat right when you hear the sound at the beginning , press left left left left b a b y b a b y b a b y and all the girl characters will be naked .
If you beat one of them there is a special fatality called the sexuality and it makes them have sex .
It works on Killer Instinct too and when the one girl shows her boobs she turns around so you can see and you can do a sexuality on her .

Would tweaking human brains widen the gulf between the world ’s haves and have - nots ?

It will soon be possible to boost human brainpower with electronic “ plug- ins ” or even by genetic enhancement .
What will this mean for the future of humanity ?

The family of a Knowlton Township boy mauled by three dogs in 2004 can move forward with a civil suit , according to a New Jersey Superior Court ruling Tuesday .
A lower court threw out the suit filed by Kodi Dalman 's parents against their landlords .
The dogs ' owner , who was their neighbor at the time of the attack , was not a party to this ruling .
Dalman was 5 in July 2004 when he tripped and fell in the backyard and was pounced on by three mastiffs owned by Anthony Braxton .
All three dogs were later euthanized .
Another dog initially was suspected in the attack , but it was later found that pet was trying to protect the boy .
New Jersey State Police say Dalman , now 9 , suffered multiple bite wounds to his head , chest , back and upper thigh .
He underwent more than eight hours of surgery to repair his wounds the day after the attack .
The suit alleges the Dalmans and Braxton 's landlords , Raymond and the late Eleanor George , knew the dogs were vicious and did nothing about it .

The upheaval after Iran 's election has proved that the Internet has evolved from being the handiest purveyor of smut and knock - off Jimmy Choos to an instrument that can allow people in Louisville to influence events in Tehran .
This two - part series will focus on what you can do .
Read Part 1 to learn how to use Twitter to help ensure Iran has a fair election .
Part 2 , Media pressure and circumventing Iran 's Internet firewall
Media pressure
With an abundance of dead celebrities and philandering governors , the media will need prodding to focus on a story that will matter long after Jacko and Farrah are still dead and governors are still hypocrites .
Contact Louisville 's media outlets and demand they continue to cover the Iran election .
Circumventing Iran 's Internet firewall
According to its
Web site , Tor " is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy , confidential business activities and relationships , and state security known as traffic analysis . "
By allowing your computer to run a Tor relay , you can help ensure Iranians ( and other dissidents worldwide ) have unfiltered Internet access .
One caveat though , I am a tech geek but am having problems configuring my iMac to serve as a Tor relay .
Hopefully it will be easier for you .

Well , that did n't take long .
Last night , we reported that sources inside and outside Google were suggesting that the company would announce a Chrome - centered OS within a matter of days .
It turned out to be a matter of hours .
Late Tuesday night , the Google Blog officially announced that the Google Chrome OS was a reality and would appear on netbooks some time later next year .
The announcement contained a thesis statement that is a bit more significant than it might appear at first : " It 's our attempt to re-think what operating systems should be . "
That statement has both strategic and practical implications , which we 'll consider in turn .
From a strategic perspective , " what operating systems should be " clearly involves a heavy dose of Google - driven Web apps , from e-mail to spreadsheets .
The entire OS will be focused on getting users into a Web browser as quickly as possible ; any other applications will be secondary and probably not provided by Google .
Instead , once the browser launches , users can do their computing via online applications , saving their data in the cloud ( think of all those " gDrive " rumors from the last few years ) .
Google views this as computing nirvana for users , saying , " [ Users ] want their data to be accessible to them wherever they are and not have to worry about losing their computer or forgetting to back up files . "
But there are still a variety of applications that simply can't be replicated within a browser , and consumers have had a mixed reaction to Google 's own apps , embracing Gmail but finding its presentation software to be severely limited compared to its desktop app counterparts .
But the Chrome OS will be appearing first on netbooks , which can't handle some of the more heavyweight desktop applications in the first place .
And the new offering has the potential to drive users to rely on Google 's online offerings , which certainly would further the company 's goals .
Of course , the cloud is only useful if it 's accessible , and staying online is n't always convenient or cheap at this stage .
The new offline storage capabilities in the latest Web standards certainly limit the impact of temporary disconnection and , by controlling the whole software stack , Google has the opportunity to make sure its applications play nicely when the computer happens to be offline .
From a technological perspective , there appear to be some interesting aspects to rethinking the operating system .
For one , by having an extremely narrow focus — bringing up a networking stack and browser as quickly as possible — Chrome OS has the ability to cut down on the hassles related to restarting and hibernating computers .
And , aside from the browser , all of the key applications will reside online , security and other software updates wo n't happen on the computer itself , which should also improve the user experience .
From a security perspective , Google claims that it will be " completely redesigning the underlying security architecture of the OS " in a way that eliminates virus and malware worries .
The sandboxing and process isolation that Google has built into the Chrome browser undoubtedly provide much of that security , so it 's unclear what will have to happen at the OS level ; it 's possible that Google will be looking at ways to extend this level of security to third party apps .
More cryptically , Google also says that the users it views as its target market " do n't want to spend hours configuring their computers to work with every new piece of hardware . "
That problem has plagued all OS makers , and none of them have solved it to the satisfaction of all users .
It 's possible that Google thinks it can do so , but given its general attitude ( everyone should be happy with Web apps ) , it 's equally possible that the company has decided that people simply do n't need much in the way of peripherals .
At the moment , the Linux port of Chrome is still in rough shape ( although it 's improving rapidly ) , so it 's no surprise that the arrival of the OS is still a ways off .
The code itself will be released to the community later this year , and Google says the partners it has lined up wo n't release hardware to consumers until 2010 .
The intervening time may also be necessary for more sites to start adopting tags for embedding video and audio content in a way that ensures that the Chrome OS can handle multimedia .
One part of the announcement that may be causing a few grey hairs in Santa Clara : the Chrome OS will run on both x86 and ARM .
Many manufacturers have been considering ARM in netbooks due to its exceptional power management capabilities , but the lack of a Windows port has undoubtedly held things back .
A netbook - specific Linux with a high - profile corporation like Google backing it may change perceptions and help usher ARM into the space just above handheld hardware , where the architecture already dominates .
Will all of this work ?
Apple spent a couple of years trying to convince developers that they should be happy with Web apps , but it 's clear that the arrival of native applications has been a significant driver of the iPhone 's popularity .
Palm appears to be trying something closer to Google 's vision with the Pre , but Palm is also offering a native SDK , and it 's too early to tell how well its reliance on online services will work out for users .
At this stage , it 's not even clear if the netbook market will have staying power once the economy picks back up .
All of that would tend to suggest a Chrome OS could wind up occupying a niche .
But that may be perfectly fine from Google 's perspective .
At the moment , Chrome also occupies a relatively small niche , but it has helped change perceptions of what a browser should do in terms of sandboxing processes and isolating plugins .
If the Chrome OS can help change consumer perceptions about the utility of online applications and cloud storage , it could be a big success for Google , even without wide adoption .
It ’s strange but I ’ve started to only get surprised when Republicans actually get called out for their bald - faced lies ( via C&L ) :
Last Sunday on Fox News , Ohio Republican John Boehner raised a few eyebrows when he told host Chris Wallace that there has n’t been a single stimulus job started in his state :
In Ohio , the infrastructure dollars that were sent there months ago — there has n’t been a contract let , to my knowledge .
And the fact is — is I do n’t believe it will create jobs .
John Boehner is either a liar or he ’s clueless :
When U.S. House Minority Leader John Boehner told a newscaster Sunday that not a single stimulus - funded road contract in his home state of Ohio had been let , he was wrong .
The Ohio Department of Transportation has OK ’d 52 stimulus - funded
road and bridge projects at a cost of nearly $ 84 million .
Boehner released a statement to “ clarify : ”
Thanks to OE Group , we now have a teaser poster for the upcoming horror film called “ Grimm “ , which is currently in pre-production .
It looks like Bruce Willis is going to play the lead role .
Plot : Marburg , Massachusetts , USA – Teenager Katie O’Sullivan goes to a new babysitting job .
Instead of a regular family , she encounters ghostly twins Henry and Grace and a terrifying apparition that drags her off towards a sinister tower .
She is never seen again .
Soon afterwards , Pat Quinn and his family move to the seemingly idyllic town , where he is the new Police Chief .
His second wife Ella has two daughters from her first marriage and Quinn has a daughter , Megan , and son , John , from his .
On their very first evening John encounters the strange twins , as well as a huge frog , which he brings back to the house .
Quinn makes him take it back to the pond where he found it , but that night a wet , naked young man forces his way into the house and Megan ’s bedroom .
He vanishes before Quinn sees him , leaving behind a slimy trail .
From this moment on , Megan and John notice strange things and people in the town , but when they talk about them , nobody believes them .
Only Professor Kurland , who approaches Quinn to show him pictures of Katie and two other teenagers who went missing at the same time , thinks they ’re telling the truth .
He warns Quinn that bad things happen to youngsters in this town .
One day , Megan and her best friend Ruth go to visit Ruth ’s grandmother .
A wolf - like creature attacks them , having already savaged the grandmother .
Ruth is torn limb from limb and Megan barely escapes with her life .
As mysterious and frightening happenings occur one after the other , Quinn starts to believe there may be sinister forces at work in Marburg , but will he discover who or what is behind it all in time to save his family ?
This information was just culled from the Dallas Voice blog page .
The only reply I see so far on that blog says in part :
I do n’t know what went down once the police got inside , I was lucky that I was leaving at the exact moment that the first agent was walking in the door , but they already had the outside door person up against the wall in cuffs , and the building surrounded with cars .
Arresting people in a bar for Public Intoxication seems strange , and doing it on the 40th anniversary of Stonewall seems like they are trying to spark another Stonewall .
This is the only site I have been able to find any news about this raid .
I will be updating this ; this may be a misunderstanding or a setup .
As I find out more news today I will be updating this dairy .
STATUS 1 :
I am keeping this a draft for now until I get at least 1 confirmation on the story , or until the Dallas Voice moves it from a blog entry to their " breaking " page .
CONFIRMATION :
There is now a Facebook Group * discussing the raid (* I do n't know if non-facebook users can read that link ) .
The summary of the group :
Last night around 1 a.m. , on the anniversary of the Stonewall riots , the Fort Worth Police Department raided the Rainbow Lounge and began randomly handcuffing and arresting patrons and shoving anyone who dared to ask why .
It was a sobering reminder that on this pinnacle date in the history of gay rights , we still have a very long way to go .
I created this group to give folks a chance to discuss it , share stories , pictures , etc .
Pictures of police arresting people at the Lounge are posted there .
There are rumors of a protest being organized for today .
However at this time the location and time are fuzzy ( the facebook page says both the Rainbow Lounge in Fort Worth , and the Crossroads in Oaklawn ( the Crossroads is the middle of the Dallas gay area ) , and times from 3:00 to 5:00 pm today ( CDT ) .
If I hear of a firm location and time I will update here .
This is very frustrating to me .
The idea of raiding a bar to handcuff people for PI is startling , the fact that they hit a gay bar on the 40th Anniversary of Stonewall is chilling .
UPDATE #1 :
Comments posted by a dancer at the bar .
Again , this is from a post on the Dallas Voice blog page .
I am still trying to get stronger confirmation from a verifiable source than blog postings and responses .
I was one of the dance entertainers last night at Rainbow Lounge .
I was dancing on a box in the VIP lounge and was looking right at the first guy that was arrested .
The male patron was standing at the bar doing nothing but having a having a drink and a fun time ( like people do in bars ) when an officer entered that section of the club and made a beeline straight towards him .
The officer forcefully spun the man around , shoved him against the bar and placed plastic restraints on his wrists .
The officer then marched the man out the club .
The guy was stunned and obviously really scared .
I then noticed another officer in the VIP section and several other officers filtering into the club .
I made the decision at that point to go ahead and get dressed in case they were going to start arresting everyone in the entire place .
When I got inside the dressing room there were other dancers already in there getting dressed .
They were panicing and saying that this is not something they have ever had to deal dancing in Dallas .
I got dressed and walked out the door and saw that several more officers had made their way into the club .
I went into sort of a surreal haze at that moment .
I was so disturbed and saddened because it occured to me in that moment that being after midnight , it was actually the exact same day as the Stonewall Riots .
I just could n’t believe what was happening .
I was still standing near the entrance to the VIP lounge with a friend when an officer approached a man standing there .
The man had water in his hand .
The officer asked him how much he had had to drink and the man said that he did n’t have to answer that .
The officer then said that he was going to arrest him for public intoxication .
The man said , " You ca n’t do that I am just standing here right now drinking water . "
At the time the officer shoved the man over towards the wall near the dressing room and then back to the rear wall near the men ’s restroom , then down onto the floor .
Several other officers , made their way back there to hold that ONE MAN down on the ground as they placed restraints on him .
At the time I noticed that all of them did not have FWPD uniforms on .
Some of them were actually State Police .
UPDATE # 2 : From the Facebook group page .
Here are the official protest times and locations :
3 p.m. Meet at the Crossroads to make signs and plan .
5 p.m Meet at Rainbow Lounge for first part of the protest .
7 p.m. Meet at Tarrant County Courthouse , 100 E. Weatherford at the end of Main Street .
Still no independent verification , though more and more people are chiming in on the blog that it it happened , with more pics from their phones .
UPDATE # 3 : I have had a brief IM with a reporter who is at the jail interviewing people who were arrested this morning .
This verifies that the bar was raided , though all the details we have are via first - person account .
From comments below and on facebook , I have gleamed the following .
Note that some of these are contradictory :
It is now legal for police to arrest people in bars for Public Intoxication .
They have been doing that regularly in Fort Worth of late .
There was a detainee transportation vehicle * ( changed from a term someone found offensive ) and " State Police " in the raid , which implies it was a planned raid , not a random stop .
( Note : there are no actual " state police " , so it was probably actually the TABC ) .
A anonymous call complained of a sexual assault at or near the bar which triggered the raid .
Here 's a link to all blogs today at the Dallas Voice Bog page .
All blogs today are concerning the raid , all posted by Tammye Nash with comments by others .
Nash is a reporter for the Dallas Voice .
UPDATE # 4 :
Rec list .
Thanks guys .
It 's a first for me .
UPDATE # 5 :
As noted below , since January the TABC can raid bars looking for " public intoxication " , this is supposedly an effort to prevent drunken driving and public drunkenness .
Info provided by BrowniesAreGood .
Several bars in Irving , TX were raided earlier this year under this statute , and such sweeps have continued throughout Texas .
However , it certainly seems that the anecdotal testimony is of police arresting individuals who were drinking water , or who simply catcalled the police , or who called them " Homophobes " .
Again , the treatment of the patrons ( zip - cuffing them on the ground ) on the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots ) seems completely over the top .
I hope to have some links to the protests taking place in Fort Worth this evening .
UPDATE #6 :
A KOSer reports that I have it all wrong .
The police were lewdly approached by like totally drunk dudes , who they had to forcibly subdue and arrest .
One man is in the hospital with a head injury he sustained from being such a total cop -groping drunk .
Personally I think it 's police covering their ass .
The several eye - witness reports from patrons on the Dallas Voice directly conflict with the police ; I tend to side with them .
Perhaps cameras in the bar will show a clearer picture , I do n't know if the bar had a camera running at the time ( I believe many to have a camera feed for security reasons nowadays ) .
I have tried to be even - handed with this diary .
I withheld publishing until I got corroboration from a reporter , and the eye - witness accounts point to at least individual homophobic acts by the police .
I updated with counter - claims that this is business as usual by TABC .
I did n't push them hard because that 's not my issue .
If you want to push that , I would gladly rec your diary .
I am disappointed by the idea expressed by some that the event should n't be shared in a diary , and that information about the follow - up protest was n't worth sharing .
MINI - UPDATE : I very briefly has some rude comments to another KOSer here .
They were inappropriate and I have cut them from this diary .
A Home Network Solution
In today ’s world , it is almost becoming a requirement to have a networked home .
More and more appliances , televisions , gaming consoles , cable and satellite boxes , and even thermostats are requiring access to your home network .
And while many of these items can currently use your wireless network , not all can .
So what ’s a home owner to do for the items that need a faster and more reliable Ethernet connection but do n’t have the home wired for it ?
My suggestion , buy a D - Link PowerLine HD Network Starter Kit .
According to D - Link ’s website :
The D - Link® PowerLine HD Ethernet Adapter ( DHP - 302 ) and Starter Kit ( DHP - 303 ) take advantage of your home ’s existing electrical wiring to create or extend a network .
Turn every power outlet into a possible network connection to connect computers , digital media players , and game consoles throughout your home .
This sounds like a great and affordable ( $ 139 ) solution for any home .
No doubt that this is much cheaper than trying to run CAT5 cable all throughout your house .
And if you are worried about speed , the website lists the speed at up to 200 M bps which is much faster than any cable or DSL service I know of .
So if you ’re in need of a home network solution , save yourself the hassle and the expense of wiring your own home and instead check out D - Link ’s Powerline HD Network Starter kit .

Before I made this cake on Sunday afternoon , I sat down with a nice , tall root beer float .
Sure , it was 10:30 in the morning .
I suppose that technically that means I had a root beer float for breakfast .
That ’s one of the great thing about being an adult , you can have a float for breakfast with no resistance .
Something about a root beet float puts me on a conveyor belt back to some really random childhood memories .
The taste , the bubbles , the increasingly creamy soda … it take me back to constantly skinned knees , playing in a beat - up old red wagon with my sister , and sitting in front of an old black and white television watching baseball with my grandfather .
Funny what a little ice cream and soda can do in your brain , right ?
But cake !?
Root Beet Float Cake ?
I have so many questions .
Will it have the same memory inducing effects as the real deal ?
Is that asking too much ?
Wait , is this cake chocolate or root beer ?
Can I eat it for breakfast ?
Will it change my life for the better ?
Answers and cake , just a click away .
Here ’s what you should know about the Root Beer Float Cake .
It ’s a wonderfully moist , super chocolate Bundt Cake .
It ’s the kind of cake that ’s great to take to a outdoor summer party because it has the “ hmmm ” factor .
People will wonder what ’s in it besides the chocolate .
The cake does n’t have the same memory inducing effects as a real root beer float .
I blame that on all the chocolate .
The root beer flavor does intensify in the cake the next day .
I suggest making the cake a day ahead , wrapping it well , then frosting it and serving the next day .
And yes … cake for breakfast is always encouraged around these parts .
Cake for breakfast usually makes my life better .
Try this cake .
Maybe for Memorial Day .
Maybe put it on your summer baking list .
I ’d love to hear what you think !

Remember that you get what you pay for .
Generally , more expensive headphones are made with higher quality materials and better engineering , improving the sound quality .
$ 30 headphones will sound good , but not as good as $ 60 ones .
Up in the $ 80 - 90 range , you may hear stuff in your music that you 've never heard before .
$ 9.99 bargain bin earbuds or headphones may last , at longest , a year , and will not sound great to begin with .
So spending at least $ 20 on them ensures you at least get basic music quality .
One guideline is to spend $ 50 on portable headphones and $ 250 on a pair for a home stereo .
Another thing you get with quality is durability .
There are probably people out there with headphones from the 70's and 80's that still work because they 're made well , and made to last .
When you get a brand name you are n't just paying for the name sometimes ; you 're paying for the trusted quality .
One of London Mayor Boris Johnson 's deputies resigned today over his misuse of a corporate credit card .
Ian Clement , deputy mayor for government and external relations , was reprimanded earlier this month for using the card to buy personal items in a breach of Greater London Authority ( GLA ) regulations .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
An initial investigation found that Mr Clement , the former leader of Bexley Council in south east London , had repaid the money at the earliest opportunity and had made no personal gain .
But further " discrepancies " were later discovered in the use of his corporate credit card and he stood down from the GLA today , City Hall said .
Mr Johnson wrote in a letter to his former deputy : " I was extremely angry at the liberties you took with your corporate credit card , but last week I made the essential distinction between behaviour that is crass and anything that amounts to dishonesty or deception .
" In the light of the further discrepancies in your expenses that have emerged this morning , it is clear to both of us that your position is untenable . "
Mr Johnson initially stood by Mr Clement following press revelations last week that he spent £ 2,300 on personal expenditure using a City Hall credit card .
The deputy mayor 's card was confiscated after he allegedly used it to upgrade himself and a colleague to business class on a flight to the Beijing Olympics , to pay for meals including a £ 700 dinner in New York and to buy more than £ 200 worth of groceries and a £ 535.49 audio system for his Jaguar , which he then repaid .
Mr Clement offered his resignation shortly after a conversation with Mr Johnson this morning in which it was made clear that he could not stay in the £ 127,000 - a - year post .

In a letter , he told the Mayor : " It has been a pleasure to work for you and I am sorry that I have let you down and deflected away from the excellent work you and indeed your team are doing in delivering for Londoners . "
The Mayor 's Office would not give details of the fresh allegations today .
But it is thought that a Greater London Authority investigation into Mr Clement 's use of the credit card raised questions over occasions when it had been used on purportedly official business , such as lunches with MPs and councillors .
Mr Clement is the third deputy mayor to leave Mr Johnson 's administration since his election in May last year , following youth leader Ray Lewis and transport chief Tim Parker .
City Hall said the post would be filled in due course .
Various activists maintain a presence of peaceful resistance at this year 's elitist retreat at the Bohemian Grove .
NorCalTruth.org
July 11th and 12th
10 am - 5 pm
Bohemian Grove Entrance
(... aka " Scumbag Gathering " ) Call to Action from IndyBay.org
Original Call to Action from
" This years elite retreat at Bohemian Grove is fast approaching .
Many of the Grove ’s guests will be flying into Santa Rosa Airport on the 10th of July , a Friday .
They will travel West towards a small town called Monte Rio via highway 116 , or River Road to discuss events and policy in private .
In the spirit of past rallies and protests organized by the Bohemian Grove Action Network , 9/11 Truth and anti-globalization activists will maintain a presence at the Grove .
This is the first weekend of the retreat and they will be performing their Cremation of Care ceremony .
I must mention that while the elite are here meeting privately , our focus is what the elite do outside the Grove .
Anyone who is interested in joining is welcome .
The issue at hand is corporate control of us individually and as a Government .
Stand with us against policy makers that come to the Grove to escape and meet in private .
Yearly guests to the Grove include : David Rockefeller Sr. and Jr. , Henry Kissinger , George H.W. Bush , Paul Pelosi , Colin Powell , Walter Cronkite , Kenneth Starr , James Woolsey , Donald Rumsfeld , Riley Bechtel of Bechtel Corp. , and so many more .
As you can see the people coming to Sonoma County are from the corporate , banking , military , intelligence , and media complexes . "
The Press Democrat was kind enough to cover not only the gathering this weekend , but also give a quick shout out to our current protest , as well as the long history of protests maintained by the Mary Moore and the Grove Action Network over the years .
That article can be viewed here .
Thanks to everyone who came out and supported the first of two planned protests at the Bohemian
Grove , 2009 .
A couple of people from the Bohemian Grove Action Network came out for the first time in quite a few years to re-activate with us .
Nor Cal Truth was joined by activist ’s from Marin , Vallejo ,
and San Francisco .
The police were hardly problematic or overly aggressive , thanks due to a healthy group of peaceful activists .
Security was tight as always , and a “ few extra highway patrol were on duty due to an early attempt of a break in ” said a worker who declined to give his name .
A highway patrolman came to say thanks at one point , though he declined to arrest any of the war criminal ’s inside .
Even more gratifying was the sheriff who came to say “ do n’t let anyone give you a hard time , if anyone ( guest ’s ) walking or driving through gives you any trouble come let me know , and I will take care of it for you .
Because you guys do n’t need to deal with that … ”

torture
These guys are undecided on their support .

Conventional vaccines packed with inert versions of a flu strain give your immune system the chance to develop antibodies .
These identify that strain 's particular version of hemagglutinin , a lollipop - shaped protein on its surface , so your body knows what to kill if infected .
Every strain 's hemagglutinin has a slightly different head , so Robert Liddington , a biologist at the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in California , went after its stalk .
" The lollipop head changes quite easily from generation to generation , but the stalk remains stable , " he says .
" It 's the flu's Achilles ' heel . "
His team found a rare antibody that targets it , injected it into mice , and exposed them to 10 times the lethal dose of several seasonal flu strains , the H5N1 bird flu and the pandemic - causing 1918 Spanish flu .
The drug staved off serious infection in each case , even if administered 72 hours after the initial exposure .
Well , it 's been 6 months and 1 liver transplant since Steve Jobs initially took a voluntary 6 months leave of absence from Apple , and now Apple is confirming that Jobs officially returned to work today .
According to Apple spokesman Steve Dowling , Jobs ' transition back to Apple will see him slowly ease back into a full work schedule .
For the time being , Downling noted that Jobs will work a few days at Apple HQ in Cupertino while working a few days from home as well .
The return of Steve Jobs should be more than welcome news for investors who have been critical of the way Apple has handled disclosures pertaining to Jobs ' health .
More recently , investors have lambasted Apple for waiting a few months to disclose the fact that Jobs received a liver transplant .
Interestingly , famed investor Warren Buffet even added his 2 cents to the discussion , and chided Apple for hiding what he termed were " material facts " regarding Steve Jobs and his future at Apple .
There has also been a lot of speculation regarding just how involved Jobs will be at Apple once he returns , and while it might be too soon to make any predictions , Jobs ' surgeon issued a press release last week noting that Jobs ' prognosis was " excellent . "
With that being the case , we can only hope that Jobs will make a full recovery and soon be back at the helm of Apple 100 % .

Once upon a time , scientists routinely found life in places where it was n’t supposed to exist .
That does n’t happen anymore , and not because the pace of discovery has slowed .
If anything , it ’s accelerated .
It ’s simply become clear that life can exist almost anywhere on Earth .
After 3 billion years of evolution , life has flowed into every last nook and cranny , from the bottom of the sea to the upper edge of the stratosphere .
From blazing heat and freezing cold to pure acidity and atomic bomb - caliber radiation , there ’s seemingly no stress so great that some bug ca n’t handle it .
This gallery highlights a few particularly tough species of bacteria and archaea , a lesser - appreciated but equally - vast branch of the organismal tree .
Until the late 1970s , archaea was lumped in with bacteria , a confusion that speaks to the embryonic state of human microbial knowledge .
Less than 1 percent of Earth ’s microorganisms have been identified , and most of those wo n’t even grow in a lab .
In some cases , the bugs are labeled as being uniquely durable , but the labels almost certainly wo n’t stick .
Hardly a month passes without some newly characterized species setting a new microbial benchmark .
Indeed , the very concept of species might not apply .
Bacteria and archaea exchange genes “ horizontally , ” without the need for reproduction .
It ’s as if , while encountering someone on the street , you could trade for whatever genes came in handy at the time .
This fungibility makes a mockery of old - fashioned , animal - based notions of species , and some microbiologists want to abandon the concept altogether .
Speaking of the common gut bacteria Escherichia coli , biology pioneer Lynn Margulis once said , “ If you put a particular plasmid into E. coli , all of a sudden you have Klebsiella and not E. coli .
You ’ve changed not only the species , but the genus .
It ’s like changing a person to a chimpanzee .
Can you imagine doing that , putting a chimpanzee in the refrigerator , and getting him out the next morning , and now he ’s a person ? ”
It ’s pretty hard to imagine , and the idea of microbes as an Earth - spanning ur - organism might take some getting used to .
In the meantime , here are some examples of life ’s awesome adaptability .

Update , 11:30 am ET :
The post originally mischaracterized archaea as being far less complicated than bacteria , and bacteria as possessing a cell nucleus — neither of which is true .
They differ from each other profoundly , but not in ways that lend themselves to such hierarchical judgments .
One thing bacteria and archaea have in common , however , is the lack of a nucleus or other membrane - bound cellular substructures .
Only eukaryotic cells , which compose the bodies of plants , animals and fungi , have such structures .
Herminiimonas glaciei , recovered from ice found two miles beneath a Greenland glacier is one of the smallest microbes ever found .
With extra-long , tail - like flagella , it ’s perfectly suited to moving through tiny veins in the ice .
Described in a paper published last week in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology , H. glaciei was resuscitated by University of Pennsylvania researchers after an estimated 120,000 years of dormancy .
Last June , the same research team described another glacier - recovered , lab - revived microbe , Chryseobacterium greenlandensis .
They think it could be a couple of million years old .

Pyrodictium abyssi , discovered in 1979 on the nutrient - rich edges of deep - sea volcanic vents , are the original extremophile all - star .
In addition to atmospheric pressure that could pancake a submarine , they can withstand temperatures well above the boiling point of water .
The flat , irregular disk - shaped P. abyssi accumulates in networks of hollow , tube - shaped structures called cannulae that are structurally resistant to heat .

Deinococcus peraridilitoris is the lesser - known cousin of Deinococcus radiodurans , dubbed the toughest bacterium on Earth by the Guinness Book of World Records .
Found in 2003 in soil from the Atacama desert , a region of Chile so dry and desolate that NASA uses it for Mars simulations , it can withstand cold , vacuum , drought and radiation .
Key to its survival are multiple copies of its genome ; when one is damaged , the necessary sections can be copied from the other .

Haloquadratum walsbyi was found in a salt flat near the Red Sea , an environment so saline that , as phrased in the Snail ’s Tale blog , “ you and I and just about every other organism on Earth would shrivel up into a lifeless bag of desiccated stuff . ”
In response , the square and ultra - flat archaeon has the highest surface - to - volume ratio of any creature on Earth .
You ca n’t get much more shriveled than that .

Halobacterium NRC - 1 is the most radiation - resistant organism on Earth , capable of withstanding some 18,000 grays of radiation .
( Just 10 grays are required to kill a human . )
That nearly doubles the mark set by D. radiodurans , which was originally discovered in the 1950 ’s as the sole survivor of irradiated meat .
Like D. radiodurans and D. peraridilitoris , it ’s especially good at repairing its own DNA .

Ferroplasma acidophilum can grow in a pH of zero — conditions that make sulfuric acid look like mineral water .
Found in the toxic outflow of a California gold mine , it uses iron as the central structural element of nearly all its proteins .

Desulforudis audaxviator is perhaps the one truly singular microbe .
Every other known organism exists in a system in which at least some nutrients are provided by other creatures .
But not D. audaxviator , which was discovered in a South African mine shaft , two miles beneath Earth ’s surface and entirely alone .
Using radioactivity from uranium - containing rocks as energy , it can harvest or metabolize every nutrient it needs from surrounding rock and gas — the world ’s only known single - species ecosystem .

While driving back to my office from a meeting , I saw the following sign posted on the back of a Staples delivery truck .
On the back of the truck , there is a small box that states , “ Top speed set at 60 .
It saves fuel & reduces emissions . ”
I want to commend Staples not only for putting measures in place that will help the environment , but for being transparent in communicating their efforts to the general public .
By doing so , they are both helping their business and raising awareness in general of the importance of being green .
So , thank you Staples !
Party planners know that scrunching a bunch of people into a small space will result in plenty of mingling and discourse .
A new study suggests this was as true for our ancestors as it is for us today , and that ancient social networking led to a renaissance of new ideas that helped make us human .
The research , which is published in the June 5 issue of the journal Science , suggests that tens of thousands of years ago , as human population density increased so did the transmission of ideas and skills .
The result : the emergence of more and more clever innovations .
" Our paper proposes a new model for why modern human behavior started at different times in different regions of the world , why it disappeared in some places before coming back , and why in all cases it occurred more than 100,000 years after modern humans first appeared , " said study researcher Adam Powell of the Arts and Humanities Research Council Centre for the Evolution of Cultural Diversity at University College London .
The idea that demography is linked to modern human behavior has been around for decades , but this is the first time scientists have run computer models and actually tested out different hypotheses , said Richard Potts , an anthropologist and director of the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C .
Potts , who was not involved in the current study , applauded the team for not relying solely on computer models but also including genetic and archaeological data to make their argument .
Modern humans
Scientists have known that anatomically modern humans , or Home sapiens , ( characterized by big brains and other features we sport today ) , were around at least 160,000 to 200,000 years ago .
Some thought boosts in brain power or advances in language led to modern human behavior , which includes the crafting of abstract and realistic art , body decoration , musical instruments and hunting and trapping technologies .
But our big brains did n't seem to bear any cultural fruit until much later .
In fact , archaeological evidence of art and technology beyond basic stone tools does n't appear until about 90,000 years ago in sub-Saharan Africa .
There , remnants of modern human behavior disappeared around 65,000 years ago and then re-emerged about 40,000 years ago .
" In Europe and western Asia this advanced technology and behavior explodes around 45,000 years ago when humans arrive there , but does n't appear in eastern and southern Asia and Australia until much later , despite a human presence , " said study team member Stephen Shennan of the University College London 's Institute of Archaeology .
Sharing ideas
The researchers ran computer simulations of different population densities , grouping humans into subpopulations that migrated .
The model revealed that at a certain subpopulation density there was an accumulation of ideas and skills .
To figure out whether this phenomenon of skill - sharing was real , the team used genetic data to estimate population sizes in different regions at different times .
Sure enough , when the critical population density was reached or there was a certain degree of migration between subgroups there was also archaeological evidence of modern human behavior .
" As population density increases , people migrate between groups more , " Thomas said during a telephone interview .
" That increases the probability that any skill that 's difficult to learn does n’t get lost or decay . "
For instance , population density was similar in sub-Saharan Africa , Europe and the Middle East when modern behavior first appeared in these regions .
Results also showed that population density would have dropped due to climate changes at the time when modern human behavior temporarily disappeared in sub-Saharan Africa .
" The basic idea conceptually is you can have individuals who are really great at inventing ideas and concepts and ways of approaching the world , but you need a certain population density to be able to have that stuff catch hold and spread , " Potts told LiveScience .
He added , " You could imagine that there may have been very innovative individuals on occasion , but with very small population sizes and mobile foragers who did n’t run into other groups very often , those innovations were probably very short - lived and almost invisible in the archaeological record . "
The research was supported by the AHRC Centre for the Evolution of Cultural Diversity and the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin .
Sorry about the stupid comic , my main work computer got completely FUBARed trying to install the newest OS X update and I spent most of the night trying to salvage it to no avail .
Thank god for multiple backups .
Anyway now I gotta take it to get fixed .
Here 's hoping it 's nothing too major .
Thanks to Rene for the inspiration .
Oh by the way we are selling PRINTS in the QC store now !
Just one design right now but many more are on the way .

On 4 Dec. ' 08 , security forces evacuated the settlement in the a -Ras neighborhood ( “ the House in Dispute ” ) in Hebron .
The same day , Kiryat Arba resident Ze 'ev Braude shot and wounded three members of the al - Matariyeh family .
The shooting , which took place in the Wadi Hussein section of Hebron , was filmed by Jamal Abu Sa'ifan with a camera he received in the framework of B'Tselem 's camera distribution project .
During the incident , another settler fired into the air and at Abu Sa'ifan and tried to grab the camera from him .
A third settler fired into the air and at the family 's house .
The footage of the attack .
Filmed by Jamal Abu Sa'ifan , 4 December 2008 / >
B'Tselem gave the video tape documenting the incident to the police the same day .
Two days later , two of the suspects turned themselves in to the police and were subsequently released .
One of them , Ze 'ev Braude , was indicted on two counts of causing harm with aggravated intent .
The investigation material included evidence as to which the Minister of Defense signed a certificate of privilege , and the evidence was not provided to the defense .
Braude 's attorney filed an action in the Supreme Court , demanding that the privilege be removed and that he be provided the material .
Justice Elyakim Rubinstein held that disclosure of the material is indeed liable to harm state security , but that the defendant 's right to due process prevails in this case over the public - security interest .
Justice Rubinstein pointed out that , “ clearly , a skilled defense attorney could use the material for the benefit of his client , although , in fairness to the Respondent , it should be mentioned that , defense counsel 's effort would not necessarily succeed . ”
The justice also stated that , “ at face value , it appears that the privileged material would not completely undermine the Respondent 's position .
. .
But I am of the opinion that , in certain circumstances , it could - and , again , it might be otherwise - change the decision in the file by raising a doubt ; and it is not possible to conduct a fair trial where there is material that the defense does not have to opportunity to use it for its needs . ”/>/>
The next day , the State Attorney 's Office announced that it intended to withdraw the indictment against Braude , given that “ the price paid by the public in revealing the material prevails over the public interest ” in conducting the trial .
Withdrawal of the indictment will enable a violent and dangerous person , who was documented committing an offense , to avoid punishment and continue to endanger human lives .
If the state refuses to disclose the evidence , it must find other ways to bring Braude to justice .
Withdrawal of the indictment is not a legitimate option .
Justice Rubinstein 's commitment to the defendant 's rights is welcome .
However , the decision is unique , and the State Attorney 's Office may indeed not have expected it would be required to disclose the evidence .
Routinely , privileged material is submitted to the court in criminal proceedings against Palestinian defendants , and requests by their attorneys to disclose it are regularly denied .
In balancing between security considerations and the right to due process , the balance always falls in favor of the former .
Privileged evidence also forms the basis of a long line of administrative decisions affecting other rights of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories .
In May 2009 , 449 Palestinians were being administratively detained in Israeli jails .
Administrative detention is based on an order issued by the OC Central Command , and the detainees are not informed of the accusations or evidence against them .
At no stage are they given the opportunity to refute the evidence , not even upon appeal to the Supreme Court .
Privileged evidence also forms the basis of decisions affecting the daily lives of Palestinians , such as rejection of an application to leave the region to study abroad , prohibition of a Jordanian woman to live with her Palestinian husband in the West Bank , or prevention of a detainee from meeting with his attorney for a prolonged period of time .
When victims of such decisions petition the Supreme Court , they are not provided the evidence that formed the basis of the decision , and in the vast majority of cases , the petitions are denied after the justices examine the evidence in camera .
When read outside this context , Justice Rubinstein 's decision is a wonderful example of respect for defendant 's rights .
It is to be hoped that this decision marks a change in treatment of privileged material as a basis for denying human rights .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday 13 July 2009
Interview extracts referred to one of Leonard Cohen 's songs as Dancing to the End of Love .
That should be Dance Me to the End of Love .
What have you learned from being back on stage ?
Leonard Cohen : I learned that it 's hard to teach an old dog new tricks .
I 've been grateful that it 's going well .
You can't ever guarantee that it 's going to continue doing well , because there 's a component that you really do n't command .
What component is that ?
LC : Some sort of grace , some sort of luck .
It 's hard to put your finger on it - you do n't really want to put your finger on it .
But there is that mysterious component that makes for a memorable evening .
You never really know whether you 're going to be able to be the person you want to be or that the audience is going to be hospitable to the person that they perceive .
So there 's so many unknowns and so many mysteries connected - even when you 've brought the show to a certain degree of excellence .
In 2001 , you said to the Observer that you were at a stage of your life you refer to as the third act .
You quoted Tennessee Williams saying : " Life is a fairly well - written play except for the third act . "
You were 67 when you said that , you 're 74 now - does that ring more or less true for you still ?
LC : Well , it 's well written , the beginning of the third act seems to be very well written .
But the end of the third act , of course , is when the hero dies .
My friend Irving Layton said about death : it 's not death that he 's worried about , it 's the preliminaries .
Are you worried about the preliminaries ?
LC : Sure , every person ought to be .
Let me come back to the beginning of the first act .
This was a brand new career for you that started in your 30s .
How fearful were you of starting a second career ?
LC : I 've been generally fearful about everything , so this just fits in with the general sense of anxiety that I always experienced in my early life .
When you say I had a career as a writer or a poet , that hardly begins to describe the modesty of the enterprise in Canada at that time - an edition of 200 was considered a bestseller in poems .
At a certain point I realised that I 'm going to have to buckle down and make a living .
I 'd written a couple of novels , and they 'd been well received , but they 'd sold about 3,000 copies .
So I really had to do something , and the other thing I knew how to do was play guitar .
So I was on my way down to Nashville - I thought maybe I could get a job .
I love country music , maybe I 'd get a job playing guitar .
When I hit New York , I bumped into what later was called the folk - song renaissance .
There were people like Dylan and Judy Collins and Joan Baez .
And I had n't heard their work .
So that touched me very much .
I 'd always been writing little songs myself , too , but I never thought there was any marketplace for them .
Some people would think it 's ironic to go into music to make money , given that it 's not necessarily the most lucrative of professions for most artists .
LC : Yeah , I know .
In hindsight it seems to be the height of folly .
You had to resolve your economic crisis by becoming a folk singer .
And I had not much of a voice .
I did n't play that great guitar either .
I do n't know how these things happen in life - luck has so much to do with success and failure .
People talk about the fact that you 've written songs that you 've almost grown into as you get older .
How did starting a career in your 30s inform what you were writing ?
LC : I always had a notion that I had a tiny garden to cultivate .
I never thought I was really one of the big guys .
And so the work that was in front of me was just to cultivate this tiny corner of the field that I thought I knew something about , which was something to do with self - investigation without self - indulgence .
Just pure confession I never felt was really interesting .
But confession filtered through a tradition of skill and hard work is interesting to me .
So that was my tiny corner , and I just started writing about the things that I thought I knew about or wanted to find out about .
That was how it began .
I wanted the songs to sound like everybody else 's songs .
You say you 've always been fearful of everything .
When did you give yourself permission to think of yourself as , and call yourself , a legitimate singer and musician ?
LC : You cycle through these feelings of anxiety and confidence .
If something goes well in one 's life , one feels the benefits of the success .
When something does n't go well , one feels remorse .
So those activities persist in one 's life right to this moment .
Have the women in your life been a source of your strength or weakness ?
LC : Good question .
It 's not a level playing ground for either of us , for either the man or the woman .
This is the most challenging activity that humans get into , which is love .
You know , where we have the sense that we can't live without love .
That life has very little meaning without love .
So we 're invited into this arena which is a very dangerous arena , where the possibilities of humiliation and failure are ample .
So there 's no fixed lesson that one can learn , because the heart is always opening and closing , it 's always softening and hardening .
We 're always experiencing joy or sadness .
But there are lots of people who 've closed down .
And there are times in one 's life when one has to close down just to regroup .
Are there times when you 've lamented the power that women have had over you ?
LC : I never looked at it that way .
There 's times when I 've lamented , there 's times when I 've rejoiced , there 's times when I 've been deeply indifferent .
You run through the whole gamut of experience .
And most people have a woman in their heart , most men have a woman in their heart and most women have a man in their heart .
There are people that do n't .
But most of us cherish some sort of dream of surrender .
But these are dreams and sometimes they 're defeated and sometimes they 're manifested .
Do you think love is empowering ?
LC : It 's a ferocious activity , where you experience defeat and you experience acceptance and you experience exultation .
And the affixed idea about it will definitely cause you a great deal of suffering .
If you have the feeling that it 's going to be an easy ride , you 're going to be disappointed .
If you have a feeling that it 's going to be hell all the way , you may be surprised .
Do you regret not having a lifelong partner ?
LC : Non , je ne regrette rien .
I 'm blessed with a certain amount of amnesia and I really do n't remember what went down .
I do n't review my life that way .
Even in the face of a very successful record that you made in 1992 , The Future , do you think dealing with depression was an important part of your creative process ?
LC : Well , it was a part of every process .
The central activity of my days and nights was dealing with a prevailing sense of anxiety , anguish , distress .
A background of anguish that prevailed .
How important was writing to your survival ?
LC : It had a number of benefits .
One was economic .
It was not a luxury for me to write - it was a necessity .
These times are very difficult to write in because the slogans are really jamming the airwaves - it 's something that goes beyond what has been called political correctness .
It 's a kind of tyranny of posture .
Those ideas are swarming through the air like locusts .
And it 's difficult for the writer to determine what he really thinks about things .
So in my own case I have to write the verse , and then see if it 's a slogan or not and then toss it .
But I can't toss it until I 've worked on it and seen what it really is .
What do you consider your darkest hour ?
LC : Well I would n't tell you about it if I knew .
Even to talk about oneself in a time like this is a kind of unwholesome luxury .
I do n't think I 've had a darkest hour compared to the dark hours that so many people are involved in right now .
Large numbers of people are dodging bombs , having their nails pulled out in dungeons , facing starvation , disease .
I mean large numbers of people .
So I think that we 've really got to be circumspect about how seriously we take our own anxieties today .
How much do you reflect upon your own mortality ?
LC : You get a sense of it , you know - the body sends a number of messages to you as you get older .
So I do n't know if it 's a matter of reflection , I do n't know that implies a kind of peaceful recognition of the situation .
Is there a way to prepare for death ?
LC : Like with anything else , there 's a certain degree of free will .
You put in your best efforts to prepare for anything .
There are whole religious and spiritual methodologies that invite you to prepare for death .
And you can embark upon them and embrace them and give themselves to you .
But I do n't think there 's any guarantee this could work , because nobody knows what 's going to happen in the next moment .
Are you fearful of death ?
LC : Everyone has to have a certain amount of anxiety about the conditions of one 's death .
The actual circumstances , the pain involved , the affect on your heirs .
But there 's so little that you can do about it .
It 's best to relegate those concerns to the appropriate compartments of the mind and not let them inform all your activities .
We 've got to live our lives as if they 're not going to end immediately .
So we have to live under those - some people might call them illusions .
Let me ask you about Hallelujah , because it 's been an interesting year for Hallelujah - it took on a new energy .
A song that you wrote in 1984 , and it appeared at No 1 and No 2 on the UK charts , and your version was also in the top 40 .
What did you make of that ?
LC : I was happy that the song was being used , of course .
There were certain ironic and amusing sidebars , because the record that it came from which was called Various Positions - [ a ] record Sony would n't put out .
They did n't think it was good enough .
It had songs like Dancing to the End of Love , Hallelujah , If It Be Your Will .
So there was a mild sense of revenge that arose in my heart .
But I was just reading a review of a movie called Watchmen that uses it , and the reviewer said " Can we please have a moratorium on Hallelujah in movies and television shows ? "
And I kind of feel the same way .
I think it 's a good song , but I think too many people sing it .

Graffiti is a type of deliberately inscribed marking made by humans on surfaces , both private and public and is often prevalent in low - income neighborhoods .
It can take the form of art , drawings or words .
When done without a property owner 's consent it often constitutes vandalism .
Graffiti has existed at least since the days of ancient civilizations such as classical Greece and the Roman Empire .
The word " graffiti " expresses the plural of " graffito " , although the singular form has become relatively obscure and is largely used in art history to refer to works of art made by scratching the design on a surface .
Another related term is sgraffito , a way of creating a design by scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another one beneath .
All of these English words come from the Italian language , most likely descending from " graffiato " , the past participle of " graffiare " ( to scratch ) ; ancient graffitists scratched their work into walls before the advent of spray - paint , as in murals or frescoes .
These words derive in their turn from the Greek γ ραφ ειν ( graphein ) , meaning " to write " .
Historians continue to speculate over the vexing question as to where the term " graffiti " first referred to this form of marking .
Now let 's see some art .
