Somehow , Joe Ades got people ’s attention as the crowds swirled by at the Union Square Greenmarket , on their way to eyeing and buying the produce .
He was the white - haired man with the British accent , the expensive European suits and shirts  the man selling the $ 5 peeler .
For carrots .
Or potatoes .
“ He talked constantly , ” said Clover Vail , an artist .
“ He was very excited about carrots , ” said Sara Mason , a merchandise assistant at Barnes & Noble .
“ He made it look really fun , ” said Julie Worden , who dances with the Mark Morris Dance Company .
“ The voice  you could n’t help but notice it , ” said Gordon Crandall , a mathematician who teaches at La Guardia Community College .
His was a particular kind of street theater in a city that delights in in - your - face characters who are , and are not , what they seem .
For he was the sidewalk pitchman with the Upper East Side apartment .
The sidewalk pitchman who was a regular at expensive East Side restaurants , where no one believed his answer to the “ So what do you do ? ” question : “ I sell potato peelers on the street . ” Mr. Ades ( pronounced AH - dess ) died on Sunday at 75 , said his daughter , Ruth Ades Laurent of Manhattan .
She said he never talked about how many peelers he sold in a year , or how many carrots he had sliced up during demonstrations .
She said he stashed his inventory in what had been the maid ’s room of the apartment .

For up - to - date information , please visit the new OCaml website at ocaml.org .
The most recent version of OCaml is 4.07.0 .
It was released on 2018 - 07 - 10 .
Some of the highlights in release 4.07 are :
The way the standard library modules are organized internally has changed : the List module ( for example ) is now named Stdlib__list ; a new Stdlib module contains a series of aliases such as module List = Stdlib__list ; the Stdlib module is implicitly opened when type - checking OCaml programs ( as Pervasives previously was ) , so that Stdlib .
List can be accessed as just List , as before .
The purpose of this reorganization is to facilitate the addition of new standard library modules while minimize risks of conflicts with user modules of the same name .
Modules Float ( floating - point operations ) and Seq ( sequences ) were added to the standard library , taking advantage of the new organization mentioned above .
The error messages caused by various typing errors have been improved to be easier to understand , in particular for beginners .
Effort has been made to reduce the compilation time of flambda programs , and the size of the generated .cmx files when using the - Oclassic optimisation level .
The HTML manual has benefited from various style improvements and should look visually nicer than previous editions .
Since 4.01 , it is possible to select a variant constructor or record field from a sub- module that is not opened in the current scope , if type information is available at the point of use .
This now also works for GADT constructors .
The GC should handle the accumulation of custom blocks in the minor heap better ; this solves some memory - usage issues observed by code which allocates a lot of small custom blocks , typically small bigarrays .
For more information , please consult the comprehensive list of changes .

Vermont senators approved a gay marriage bill with an overwhelming 26 to 4 vote late Monday evening .
House Speaker Shap Smith , a proponent of gay marriage , said his chamber will begin work on the bill as early as today .
The Senate voted on the bill after a Senate Judiciary Committee gave it an unanimous approval on Friday .
The five member committee listened to a week 's worth of testimony before giving its blessing on the legislation .
Big crowds arrived for a Wednesday evening public hearing at the Montpelier Statehouse and the debate at times became heated .
Opponents wore stickers that read “ Marriage : A mother and father for every child ” while proponents carried the message “ From legal rights to equal rights . ”
The bill – introduced by Representatives Mark Larson ( Democrat ) and David Zuckerman ( Progressive ) in the House and Senator John Campbell in the Senate – grants gay and lesbian couples the right to marry in the first state to offer civil unions for gay couples in 2000 .
In arguing for the bill , Campbell was unapologetic to its Republican detractors .
“ Whenever the Republicans talk about gay marriage , it 's always , ' they ' and ' those people have enough rights , ' ' those people should be arrested because that lifestyle is criminal .' ...
But , they are our policemen .
They are our firefighters .
They are our teachers .
They are our garbage men .
They 're our children , our brothers , and our sisters . ”
Vermont Governor James Douglas opposes gay marriage , saying civil unions suffice , but has not indicated he would veto the bill .
Many believe he would let the law take effect without his signature .
Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2 to 1 in the House , where passage appears likely , but it 's uncertain if there are enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto .
If passed , Vermont would become the first state to legislatively extend marriage to gay and lesbian couples .
Gay marriage became available in Massachusetts , Connecticut and briefly in California as a result of state Supreme Court decisions .
Attorney General Terry Goddard said Tuesday he might be willing to consider legalizing marijuana if a way can be found to control its distribution - and figure out who has been smoking it .
Goddard said marijuana sales make up 75 percent of the money that Mexican cartels use for other operations , including smuggling other drugs and fighting the Mexican army and police .
He said that makes fighting drug distribution here important to cut off that cash .
He acknowledged those profits could be slashed if possession of marijuana were not a crime in Arizona . [ East Valley Tribune ]
Goddard 's comments came following a press conference Tuesday announcing the breakup of a major ring that police said has been responsible for bringing about 400,000 pounds of marijuana into Arizona each year since 2003 .
While prosecutors in Massachusetts still can’t figure out what " decriminalization " even means , Arizona ’s top drug enforcer is talking about legalization :
Not only is all of this completely dead - on , he said it at a frickin ’ massive drug bust press conference !
Are you kidding me !?
I guess somebody forgot to give Goddard the script .
Ya know , the one where you ’re supposed to use these big busts to declare epic progress with pillows of schwag piled to the ceiling and crow that you ’ve crippled the cartels pretty bad this time .
A long - range Grad rocket from Gaza landed in the Israeli city of Ashkelon today as Hamas delegates met Egyptian officials in Cairo for talks aimed at securing a long - term truce with Israel .
The rocket was the first of its kind to be fired at the city of 122,000 since informal ceasefires were declared separately by Israel and Hamas two weeks ago at the end of Israel 's three - week - long offensive in Gaza .
No one was injured in today 's attack , police said .
Israel launched Operation Cast Lead on 27 December with the aim of stopping rockets being fired from Gaza on a near - daily basis at Israeli targets .
Sporadic rocket and mortar fire from Gaza has continued , however , prompting tough warnings of reprisals from Israeli leaders .
More than a dozen rockets and mortar shells were fired into Israel on Sunday .
The following day Israel fired a missile at a car in the town of Rafah , killing a Palestinian militant , and bombed the nearby Gaza - Egypt border , seeking to destroy tunnels that Hamas uses to smuggle in weapons and supplies .
The Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , pledged to keep hitting Hamas as long as it attacked Israel , and ruled out negotiations with the militant Islamic rulers of Gaza .
" Terror must be fought with force and lots of force .
Therefore we will strike Hamas , " she said at a security conference yesterday .
" If by ending the operation we have yet to achieve deterrence , we will continue until they get the message . "
Continued violence could work against Livni's government in the 10 February general election and bolster the hardline opposition leader , Binyamin Netanyahu , who is seen as the frontrunner .
Ashkelon was hit by nearly 100 rockets during the Gaza fighting .
Since the fall of 2008 we have been living in an implied socialist republic .
Perhaps more appropriately , we have been living in a socialist - leaning nation where we elect ( ed ) our socialist - leaning representatives .
I use the term “ implied socialist - republic ” because it is not overtly stated that it is indeed socialism , yet we can see the effects through the actions and intent of the federal government .
And it 's getting worse .
If the administration had it their way they would cure the world of all suffering , evil , unfairness , misfortune … and oh yes , opportunity .
This sounds good and well ( not really ) , but in reality it is as unsustainable in America as our ability to continue printing and borrowing money at will and not suffering massive blowback for it .
We 've been flirting with socialism in the U.S. for decades , however , now we are looking at it on a major scale .
With the ill - fated bailouts and stimulus ' we began to see the inevitability of government coercion in private industry .
If you give a mouse a trillion cookies he 'll want a trillion glasses of milk – and now the federal government is trying to claim that milk from you and I and apparently any company it feels it should .
The Obama Administration is currently lobbying Congress for the “ authorization ” to seize any non-banking financial institution .
Let 's assume that most Americans understand this to be a heinous , corrupt , and outright illegal act .
Congress does not have the authority to authorize the government to do so .
Even if it does happen “ legally ” ( asking Congress as opposed to telling ) , it still remains unconstitutional , thus illegal to do so .
The power that the administration is seeking is the ability to seize any non-banking financial institution ( investment firm , hedge fund , insurance company , etc. ) if they foresee financial struggle within said company .
The idea is that the government , after stepping in , will do a better job of managing the business , transactions , and contracts of these companies .
What 's especially amusing ( sickening ) about this is that the companies it intends to take over are in the business of ….. making money .
They did n't do too well , for whatever reason , and the government feels that they can do better .
The government is not in the business of making money , however , they only operate at cost to U.S. taxpayers and thus do not retain the interest , experience , capacity , and knowledge to do so .
They understand how to make money even less than these failing companies do !
The most likely entity to retain this power , if given , is the Federal Reserve .
The Federal Reserve is the sole issuer of domestic currency in the U.S. and its role is to maintain a stable currency and supply of money .
Since its inception in 1913 the dollar has lost more than 95 % of its value .
According to the CPI ( consumer price index ) what took $ 1 to buy in 1913 cost $ 21.57 in 2008 .
You can view CPI numbers by year at [ link edited for length ] .
How 's that for track record ?
It 's noteworthy to mention that the Federal Reserve is a privately owned company and is in no way accountable to the government .
Congress does not even know how or where it issues the money it creates or in what amount .
The Federal Reserve is entirely unconstitutional and illegal .
Who cares what is or is not unconstitutional though .
In the words of former President George W. Bush ( another despot ) ; “ The Constitution is just a god$@mn piece of paper ! ” .
Good thing we have Presidents on our side .
I digress .
Somehow the government feels that the Federal Reserve will do a better job of producing prosperity in a broken company than the original company did .
This whole issue was prompted by public outcry over bonuses paid to AIG executives after receiving billions in bailout money .
The government has blamed their irresponsible spending on AIG 's irresponsible spending ….of our money .
The root problem is not AIG spending irresponsibly , yes that occurred , but they should have never been given that money in the first place .
Rewarding incompetence by bailing out any company is diametrically opposed to the principles of free enterprise .
The government merely invokes the fear of economic collapse any time it realizes that its policies have not worked as planned .
They create more answers to the original problem , yet all are a fallacy .
It is now simply trying to cover its tracks with manure .
The tracks are still there , but now there 's crap all over the place .
What is to stop the government from interfering with any other industry at this point ?
It only needs to invoke the fear clause in order to pursue more failed agendas , legislation , and tinkering .
Companies that should have been allowed to fail have been propped up , thus preventing those to blame from learning from the mistakes made and creating the illusion of progress .
With this provision the government seeks the ability to amend or abolish business practices , models , and contracts however it sees fit .
Failure is opportunity , opportunity for someone else to rise up in the wake and provide that product or service at a better value and more successfully .
It is delusional to think that no one could possibly fill the gap these companies should have left behind .
With this unprecedented move the government has taken the next logical step from socialism .
Government coercion in private industry reeks of communism and can only serve to oppress the people it was intended to “ liberate ” .
If Congress does give this “ authority ” it will unleash the salivating dogs of despotism upon the populace and serve to further hamper economic growth and recovery .
We should all be familiar by now of the ineptitude and inefficiency of the federal government in dealing with nearly any problem .
It simply does n't work .
These businesses will fail with or without government help .
The end state will be more wasteful spending at our expense and further destruction of private industry in general .
But hey , they mean well right ?
Let us all raise a glass to coercion and despotism tonight .
We 'll all be drinking the same thing soon enough , so enjoy it .
Cheers !

On March 18 , Rep. George Miller , a Democrat from California , tacked an amendment on H.R. 1388 , entitled “ Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act , ” or GIVE ( to government ) , Obama ’s plan to require mandatory service for all able young people .
Miller ’s amendment will “ prohibit organizations from attempting to influence legislation ; organize or engage in protests , petitions , boycotts , or strikes ; and assist , promote , or deter union organizing , ” according to GovTrack.us , a site that tracks Congress .
Obama ’s call for a “ Civilian Security Force ” during a campaign speech in Colorado Springs , Colorado .
In other words , Obama ’s “ volunteer corps ” act , passed by the House with a 321-105 margin and requiring the government to develop a plan for indentured servitude , would deny millions of people their right to oppose and organize against government legistation under the First Amendment .
“ This is as close to a sedition act , a violation of 1st Amendment rights , as has been proposed in recent history .
A basic right as a part of our natural , inalienable rights , is to resist government .
Our founders not only knew it was a right but it was a responsibility .
This legislation begins to break that down significantly , ” writes Gary Wood for the Examiner .
GIVE ( up your rights ) will conscript millions of young people , put them in uniforms and send them packing to 4 - year “ public service ” academies where they will be indoctrinated and trained to become “ public sector leaders . ”
GIVE was passed by the House on March 18 by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 321 to 105 .
“ At this moment of economic crisis , when so many people are in need of help and so much needs to be done , this could not be more urgent , ” said Obama .
“ It is up to every one of us to do his or her small part to make the world a better place . ”
Under section 6104 of the bill , entitled “ Duties , ” in subsection B6 , the legislation states that a commission will be set up to investigate , “ Whether a workable , fair , and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed , and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the Nation and overcome civic challenges by bringing together people from diverse economic , ethnic , and educational backgrounds . ”
Section 120 of the bill addresses the “ Youth Engagement Zone Program ” and states that “ service learning ” will be “ a mandatory part of the curriculum in all of the secondary schools served by the local educational agency . ”

H.R. 1388 not only reauthorizes programs under the National and Community Service Act of 1990 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 , but also includes “ new programs and studies ” and is expected to be funded with an allocation of $ 6 billion over the next five years , explains Bob Unruh for WND .
“ Many , however , are raising concerns that the program , which is intended to include 250,000 ‘ volunteers , ’ is the beginning of what President Obama called his ‘ National Civilian Security Force ’ in a a speech last year in which he urged creating an organization as big and well - funded as the U.S. military .
He has declined since then to elaborate , ” Unruh adds .
It appears Miller ’s amendment is designed to strip members of this emerging “ National Civilian Security Force ” of their constitutional rights under the First Amendment .
The First Amendment reads as follows : “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . ”
According to GovTrack.us , the addition of the Miller amendment to GIVE was agreed to by voice vote .
On March 23 , a similar bill was passed by the Senate on a 74 to 14 vote .
“ From President Kennedy ’s days to the creation of Americorps by then President Bill Clinton , the notion of public service has become a rallying cry .
Tonight ’s vote , propelled by President Obama ’s urging of an expansion , would mean a growth in such work from 75,000 community service jobs to 250,000 , ” reported the New York Times .

After Apple announced that Steve Jobs would be not be giving the 2009 Macworld Expo keynote , analyst expectations about the event dropped dramatically .
While Apple did not deliver the expected updates to the iMac and Mac mini , they did provide substantial updates to their iLife and iWork suites and finally introduced the unibody 17 " MacBook Pro .
No iMac and Mac mini Updates
The most disappointing aspect of Macworld was the lack of updates for the Mac mini and iMac .
The Mac mini , in particular , has been long overdue for a refresh , and the recent rumors seemed to indicate that it would finally get some worthy upgrades ( dual monitor , FireWire ) .
While no one could say for sure that the new iMac was coming , two sites ( Wired and TUAW ) specifically said that Apple would be releasing a new Mac mini at Macworld .
The timing was believable , of course , since evidence of the new iMacs and Mac minis had been found buried within Mac OS X , itself .
Unfortunately , either timetables changed , or these sites were simply wrong .
It 's still clear to us , however , that Mac mini and iMac updates are imminent .
Based on whispers we 've heard , we do feel that many of the rumored upgrades surrounding the Mac mini are true .
It 's just a matter of when .
Macbook Pro 17 " - Fixed Battery
The first report that Apple was going to deliver a 17 " MacBook Pro with a fixed internal battery came from 9to5 Mac .
Though the site hedged a bit towards the end , the original information was confirmed by multiple sources .
The use of an extended - life , non-removable battery was unique and accurate and 9to5 Mac deserves credit for the scoop .
i Life , iWork , Cloud Computing
Perhaps to the relief of many , Apple 's push into " cloud " computing was far more limited than originally reported .
The information came again from 9to5 Mac but was described as far more ambitious a plan than what was seen at this year 's Macworld .
Original reports claimed Apple would migrate iWork and iLife functionality into web - based services .
While Apple did release an iWork.com public beta , its functionality is limited to collaboration and document sharing .
Other information from 9to5 Mac also detailed celebrity lessons for GarageBand , which did turn out to be true .
DRM - Free
It seems clear that CNet has sources at major music labels and was able to predict that Apple would be launching a full DRM - free store at Macworld .
No iPhone Nano ...
Yet ?
Case manufacturers XSKN and Vaja have both advertised cases for an unreleased iPhone Nano in the weeks leading up to Macworld .
And while we still do n't see the reasoning behind such a product , it seems clear that the case manufacturers did believe that this product was coming and have actually produced cases based on the leaked specs .
In fact , the same spec leaks may also be responsible for the iPhone Nano clones that have already hit the market .
It remains possible that we will see such a product in the future , or it may have simply been an expensive mistake on the part of the case manufacturers .
What 's Next ?
Cinema Displays , the Mac mini and iMac seem the most likely updates coming next .
Previous supply chain sources had claimed the iMac would start shipping in January .
If true , that means the update could come within weeks .
Apple has occasionally been known to launch products shortly after their Macworld events in either January or February .
The earliest example we could find was an iPod Shuffle revision launched on January 30th , 2007 .
Voice 1 : Adrenaline just took over and instead of thinking what I should do I just put my foot down and accelerated and drove straight through all the orange flame .
Voice 2 : It was pitch dark and headlights did n't do anything because of the smoke .
Voice 3 : Every fibre was just screaming ' you 've got to get out of here , the fire 's coming ' .
Voice 4 : I warned my son a bit after seven o'clock that night not to come through .
He said " I 'll make it " .
Mark Horstman :
This is the last place you 'd want to be in a bushfire ... inside a car .
Narration : Cars and bushfires are a lethal combination .
Ash Wednesday , 1983 ...31 of the 46 fatalities were in or near vehicles .
Eyre Peninsula in South Australia , 2005 .
Tragically , nine people died .
Eight of them were in or near their cars .
Mark Horstman :
If you find yourself trapped inside a car in a bushfire what can you do to increase your chances of survival ?
Narration : Andrew Sargeant from the CSIRO has been reading more coroners ' reports about bushfires than he'd like .
Andrew Sargeant :
It 's literally an inferno .
You would be getting exposed to probably about 80 times the radiant heat compared to a sunny day like this .
Andrew Sargeant :
It must be horrific .
Outside of the car it would be very dark , it would feel like it was raining fire .
It would be very windy , the car would be moving a lot .
Smoke would be unbearable , temperatures would be unbearable , you 'd feel plastics melting away onto your skin .
Narration : Andrew 's part of a team led by Justin Leonard that for the first time is putting cars to the test .
Their giant gas griller simulates the radiant heat of a real bushfire .
Justin Leonard :
We 've configured here a series of burners that actually run on liquid phase LPG and have designed the nozzles in a way that they project the gas up and it burns in a very similar way to an actual bushfire .
Narration :
They spend hours in each test car fitting what looks like a tangled mess of wires .
Andrew Sargeant :
And if we put another one there , it should hold the guide wires in place , no worries ...
Justin Leonard : Surprisingly it 's a highly organised set of sensors , where we bring temperature signals in from all different parts of the car .
Narration :
All the data are beamed live to the scientists out of a fireproof box .
From the ceiling to the floor , fifty sensors will paint a detailed heat map of the car .
But heat and radiation are n't the only challenges .
A melting car makes plenty of smoke and toxic gases .
Dr Steve Brown :
We have one point up here at the breathing zone of the driver , and at the same time we 'll sample a second point down near the floor level .
Narration : Steve Brown sets up an air sampler to see what you'd be breathing if you were crouched down under a woollen blanket , as recommended by fire safety authorities .
Dr Steve Brown : A lot of car lining materials are PVC , and PVC when it 's heated , even before it starts to ignite , will release hydrogen chloride gas , and that 's a very severe irritant .
Our aim is to see whether people will reach a point in the car where they feel too distressed and they panic and jump out .
Narration :
Add to that a rising panic that the fuel tank may be about to explode .
But after many tests , this has n't happened once .
Justin Leonard :
This test we 're going to do a side - on exposure , and we 're going to do it with the engine running and the air conditioning on .
Mark Horstman :
Have you done this one before ?
Justin Leonard : No .
This is our first one with air conditioning so we 're really interested in how much difference it really makes .
Andrew Sargeant : Ignition .
Narration :
The radiant heat from the gas jets is building gradually , just like an approaching bushfire .
Justin Leonard : 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , ten kilowatts .
Narration : Eight minutes into the test , and we 're seeing the first signs of the car overheating .
Andrew Sargeant : See all the rubber , its all starting to drip down ...
Justin Leonard : 2 , 1 , 20 kilowatts ...
Narration :
It 's when you see it melt that you realise how much plastic and rubber there is .
Eleven minutes in , and the simulated fire - front is rolling over the car .
It 's peaking just above forty kilowatts , that 's twenty times the pain threshold .
The exposed side bursts into flame .
Justin Leonard : Ignition of the car ...
Narration : Twelve minutes in ( bang ) and there goes the front tyre .
Justin Leonard : Coming down to 20 kilowatts ...
Narration :
As the fire recedes it looks like there 's smoke billowing inside the cabin .
Justin Leonard : End of test .
Suppression crews ...
Narration :
The firemen start the water pump to save the instruments .
As soon as it's safe , Steve Brown is sucking out samples of the cabin smoke .
Dr Steve Brown :
We 've had about 200 parts per million of hydrogen chloride .
That would be extremely irritating to somebody .
I believe they 'd want to get out of that car .
Andrew Sargeant :
The interior for the most is still intact .
Justin Leonard : Just a small burn hole in the back seat .
Justin Leonard :
Well that was probably one of the most revealing tests we 've had .
We learnt a lot about engine operation and how the aircon performed .
Narration : Although the windows stopped 70 percent of the radiant heat getting through , the range of temperatures inside is astonishing .
Justin Leonard :
We 've actually got peaks up around , as high as 250 in fact , very high in the cabin , but if you 're down low under the blanket there very tenable around 40 to 50 degrees , which is quite survivable .
Narration :
On the floor under the woollen blanket , you 'd be able to survive the heat .
But it 's the toxic gases that could be lethal .
Justin Leonard :
The preliminary results seem to indicate that it's a much cooler environment for the people to be in .
However it looks like the stirring up effect of the air conditioning may in fact mix the toxic gases around in the cabin and may in fact be worse for the occupants .
Mark Horstman :
The best advice is do n't get caught in your car in the first place .
Make your decision early enough to stay or go .
But sometimes that 's just not possible .
If you do get stuck , here 's what you do :
Shut the doors , shut all the windows .
Turn your headlights on so people can see you .
Close all the air vents .
Narration : Crouching down low and covering yourself with a woollen blanket really makes a difference .
And these tests show that lining up the car in a clearing front - on to the fire , and turning off the aircon and fan will also help .
Hopefully its information you 'll never need , but in a land of bushfires , you never know .
Here ’s something I had been wanting to do for a long time and could never find the right docs for .
When you perform some operation in Emacs , it often puts stuff ( search results , some new buffer , etc. ) in a window other than the current one .
( I ’m using window in the Emacs sense , to mean a portion of what you might call a window but it calls a frame . )
But I have a huge Emacs frame , and always want to keep some buffers present in particular positions while rotating the rest of it around .
In my case , it ’s my org - mode windows , which keep track of most everything about my work day , but you could imagine it being some documentation reference or something .
Because I have these buffers up for long stretches of time but rarely actually go to them and edit them , Emacs thinks they ’re not important and is happy to reuse their windows when it has new data to display .
How to stop it from doing so ?
It turns out that what I want is a dedicated window ( if I had realized this , I could have found the answer a lot faster ) .
The details are in the Emacs Lisp docs or you can just put this trivial but handy code in your .emacs , and use the Pause key to toggle the dedication of the current window :
( defun toggle - current -window - dedication ( ) ( interactive ) ( let* ( ( window ( selected - window ) ) ( dedicated ( window - dedicated - p window ) ) ) ( set - window - dedicated - p window ( not dedicated ) ) ( message " Window % sdedicated to %s " ( if dedicated " no longer " " " ) ( buffer - name ) ) ) ) ( global - set - key [ pause ] ' toggle-current-window- dedication )

" God rays " :
Alot of people know light is an amazing thing .
What they do n't know is that electro magnetic waves can be used to do practically anything .
This particular technology ( more on its origin later in this post ... ) is called the " god ray " by those in the know because of its amazing capabilities .

Mind reading :
They can even read your mind .
It does n't end there .
Not only can your thoughts be heard but what you visualize in your mind can also be seen as well as your dreams .
Your ENTIRE brain state can be examined and manipulated as if it were a computer .
They can see when you are aroused .
They can see what the visual part of your brain is processing .
They can use data from your brain to recreate a 3d model of your body that does exactly what you do so you can never hide .

Modification of reality :
The same way that your brain processes visual and audio information to create the experience of watching a movie or browsing on the internet
can be hijacked to change your reality .
TV shows and movies can be changed to have new dialogue , entirely new scenes .
Often this will be used to make the target think that the media is commenting on things that the target does to drive them into insanity .

Last week was a terrible week for DVDs , unless you were planning to pick up Twilight , so bad that I did n’t even write a DVD pick article last week .
Do n’t worry there are some good DVDs coming out this week , and no I ’m not talking about Bolt or Follow That Bird .
First up this week we have The Riches : Season 2 .
If you have n’t been watching Eddie Izzard ’s latest show The Riches on FX , you should think about checking it out .
It follows a family of gypsies who , after an altercation with their clan , witness a fatal car accident .
It turns out the dead couple were in the process of moving , so the gypsies move into their new house , and attempt to lead a normal “ buffer ” life .
I was n’t sure what DVD to pick this week , but after careful consideration I decided against Quantum of Solace .
It is a direct sequel to Casino Royale , the filmmakers wanted to take advantage of Bond ’s emotions after the death of Vesper .
Do n’t worry it was n’t too long before he runs into Olga Kurylenko , and do n’t worry we do have a gallery of her .
This week ’s DVD Pick of the Week is The Venture Bros. : Season Three .
The Venture Brothers follows Hank and Dean Venture , two dopey teenagers , their failing Superscientist Father ( Dr. Thaddeus “ Rusty ” Venture ) and their extremely violent government issued bodyguard ( Brock Samson ) .
In season 3 we find out about Dr. Girlfriend ’s secret , Dr Venture thinks he might have to sell the compound , and Brock loses his license to kill and goes up against the OSI .
The quirky sense of humor , the rediculous situations , and crazy venture kids all got kicked up a notch in the latest season .
The Taliban , who became internationally notorious for public executions during their regime , accused Karzai 's government of corruption and said : " We strongly request the UN , the EU , the Red Cross and human rights groups to earnestly prevent this barbaric act . "
MEMPHIS , Tenn . -- Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol rallied the Lakers to another victory .
However , Los Angeles might have lost a key player again .
Bryant scored 25 points , Gasol had 24 points and eight rebounds and the Lakers beat Memphis 115- 98 on Saturday night , extending the Grizzlies ' losing streak to 12 games .
The win was tempered by the uncertain status of Lakers center Andrew Bynum , who left the game in the first quarter with a sprained right knee .
X - rays were negative and further tests will be done Sunday in New York where the Lakers face the Knicks the following day .
" Great disappointment .
It took the wind out of the whole team in the first half , and that was a reason we played like we did , " Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson said .
" We have to stay optimistic about it .
That 's all we can do . "
Derek Fisher scored 14 points for Los Angeles , and Lamar Odom added 13 as the Lakers won for the sixth time in the last seven games .
Bryant also had seven assists .
Rudy Gay had 23 points , while O.J. Mayo scored 21 points on 8 - for - 12 shooting from the field for the Grizzlies , losers of 20 of their last 22 .
Mike Conley finished with 13 points and seven assists , and Marc Gasol also scored 13 points .
Bynum was injured with about 5 minutes gone in the game .
Bryant was driving to the basket , missed the shot , came down awkwardly and crashed into Bynum 's right leg .
Bynum was helped from the floor and did not return .
The Lakers center missed the final 46 games of last season with a left knee injury , also suffered against the Grizzlies .
" He was in considerable pain out there , and it looked very reminiscent of what happened last year , " Jackson said .
The Lakers pulled away midway in the third period after the Grizzlies held a 13 - point lead in the first half .
Los Angeles outscored Memphis 60 - 37 after the break , including 24 points off 14 turnovers .
" They did a great job in the second half , no denying that , " Mayo said .
" I felt like my touches were limited in the second half , and give a lot of credit to the Laker defense . "
Hollins noticed his team lose their edge in the second half , primarily as the veteran Lakers turned up the intensity .
" They got deflated , " Hollins said of his team .
" [ The Lakers ] made some tough shots .
They started making threes , and their defensive pressure is something that could have affected them emotionally .
As the game went on , our energy level went down .
We were n't able to be consistent as the game wore on . "
The Grizzlies ' offense was more free - flowing in the first half , a different style under Hollins , in his third game since replacing the fired Marc Iavaroni .
Instead of set plays , the Grizzlies were pushing the ball to the basket , and Mayo was connecting from outside .
Memphis was still shooting about 60 percent in the latter stages of the first half and built the lead to 13 before it was cut to 61 - 55 at halftime .
It did n't take the Lakers long to overtake Memphis as they opened the second half with 10 - 2 run , capped by Bryant 's 3 - point play .
From there , the two teams stayed close as they continued to shoot above 50 percent .
But the Lakers closed the third with a 14 - 4 run , including 10 consecutive points , to take a 91 - 82 lead into the fourth .
Bryant had 10 in the quarter , and Odom added nine to help Los Angeles build its lead .
" We came out much better mentally in the second half , " Gasol said .
" Defensively , we did a much better job than we did in the first half . "
And , perhaps the Lakers ' second - half dominance was an indication of how the Grizzlies have n't quite adapted to the faster pace under Hollins .
" Obviously , they picked it up , " Marc Gasol , Pau 's younger brother , said of the second half .
" They got us off rhythm .
...
We 've got to be consistent .
We 've got to be able to play full speed for 48 minutes .
We 've got to be in really good shape . "
Game notes
The Grizzlies ' 12 - game losing streak is the longest for the Memphis since opening the 2002 - 03 season 0 - 13 .
Darko Milicic participated in pregame warmups was a brace on his right hand .
The Grizzlies ' 7 - foot C , who fractured his right ( non-shooting ) hand Dec. 26 , was cleared for non-contact practice Friday and a determination will be made early next week on when he can start full practices .
Hollins said Milicic , who has missed 17 games , possibly could return next weekend .
It was the second time Pau Gasol returned to Memphis after his trade to the Lakers a year ago .
As part of that deal , the Grizzlies acquired the rights to Marc Gasol , who was playing in Europe .
In the last post I show how we can calculate clusters of n-dimensional Objects with the K - means - Algorithm in F# .
This time I will simplify the code by using the built - in type vector .
First of all we redefine the interface for “ clusterable ” objects :
type IClusterable = abstract DimValues : vector with get
This time we do not need any dimension information – the vector type will care about this .
Now we can reduce our distance function to :
let calcDist ( p1:vector ) ( p2:vector ) = ( p1 - p2 ) .
Norm
The function Norm calculates the 2 - Norm of a vector .
So calcDist will still compute the n-dimensional Euclidean distance .
The next step is the definition of a n-dimensional Centroid type .
This time we will only use a type alias of vector :
type Centroid = vector
The calculation of the centroid and the centroid error can be written as :
let calcCentroid ( items : 'a list when 'a :> IClusterable ) ( oldCentroid : Centroid ) = let count = items .
Length if count = 0 then oldCentroid else let sum = items |> List.fold_left ( fun vec item -> vec + item.DimValues ) // vector addition ( nullVector oldCentroid ) sum * ( 1. /( count |> float ) ) // multiply with scalar let calcError centroid ( items : 'a list when 'a :> IClusterable ) = let sq x = x * x items |> List.sum_by ( fun i -> calcDist centroid i.DimValues |> sq )
The calcError function is straight forward but not perfect in terms of performance .
As we use the calcDist function and hence the 2 - Norm the function will first calculate a square root and then squares the result .
The rest of the code is pretty much same as in the last post :
/// creates n-dimensional 0 - vector let nullVector ( v:vector ) = v * 0. type Cluster <'a > when 'a :>
IClusterable = { Items : 'a list ; Count : int ; Centroid : Centroid ; Error : float} member x .
Print = printfn " ( Items : %d , Centroid : %A , Error : %.2f ) " x. Count x.Centroid x. Error static member CreateCluster ( item : 'a ) = let items = [ item ] let empty = nullVector item .
DimValues let centroid = calcCentroid items empty { new Cluster < 'a > with Items = items and Count = 1 and Centroid = centroid and Error = calcError centroid items} member x.EvolveCluster ( items : 'a list ) = let l = items .
Length let centroid = calcCentroid items x.Centroid {x with Items = items ; Count = l ; Centroid = centroid ; Error = calcError centroid items}
let rand = new Random ( ) let InitClusters ( k:int ) ( items : 'a array when 'a :> IClusterable ) = let length = items .
Length let getInitItem ( ) = items .[ rand .
Next length ]
Array.init k ( fun x -> getInitItem ( ) |> Cluster <'a >. CreateCluster ) let AssignItemsToClusters k ( clusters : Cluster < 'a > array ) ( items : 'a seq when 'a :> IClusterable ) = if k <= 0 then failwith " KMeans needs k > 0 " let findNearestCluster ( item : 'a ) = let minDist , nearest , lastPos = clusters |> Array.
fold_left ( fun ( minDist , nearest , pos ) cluster -> let distance = calcDist item .
DimValues ( cluster .
Centroid ) if distance < minDist then ( distance , pos , pos+1 ) else ( minDist , nearest , pos+1 ) ) ( Double. PositiveInfinity , 0,0 ) nearest let assigned = items |> Seq.map ( fun item -> item , findNearestCluster item ) let newClusters = Array.create k [ ] for item , nearest in assigned do newClusters .[ nearest ] <- item ::( newClusters .[ nearest ] ) clusters |> Array.mapi ( fun i c -> c.EvolveCluster newClusters .[i ] ) let calcClusterError ( clusters : Cluster < 'a > array ) = clusters |> Array.fold_left ( fun acc cluster -> acc + cluster .
Error ) 0 . let kMeansClustering K epsilon ( items : 'a array when 'a :> IClusterable ) = let k = if K <= 0 then 1 else K let rec clustering lastError ( clusters : Cluster < ' a > array ) = let newClusters = AssignItemsToClusters k clusters items let newError = calcClusterError newClusters if abs ( lastError - newError ) > epsilon then clustering newError newClusters else newClusters , newError InitClusters k items |> clustering Double .
PositiveInfinity
This vector approach shortens the code for the kMeans algorithm , but has a little longer runtime .
I am interested in any suggestions .

BIGGEST . TAX CUT .
EVER ….
A few weeks ago , when the House approved the economic stimulus bill without any Republican votes , David Weigel noted that he literally could n’t remember “ a time when the entire Republican conference in either house voted against tax cuts . ”
That ’s true , but let ’s go a little further .
The compromise plan announced last night includes $ 282 billion in tax cuts over two years .
With that in mind , Steven Waldman argues , persuasively , that when the vast majority of congressional Republicans oppose the package , they ’ll be voting against the biggest tax cut “ in history . ”
According to the Wall Street Journal , Bush ’s first two years of tax cuts amounted to $ 174 billion .
A second batch in 2004 and 2005 cost $ 231 .
And those were thought to be bigger than the tax cuts offered by Reagan , Kennedy or others .
Now , perhaps some new analysis will show that the tax cuts end up not quite being the largest in history by this measure or that .
But it ’s clear they ’re massive .
I ’m ducking the debate on whether this is economically a good or bad — but surely it ought to be a big story .
True .
Waldman also notes that this is also an example of a liberal Democrat delivering early on a tax cut he promised during the campaign , a pledge “ few Republican thought he ’d keep . ”
What ’s more , let ’s also not forget that Obama ’s tax - cut plan in the recovery package is not only arguably bigger than previous cuts , but also better targeted .
George W. Bush ’s tax cuts were long - term income - tax rate cuts , which amounted to a generous break for those at the top , since the wealthy pay most income taxes .
Obama ’s tax cuts , meanwhile , are short - term refunds paid directly to working and middle class families ( some of which Republicans have denounced as “ welfare ” ) .
As such , GOP lawmakers are going to reject one of the largest , if not the largest , tax cut ever proposed by a president — which just so happens to be targeted at the working and middle class families Obama vowed to look out for .
When the economy recovers , I suspect many on the right will argue , “ Obama ’s policy only worked because he passed a quarter - trillion dollars in tax breaks . ”
That will surely make them feel better .
But how will those same conservatives respond when it ’s noted that Republicans stood up to oppose one of the biggest tax - cut plans in American history ?
Pictured :
The supergun that kills from a mile - and the camouflaged crackshots using it against the Taliban
British Army snipers call it ' the Silent Assassin ' and it is the weapon the Taliban fear the most .
It is the British - made L115A3 Long Range Rifle which , in recent weeks , has killed scores of enemy fighters in Afghanistan .
In a new initiative on the front line , the Army is using sniper platoons to target the Taliban and ' The Long ' , as the snipers call it , can take out insurgents from a mile away .
Made to measure : Army sniper Yuppie in his home - made camouflage suit
Many of the elite marksmen who use the rifle make their own extraordinary suits of camouflage to stay hidden from the Taliban .
Some have been known to go ' under cover ' for two days while they pick off the enemy .
Last week Army snipers were training with the rifle and full camouflage on the snow - covered ranges of the Support Weapons School at the Land Warfare Centre at Warminster , Wiltshire .
Deadly :
The rifle is known as ' The Long ' and can take out insurgents from a mile away
One of them , known as Yuppie , said : ' You could call it made - to - measure camouflage .
' This one is green string tied into sheets , then covered in straw with straps attached so it fits tight .
It took three months and a lot of patience to make . '
His comrade Dean , who like Yuppie is a veteran of Iraq , Afghanistan , Bosnia and Northern Ireland , said : ' I would n't say us snipers are an elite , but we think we 're a cut above the rest . '
The L115A3 Long Range Sniper Rifle - based on a weapon used by the British Olympic shooting team - weighs 15 lbs , fires 8.59 mm rounds and has a range of 1,100 - 1,500 yards .
Today ’s culture warriors have better things to argue about than pot -smoking hippies , yet federal marijuana laws are still stuck in the Nixon - era days when conservatives feared that reefer madness was destroying the minds of America ’s youth .
Amid that time warp , efforts by California and other states to nudge Washington in the direction of more sensible drug laws have largely been welcome .
But whether or not you ’re in the camp that thinks marijuana should be legalized , a proposal to regulate and tax its sale as a way of helping to balance California ’s budget is an idea whose time has not come .
A bill from Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco -- where else ? ) that would do precisely that was introduced Monday .
It would , first , decriminalize the possession and sale of marijuana under state law , and , second , set up a system for regulating and taxing it .
The sales and taxation part only happens , though , if the federal government decriminalizes marijuana too , or at least allows states to make their own decisions about the drug .
Ammiano and his supporters argue that the state is losing out on more than $ 1 billion a year in tax revenues because its biggest cash crop , marijuana , is illegal and therefore not taxable .
Further , they argue that by passing the law , the state would send a strong message to Congress and the Obama administration about revisiting federal marijuana policies .
It is almost beyond dispute that the federal laws are unjustified by science or common sense .
Under the 1970 Controlled Substances
Act , cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug , meaning it has no medical use and cannot be prescribed by a physician .
The many medical uses of marijuana are well documented , and it is not nearly as addictive or intoxicating as less - restricted Schedule 2 drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine .
Moreover , the active ingredient in marijuana , THC , can be sold in pill form as a Schedule 3 drug .
So what makes the plant so dangerous ?
The problem with Ammiano ’s bill , AB 390 , is that it would only widen the gray area between California and federal laws on medical marijuana .
Though the state ’s acceptance of medicinal marijuana has brought many public benefits , it also has resulted in even more illicit cultivation in places such as Humboldt County , as well as legal and regulatory chaos .
AB 390 would do nothing to increase tax revenues in the absence of federal action , and would probably only further enrich the state ’s marijuana black market .
The Obama administration should reexamine the Controlled Substances
Act because it ’s the right thing to do , not because of an ill - considered taxation scheme from California .
Melvin Bryan was stabbed in the neck and chest
Two drug dealers who murdered a teenager over a £ 10 debt have been jailed for life for murder .
Melvin Bryan , 18 , was found in a bedsit in north London , in July , with knife wounds to his neck and chest .
The teenager , from Peckham , south - east London , was attacked for refusing to pay £ 10 for a rock of crack cocaine .
O'Jay Rodgers , 23 , of no fixed address , and Damion Sealey , 28 , of Green Lanes , north London , were given minimum terms of 22 and 20 years respectively .
The attack happened a house in Gloucester Road , Edmonton .
O'Jay Rodgers and Damion Sealey killed over £ 10 worth of crack
At the Old Bailey , Judge Timothy Pontius said : " He was a terrified young man desperate to escape .
" Sealey , you watched as Rodgers used a knife on Melvin Bryan , encouraging that remorseless attack .
It was clearly your intention that Rodgers should continue until he was dead ... all for £ 10 . "
Rodgers was on bail at the time of the killing for possessing crack .
Both men had been deported from America for breaking the law and " set about earning a dishonest and unscrupulous living here " said the judge .
I have read that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are asking that the Capitol Power Plant change from coal to natural gas for producing electricity .
With the proposed tax policy , I am afraid that they will find themselves asking to switch back to coal within a few years , because sufficient natural gas will not be available .
If the natural gas industry is to maintain or raise production levels , it will need assistance , not higher taxes .
What is the likely outcome ?
I fear it is an even steeper drop in US produced oil and gas supplies than would otherwise be the case .
This drop will come primarily because of the likely impact on small oil and gas companies that dominate the US production market , especially for natural gas .
The oil and gas industry is already pulling back sharply .
If one looks at drilling rig counts , the number of drilling rigs operating in the United States has dropped by close to 40 % from peak levels in 2008 .
Now changes to the tax law which would make it more expensive for oil and gas companies to operate are being proposed by the Obama administration .
Last September , I wrote a post saying that there was a possibility that US natural gas production could be ramped up , if quite a number of obstacles could be overcome .
I included this graphic of possible future production .
Figure 2 . Approximate future US natural gas production , based on Navigant Consulting estimates of shale gas and tight gas production .
The credit crisis has reduced demand , and this has reduced prices of both oil and natural gas .
At current prices , it is no longer profitable to drill most unconventional natural gas wells .
If taxes are higher , this will only make the situation worse , driving more marginal producers out of business .
The effect on supply wo n't be felt immediately , because drilling rigs are used for drilling new wells and for servicing existing wells .
Wells that have been drilled continue producing for several years , but the amount of oil or gas produced each year decline , as the pressure in the well declines , and as the percentage of water produced increases .
Companies need to continue drilling new wells to keep production up .
Figure 1 shows that companies are already cutting back dramatically on drilling new wells .
Adding new taxes will only make matters worse .
Even without new taxes , a decline in natural gas production is likely within two years .
President Obama has recently released his budget proposal for 2010 .
I understand it has tax benefits for green energy , while also increasing taxes and adding fees on the oil and gas industry .
As I understand it , the proposed tax increases on the oil and gas industry are not huge .
They are expected to produce revenues of " at least $ 31.5 billion " over 10 years , according to the Wall Street Journal .
This would average $ 3.15 billion a year ( or more ) .
According to recent testimony of Gary Luquette , President of Chevron North America Exploration and Production Company , the industry spent $ 152 billion on tax and royalty revenues paid to federal , state , and local governments .
This averages about $ 25 billion a year .
If the tax amounts to only $ 3.15 billion a year , this would amount to a 12 % increase .
Of course , it is not clear it will come to only $ 3.15 billion a year -- it may be considerably more .
One of the more widely discussed changes is new tax treatment for leases in the Gulf of Mexico .
According to Reuter's :
Obama 's plan , which must still be approved by Congress , would levy an excise tax on Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas , raising $ 5.3 billion in revenue from 2011 to 2019 .
This new 13 percent tax on all oil and gas production in the Gulf would only affect those companies that are currently not paying any royalties due to a loophole , said an Interior Department official .
The official said producers who already pay royalties will receive a tax credit .
The proposal would also place a $ 4 per acre annual fee on energy leases in the Gulf that are designated as non-producing , another Interior official said .
The budget proposal expects the fee to generate $ 1.2 billion from 2010 to 2019 .
If this is as far as the legislation went , I do n't think there would be a major problem .
I think the oil majors would be able to live with these provisions , but it might make them less likely to take leases in the Gulf of Mexico , and thus slightly reduce our future oil and gas supply .
The budget also calls for ending federal funding for an ultra- deepwater oil and gas research and development program .
If we want our oil and gas companies to be able to maintain or expand their output , this does n't seem like the direction to go , unless we have decided to give up on ultra-deepwater .
The legislation has provisions that will hit small producers particularly hard , if we believe the press release of the Independent Petroleum Association of America , an organization that represents small oil and gas companies .
Some of the more obscure provisions it is concerned about include the following , with its descriptions :
Repeal Expensing of Intangible Drilling Costs – expensing of the some of the normal costs of business ( i.e. , fuel , repairs , hauling supplies ) .
Repeal of Percentage Depletion – as an oil or natural gas well is developed over time , it depletes the natural resource .
This tax incentive allows for the “ depreciation ” of these wells many of which are small , barely economic wells .
Without this provision , many could be shut down .
[ " Regular " depletion would still be allowed , though . ]
Repeal Marginal Well Tax Credit – a credit that serves as a safety net for those wells that only produce small amounts of oil and gas .
Most of these wells are barely economic to keep operating , but collectively they supply almost 20 percent of the nation ’s oil and 12 percent of its gas .
Repeal Enhanced Oil Recovery Credit – a credit that allows industry to get more energy from wells that are “ tired ” and depleted , instead of drilling new wells .
Increases Geological and Geophysical Amortization Costs – allowed for some expensing of the high costs of doing seismic and other high - tech studies / surveys .
Such surveys are important to locate reserves and reduce the number of dry holes and unnecessary wells ( a.k.a. the industry ’s footprint ) .
Repeal of Manufacturing Tax Deduction – a provision given to every other American manufacturer .
Smaller companies are the ones doing much of the enhanced oil recovery , and are the ones operating the many stripper wells in this country .
They also are the ones drilling the majority of the unconventional natural gas supplies , which is the increasing part of the natural gas in Figure 2 .
According to the IPAA , the companies it its association drill 90 percent of the nation 's oil and natural gas wells and produce 68 percent of American oil and 82 percent of American natural gas .
The smaller companies tend to be more dependent on debt than the " majors " , so they have been hit particularly hard by the credit crisis .
As one can see from the drilling rig numbers , these companies are already cutting back greatly .
New taxes will only increase the degree of cutback , and will mean that more people and businesses will leave the industry .
If this happens , it will be even more difficult to expand when demand picks up again .
If the Obama Administration expects natural gas to replace some of the coal currently in use , it needs to be careful in crafting its tax legislation not to penalize the many small companies that today produce natural gas and oil .
In fact , if the Obama Administration wants natural gas growth , it should really be thinking about ways it can aid the industry .
One thing the industry needs help with is long term stable prices , at a levels high enough to encourage investment .
Another thing it needs help with is building infrastructure , like long distance gas pipelines and underground storage tanks to go with new production , so that new gas production has a place to go , when it is completed .
Also , some planning needs to be done to match up new production with new uses , so that one does not end up with a supply / demand mismatch .
Without action along these lines , US natural gas supply is likely to shrink , and , in the long run , make us more dependent on coal ( or leave us with gaps in fuel supply ) .
We must also look to the future global market .
For a decade , I have believed in the gradual rise of the so - called BRIC economies – those of Brazil , Russia , India and China .
It is fashionable – purely because of their declining stock markets last year – to believe that any BRIC " dreams " are well and truly over .
But we forecast GDP growth for China and India at , respectively , 6 per cent and 5.7 per cent for this year – they remain on course to overtake the US and become the world 's dominant economies .
These BRIC countries offer fantastic opportunities to companies in the UK , whether in the manufacturing or service sectors .
Our time zone and language are both things that , luckily , our banking industry or policymakers can't affect .
With all this in mind , forget the last 100 years .
Look forward with a little cheer .

Three Major Singularity Schools
( Originally appeared on the Machine Intelligence Research Institute blog , September 2007 . )
Singularity discussions seem to be splitting up into three major schools of thought : Accelerating Change , the Event Horizon , and the Intelligence Explosion .
Accelerating Change : Core claim :
Our intuitions about change are linear ; we expect roughly as much change as has occurred in the past over our own lifetimes .
But technological change feeds on itself , and therefore accelerates .
Change today is faster than it was 500 years ago , which in turn is faster than it was 5000 years ago .
Our recent past is not a reliable guide to how much change we should expect in the future .
Strong claim : Technological change follows smooth curves , typically exponential .
Therefore we can predict with fair precision when new technologies will arrive , and when they will cross key thresholds , like the creation of Artificial Intelligence .
Advocates : Ray Kurzweil , Alvin Toffler ( ? ) , John Smart
Event Horizon : Core claim :
For the last hundred thousand years , humans have been the smartest intelligences on the planet .
All our social and technological progress was produced by human brains .
Shortly , technology will advance to the point of improving on human intelligence ( brain - computer interfaces , Artificial Intelligence ) .
This will create a future that is weirder by far than most science fiction , a difference - in - kind that goes beyond amazing shiny gadgets .
Strong claim :
To know what a superhuman intelligence would do , you would have to be at least that smart yourself .
To know where Deep Blue would play in a chess game , you must play at Deep Blue ’s level .
Thus the future after the creation of smarter - than - human intelligence is absolutely unpredictable .
Advocates : Vernor Vinge
Intelligence Explosion : Core claim : Intelligence has always been the source of technology .
If technology can significantly improve on human intelligence – create minds smarter than the smartest existing humans – then this closes the loop and creates a positive feedback cycle .
What would humans with brain - computer interfaces do with their augmented intelligence ?
One good bet is that they ’d design the next generation of brain - computer interfaces .
Intelligence enhancement is a classic tipping point ; the smarter you get , the more intelligence you can apply to making yourself even smarter .
Strong claim :
This positive feedback cycle goes FOOM , like a chain of nuclear fissions gone critical – each intelligence improvement triggering an average of > 1.000 further improvements of similar magnitude – though not necessarily on a smooth exponential pathway .
Technological progress drops into the characteristic timescale of transistors ( or super - transistors ) rather than human neurons .
The ascent rapidly surges upward and creates superintelligence ( minds orders of magnitude more powerful than human ) before it hits physical limits .

The thing about these three logically distinct schools of Singularity thought is that , while all three core claims support each other , all three strong claims tend to contradict each other .
If you extrapolate our existing version of Moore ’s Law past the point of smarter - than - human AI to make predictions about 2099 , then you are contradicting both the strong version of the Event Horizon ( which says you ca n’t make predictions because you ’re trying to outguess a transhuman mind ) and the strong version of the Intelligence Explosion ( because progress will run faster once smarter - than - human minds and nanotechnology drop it into the speed phase of transistors ) .
I find it very annoying , therefore , when these three schools of thought are mashed up into Singularity paste .
Clear thinking requires making distinctions .
But what is still more annoying is when someone reads a blog post about a newspaper article about the Singularity , comes away with none of the three interesting theses , and spontaneously reinvents the dreaded fourth meaning of the Singularity :
Apocalyptism :
Hey , man , have you heard ?
There ’s this bunch of , like , crazy nerds out there , who think that some kind of unspecified huge nerd thing is going to happen .
What a bunch of wackos !
It ’s geek religion , man .
I ’ve heard ( many ) other definitions of the Singularity attempted , but I usually find them to lack separate premises and conclusions .
For example , the old Extropian FAQ used to define the “ Singularity ” as the Inflection Point , “ the time when technological development will be at its fastest ” and just before it starts slowing down .
But what makes this an interesting point in history apart from its definition ?
What are the consequences of this assumption ?
To qualify as a school of thought or even a thesis , one needs an internal structure of argument , not just a definition .
If you ’re wondering which of these is the original meaning of the term “ Singularity ” , it is the Event Horizon thesis of Vernor Vinge , who coined the word .
Step aside and take solace , John Thain :
The public flogging you just endured for spending $ 1.2 million to jazz up your now - vacant office at Merrill Lynch could subside once the sanctimonious mob moves on to other Wall Street titans who would dare redecorate their digs .
Next likely target : Citigroup .
Though it is ailing mightily , Citi only recently began sprucing up an entire floor of offices for its senior - most executives at its headquarters in Manhattan , at 399 Park Avenue .
That includes a new office for chief executive Vikram Pandit .
If a disgruntled staffer leaks details of any new accoutrement and their price tags , the bank could come under new fire for its supposedly profligate ways .
Just down the street , J.P. Morgan
Chase is close to completing a gut renovation of all 50 floors at its headquarters at 270 Park .
Cost of the project , which began 18 months ago : A quarter of a billion dollars .
Let any cushy details from that facelift surface , and JPM Chief Executive Jamie Dimon could have some ’ splaining to do .
No doubt some other Wall Street giants have redone their offices , too .
Let the witch hunt begin for the next CEO we can pillory for his fatcat ways .
The big problem with all this is it criminalizes capitalism .
It plays right into the ill - conceived agenda of Wall Street ’s harshest critics .
And it diverts attention away from the real issue — how to stabilize the world ’s biggest banks amid more than half a trillion dollars in losses and dire predictions from George Soros and others of another trillion or two still to come .
So what ?
Carping at CEO perks is a far easier pursuit .
Most of our regulators and politicians know almost nothing about how to fix this financial collapse , yet all of them can tsk-tsk and fingerwag about a million - dollar office redo .
( Never mind that it amounts to one - millionth of a trillion - dollar crisis . )
Go ahead , New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , we dare ya : Subpoena Vikram Pandit ’s designer on your way to running for governor .
Let ’s admit up front that Thain ’s office upgrade , initiated in January 2008 before the worst of the meltdown had begun , is in especially poor taste given the $ 45 billion in taxpayer funding that has been pumped into Merrill ’s new owner , B of A , in recent months .
“ Optics is very important , ” says an executive at one large rival bank .
“ They ’re beating up on ( Thain ) too much , but unless the carpet is peeling up , this is n’t the time to be redecorating . ”
He adds : “ In a world of quick sound bites , you just have to be so careful .
If it takes you four sentences to explain , you ’re not gonna win . ”
Trouble is , sexy sound bites can truncate the truth and leave out mitigating factors .
That $ 1.2 million for Thain ’s office amounts to the revenue that Merrill collects in 10 minutes ( based on doing business 365 days a year , 24 hours a day ) .
And the guy now says he will repay B of A .
I just hope he takes all that pricey carpeting and fancy furniture with him when he leaves .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
One morning a couple of months ago at Westchester Medical Center , Dawn Verdick gave Daniel Flood one of her kidneys .
Daniel Flood received a kidney from Dawn Verdick .
They were brought together through Craigslist .
Verdick and Flood were not friends or family .
In fact , they were total strangers from the East and West coasts .
But that 's not the most unusual aspect of this case .
The patient and donor were brought together after Flood 's three daughters placed an ad on Craigslist , the online classifieds site that offers everything from autos to real estate and guitar lessons to massage .
" Please help us , my dad needs a kidney ! " began their posting in the site 's volunteer section .
Watch more on the Craigslist - kidney connection »
" It was a shot in the dark , but it had worked for everything else , " Jennifer Flood said .
After years of untreated high blood pressure , Flood 's levels of creatinine had risen , indicating damage to the kidney .
The bean - shaped , fist - sized organs process blood to sift out waste products and extra water .
More than 15 million Americans have some degree of kidney disease , according to estimates .
Flood 's doctor told him he needed a transplant or dialysis .
Both options have pros and cons .
Dialysis can be hard on the heart and takes up time several days a week .
Making Flood 's situation more difficult was the fact that the retired 68 - year - old life insurance salesman was born with only one kidney .
In addition , Flood 's rare O - negative blood type made the odds even tougher .
None of Flood 's daughters , or his immediate family , was a match .
Jennifer and sisters Cynthia and Heather , all in their early 30s , vowed to find their father a living donor .
" We knew that the waiting list was two to six years .
And we knew how dialysis takes a toll on your body , and we knew we had to save Dad . ''
About three - quarters of kidney transplants are between family members , and the rest are among friends and acquaintances , according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , a not - for - profit organization that manages the nation 's transplant system .
Nearly 75,000 Americans were waiting for a kidney by the end of 2007 , according to the organization .
Just over 16,000 on the wait list received one , about 6,000 of them from living donors .
Although the number of kidney donors has grown since 1998 , the wait list has doubled as the incidence of diabetes , a leading cause of kidney disease , rises to crisis levels .
A kidney from a deceased donor is far more likely to be rejected than one from a living donor and may not hold up for the recipient 's lifetime .
" Kidneys from living donors last , on average , 25 years while kidneys from cadavers last an average of 10 years , because kidneys from living donors are usually in better shape , '' said Dr. Jonathan Lazare , a urologist with the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York .

The Floods received more than 100 responses to the Craigslist ad .
Many sounded genuinely interested in helping , but others sought to sell a kidney , which is illegal in the United States .
One encounter with a young man from the Washington area was especially disheartening .
The man traveled to the Floods ' home in Pleasantville , New York , just outside New York City , and even stayed with them a few days .
Soon after , he e-mailed Jennifer Flood to say he had only wanted to see the city .
Internet appeals for organ donations raise a number of questions of fairness , one medical ethicist said .
" Ideally , organs should be fairly allocated on basis of medical need and time on the waiting list , " said Dr. Kenneth Prager , director of clinical ethics and chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee at New York Presbyterian Hospital .
" Solicitations undermine the concept of a level playing field . "
But , he added , " we are a country with free speech .
There is nothing illegal in advertising or in using the Web for personal or health reasons .
Altruistic organ donors have the legal right to designate recipients . "
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Kidney transplant
And he sees a potential benefit from the Internet .
" An important argument supporting the solicitation of donors through advertising is that many such altruistic unrelated donors would never have given their organs without being moved by the personal stories of the patients on the Web , " Prager said .
" As such , patients who solicit such donors do not do so at the expense of others on the list .
By expanding the population of organ donors , Web sites such as matchingdonors.com or Craigslist can benefit the population of those in need of organs as a whole . "
For the Flood family , the breakthrough came when Verdick , who lives in Monterey , California , went on Craigslist for the first time to look for a volunteer project when a close friend died .
" I did n't set out to donate a kidney , '' said Verdick , 48 , the founder of a not - for - profit educational organization .
The ad initially caught her attention because it mentioned her blood type .
" I turned it over to the universe early on .
And I just said , ' If it 's meant to be , then I will qualify , and if it's not , I won't . ' ''
Verdick was such a strong match that doctors said it was as if she and Flood were close relatives .
As part of the screening process , Verdick underwent two psychological evaluations .
One question asked how she would react if she were to donate and later have kidney failure .
'" What if I 'm hit by a bus tomorrow ? " she responded .
" There 's a lot of ' what ifs . '
I do n't live in ' what if . '
I live in the ' what is . ' "
The experience has brought profound renewal to Daniel Flood .
After feeling tired and having a symptomatic gray skin tone for so many years , he says , his complexion has turned ruddy again , and he feels more energetic .
He takes 14 medications every day , including three anti-rejection drugs .
For a while he wo n't be allowed to shake hands or hug anyone because of the risk of infection , or to lift more than 10 pounds .
But for now , the numbers are on his side .
The five - year survival rate for kidney recipients from a living donor is about 90 percent , versus an 80 percent chance for people who receive from a cadaver , according to the organ - sharing organization .
" Every day is a fresh start for me .
It 's a whole new awakening , a whole new beginning , '' said Flood , who looks forward to playing golf again and spending more time with his wife , children and 3 - year - old granddaughter .
Flood 's daughters are now making it their mission to give back .
They launched the Flood Sisters Kidney Foundation of America at www.floodsisters.org, which has about 20 members , to bring potential living kidney donors together with people who need them .
And come December , Verdick and the Flood family are marking their calendars for dinner , to celebrate their special " anniversary . ''

The .NET technologies feature is not available to the users who have Linux as their platform .
A Windows hosting plan needs to be chosen if you own a website based on the Microsoft .
NET plan of hosting .
But remember , if you go for an ASP without the .NET technology , then the Linux people will offer little support for it .
Only a Windows hosting plan can support Access databases .
Being a Microsoft product , Access cannot run on a Linux operating system , but only on Windows operating systems .
A unique database put forward by Microsoft is MSSQL .
If you are in need of enterprise - level database software , some options are available which run on Linux as well , but a Windows hosting plan will be the only resort if you consider Microsoft 's unique MSSQL database .
Another area where Windows hosting plan will become indispensable is if you use the Sharepoint features of Microsoft Frontpage 2003 .
Hey guys why are you making things complicated ?
Simply stated Windows hosting is nothing but an NT - based web hosting tool .
A windows dedicated server works exclusively on Windows operating system .
Windows operating system like Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP has all the internet explorer browsers pre-configured for the execution of ASP [ active server page ] commands .
ASP .NET : Enabling on dedicated server
First , you want to set the service “ ASP.
NET State Service ” to automatic .
Second , you need to disable remote machines from connecting to your server and using it for State service .
You need to go into the registry and turn the bit flag for Remote Connections to false .
Here is the registry key :
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServic esaspnet_stateParametersAllowRemoteConnection
Now you should be ready to start using ASP .
NET State Service .
In this kind of web hosting , we choose an operating system which works basically on the window system .
The simplicity of the Windows XP operating system is what stands out with these applications .
Windows provides its users with friendly , familiar environment that is easy to work with .
Windows or XP platform is scalable and very cost - effective because at a relatively low price you can set up a fully functional Internet server with Windows XP in a matter of hours .
Interactive websites usually rely on ASP , PHP , or Perl ( Practical Extraction and Reporting Language which is a scripting language used to receive and process data stored on web page forms ) .
You prefer ASP most of all Windows / XP – based web hosting is the perfect choice for you .
There are also some more only Windows available applications such as Access , MS SQL , Windows Media and Virtual Basic scripts .
Seattle startup Melodeo has just released a $ 3 iPhone app that gives its users access to the entire back catalog of The Presidents of the United States of America .
That means all four albums as well as " rare , exclusive material , " all of which can be updated from the server side .
Why this particular group ?
Well , because one of Melodeo's VPs is none other than Dave Dederer , the founder of PUSA .
The former frontman told Wired 's Epicenter that the iPhone app store offers an opportunity to pimp music before it gets released to the mainstream , an alternative to " paying tens or or hundreds of thousands of dollars ... to get the album in heavy rotation on the radio . "
Dederer also said that integration with the iTunes Store is an advantage as well — the application only lets you stream the music , so it can provide a link to pre-order the album .
If Dederer is right , this model could indeed represent a serious shift in the way that new music hits the streets .
This is n't the first band to offer an iPhone application for listening to their music : indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie has a similar program available in the App Store , though it only features a selection of the band 's work .
I wonder if maybe entire record labels will collaborate to offer up a sampler of upcoming bands .
Hell , I 'd def pay a few bucks to check out the newest releases of say , Matador Records .
Whales beached on British shores will be humanely killed as soon as possible after they are found , under new official guidelines .
Scientists and conservationists say recent research shows that trying to return stranded whales to their ocean habitats was impractical in the UK and that any attempts to do so merely prolonged the suffering of the animals .
The Marine Animal Rescue Coalition , which includes the RSPCA and is responsible for handling stranded marine animals , worked with scientists from the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) on the new policy , announced today .
It states that stranded whales should be put down by a lethal injection of an opiate unless there were clear reasons not to do so .
The policy would apply to deep - sea creatures such as beaked and sperm whales but not to dolphins or porpoises , which are also sometimes found stranded on UK shores .
" We now have a clear direction for those who respond to the strandings , " said Tony Woodley of the RSPCA .
" The presumption will be euthanasia unless the animal can be refloated in a very short period of time into oceanic - depth water , which is extremely unlikely in the British Isles because of the logistics of getting animals to those waters in that time period . "
Paul Jepson of ZSL , who has led much of the research on stranded marine animals in recent years , said : " Between 2002 and 2006 , there were 30 sperm whales and 24 beaked whales reported stranded in the UK and none of them survived . "
Marine animals can become stranded for several reasons , including the effects of disease or pollution or as a result of trauma from collisions with boats or other animals .
Once onshore , their bodies undergo rapid deterioration .
Recent research on blood samples taken from stranded whales , including the famous beaked whale that swam into the Thames in January 2006 , all point to the same causes of death : dehydration and irreparable muscle and kidney damage .
Deep - sea marine animals such as beak or sperm whales use an oxygen - carrying protein called myoglobin in their muscles to carry much of the oxygen they need to swim deep in the sea .
When they are stranded on land , their dense muscles become compressed under their own weight .
The cells die and release the myoglobin into the bloodstream , which is toxic for the kidneys .
Stranded whales were also found to be dehydrated because their only source of water is the food they eat .
When the whales get lost in the North Sea or other relatively shallow waters , they cannot find anything to eat .
" They become so weak with dehydration , they strand and a whole cascade of physiological compromises begins , " said Jepson .
Because of this rapid deterioration , which can happen within hours and become irreversible well before the stranded whales could be moved back into deep waters , scientists have concluded that it is virtually impossible to save the creatures .
Dolphins and porpoises deteriorate more slowly , and live in much shallower waters , so refloating them is often easy .
" We like to base good policy on science and this is one example where the science shows us that the animals , when they strand , are severely compromised , " said Adam Grogan of the RSPCA .
He said the lack of recent strandings made it a good time to announce the change in policy because emotions tended to run high when the whales were in trouble .
" It 's only fair to tell everybody that in the future it 's very likely that , to put it out of its suffering , euthanasia is likely to be the most likely option . "
Embedded System Design Issues
( the Rest of the Story )

ABSTRACT
Many embedded systems have substantially different design constraints than desktop computing applications .
No single characterization applies to the diverse spectrum of embedded systems .
However , some combination of cost pressure , long life - cycle , real - time requirements , reliability requirements , and design culture dysfunction can make it difficult to be successful applying traditional computer design methodologies and tools to embedded applications .
Embedded systems in many cases must be optimized for life - cycle and business - driven factors rather than for maximum computing throughput .
There is currently little tool support for expanding embedded computer design to the scope of holistic embedded system design .
However , knowing the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches can set expectations appropriately , identify risk areas to tool adopters , and suggest ways in which tool builders can meet industrial needs .
CONTENTS
1. Introduction
Approximately 3 billion embedded CPUs are sold each year , with smaller ( 4- , 8 - , and 16 - bit ) CPUs dominating by quantity and aggregate dollar amount [ 1 ] .
Yet , most research and tool development seems to be focussed on the needs of high - end desktop and military / aerospace embedded computing .
This paper seeks to expand the area of discussion to encompass a wide range of embedded systems .
The extreme diversity of embedded applications makes generalizations difficult .
Nonetheless , there is emerging interest in the entire range of embedded systems ( e.g. , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] ) and the related field of hardware / software codesign ( e.g. , [ 7 ] ) .
This paper and the accompanying tutorial seek to identify significant areas in which embedded computer design differs from more traditional desktop computer design .
They also present " design challenges " encountered in the course of designing several real systems .
These challenges are both opportunities to improve methodology and tool support as well as impediments to deploying such support to embedded system design teams .
In some cases research and development has already begun in these areas -- and in other cases it has not .
The observations in this paper come from the author 's experience with commercial as well as military applications , development methodologies , and life - cycle support .
All characterizations are implicitly qualified to indicate a typical , representative , or perhaps simply an anecdotal case rather than a definitive statement about all embedded systems .
While it is understood that each embedded system has its own set of unique requirements , it is hoped that the generalizations and examples presented here will provide a broad - brush basis for discussion and evolution of CAD tools and design methodologies .
2. Example Embedded Systems
Figure 1 shows one possible organization for an embedded system .
Figure 1 .
An embedded system encompasses the CPU as well as many other resources .
In addition to the CPU and memory hierarchy , there are a variety of interfaces that enable the system to measure , manipulate , and otherwise interact with the external environment .
Some differences with desktop computing may be :
The human interface may be as simple as a flashing light or as complicated as real - time robotic vision .
The diagnostic port may be used for diagnosing the system that is being controlled -- not just for diagnosing the computer .
Special - purpose field programmable ( FPGA ) , application specific ( ASIC ) , or even non-digital hardware may be used to increase performance or safety .
Software often has a fixed function , and is specific to the application .
In addition to the emphasis on interaction with the external world , embedded systems also provide functionality specific to their applications .
Instead of executing spreadsheets , word processing and engineering analysis , embedded systems typically execute control laws , finite state machines , and signal processing algorithms .
They must often detect and react to faults in both the computing and surrounding electromechanical systems , and must manipulate application - specific user interface devices .
Table 1 .
Four example embedded systems with approximate attributes .
In order to make the discussion more concrete , we shall discuss four example systems ( Table 1 ) .
Each example portrays a real system in current production , but has been slightly genericized to represent a broader cross-section of applications as well as protect proprietary interests .
The four examples are a Signal Processing system , a Mission Critical control system , a Distributed control system , and a Small consumer electronic system .
The Signal Processing and Mission Critical systems are representative of traditional military / aerospace embedded systems , but in fact are becoming more applicable to general commercial applications over time .
Using these four examples to illustrate points , the following sections describe the different areas of concern for embedded system design : computer design , system - level design , life - cycle support , business model support , and design culture adaptation .
Desktop computing design methodology and tool support is to a large degree concerned with initial design of the digital system itself .
To be sure , experienced designers are cognizant of other aspects , but with the recent emphasis on quantitative design ( e.g. , [ 8 ] ) life - cycle issues that are n't readily quantified could be left out of the optimization process .
However , such an approach is insufficient to create embedded systems that can effectively compete in the marketplace .
This is because in many cases the issue is not whether design of an immensely complex system is feasible , but rather whether a relatively modest system can be highly optimized for life - cycle cost and effectiveness .
While traditional digital design CAD tools can make a computer designer more efficient , they may not deal with the central issue -- embedded design is about the system , not about the computer .
In desktop computing , design often focuses on building the fastest CPU , then supporting it as required for maximum computing speed .
In embedded systems the combination of the external interfaces ( sensors , actuators ) and the control or sequencing algorithms is or primary importance .
The CPU simply exists as a way to implement those functions .
The following experiment should serve to illustrate this point : ask a roomful of people what kind of CPU is in the personal computer or workstation they use .
Then ask the same people which CPU is used for the engine controller in their car ( and whether the CPU type influenced the purchasing decision ) .
In high - end embedded systems , the tools used for desktop computer design are invaluable .
However , many embedded systems both large and small must meet additional requirements that are beyond the scope of what is typically handled by design automation .
These additional needs fall into the categories of special computer design requirements , system - level requirements , life - cycle support issues , business model compatibility , and design culture issues .
3. Computer Design Requirements
Embedded computers typically have tight constraints on both functionality and implementation .
In particular , they must guarantee real time operation reactive to external events , conform to size and weight limits , budget power and cooling consumption , satisfy safety and reliability requirements , and meet tight cost targets .
3.1 . Real time / reactive operation
Real time system operation means that the correctness of a computation depends , in part , on the time at which it is delivered .
In many cases the system design must take into account worst case performance .
Predicting the worst case may be difficult on complicated architectures , leading to overly pessimistic estimates erring on the side of caution .
The Signal Processing and Mission Critical example systems have a significant requirement for real time operation in order to meet external I/O and control stability requirements .
Reactive computation means that the software executes in response to external events .
These events may be periodic , in which case scheduling of events to guarantee performance may be possible .
On the other hand , many events may be aperiodic , in which case the maximum event arrival rate must be estimated in order to accommodate worst case situations .
Most embedded systems have a significant reactive component .
Design challenge :
Worst case design analyses without undue pessimism in the face of hardware with statistical performance characteristics ( e.g. , cache memory [ 9 ] ) .
3.2 . Small size , low weight
Many embedded computers are physically located within some larger artifact .
Therefore , their form factor may be dictated by aesthetics , form factors existing in pre-electronic versions , or having to fit into interstices among mechanical components .
In transportation and portable systems , weight may be critical for fuel economy or human endurance .
Among the examples , the Mission Critical system has much more stringent size and weight requirements than the others because of its use in a flight vehicle , although all examples have restrictions of this type .
Design challenges :
Non-rectangular , non-planar geometries .
Packaging and integration of digital , analog , and power circuits to reduce size .
3.3 . Safe and reliable
Some systems have obvious risks associated with failure .
In mission - critical applications such as aircraft flight control , severe personal injury or equipment damage could result from a failure of the embedded computer .
Traditionally , such systems have employed multiply - redundant computers or distributed consensus protocols in order to ensure continued operation after an equipment failure ( e.g. , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] )
However , many embedded systems that could cause personal or property damage cannot tolerate the added cost of redundancy in hardware or processing capacity needed for traditional fault tolerance techniques .
This vulnerability is often resolved at the system level as discussed later .
Design challenge :
Low - cost reliability with minimal redundancy .
3.4 . Harsh environment
Many embedded systems do not operate in a controlled environment .
Excessive heat is often a problem , especially in applications involving combustion ( e.g. , many transportation applications ) .
Additional problems can be caused for embedded computing by a need for protection from vibration , shock , lightning , power supply fluctuations , water , corrosion , fire , and general physical abuse .
For example , in the Mission Critical example application the computer must function for a guaranteed , but brief , period of time even under non-survivable fire conditions .
Design challenges :
Accurate thermal modelling .
De-rating components differently for each design , depending on operating environment .
3.5 . Cost sensitivity
Even though embedded computers have stringent requirements , cost is almost always an issue ( even increasingly for military systems ) .
Although designers of systems large and small may talk about the importance of cost with equal urgency , their sensitivity to cost changes can vary dramatically .
A reason for this may be that the effect of computer costs on profitability is more a function of the proportion of cost changes compared to the total system cost , rather than compared to the digital electronics cost alone .
For example , in the Signal Processing system cost sensitivity can be estimated at approximately $ 1000 ( i.e. , a designer can make decisions at the $ 1000 level without undue management scrutiny ) .
However , with in the Small system decisions increasing costs by even a few cents attract management attention due to the huge multiplier of production quantity combined with the higher percentage of total system cost it represents .
Design challenge :
Variable " design margin " to permit tradeoff between product robustness and aggressive cost optimization .
4. System - level requirements
In order to be competitive in the marketplace , embedded systems require that the designers take into account the entire system when making design decisions .
4.1 . End-product utility
The utility of the end product is the goal when designing an embedded system , not the capability of the embedded computer itself .
Embedded products are typically sold on the basis of capabilities , features , and system cost rather than which CPU is used in them or cost / performance of that CPU .
One way of looking at an embedded system is that the mechanisms and their associated I/O are largely defined by the application .
Then , software is used to coordinate the mechanisms and define their functionality , often at the level of control system equations or finite state machines .
Finally , computer hardware is made available as infrastructure to execute the software and interface it to the external world .
While this may not be an exciting way for a hardware engineer to look at things , it does emphasize that the total functionality delivered by the system is what is paramount .
Design challenge :
Software - and I /O - driven hardware synthesis ( as opposed to hardware - driven software compilation / synthesis ) .
4.2 . System safety & reliability
An earlier section discussed the safety and reliability of the computing hardware itself .
But , it is the safety and reliability of the total embedded system that really matters .
The Distributed system example is mission critical , but does not employ computer redundancy .
Instead , mechanical safety backups are activated when the computer system loses control in order to safely shut down system operation .
A bigger and more difficult issue at the system level is software safety and reliability .
While software does n't normally " break " in the sense of hardware , it may be so complex that a set of unexpected circumstances can cause software failures leading to unsafe situations .
This is a difficult problem that will take many years to address , and may not be properly appreciated by non-computer engineers and managers involved in system design decisions ( [ 12 ] discusses the role of computers in system safety ) .
Design challenges :
Reliable software .
Cheap , available systems using unreliable components .
Electronic vs. non-electronic design tradeoffs .
4.3 . Controlling physical systems
The usual reason for embedding a computer is to interact with the environment , often by monitoring and controlling external machinery .
In order to do this , analog inputs and outputs must be transformed to and from digital signal levels .
Additionally , significant current loads may need to be switched in order to operate motors , light fixtures , and other actuators .
All these requirements can lead to a large computer circuit board dominated by non-digital components .
In some systems " smart " sensors and actuators ( that contain their own analog interfaces , power switches , and small CPUS ) may be used to off - load interface hardware from the central embedded computer .
This brings the additional advantage of reducing the amount of system wiring and number of connector contacts by employing an embedded network rather than a bundle of analog wires .
However , this change brings with it an additional computer design problem of partitioning the computations among distributed computers in the face of an inexpensive network with modest bandwidth capabilities .
Design challenge :
Distributed system tradeoffs among analog , power , mechanical , network , and digital hardware plus software .
4.4 . Power management
A less pervasive system - level issue , but one that is still common , is a need for power management to either minimize heat production or conserve battery power .
While the push to laptop computing has produced " low - power " variants of popular CPUs , significantly lower power is needed in order to run from inexpensive batteries for 30 days in some applications , and up to 5 years in others .
Design challenge :
Ultra -low power design for long - term battery operation .
5. Life - cycle support
Figure 2 shows one view of a product life - cycle ( a simplified version of the view taken by [ 13 ] ) .
Figure 2 .
An embedded system lifecycle .
First a need or opportunity to deploy new technology is identified .
Then a product concept is developed .
This is followed by concurrent product and manufacturing process design , production , and deployment .
But in many embedded systems , the designer must see past deployment and take into account support , maintenance , upgrades , and system retirement issues in order to actually create a profitable design .
Some of the issues affecting this life - cycle profitability are discussed below .
5.1 . Component acquisition
Because an embedded system may be more application - driven than a typical technology - driven desktop computer design , there may be more leeway in component selection .
Thus , component acquisition costs can be taken into account when optimizing system life - cycle cost .
For example , the cost of a component generally decreases with quantity , so design decisions for multiple designs should be coordinated to share common components to the benefit of all .
Design challenge :
Life - cycle , cross - design component cost models and optimization rather than simple per-unit cost .
5.2 . System certification
Embedded computers can affect the safety as well as the performance the system .
Therefore , rigorous qualification procedures are necessary in some systems after any design change in order to assess and reduce the risk of malfunction or unanticipated system failure .
This additional cost can negate any savings that might have otherwise been realized by a design improvement in the embedded computer or its software .
This point in particular hinders use of new technology by resynthesizing hardware components -- the redesigned components cannot be used without incurring the cost of system recertification .
One strategy to minimize the cost of system recertification is to delay all design changes until major system upgrades occur .
As distributed embedded systems come into more widespread use , another likely strategy is to partition the system in such a way as to minimize the number of subsystems that need to be recertified when changes occur .
This is a partitioning problem affected by potential design changes , technology insertion strategies , and regulatory requirements .
Design challenge :
Partitioning / synthesis to minimize recertification costs .
5.3 . Logistics and repair
Whenever an embedded computer design is created or changed , it affects the downstream maintenance of the product .
A failure of the computer can cause the entire system to be unusable until the computer is repaired .
In many cases embedded systems must be repairable in a few minutes to a few hours , which implies that spare components and maintenance personnel must be located close to the system .
A fast repair time may also imply that extensive diagnosis and data collection capabilities must be built into the system , which may be at odds with keeping production costs low .
Because of the long system lifetimes of many embedded systems , proliferation of design variations can cause significant logistics expenses .
For example , if a component design is changed it can force changes in spare component inventory , maintenance test equipment , maintenance procedures , and maintenance training .
Furthermore , each design change should be tested for compatibility with various system configurations , and accommodated by the configuration management database .
Design challenge :
Designs optimized to minimize spares inventory .
High - coverage diagnosis and self - test at system level , not just digital component level .
5.4 . Upgrades
Because of the long life of many embedded systems , upgrades to electronic components and software may be used to update functionality and extend the life of the embedded system with respect to competing with replacement equipment .
While it may often be the case that an electronics upgrade involves completely replacing circuit boards , it is important to realize that the rest of the system will remain unchanged .
Therefore , any special behaviors , interfaces , and undocumented features must be taken into account when performing the upgrade .
Also , upgrades may be subject to recertification requirements .
Of special concern is software in an upgraded system .
Legacy software may not be executable on upgraded replacement hardware , and may not be readily cross-compiled to the new target CPU .
Even worse , timing behavior is likely to be different on newer hardware , but may be both undocumented and critical to system operation .
Design challenge :
Ensuring complete interface , timing , and functionality compatibility when upgrading designs .
5.5 . Long - term component availability
When embedded systems are more than a few years old , some electronic components may no longer be available for production of new equipment or replacements .
This problem can be especially troublesome with obsolete processors and small - sized dynamic memory chips .
When a product does reach a point at which spare components are no longer economically available , the entire embedded computer must sometimes be redesigned or upgraded .
This redesign might need to take place even if the system is no longer in production , depending on the availability of a replacement system .
This problem is a significant concern on the Distributed example system .
Design challenge :
Cost - effectively update old designs to incorporate new components .
6. Business model
The business models under which embedded systems are developed can vary as widely as the applications themselves .
Costs , cycle time , and the role of product families are all crucial business issues that affect design decisions .
6.1 . Design vs. production costs
Design costs , also called Non-Recurring Engineering costs ( NRE ) , are of major importance when few of a particular embedded system are being built .
Conversely , production costs are important in high - volume production .
Embedded systems vary from single units to millions of units , and so span the range of tradeoffs between design versus production costs .
At the low - volume end of the spectrum , CAD tools can help designers complete their work with a minimum of effort .
However , at the high - volume end of the spectrum the designs may be simple enough and engineering cost such a small fraction of total system cost that extensive hand - optimization is performed in order to reduce production costs .
CAD tools may be able to outperform an average engineer at all times , and a superior engineer on very large designs ( because of the limits of human capacity to deal with complexity and repetition ) .
However , in small designs some embedded computer designers believe that a superior human engineer can outperform CAD tools .
In the Small system example a programmer squeezed software into a few hundred bytes of memory by hand when the compiler produced overly large output that needed more memory than was available .
It can readily be debated whether CAD tools or humans are " better " designers , but CAD tools face skepticism in areas that require extraordinary optimization for size , performance , or cost .
Design challenge :
Intelligently trade off design time versus production cost .
6.2 . Cycle time
The cycle time between identification of a product opportunity and product deployment ( also called Time to Market ) can be quite long for embedded systems .
In many cases the electronics are not the driving force ; instead , product schedules are driven by concerns such as tooling for mechanical components and manufacturing process design .
Superficially , this would seem to imply that design time for the electronics is not an overriding concern , but this is only partially true .
Because the computer system may have the most malleable design , it may absorb the brunt of changes .
For example , redesign of hardware was required on the Mission Critical example system when it was found that additional sensors and actuators were needed to meet system performance goals .
On the Small example system , delays in making masked ROM changes in order to revise software dominate concerns about modifications ( and programmable memory is too expensive ) .
So , although the initial design is often not in the critical path to product deployment , redesign of the computer system may need to be done quickly to resolve problems .
Design challenge :
Rapid redesign to accommodate changing form factors , control algorithms , and functionality requirements .
6.3 . Product families
In many cases embedded system designs are not unique , and there are a variety of systems of various prices and capabilities forming a product family .
To the extent that system designers can reuse components , they lower the total cost of all systems in the product family .
However , there is a dynamic tension between overly general solutions that satisfy a large number of niche requirements , and specifically optimized designs for each point in a product family space .
Also , there may be cases in which contradictory requirements between similar systems prevent the use of a single subsystem design .
In the Mission Critical and Small examples different customers require different interfaces between the embedded system and their equipment .
In the Distributed example regulatory agencies impose different safety - critical behavior requirements depending on the geographic area in which the system is deployed .
Design challenge :
Customize designs while minimizing component variant proliferation .
7. Design culture
Design is a social activity as well as a technical activity .
The design of desktop computers , and CPUs in particular , has matured in terms of becoming more quantitative in recent years .
With this new maturity has come an emphasis on simulation and CAD tools to provide engineering tradeoffs based on accurate performance and cost predictions .
Computer designers venturing into the embedded arena must realize that their culture ( and the underlying tool infrastructure ) are unlike what is commonly practiced in some other engineering disciplines .
But , because embedded system design requires a confluence of engineering skills , successful computer designers and design methodologies must find a harmonious compromise with the techniques and methodologies of other disciplines as well as company management .
Also , in many cases the engineers building embedded computer systems are not actually trained in computer engineering ( or , perhaps not even electrical engineering ) , and so are not attuned to the culture and methodologies of desktop computer design .
7.1 . Computer culture vs. other cultures
A specific problem is that computer design tools have progressed to the point that many believe it is more cost - effective to do extensive simulation than build successive prototypes .
However , in the mechanical arena much existing practice strongly favors prototyping with less exhaustive up - front analysis .
Thus , it may be difficult to convince project managers ( who may be application area specialists rather than computer specialists ) to spend limited capital budgets on CAD tools and defer the gratification of early prototype development in favor of simulation .
Design challenge :
Make simulation - based computer design accessible to non-specialists .
7.2 . Accounting for cost of engineering design
One area of common concern is the effectiveness of using engineers in any design discipline .
But , some computer design CAD tools are very expensive , and in general organizations have difficulty trading off capital and tool costs against engineering time .
This means that computer designers may be deprived of CAD tools that would reduce the total cost of designing a system .
Also , in high - volume applications engineering costs can be relatively small when compared to production costs .
Often , the number of engineers is fixed , and book - kept as a constant expense that is decoupled from the profitability of any particular system design , as is the case in all four example systems .
This can be referred to as the " Engineers Are Free " syndrome .
But , while the cost of engineering time may have a small impact on product costs , the unavailability of enough engineers to do work on all the products being designed can have a significant opportunity cost ( which is , in general , unmeasured ) .
Design challenge :
Improved productivity via using tools and methodologies may be better received by managers if it is perceived to increase the number of products that can be designed , rather than merely the efficiency of engineers on any given product design effort .
This is a subtle but , in practice , important distinction .
7.3 . Inertia
In general , the cost of change in an organization is high both in terms of money and organizational disruption .
The computer industry can be thought of as being forced to change by inexorable exponential growth in hardware capabilities .
However , the impact of this growth seems to have been delayed in embedded system development .
In part this is because of the long time that elapses between new technology introduction and wide - scale use in inexpensive systems .
Thus , it may simply be that complex designs will force updated CAD tools and design methodologies to be adopted for embedded systems in the near future .
On the other hand , the latest computer design technologies may not have been adopted by many embedded system makers because they are n't necessary .
Tool development that concentrates on the ability to handle millions of transistors may simply not be relevant to designers of systems using 4 - and 8 - bit microprocessors that constitute the bulk of the embedded CPU market .
And , even if they are useful , the need for them may not be compelling enough to justify the pain and up - front expense of change so long as older techniques work .
That is not to say that new tools are n't needed , but rather that the force of cultural inertia will only permit adoption of low - cost tools with significant advantages to the problem at hand .
Design challenge :
Find / create design tools and methodologies that provide unique , compelling advantages for embedded design .
8. Conclusions
Many embedded systems have requirements that differ significantly both in details and in scope from desktop computers .
In particular , the demands of the specific application and the interface with external equipment may dominate the system design .
Also , long life - cycles and in some cases extreme cost sensitivity require more attention to optimization based on these goals rather than maximizing the computational throughput .
The business and cultural climates in many embedded system design situations are such that traditional simulation - based computer design techniques may not be viable in their current form .
Such methodologies may not be cost - effective given constraints on categories of expenditures , may not be seen as worthwhile by non-computer - trained professionals , or may simply be solving the wrong problems .
Recent interest in hardware / software codesign is a step in the right direction , as it permits tradeoffs between hardware and software that are critical for more cost - effective embedded systems .
However , to be successful future tools may well need to increase scope even further to include life - cycle issues and business issues .

WASHINGTON -U.S. President - elect Barack Obama has asked retired Air Force Maj. Gen. ScottGration , one of his top foreign policy and military advisers during hiscampaign , to take the helm of NASA , according to a source informed of theselection .
Anannouncement is expected as soon as Wednesday .
he would be the first NASA administrator in history to be announced before the inauguration of an incoming president .
Gration , adecorated fighter pilot who held senior policy positions in the military priorto his retirement , is a virtual unknown to the space community , but has someexperience with NASA .
In 1982 , as a captain and fighter pilot instructorrecently returned from Kenya , Gration spent a year as a White House Fellowworking for NASA 's deputy administrator at the time , Hans Mark .
Gration ' slack of space experience should not preclude him from being qualifiedfor the job , said John Logsdon , a space policy expert here .
" There are lots of NASA administrators who have come from other areaswithout a background in space , " he said .
" You want a guy who is aleader and can managea large organization . "
Asa pilot Gration logged more than 1,000 hours of combat missions , according tothe Air Force 's Web site .
He retired from active duty in October 2006 .
He wenton to campaign for Obama alongside former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig andretired Gen. Merrill McPeak , former Air Force chief of staff , as part of Obama 's national security policy working group .
Gration ledthe retired generals tribute during the National Democratic Convention inAugust , telling the audience he is a former Republican who met then - Sen .
Obamain 2005 while serving as director of strategy , plans and policy at U.S.European Command .
" That 'swhen I met a leader unlike any I had met before , " he said .
" He askedtough questions , and he did n't settle for easy answers .
It was this same way ofthinking that led him to get it right , when he opposed the war in Iraq , when hewarned of its consequences .
That 's the judgment of a leader . "
After theirmeeting in 2005 , Gration accompanied Obama on a five - nation , 15 - day tour of Africa in 2006 .
Gration , the son of missionary parents , spent part of his childhood in the Congo andspeaks Swahili fluently , according to a Newsweek article published in August2007 .
He joined the Air Force in 1974 through the Air Force Reserve OfficerTraining Corps at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , N.J. , where he earned abachelor 's degree in mechanical engineering .
He earned a master 's degree innational security studies from Georgetown University in Washington in 1988 .
Crooks set cyber traps on Digg : security firm Agence France - Presse
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This SAN FRANCISCO ( AFP ) - PandaLabs , a computer security firm , is reporting that cyber - crooks are setting traps on popular news - sharing website Digg .
Criminals pose as legitimate Digg members and then entice readers with bogus links to scintillating online video in comments posted in forums related to celebrity news , according to the Spain - based firm .
Digg is a website at which stories from throughout the Internet are gathered and then given prominence depending on votes , or " diggs , " they get from website members .
Digg members chat about stories in accompanying online forums .
PandaLabs said cyber - frauds post comments claiming to have links to video of starlets having sex or stars getting into trouble .
Those that follow such links are prompted to download software to view the promised video .
What is actually installed is a program that pretends to scan computers for malicious software , claims to find critical problems and then offers to eliminate the supposed trouble at a price .
" To make its claims more believable , it prevents the system from operating correctly , " PandaLabs said of the malicious software ruse .
" The aim is obviously to profit from sales of this spoof security solution . "
PandaLabs said a preliminary analysis of Digg revealed more than 50 profiles that left comments to lure members into the trap .
" We are fully aware of the issue at hand and have already taken action , " Digg community manager Jen Burton said in an emailed response to an AFP inquiry .
" Malware accounts reported to us by the community are terminated immediately and all content is removed . "
Burton said Digg has terminated more than 300 accounts suspected of spreading malware .
Counter Terror Expo
A former Assistant Chief of the UK's shadowy Secret Intelligence Service ( SIS , aka MI6 ) has played down the threat of jihadi terrorism , saying that other dangers are more serious .
The ex-spy also said that global counterterrorism database plans were " unlikely ever to succeed " .
Nigel Inkster , who was an SIS officer from 1975 to 2006 and rose to be Assistant Chief and Director of Operations and Intelligence , was speaking this morning at a counterterrorism conference in London .
On the subject of international counterterrorist databases , always a hot - button issue among those concerned with privacy and individual rights , Inkster had reassuring words .
" There are limits to what we can sensibly aspire to , " he said .
" Efforts to establish a global repository of counterterrorist information are unlikely ever to succeed .
We need to be wary of rebuilding our world to deal with just one problem , one which might not be by any means the most serious we face . "
Asked what dangers were more serious than terrorism , Mr Inkster suggested that British government planners were more concerned regarding the possible results of global pandemics , or perhaps the worst - case outcomes of climate change .
" We need to keep terrorism in some kind of context , " he said .
" For example , every year in the UK , more people die in road accidents than have been killed by terrorists in all of recorded history . "
The secret - service mandarin suggested that the Global War On Terror initiated by the Bush administration could never be won .
" We can't kill or arrest our way out of this problem ... we will never solve this issue and live in a terrorism - free world .
It has to be managed . "
Inkster said that there was definitely a need for police and sometimes military action in fighting terrorism , but suggested that it was now widely acknowledged in the spook community that the Iraq invasion - and now the Israeli assault on Gaza - were definite factors in radicalisation of British domestic terrorists .
" A move away from the rhetoric of GWOT will help , " he said , saying that the " more nuanced message " of the Obama administration was already showing results .
As for recommendations , Inkster said that it was important to promote good government and economic opportunity around the world .
" If I hear one more speaker suggest that the root of terrorism is poverty I 'll probably become a terrorist myself , " he joked .
" But we have to acknowledge that it 's a factor . "
As for the West , he said : " We should keep our nerve and our faith in our own values .
Our own behaviour - especially with respect to the rule of law - is very important . "
Inkster also offered an insight into life in Her Majesty 's secret service , saying " I come from an organisation that does n't do Powerpoint culture " . ®
People who spend money on " brain trainers " to keep their minds agile may get the same results by simply doing a crossword or surfing the internet , according to research published today .
A panel of experts , including eminent neuroscientists , found there was no scientific evidence to support a range of manufacturers ' claims that the gadgets can help improve memory or stave off the risk of illnesses such as dementia .
Devices such as the Nintendo DS , endorsed by the actor Nicole Kidman and the singer Cheryl Cole , have enjoyed a surge of popularity recently .
But the experts employed by the consumer group Which ?
concluded that much of the evidence supporting the claims was " weak " and that in some cases other activities , such as playing standard computer games , could have the same effect .
Importantly , none of the " brain training " claims were supported by peer - reviewed research published in a recognised scientific journal .
Which ?
asked a panel of scientific experts to examine gadgets and their claims .
They included Dr Kawashima 's Brain Training , Mindfit and Lumosity .
Martyn Hocking , editor of Which ? , said : " If people enjoy using these games , then they should continue to do so - that 's a no-brainer .
But if people are under the illusion that these devices are scientifically proven to keep their minds in shape , they need to think again . "
Which ?
members who had written to the organisation about brain training were asked to try the products for a month .
One of the experts , Dr Adrian Owen , assistant director at the Medical Research Council 's cognition and brain sciences unit in Cambridge , said of the research involving one group :
" If they 'd been asked to play Space Invaders for a month and improved at it - as surely they would - would we have concluded this was a beneficial form of brain training ?
Probably not . "
Michael Scanlon , a neuroscientist from Lumosity , defended the company 's research standards , and said : " We would never say Lumosity is proven to improve day - to - day living , but there is more and more evidence it does .
We have actually conducted our own clinical trials to measure effectiveness of the product . "
Also under the spotlight was Mindfit , a CD - Rom endorsed by the scientist Lady Greenfield .
Two of the three studies it used to support its claims that it improved mental performance were found to be flawed .
It also claimed that " cognitively challenging " activity protects against Alzheimer's .
Bruce Robinson , chief executive of MindWeavers , which produces MindFit , said : " If you look at the wider evidence in the field the broad conclusion is that brain stimulation is working .
With the MindFit product , a study was done by an independent medical centre in Israel which supported that evidence .
We are not claiming MindFit will stop Alzheimer's . "
Nintendo said : " Nintendo does not make any claims that Brain Training is scientifically proven to improve cognitive function .
What we claim is the Brain Training series of games , like playing sudoku , are enjoyable and fun .
These exercises can also help to keep the brain sharp . "
Tried and tested
Dr Kawashima 's Brain Training ( Nintendo ) £ 110 including DS console :
Instructions say it can help consolidate memory and creativity
Which ?
No evidence that using this product will have any functional impact on your life whatsoever
Mindfit ( PC CD - ROM ) £ 88
Company claims " exercises important abilities known to decline in later life "
Which ?
Tests did n't show using it was significantly better than playing Tetris
Lumosity ( online training system ) Luminos Labs , £ 4.99 a month
Company says : " Exercises ... designed to stimlulate neuroplasticity that leads to improved cognitive ability "
Which ?
Does not mean improvements on tasks will lead to improvements in day - to - day living
Two potential prime ministers – this is what the Israeli public chose in the 2009 elections .
According to a
Ynet poll and exit polls commissioned by major TV stations , the 18th Knesset will not see a ruling party .
Therefore , all options are open .
Indeed , Tzipi Livni's Kadima edged Netanyahu's Likud , yet the rightist bloc won a clear majority .
A total of 63 - 65 mandates , according to the various exit polls , were given to the rightist and religious parties , compared to 50 - 52 granted to the center - Left camp ( not including Balad and United Arab List – Ta'al , which on the eve of the elections declared they will not endorse the parties that backed the call to disqualify them . )
Israel Votes
Ynet poll : Kadima wins ; Labor crashes Ynet Tzipi Livni big winner of 2009 elections , according to Rafi Smith poll commissioned by Ynet ; Kadima wins 28 Knesset seats , Likud comes in second with 26 , Lieberman third with 16 , Labor crashes to 14 Ynet poll : Kadima wins ; Labor crashes
Meanwhile , Netanyahu is also stuck , yet it appears his options are somewhat more diverse :
He pledged to approach Shas and Yisrael Beiteinu before he talks to any other party .
These two parties would boost his coalition by 25 mandates , yet this is n't enough .
He will have to – and he declared that he wants to – bring either Kadima or Labor into his government .
Another possibility for him is to form a rightist - religious government with the Jewish Home and National Union , and without Labor and Kadima .
One should not underestimate the decision faced by Ehud Barak .
More and more senior Labor officials are demanding that he head to the opposition instead of joining the Netanyahu or Livni government as a fifth wheel – especially in Lieberman 's presence .
In the face of its slim number of mandates , Labor would not be able to offer substantive political support for the new coalition .
One of the possibilities being discussed within the political establishment is a repeat of the 1984 scenario – a rotation between the two large parties .
Back then it was Peres and Shamir who traded places mid-way through their term in office .
This was the only Israeli government to almost complete its four - year tenure .
Netanyahu does not like the idea , and neither does Livni , yet it is possible that for the sake of stability , and in the face of the ambiguous statement made by Israeli voters , there will be no other choice .
There are two reasons to bail out a financial company .�
The first is that it ’s failure would lead to a run on liquidity at similar companies duewith those of to a lack of confidence .�
The second is that it their promises are so interlaced with those of other companies that failure would cause many other companies to fail .
For the first reason , we have the FDIC and similar institutions for deposit - takers , and the insurance guarantee funds for the insurers .�
For the second reason , the government should be minimalistic , and only guarantee the entities that threaten systemic risk .
For AIG , what should have happened back in September , and what should happen now , is that the government should have let the holding company fail , and guaranteed the obligations of AIG Financial Products in exchange for a senior loan that would subordinate all existing holding company debt . �
[ Essentially a DIP loan , because the holding company would be in Chapter 11 . ]
Aside from Financial Products , most AIG ’s subsidiaries are probably fine , and do n’t need any help . �
Those that might fail do n’t pose any systemic risks .
So , when I see AIG coming back to the government for more , I think of several things :
1 ) When Hartford Steam Boiler was sold for a cheap price , I commented that if that was the price for a good asset like HSB , then AIG common was worthless .
2 ) Why are we messing around with the holding companies as we do bailouts ?�
Regulated entities I understand .�
There is no compelling interest for the US government to own AIG holding company stock .
3 ) Let the bondholders suffer a little .�
AIG did not trade like a AAA credit , even in its glory days .�
It traded more like single - A. �
If you did n’t take the warning that the bond market was giving you as the leverage built up , then that is your fault .
4 ) Back to point 2 in a more general way .�
If the government is going to intervene , let them inject money into the regulated subsidiaries , not holding companies , and then limit dividends and transfer payments to the holding company .
5 ) If large derivative counterparties are so critical to the financial infrastructure , then they need to be regulated as well .�
Open the derivative books to the regulator , and let the new regulator set leverage / capital policy . �
What ?�
They ca n’t do as much business ?�
Too bad .
6 ) As I commented regarding the automaker bailouts , the important thing is to get your foot in the door and get some money , so that the legislators / regulators feel they must protect their initial investment with more money later . �
With AIG , that is in full force , as this could be the fourth bailout . �
When does it dawn on a bureaucrat that you have been bamboozled ?
7 ) The government was hoodwinked on the first few iterations of the bailout .�
Shame on them , if they do n’t realize that they are throwing good money after bad again .
AIG is a case in point of why I do n’t like the way we are doing bailouts now .
We bail out the holding company , which is not in the public interest .
We accept the creeping costs of bailout rather than use better - understood bankruptcy process .
It ’s obvious that the government does not understand what it is doing / buying .
We do incrementally bad deals , rather than squeezing the stakeholders , as a clever lender of last resort would .
If the US Government wants to prevent systemic risk , fine !�
Guarantee the subsidiaries that pose that risk , but let the rest go into bankruptcy .

Talk about a child getting " stuck in the middle " of two feuding parents .
William " Duke " Lewton , according to this story from Nebraska 's Omaha World - Herald , has sued his ex-wife , Dianna Divingnzzo , after she or someone on her behalf allegedly inserted an audio recorder into their 4 - year - old daughter 's teddy bear during the couple 's acrimonious custody battle .
The suit reportedly alleges that Divingnzzo or her father planted a listening device inside " Little Bear " in an effort to expose her ex's secrets .
The plan backfired , however , when the judge presiding over child custody proceedings refused to hear the recordings ....
for the person who answered first .
in recent history palestine was part of the ottoman empire .
after world war 1 the entire middle east was under british and french mandates and was being divided into countries .
syria , lebanon , jordan , iraq , even egypt got their independence after world war 1 . in 1922 when the british faced palestine the idea was to divided the land into two countries , jordan for the palestinians and israel for the jews .
jordan became an independent state in 1946 but the naighbouring arabs didnt want a jewish state in palestine .
after the founding of jordan , the arabs living in palestine demanded that instead of them migrating into jordan the rest of the british mandate will be divided into two , palestinian and israeli ... although the original idea was that jordan will be the palestinian state .
a vote was made by the united nations in which 33 voted for and 13 voted against the israeli state .
in 1948 , the day following israel proclamation of independence the arab countries attacked israel and israel conquered parts of what was inteded to be the palestinian state .
the plestinians themselves fled into gaza and the west bank .
as the war ended , the gaza strip was in egyptian control and the west bank was in jordanian control .
in the 6 day war , the arab armies were forming and building on israel 's borders readying to attack israel , israel counter attacked and managed to conquer the gaza strip , golan hights , west bank and the etire sinai paninsula .
after negotiations israel gave back the sinai paninsula to the egyptians and offered the gaza strip , but egypt didnt want the gaza strip .
israel also offered the west bank to jordan , but jordan didnt want the west bank .
none of the arab countries wanted the refugee problem on their hands , so thus israel has made its biggest mistake by leaving its army in the gaza strip and west bank .
israel ended up with the refugee problem on its hands , the palestinians were offered again a state but refused because they wanted the land they lost in war that they initiated back .
then in 2005 israel pulled out of gaza and gave the palestinians a chance to create their own state , with billions of aid money being pured into it by different nations of the world , all the while israel is providing gaza with electricity , water and gasoline .
but all the palestinian managed to do was to fight amongst themselves and smuggle weapons , making the terrorism against israel worsen .
israel had said it will negotiate with the palestinians for a state for them , but the hamas who is in control of gaza does not want to talk , its agenda is the destruction of israel and called for a jihad on israel , a jihad is a holy war equal to the crusades .
israel is now striking the hamas to desrupt their weapon smuggling and to hurt the terrorist infrastructure in gaza .
israel is saying its goal is to make southern israel safe for the israeli people .
Ruben Meerman : Nice waves !
But have you ever wondered why some people manage to catch them easily and others do n't , well there 's a science to surfing and I 'm about to meet a mathematician whose thought about just that .
G'day Neville !
Professor Neville De Mestre : G'day Ruben , how are you ?
Ruben : Pretty good .
Professor De Mestre :
How would you like a maths and science lesson ?
Ruben :
Out there ?
Professor De Mestre :
Out there .
Ruben :
You 'll need a white board wo n't you ?
Professor De Mestre :
No you wo n't need a white board just have this and let 's go .
Narration : Professor Neville De Mestre has been body surfing since he was a nipper .
He 's won ten world surf masters events and thirty Australian masters surf championships .
So if anyone knows about body surfing and wave dynamics its Professor Neville !
Like a lot of people I 've been body surfing for years .
There 's not that much to it really ... or so I thought !
Professor De Mestre : Yes Ruben here comes one , let 's go for it ...
Narration : Unlike Professor Neville I certainly have n't considered this in terms of a quantitative mathematical examination .
But it 's worth considering some simple mathematical models for catching and riding a wave .
Professor De Mestre :
That 's too early Ruben looks like it 's going to break on your head ...
Narration :
There are definitely forces at work at work here ...
Professor De Mestre : I went to university and did a science degree and became interested in research into fluid mechanic 's and so I really wanted to know why a person could actually catch a wave and ride it to the beach .
Narration :
As part of his research Neville used small - scale body surfer models , such as surfing barbie , to obtain an understanding of the physics involved .
Ruben : Right so what does this mathematics you 've been doing look like ?
Professor De Mestre :
Well the mathematics of body surfing depends on how fast the person can catch the wave and so it depends on Newton 's equations and if you remember newton equations where mass times acceleration of the body surfer , must be equal to in this case the propulsive force of the swimmer , plus the drag force due to the wave , that gives us a differential equation we can solve .
Narration : Professor Neville de Mestre is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at Bond University on the Gold Coast and I 've got a feeling this is about to get very complicated !
Professor De Mestre : Ruben this is a wave simulator machine and notice that the wave travels in this direction , what we 're interested in is what is the particle speed in the wave just at the front , just at the front here .
Now if you 're swimming in a river and swimming upstream then the drags against you , you 've got negative drag but if you 're swimming downstream and the rivers flowing faster than you can swim you 've got positive drag , that 's what we 're interested in here we want positive drag from the wave front so that you can get up to wave speed and catch the wave .
Ruben : Right so we need the assistance of that wave .
That 's great but how about those equations ?
Professor De Mestre :
Well let 's go and have a look at them .
The mass of the swimmer , times the acceleration of the swimmer equals the propulsive force of the swimmer , plus the drag .
So let 's expand on this drag force for the wave .
It 's proportional to the relative velocity squared now what 's the relative velocity , well W is the speed of the wave particles and V is the speed of the swimmer and if you square it then that gives you this expression .
This now is a differential equation .
The solution is V is equal to W minus A times something called the hyperbolic tan , it 's a very complicated mathematical expression and that involves this constant K , the time that we take off and the mass of the swimmer M .
Ruben : Hang on a minute professor !
What does all that actually mean ?
Professor De Mestre : From that we can work out whether the swimmer can actually catch the wave or not .
Ruben :
So the trick is we 've got to get our speed up to wave speed .
What kind of wave speed do we have to get up to in the ocean ?
Professor De Mestre :
The wave speed is three metres a second and swimmers like Grant Hackett and the Olympians do about two metres a second , most of us swim about one metre a second , so we 've got to increase our speed up to wave speed .
Narration :
So if you 're a newcomer struggling to catch waves , start where it 's shallow and use your legs to push off , otherwise use flippers if you 're going out into deeper water .
Now of course when you 're in the surf you 're not supposed to be thinking about a hyperbolic tan or the value of W , I 'm sure my dolphin friends do n't ... but I 'm very glad Professor Neville has !
Brussels , 19 February 2009 ( ITUC OnLine ) :
The ITUC has expressed deep concerns over the planned holding of trade union elections in Iraq in March under the legal framework inherited from the regime of Saddam Hussein , in violation of international law on freedom of association .
The elections are set to be held under “ Law 52 ” , which prohibits workers in the public sector from forming or joining unions .
In fact only six mainly private sector unions , all affiliated to the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions , will be allowed to participate .
Other affiliates of the IFTU and those affiliated to other national trade union centres are excluded .
Moreover , the three Northern Kurdish provinces will be excluded from the elections .
“ The Iraqi authorities may well be aiming to move forward on much - needed improvements on workers ’ rights , but this is completely the wrong way to go about it .
They need to ensure that workers in Iraq have the full rights and protections enshrined in international law , in particular Conventions 87 and 98 of the ILO ” said ITUC General Secretary Guy Ryder .
The ITUC understands the Chair government committee supervising the elections has said that he would not prevent public sector workers from organising their own trade union elections , but that these unions would not be recognised since Law 52 does not allow it .
As a result , some public sector unions have indicated they wish to hold trade union elections , while others have decided not to in light of the legal situation .
The situation is further complicated by the fact that there are both private and public sector workers in the membership of the six unions which are holding officially - recognised elections .
In addition , the controversial August 2005 Order 8750 freezes all trade union assets and financial accounts .
The application of this order would only be re-assessed and possibly suspended after union elections are held , and only for those unions allowed to take part in the officially - recognised elections .
In a letter sent to the Iraqi authorities the ITUC has informed Prime Minister Jawas Al Maliki , Prime Minister , that it has asked the UN ’s International Labour Organisation to offer the Iraqi authorities assistance in bringing their laws into compliance with international standards .
“ Workers in Iraq have too long been denied their legitimate rights , and we trust that the authorities will now work with the ILO to ensure that these rights are fully respected , ” added Ryder .
The ITUC represents 170 million workers in 312 affiliated national organisations from 157 countries .

We are told that Indymedia does n't log IP addresses or other identifying information about posters , but I would n't rely on this - accidents do happen , and there may be other machines belonging to ISPs along the way logging things .
So if you are wanting to post controversial information , I would recommend using the Tor program to hide your IP address .
It is totally free and fairly easy to install .
http://www.torproject.org/
It means that Indymedia , nor anyone else along the way , can link your computer with the visit to their website .
After you have installed it , check it is working by going to a site such as http://www.whatismyip.com/ and seeing what IP address it sees you as coming from .
It should be one different to your real IP address .
Ultimately though , anything of dubious legality is going to be removed by Indymedia fairly quickly , since like it or not , they are bound by the laws of the land , and if they do n't , they get shut down .
So for absolute freedom of speech , you will need to post information on an anonymous network such as : Tor - Tor has the ability to run " hidden " webservers as well as to mask your IP address on regular websitesI2P - http://www.i2p2.de/
- you can run anonymous uncensorable websites on this .
Freenet - http://freenetproject.org/
- this can host anonymous , uncensored websites too .
Note that these networks are only visible to other people on them , so your audience will be limited .
But they are free to install and use , so the more people that are on them , the better .
ARE YOU BEING SERVED ?
An Indymedia server was seized by police in Manchester yesterday ( 22nd ) .
This comes after somebody had posted the address of the judge in the SHAC trial on Indymedia , leading to Kent Police requesting that the relevant posts be removed , and the IP address of their author be divulged ( eg the unique number given to each internet connection , which can be used to trace the user ) .
The posts had already been pulled , in line with IMC UK policy protecting privacy , but because Indymedia do n’t log the IP addresses of people publishing on it , they could n’t help police with their enquiries .
Indymedia is one of the few websites in the land of blogs and open posting that does n’t log IP addresses , which puts it in contravention of the 2006 EU Directive about the retention of data , obliging sites to log who ’s visiting and posting .
Nearly all other sites do retain this data – something to think about when you blaze away in the comments section on sites by blogspot , wordpress , facebook and nearly all others .
The police gained a warrant to take this one server , presumably to sift through it to find IP addresses , but Indymedia already knew the police would n’t find what they ’re looking for as they watched it go out the door .
This EU Directive has never been tested in Britain , and it remains to be seen if this will be the first time .
But it would be a major own - goal for the police to do so considering the publicity it would generate for Indymedia .
The seizure has n’t affected the running of Indymedia as the server was one of several mirrors .
It ’s just an inconvenience and has been taken as a general attempt by police to attack IMC infrastructure .
Several sites were temporarily affected including London Indy , and sites for an anti-GM group plus a Canadian campaign against the 2010 Olympics .
Indymedia continues to be a place to publish and read news which protects your online privacy – visit www.indymedia.org.uk
The " evidence " did n't link them to organising or taking part in direct action , but for reporting that it had happened ( as SHAC used to publicise ALF communiques before it became illegal - Terrorism Act 2006 ) .
This is where the " evidence came from the autosave function of documents . " , because although anonymously sent communiques were deleted afterwards ( from whom they were recieved by ) , auto - save would have left it on the computers in certain circumstances ( for example a computer crashing ) .
But is this actually relevant ?
Not at all , they only needed to point at the SHAC website to prove that activists had anonymously recieved ALF communiques and released them .
Forensic evidence is not in reality part of the picture when they openly and publicily released such statements , unless of course links are broken and the cops did n't get a screenshot .
Either way though , the " evidence " was based on receiving anonymous communiques , not sending them .
Crime is essentially now based on one 's curiosity over an encryped email , if you open it and read it , you then share an " association " with an unknown criminal ( even if you completely disagree with them and do n't bother to release the communique to others ! )
All in all , the activists were guilty of an " association " with criminals , i.e. recieving anonymous communiques from unknown persons , or reposting them .
They are not guilty , as anyone might believe , of an " association " with crime , which is an extreme difference to an " association " with those who committed crime .
For example , newspapers can do a report from an anonymous criminal , and that is fine , but if they write an article about their ' personal ' association with that crime , it is not .
The irony being the former tactic is now also illegal .
For example , Smash EDO web - activists could easily be jailed under the same law , because the website reports regarding illegal direct action ( even just reposting from indymedia ) , as a specific example ; the quarter of a million pound damage earlier this year .
The campaign would therefore have an " association " with the criminals , especially by financially supporting them , or pomoting such prisoner support for them .
" Conspiring with unknown persons " basically means if you do anything ( even vocally support an action / individual ) , you are conspiring with them to commit crime .
If that crime is political , you are a terrorist .
Is n't it now all so easy , even obvious ?
Bottom line : Seven activists got fifty years for reporting on what the mainstream media are n't allowed to talk about freely - illegal direct action .
Talking about PGP , or relating it to the SHAC trial , is quite obviously a " red herring " .
---
What you might be thinking now is ; but they would n't send away the EDO 9 for 50 + years , because they can would they ?
Of course not , yet .
A look at history always reveals the answers - always .
The reason SHAC received such harsh sentences is because the militant animal liberation movement has been receiving them for decades , and no offence to anyone , but the militant anti-militarist movement has n't experienced the reality of repression through the courts as of yet , let alone built up an illegal direct action movement ( actions : yes , movement : no ) .
It took illegal liberation after liberation before the courts successfully demonised those rescuing non-humans in the 80s , sending them to prison for years by the 90s , in the same way they will begin to demonise individuals taking illegal actions to rescue humans from wars , climate change etc .
If you think this is a warped vegan - imagination , then wonder where the prisoner lists are to support all these anti-militarist direct action warriors ; that have long term sentences for the actions legal or otherwise .
They do n't exist , yet .
All in all , illegally saving lives will only be praised for so long within each issue , then it will be swiftly repressed .
Smash EDO will be at the frontlines of the repression of the anti-militarist movement , clearly , as are SHAC to the animal liberation movement .
But this is barely the beginning for smash edo , as I 'm sure those within the campaign are well aware of , the vegans especially I hope ;)
Governments do n't roll over and die , and more importantly , they do n't let their businesses suffer in the same way - just look at the support for the banking system and you 'll realise how its going to take a while to shut down the Brighton bomb makers !
But this far from mean its pointless and the campaign should n't be happening , the opposite is true .
Just like G8 and the WTO , EDO are just like HLS , a meeting engagement between the people and the state , with everything at stake ; the lives of the innocent .
It might take 10 years , 20 or 100 , but the fact remains - direct action the only way forward , and it works .

UK ministers must answer allegations that Britain was complicit in torture , a senior Conservative MP has said .
David Davis said a High Court ruling on Wednesday alleged that Binyam Mohamed , a UK resident held in the Guantanamo Bay camp in Cuba , had been tortured .
The judges also said the US threatened to withdraw intelligence help from the UK if details were released .
But Foreign Secretary David Miliband said there had been no such threat and the UK " never condoned torture " .
" There has been no threat from the US to break off intelligence co-operation , " he said .
He stressed that the US - UK security relationship was built on trust and that depended on intelligence remaining confidential .
The judges said the UK's attorney general has begun a criminal investigation into possible torture against Mr Mohamed .
Investigation Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones said the attorney general would be investigating the issues of " torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " .
He [ David Miliband ] should explain what degree of complicity we have in this
David Davis
Nick Robinson on the allegations Tensions over Guantanamo case Profile : Binyam Mohamed
The judges said they wanted the full details of the alleged torture to be published in the interests of safeguarding the rule of law , free speech and democratic accountability .
But they had been persuaded that it was not in the public interest to publish those details as the US government could then " inflict on the citizens of the United Kingdom a very considerable increase in the dangers they face at a time when a serious terrorist threat still pertains " .
These details were a summary of a report by the US government to the British security services about the detention and treatment of the individual concerned which amounted to 25 lines .
No 10 said it was not aware of any threat from the US government to withdraw intelligence co-operation with Britain if details of the case were revealed .
Explanation sought
The allegations relate to Binyam Mohamed , a British resident held in Guantanamo , who alleges he was tortured in Pakistan , Morocco and Afghanistan between 2002 and 2004 .
Mr Davis said a High Court ruling , which pointed to complicity by the UK and US authorities in his torture , was prevented from being published after the US put pressure on the UK .
The former shadow home secretary raised the case in a point of order in the House of Commons .
He said Mr Miliband should make a statement to MPs about the issue as soon as possible to " explain what the devil is going on " .
He said the UK government should make it " plain " that it did not support torture in any circumstances .
Mr Mohamed , 30 , has been held in Guantanamo for four years after the US authorities accused him of conspiring with Al - Qaeda leaders to plan a series of terrorist attacks .
But war crimes charges against him were dropped in October .
Mr Mohamed - an Ethiopian national who moved to the UK in 1994 - says documents support the fact that the evidence against him was obtained through torture .
Last August , Lord Justice
Thomas said evidence relating to the case should be disclosed , saying it was " essential " .
However , the British government argued the disclosure of certain material would cause " significant damage to national security " .
' None of their business '
Mr Davis said it appeared the Bush administration had " threatened " the UK government about the repercussions should details of the case be made public .
" Frankly it is none of their business what our courts do , " he said , adding this was " plain fact " not merely an allegation .
" They should not seek in any circumstances to put pressure on British courts .
That 's completely beyond the rule of law . "
There is no other terms for what the US intelligence services are doing than blackmail
Nick Clegg , Lib Dem leader
He said Mr Miliband must explain why this had happened and whether the new Obama administration supported its predecessor 's stance on the issue .
" While he is at it , he [ the foreign secretary ] should explain what degree of complicity we have in this , " he told the BBC .
Mr Davis said the government had taken a " highly principled public stand " against torture but must " come clean " about whether there were cases where British agencies ever knew about instances of torture by others .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington said a former Bush administration official who dealt with Guantanamo Bay confirmed that US intelligence agencies did tell the UK that they opposed the release of certain US intelligence without their consent .
The official added that this was standard practice , just as MI6 and MI5 would oppose the release of UK intelligence in the US without their consent .
Civil liberties campaigners described the judges ' remarks on the case as " astounding " .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said the Bush administration had tried " to bully " the British courts and President Obama must make it clear he would not do the same .
And Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said all the documents in the case must be published immediately .
" There is no other terms for what the US intelligence services are doing than blackmail , " he said .
" It is simply incredible that the US government would have halted intelligence co-operation with the UK if this information had been made public . "

Auburn , NY -- Stephen A. Turo , of Genoa , sat on a chair covered with a blanket in the back of a rental truck , shivering in the 18 - degree cold , as Cayuga County Judge Thomas G. Leone arraigned him Monday on a 24 - count indictment alleging sale and possession of prescription painkillers .
Turo , 56 , of 1138 Maple St. , by his own estimate weighs about 700 pounds .
He was accompanied to the arraignment by his wife and daughter , and he sucked oxygen from two plastic tubes fed by a portable machine during the proceeding .
It was an unusual setting for a court proceeding : a 10 - foot box truck backed up to the loading dock in the rear of the Historic Post Office in Auburn .
Leone and a dozen other court personnel stood in the swirling snow for the 15 - minute proceeding .
If found guilty of just one of the felony charges , Turo could be sent to state prison for 25 years .
If he lands in prison , he would be the heaviest inmate ever housed by the state Department of Correctional Services , spokesman Erik Kriss said .
The Genoa man pleaded innocent .
Leone set bail at $ 1,000 cash or $ 2,000 bond , even though Chief Assistant District Attorney Christopher T. Valdina said Turo posed no risk of flight .
Turo has until 5 p.m. today to post bail .
" Thank you , your honor , for coming down , " Turo told Leone as the arraignment ended .
After the arraignment , Leone said Turo needed to be present at the proceeding to avoid any misunderstanding about the charges or his rights .
The judge said he would not go to Turo 's home for the arraignment .
" That 's a dangerous precedent to set , ' Leone said .
Turo remained in the truck to be fingerprinted and have his " mug " shot taken by a sheriff 's investigator .
The whole process , including the time Turo sat in the back of the closed truck waiting , took less than 90 minutes .
Turo 's wife , Claudette , had been arraigned last week on a 17 - count indictment that also alleged possession and sale of prescription painkillers .
The trip to Auburn was the first time Turo has been out of his home in several years .
He is unlikely to appear back in court until his case is settled .
He waived his right to attend any future court sessions , to argue motions on April 16 or to bargain with the District Attorney 's Office .
His attorney , Douglas Bates , will handle the plea negotiations .
" I do n't know what outcome our office will ultimately approve of , but gross obesity in and of itself is no defense , " Valdina said after the arraignment .
Kriss , the state prison spokesman , said if Turo is convicted and is sent to state prison , the prison system will accommodate him .
" No one on our medical staff can recall an inmate that heavy being in our custody , " Kriss said , " but they did say whatever size inmate we get and however heavy , we will make sure they will have the right bed and all the rest of that stuff so that they can have their needs met . "
The prison system has four medical facilities across the state , Kriss said , and Turo could end up in one of those facilities .
Cayuga County Sheriff David S. Gould said his corrections staff will make whatever adjustments are necessary to house Turo in the county lockup in Sennett if he is housed there .
" We would do whatever we had to do , " the sheriff said .
" We could do it .
...
It would be something different , but we could do it if we had to . "

I ’ve read the entire Old and New Testament of the King James Bible and there are many verses that were strikingly bizarre at first glance .
A second glance only served to make them even more bizarre .
From a list of 10 Bible verses that are never preached on , I learned two things : one , different translations of the Bible can differ significantly , and two , I ’m not the only one who found some of the verses extremely odd .
I ’ve loved the “ go up thou bald head ” verse ever since I came across it .
To illustrate how much translations can differ , I ’ve included the verses as quoted from the site along with the version from the King James version .
It ’s interesting to compare the two .
10 . 2 Kings 2:23 -24
NKJV
Then he went up from there to Bethel ; and as he was going up the road , some youths came from the city and mocked him , and said to him , â€ œGo up , you baldhead !
Go up , you baldhead ! â€ 
So he turned around and looked at them , and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the LORD .
And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty - two of the youths .
KJV
And he went up from thence unto Beth - el : and as he was going up by the way , there came forth little children out of the city , and mocked him , and said unto him , Go up , thou bald head ; go up , thou bald head .
And he turned back , and looked on them , and cursed them in the name of the LORD .
And there came forth two she bears out of the wood , and tare forty and two children of them .
9. Mark 14:51 - 52
NASB
A young man was following Him , wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body ; and they seized him .
But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked .
KJV
And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
8. Deuteronomy 23:1
ESV
No one whose testicles are crushed or whose male organ is cut off shall enter the assembly of the Lord .
KJV
He that is wounded in the stones , or hath his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD .
7. Genesis 38:8-10
NASB
Then Judah said to Onan , â€ œGo in to your brotherâ€™s wife , and perform your duty as a brother - in - law to her , and raise up offspring for your brother .â€ 
Onan knew that the offspring would not be his ; so when he went in to his brotherâ€™s wife , he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother .
But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD ; so He took his life also .
KJV
And Judah said unto Onan ,
Go in unto thy brotherâ€™s wife , and marry her , and raise up seed to thy brother .
And Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brotherâ€™s wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
And the thing which he did displeased the LORD : wherefore he slew him also .
6. 1 Samuel 18:25-27
ESV
Then Saul said , â€ œThus shall you say to David , â€ ˜The king desires no bride - price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines , that he may be avenged of the kingâ€™s enemies .
â€™â€ 
Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
And when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the kingâ€™s son - in - law .
Before the time had expired , David arose and went , along with his men , and killed two hundred of the Philistines .
And David brought their foreskins , which were given in full number to the king , that he might become the kingâ€™s son - in - law .
And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife .
KJV
And Saul said ,
Thus shall ye say to David , The king desireth not any dowry , but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to be avenged of the kingâ€™s enemies .
But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
And when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the kingâ€™s son in law : and the days were not expired .
Wherefore David arose and went , he and his men , and slew of the Philistines two hundred men ; and David brought their foreskins , and they gave them in full tale to the king , that he might be the kingâ€™s son in law .
And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife .
5. Exodus 4:24 -25
NASB
Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that the LORD met him and sought to put him to death .
Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her sonâ€™s foreskin and threw it at Mosesâ€™ feet , and she said , â€ œYou are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me.â€ 
KJV
And it came to pass by the way in the inn , that the LORD met him , and sought to kill him .
Then Zipporah took a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , Surely a bloody husband art thou to me .
4. Ezekiel 16:17
NIV
You also took the fine jewelry I gave you , the jewelry made of my gold and silver , and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them .

Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them ,
3. Ezekiel 23:19 -20
NET
Yet she increased her prostitution , remembering the days of her youth when she engaged in prostitution in the land of Egypt .
She lusted after their genitals â€ “ as large as those of donkeys , and their seminal emission was as strong as that of stallions .
KJV
Yet she multiplied her whoredoms , in calling to remembrance the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
For she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
2. Judges 3:21 - 22
ESV
And Ehud reached with his left hand , took the sword from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly .
And the hilt also went in after the blade , and the fat closed over the blade , for he did not pull the sword out of his belly ; and the dung came out .
KJV
And Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly :
And the haft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
1. Deuteronomy 25:11-12
NASB
If two men , a man and his countryman , are struggling together , and the wife of one comes near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one who is striking him , and puts out her hand and seizes his genitals , then you shall cut off her hand ; you shall not show pity .
KJV
I ’m a carnivwhore , which is two things : first , it ’s a pun .
But it ’s also a great way to describe those of us out there who think meat is better than anything else this life has to offer , even the love of the Baby Jesus .
In fact , if you sprinkled some Lawry ’s on the Baby Jesus and set him out in the sun ... look out .
I love all meats , even the buche and the tripe .
But why drive an Escort when you could clog your arteries with the Ferrari of the flesh : bacon .
Face it , bacon is at the top of the meat - heap and it always will be , which is why people love putting it in or around anything they can .
Those cash - thirsty corporate vampires know that bacon is pure opium to the fat kid masses .
And it only takes a few of us chubdumpsters to form a mass .
Seriously , if you put bacon on something , I will eat that new bacon - infused combination .
Think not ?
Try me , hippie .
Burger ?
Yawn .
Shoelaces ?
Sure .
The cat ?
Now you ’re talking .
And I ’m certainly not alone ; Los Angeles is absolutely bonkers for bacon .
There ’s the bacon donut at the Nickel Diner , the maple - bacon lollipop ( okay , it ’s in San Fran , but I ’m sure it ’s worth the drive for fresh bacon lollies ) .
And do n’t forget the ubiquitous bacon - wrapped hotdog , the street cart staple of the City of Angels .
Some of you may be asking : why bacon ?
My answer is to punch you in your vagina with a fist full of salty pork sides .
Hopefully , you ’ll become so bacon - permeated you ’ll start to get the picture .
Bacon is n’t just the answer to the breakfast question , it ’s the answer to EVERY question .
I wrote in ‘ pork fat ’ for President , haters .
Try to think of a product that bacon does n’t make better .
Sandwiches ?
Popcorn ?
I put three pounds of bacon in my gas tank and my car had a heart attack .
At least I know it went out with pride and glory .
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with the meat sweats ; luckily the shade on my lamp gives off the unmistakably greasy glow of bacon , so I pull off a little slab and settle back into bed .
Consider all of you Food Network assholes on notice as of this writing ( except you Paula Deen , you sexy meat maven ) .
You need to get your chubby , old - ass heads together and wow me with a bacon delicacy worthy enough to shorten my life .
Fuck this lollipop / donut shit , I want you to figure out how to get it inside my fruit or start feeding it to cows to make bacon milk .
Until then , I ’ll be over here downing some meatshakes , waiting for the next big bacon thing .
Make it happen .
This morning the trial of The Pirate Bay started .
Without doubt , it will be the most important case the file - sharing community has ever witnessed .
Here are the key parts of Day 1 , distilled from the hundreds of ongoing reports .
The day started this morning at 08:30 , with Pirate Bay founders Gottfrid Svartholm Warg ( aka Anakata ) , Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi ( aka Brokep ) and Fredrik Neij ( TiAMO ) arriving at the court with the S23 K bus .
The bus will operate as their press -center in the weeks to come .
Outside the court were several Pirate Bay supporters waving Pirate Flags .
S23K
The trial began roughly half an hour later .
Prosecutor Håkan Roswall read out the charges that can be best summarized as “ commercial copyright infringement ” .
The plaintiffs are Warner Bros , MGM , EMI , Colombia Pictures , 20th Century Fox , Sony BMG and Universal .
Lundström ’s lawyer pointed out that the prosecutor may have drawn up some charges incorrectly .
Interestingly , Lundström is the only one of the defendants with two lawyers , one of which is a copyright expert .
Fredrik , Gottfrid and Peter stated their defense .
They all pleaded not guilty .
Roswall then went on to present the claims of the media outfits , and described how The Pirate Bay works , with a little bit of history .
He went on till the lunch break , but meanwhile Rick Falkvinge of the Pirate Party could n’t resist accessing The Pirate Bay site from his seat in the courtroom .
The prosecution said that TPB was aimed at Swedish users until late 2004 , when Fredrik had contact with Carl Lundström .
They say Lundström helped them develop the project by donating funds and resources to enable the growth of the site .
The prosecution suggested that The Pirate Bay was a commercial organization , with Carl Lundström as a shareholder and financier of the company .
They also said that The Pirate Bay investigated the possibility of moving to Argentina after concerns over changes in Swedish copyright law during 2005 .
The prosecution claimed there were plans with Carl Lundström to set up a company in British Virgin Islands .
Discussion ensued over the advertising on The Pirate Bay site , and the involvement of one Daniel Oded and companies Random Media and Transworld Advertising .
Lots of Press ( thanks Rick )
Following the lunch break , proceedings continued with prosecutor Håkan Roswall failing to start up his computer .
For several minutes , listeners of the live audio could hear mouse - clicks as Roswall , who earlier claimed to be an expert on computer crimes , tried to get his PowerPoint presentation on the screen .
He was eventually ordered by the judge to stick to his papers and continue .
Information was presented about various movie , music and game downloads co-ordinated by The Pirate Bay before the raid in 2006 .
Roswall further discussed the total number of seeds and peers on the tracker , all part of the evidence that was previously gathered by the plaintiffs .
During the afternoon , Peter Sunde sent a message : “ How the hell did they think this was going to be something else than EPIC FAIL for the prosecution ?
We ’re winning so hard . ”
Peter points out that the prosecutor is having difficulty working out the difference between megabits and megabytes .
The case was adjourned around 4 pm , and will continue tomorrow morning .
The £ 4billion Airfix Kit : Behind - the - scenes at Britain 's biggest warships
It may look like the ultimate boy 's toy but this scale model - pictured here for the first time - represents the future of the Royal Navy .
As work begins on two 65,000 - ton aircraft carriers , Live gains exclusive access to the top secret plans for Britain 's biggest and most ambitious warships
A starboard view of a 1:200 scale model of what will be the two biggest warships Britain has ever launched - the 65,000 - ton HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince Of Wales
At first sight it looks like a giant Airfix model , with every detail carefully replicated , from the tiny fighter jets and helicopters to the unique twin ‘ island ’ control towers complete with a captain and commander to survey the deck .
Even the 30 mm anti-aircraft guns and the long - range radar have been painstakingly reproduced .
At more than five feet long , the model is a carefully crafted reminder of our glorious naval past carved out of grey plastic .
Such vast aircraft carriers may once have been a badge of pride , but now you ca n’t help but feel they are merely lumbering relics of the Cold War or even the Empire , which have surely had their day .
After all , the UK abandoned the idea of aircraft carriers in the late Seventies when our last big carrier , the HMS Ark Royal , was scrapped .
But this long hunk of plastic represents a work in progress .
It sits proudly in the lobby of the design headquarters for the Royal Navy ’s latest grand project .
It ’s a 1:200 scale model of what will be the two biggest warships Britain has ever launched – the 65,000 - ton HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince Of Wales .
Each ship will have nine decks topped by a vast flight deck and will tower six metres taller than Nelson ’s Column from keel to masthead .
‘ Cover the flight deck with grass and it would be a par four , ’ says one of the design team .
They will carry 36 state - of - the - art Joint Strike Fighter stealth jump - jets and four helicopters each , and be able to get 24 planes airborne within just 15 minutes .
‘ All the major navies in the world are now building them , ’ says Dr Lee Willett , head of the Maritime Studies Programme at the Royal United Services Institute .
‘ The Russians have one of their big carriers , the Admiral Kuznetsov , back at sea and have stated that they plan to build 12 carrier battle groups .
The Chinese and the Indians are also under way with plans , the Japanese are building a destroyer that will act as a helicopter carrier and the US are working on new - generation carriers .
‘ We ’re an island nation and we have global interests so we need these four acres of moveable sovereign airfield that we can deploy wherever we want , whenever we need them . ’
Aerial view , showing the take - off ramp ( A ) , the giant lifts ( B ) , the runway ( C ) , and the helicopter ( D )
What the building of the carriers also shows is that Britain is running out of friends .
Willett says , ‘ The world is an unstable place and , post - Iraq and the global war on terror , access to other nation ’s territory or airspace is more difficult . ’
Former naval officer and now author Lewis Page agrees .
‘ Friendly nations are hard to find and it becomes even harder once you have taken over local air bases , which are then vulnerable to attack .
' But there is a way to avoid giving yourself a logistical nightmare and becoming a target .
Without having to ask anyone you can put an aircraft carrier 15 miles offshore in international waters and carry out operations from there without a single person needing to set foot on land or a single supply convoy coming under fire .
' And you wo n’t need to go through any diplomatic hoops . ’
Despite the persuasive arguments , our two supercarriers have had a long and painful birth .
The decision to build them was announced in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review , but the official signing ceremony only came a decade later , in July this year .
Now the Defence Secretary has announced the carriers will be further delayed – they are not expected to be ready for final delivery until 2016 and 2018 .
Meanwhile , work continues at Rosyth dockyard on the Firth Of Forth to expand the granite sides of the massive Number One dock .
It is here that the final assembly of the carriers will take place – or at least , that ’s the plan .
But there are troubled waters ahead for this huge project , which still has the potential to go spectacularly wrong .
Britain has never put together a ship in this way , on this scale , and there are fears over whether we have the commitment or the skilled workers to build the vessels to order and on time .
A computer - generated image of the new carrier
There have been criticisms of cost - cutting measures , concerns linger over whether the engines will work and , just to add to the uncertainty , the planes it is hoped will fly off the carriers have yet to be built .
From the outside it looks like any other nondescript provincial HQ , with a few well - manicured bushes and rows of family saloon cars parked neatly in front .
But it ’s on this unassuming industrial estate in suburban Bristol that the Royal Navy ’s latest strike force is being designed .
Live has been given exclusive access to the design team , to watch them at work on blueprints and on computer designs for the new carriers , the UK ’s most impressive piece of military kit for decades .
Within the open - plan office there are 180 people , among them 150 designers .
I ’m introduced to the design team in a meeting room , on one wall of which are pinned rows of detailed diagrams of the nine decks of the CVF ( CV is the hull classification for a Carrier Vessel , while F stands for Future ) .
We are prohibited from taking pictures as the diagrams are protected by the Official Secrets Act .
‘ The project has been going for ten years and this is the third ship we ’ve worked on , ’ says naval architect Simon Knight , the project ’s Platform Design Director .
‘ We spent two years working on a bigger ship but found she was much too expensive , then a year on a smaller ship , but we could n’t fit in everything we needed .
We ’ve been working on the CVFs now for the past three - and - a - half years . ’
In the past , the team would have had to build life - size sections in plywood , but today most of the design and simulation is done on computers .
Eddie Chambers , from Tyneside , is responsible for the intricate CAD ( computer - aided design ) 3D models of the ship .
Built up in meticulous detail , these even show individual pipes and electrical cables .
He offers me a virtual tour of the engine room , then calls up one of the mess halls , complete with tables and chairs .
‘ This allows you to walk around the ship , ’ he says , ‘ and means we can make sure that when we tell the build people to start they ’ll know exactly where everything has to go .
These ships are going to be huge , the second biggest in the world .
Only the Yanks have got one bigger – and it ’s good to know that at least we ’ll have a bigger one than the French . ’
Putting the ship together should be like assembling a Lego model .
But with blocks of up to 10,000 tons
No single shipyard in this country has the infrastructure or personnel to construct the entire ship , so the plan is to build them in sections in different shipyards .
Work on the lower bow section has already begun in Devon .
The other shipyards are set to begin cutting steel in March 2009 .
The aft block will be built in Glasgow , the central block in Barrow - In - Furness and the forward section in Portsmouth .
The remaining upper sections will be constructed in smaller docks ; bids from shipyards are still being considered .
The blocks will then be transported independently to Rosyth to be put together .
The integration process is scheduled to take around two years and the plan is that as soon as the first ship floats it will leave and then work will begin on the second .
Putting aside questions over whether the money or political will could dry up before these carriers are completed , simply the practicality of gathering the parts together is a logistical nightmare .
‘ Transportation is one of our biggest problems , ’ says Knight .
‘ Ideally you would build part of the ship in a dock , flood the dock , float the section of ship out and tow it to Rosyth , where you float it into another dock and let the water out so it ’s left resting on blocks .
You then connect it to the next section .
‘ But unfortunately the aft section does n’t float .
We ’ve looked at barges to transport it , but there ’s only one big enough to take that weight and who knows if that barge will be around when we need her .
‘ Alternatively we could put tanks on her to give extra buoyancy – basically enormous floats .
But this is risky because we ’ll have to tow it from the west coast of Scotland to the east coast . ’
A close - up of the forward tower on the 1:200 scale model
If and when all the pieces do finally meet , then putting the thing together should be like assembling a Lego model .
But this is a massive undertaking – each of these gigantic blocks will weigh up to 10,000 tons .
‘ Joining these enormous sections together , physically hammering them along a block and then making sure they ’re exactly aligned will be a pretty hairy operation , ’ says Knight .
The procedure has been carried out before to build offshore rigs , and the Navy is using it for its
Type 45 destroyers , but those are small projects compared to these monsters .
Each of these blocks will be bigger than a Type 45 .
Even if things run smoothly this far , there are no guarantees that the ship will actually move .
Simon Knight admits that nervousness will continue until the moment that HMS Queen Elizabeth finally goes into the water .
‘ The speed trials , scheduled to take place off Rosyth , will certainly be nerve - racking .
You can estimate how well the propellers will drive the ship forward , but until you ’re full - scale in the water it ’s very hard to know for certain .
So when they first launch the ship , I ’ll be terrified . ’
The £ 3.9 billion cost for two carriers may seem huge , but they are built to serve for 50 years , and the budget is significantly less than for American carriers – each new ship costs $ 14 billion ( £9 billion ) .
The project team admits that designing a ship with the desired features to a tight budget has been challenging .
The result , they say , is notable more for simplicity and efficiency rather than hi-tech innovation .
The most revolutionary element of the CVF design is its highly mechanised weapons handling system , which means a cut in the crew numbers required – from 4,500 on a US carrier ( including a team of 150 just to move the weapons around ) to 1,450 .
One of the first things to go was nuclear power .
Most modern aircraft carriers , including the American ships , are powered by an on - board nuclear reactor .
‘ This is a brand - new ship , so getting through all the safety aspects of nuclear power would have been hideously expensive , ’ says Knight .
Instead , like modern cruise liners , the HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince Of Wales will be propelled by electrical motors , powered by two Rolls - Royce gas turbines and four diesel generators .
The diesel generators are more economical and used for general cruising , but when you need to get somewhere fast or need more headwind to help the planes to take off then you switch to the gas turbines .
Money has also been saved in side armour protection , though Knight insists this was a strategic rather than a budgetary issue .
‘ The CVF ’s first line of defence is the frigates and the new Type 45 destroyers around us , ’ he adds .
‘ Our only self - defence is close - in weapons systems and small guns .
Instead , what you have on the ship is 36 of the most lethal aircraft ever made . ’
That would be fine except that the Joint Strike Fighter ( JSF ) jump - jets requested are still in early flight tests and engine problems mean they will not even attempt vertical take - off until next year .
‘ It ’s much easier with an existing aeroplane , ’ says Aviation Design Manager Gary Davey .
‘ Our ramp design has already been completed but the JSF ’s undercarriage is still evolving . ’
Areminder of the worth of aircraft carriers as mobile airfields was provided by the Falklands War in 1982 .
HMS Invincible and HMS Hermes had been built as ‘ through - deck cruisers ’ , to carry hunter - killer groups of Sea King anti-submarine helicopters , which were capable of tracking down and destroying Soviet subs in the north Atlantic should the Cold War ever spill over into open conflict .
The four or five Sea Harrier planes also aboard were simply there to protect the ship from attacks by other aircraft .
But then the ships were hastily reconfigured to carry eight Harrier jets in the Falklands crisis , and they proved invaluable in getting air power over their targets .
In these turbulent times , ‘ power projection ’ is once again considered a necessity .
As complications over finding host nations and even getting agreement on using air space grow , so does the value of the carrier , which has been vital in the ongoing war in landlocked Afghanistan .
‘ That started out as a carrier - based operation , ’ says Dr Willett .
‘ Finding shore bases can be politically difficult , and there ’s also the question of whether they are of a sufficient standard .
Upgrading them can be politically difficult and expensive .
Carriers have proved their value in humanitarian and relief operations as well as in combat roles , and they remain a very flexible political and military asset .
Even if it ’s not politically desirable to put troops ashore somewhere , you can fly aircraft overhead , use some ordnance against a specified target , or just deliver a warning simply by having a carrier parked offshore .
‘ And you can do all this from your own sovereign territory in international waters and no one can tell you that you can ’t . ’
THE FLOATING AIRBASE
• The surface of the 16,000sqm flight deck is covered in a grainy , heat - resistant paint , similar to very coarse sandpaper .
The entire painted surface amounts to 370 acres - slightly bigger than Hyde Park .
• Two huge lifts , each with a 70 - ton capacity , are capable of transporting two aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck in 60 seconds .
The ship will be home to 36 Lockheed Martin F - 35B Joint Strike Fighters and four EH - 101 Merlin helicopters .
• The ground - breaking twin - island layout allows more deck space for aircraft and better visibility of the flight deck .
The forward island is for navigating the ship ; flight control is based in the aft island .
• The ship 's 29,000 sq m hangar is 150 metres in length and has 20 slots for aircraft maintenance .
• There are 11 full - time medical staff on board managing an eight - bed medical suite , operating theatre and dental surgery .
• An onboard water treatment plant produces over 500 tons of fresh water daily .
• Two Rolls - Royce MT30 gas turbines and four diesel generator sets produce 109MW - enough to power a town the size of Swindon .
• Cabins are spacious and cruise - liner style , with en-suite toilets and shower facilities .
Officers and senior ratings have single or two - berth cabins .
The maximum number of crew in a cabin is six .
• The carrier will carry more than 8,600 tons of fuel , enough for the average family car to travel to the Moon and back 12 times .
This gives a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles .
• Top speed will be in excess of 25 knots , sufficient to cross from Dover to Calais in an hour .
• The two five - blade propellers are each 30ft in diameter - that 's one - and - a - half times the height of a double - decker bus .
Desarticulan un cártel internacional de tráfico de drogas que importaba cocaína desde América Latina hasta Australia , tras la detención de tres ciudadanos mexicanos en Melbourne
La Policía de Australia y la de Estados Unidos anunciaron la desarticulación de un cártel internacional de tráfico de drogas que importaba cocaína desde América Latina hasta Australia , tras la detención de tres ciudadanos mexicanos en Melbourne .
Los agentes se incautaron de 65 kilogramos de cocaína , valorada en 16 millones de dólares australianos ( 10.4 millones de dólares estadounidenses ) , durante la operación .
Los tres mexicanos , dos hombres y una mujer , fueron detenidos el viernes , durante un registro realizado a cuatro viviendas en Melbourne , y comparecerán hoy ante la justicia .
La Policía australiana les acusa de introducir el alijo escondido en contenedores en los que había cilindros de cemento , tiestos para plantas y estatuas , explicó un portavoz de la Policía Australiana , Tim Morris .
El envío del estupefaciente se efectuó en México e hizo escala en Long Beach , Los Angeles , donde fue detectado por las autoridades estadounidenses , que investigaron la red de transporte hasta Australia .
El portavoz de la Policía explicó que el interés de los traficantes de cocaína por Australia radica en el alto precio que se paga por la droga en ese país .
Un gramo de cocaína cuesta en la calle unos 350 dólares locales ( 230 dólares estadounidenses ) , mientras que el kilo puede alcanzar los 180 mil dólares australianos ( 120 mil dólares estadounidenses ) .
La pena máxima por traficar con droga en Australia es la cadena perpetua y una multa de 825 mil dólares australianos ( 536 mil 250 dólares estadounidenses ) .

Geneticists are usually concerned with picking apart the individual genes that make up a genome , but now two biochemical engineers from the University of Wisconsin Madison have decided to re-assemble all the pieces and give them a good shake .
They found that it 's not just the genes themselves , but also the way in which they are organised within the genome , that determine the characteristics of an organism .
This electron micrograph depicts VSV , the virus responsible for vesicular stomatitis ( VS ) in horses , cattle and pigs .
Image courtesy the US Department of Health and Human Services .
Kwang -il Lim and John
Yin considered the vesicular stomatitis virus , which is related to the rabies virus and in cattle produces similar symptoms to foot and mouth disease .
The virus is made up of just five genes , named N , P , M , G and L , which appear in the order NPMGL in the genome .
The expression of an individual gene depends on where in the string of all five genes it is located , so it makes sense to ask how and if the virus changes if the order of the genes is shuffled .
But even with only five genes involved , there are 120 possible orderings .
While scientists do have the ability to engineer mutants with a particular gene ordering , physically producing all 120 types of mutant is beyond reach .
So Lim and Yin used mathematics and computers to produce virtual versions of all possible mutations and to see how each fares .
In earlier work , they had developed mathematical equations which describe the life cycle of the virus , based on their theoretical understanding of the core genetic mechanisms that regulate the behaviour of the virus , and quantitative knowledge on the interaction of the virus and its host .
Setting the parameters in these equations so that they reflect the various gene orderings , as well as a given type of host — baby hamster kidney cells , for example — they then fed the equations to a computer and let it simulate the virus 's behaviour for each of the 120 different orderings .
They measured the fitness of each mutant by the number of offspring virus particles it produced : the more particles , the fitter the variant .
The computer simulations suggest that the positions of the five genes along the genome does play an important role in the virus 's growth .
The locations of the N and the L genes seem to be particularly important : those mutants with N in the first position and L in the last grew much better than others .
But where exactly should the other genes be located ?
To find out , Lim and Yin took an excursion into the world of politics .
They regarded each virtual offspring particle as a voter , who ranks the five candidate genes according to their ordering in the particle 's parent : the gene that comes first in the parent 's genome is ranked first , the gene that comes second is ranked second , and so on .
Lim and Yin then employed two simple metrics .
The first involves computing the average ranking of each of the five genes over all the voters ' rankings .
The second looks at all pairs of genes and computes the proportion of voters who ranked one gene in a pair higher than the other .
Both approaches suggest an optimal ranking , and in both it is the same : NMGPL .
Computer modelling puts microscopes out of a job .
It 's a satisfyingly clear result , but it 's also surprising .
The gene ordering of the naturally occurring wild type version of the virus is different , it 's NPMGL .
In fact , there is another ordering that seems to grow better than the wild type .
If the virus is a result of natural selection , then why did n't it evolve more optimal orderings ?
One possibility is of course that the mathematical model used by Lim and Yin does n't take account of some vital , but unknown , genetic processes .
It may also be that the two host types that were used in the simulations — baby hamster kidney cells and delayed brain tumour cells — are significantly different from the cells that the virus infects naturally .
But Lim and Yin , backed up by further simulations , suggest that rather than revealing a fault in their methods , this result points to the fact that other regulatory mechanisms play an important part in the evolution of the virus , so that the wild type can still perform optimally , even if its gene ordering is sub-optimal .
Whatever the right answer , Lim and Yin 's work sheds some light on the complicated genetic processes that govern viral growth and evolution .
And it clearly suggests that gene order is one of them .
Few people would harbour friendly feelings for a rabies - like virus , but these new results may actually enable us to help it do good .
Some viruses , including the one in question , have the ability to stimulate immune response or destroy tomours .
But their exact behaviour depends crucially on their growth rate .
Lim and Yin 's results on how this growth rate depends on gene ordering may prove important in harnessing the virus 's good traits for use in virus - based vaccines , gene therapy or cancer treatment .

Antonin Scalia demonstrates why he's an embarrassment to the high court .
Where others fear to tread , a 20 - year - old college student from Tequesta , Fla. , boldly stepped forward Tuesday to ask Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia a question he did not like during a public appearance in West Palm Beach .
" That 's a nasty , impolite question , " said Scalia , himself an expert on tough questioning , and he at first refused to answer it .
So what did Sarah Jeck ask that caused the volatile justice to erupt ?
According to her own notes and this account in today 's Sun-Sentinel , Jeck asked whether the rationale for Scalia 's well - known opposition to cameras in the Supreme Court was " vitiated " by the facts that the Court allows public visitors to view arguments and releases full argument transcripts to the public , and that justices go out on book tours .
So it 's OK for justices to go on book tours to make some extra cash , but oh ... they are not having anything to do with televised proceedings .
And Scalia gets nasty with a question about this double standard .
In a room filled with some of Palm Beach County 's most powerful people , it took a 20 - year - old political science student to throw off U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on Tuesday afternoon .
Student Sarah Jeck stood in front of 750 people and asked Scalia why cameras are not allowed in the U.S. Supreme Court even though the court hearings are open , transcripts are available and the court 's justices are open enough to go " out on book tours . "
Scalia was at the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts in part to do a book signing and was n't happy at the question .
" Read the next question , " Scalia replied .
" That 's a nasty , impolite question . "
C&L is getting ready to unveil a new Supreme Court blog very soon which will take up the " cameras in the high court " question .
Why are we shut out of their deliberations ?
We will push for cameras in the high court .
We are getting a lot of support from a bunch of organizations and law bloggers .
I 'll tell you more next week .
It should be fun .

Finally tonight , as promised , a Special Comment on former Vice President Cheney ’s remarks about the prospects of future terrorist attacks in this country .
Flatly , it may be time for Mr. Cheney to leave this country .
The partisanship , divisiveness and naiveté to which he ascribed every single criticism of his and President Bush ’s delusional policies of the last eight years , have now roared forth in a destructive and uninformed diatribe from Mr. Cheney , that can only serve to undermine the nation ’s new president , undermine the nation ’s effort to thwart terrorism , and undermine the nation itself .

Django 2.0
So apparently some folks doing business as “ Vyper Logix Corp ” are peddling a thing they call “ Django 2.0 ” .
I ’m not going to link it here since they do n’t deserve the Google bump , but if you ’re interested you can follow the link in Jannis ’ tweet where he mentioned it .
In fact , with any luck my Google juice will pop this article up above them .
“ Django 2.0 ” is , apparently , built on the Django 0.96.2 codebase , which is rather interesting since that means it could be missing :
At least one criticial security fix ( that ’s why we had a Django 0.96.3 ) .
The refactored Django ORM , including much more flexible query backends and support for model inheritance ( queryset - refactor happened after 0.96 ) .
, including much more flexible query backends and support for model inheritance ( queryset - refactor happened after 0.96 ) .
Full Unicode support ( the Unicode branch happened after 0.96 ) .
Auto - escaping templates , so open wide for cross -site scripting attacks ( auto - escaping landed after 0.96 ) .
The full django . forms library , including formsets and easy model - generated forms and support for generic relations ( all landed after 0.96 ) .
library , including formsets and easy model - generated forms and support for generic relations ( all landed after 0.96 ) .
Swappable uploading and file - storage handlers ( landed after 0.96 ) .
The easier - to - use , easier - to - customize , much - more - flexible admin ( newforms - admin landed after 0.96 ) .
django.contrib.gis for GIS support ( landed after 0.96 ) .
for support ( landed after 0.96 ) .
The refactored contrib.comments ( landed after 0.96 ) .
( landed after 0.96 ) .
The refactored ( and immensely faster ) signal dispatcher ( landed after 0.96 ) .
The ability to run Django on the Java virtual machine ( Jython compatibility did n’t happen until 1.0 ) .
An order - of - magnitude faster test framework ( landed last week for Django 1.1 ) .
Aggregation support in the ORM ( landed last week for Django 1.1 ) .
( landed last week for Django 1.1 ) .
A couple thousand bugfixes which have gone into Django since 0.96 .
Somewhere around 40,000 lines of added / improved documentation .
If you ’re happy living without all of those things , of course , it may be that “ Django 2.0 ” is for you .
And it ’s advertised as a “ Premier Python Product ” , which of course must mean it ’s just great ( one wonders why it ’s not a “ Premier Enterprise Product ” since then it ’d be “ Enterprise ” , of course , and they could rip off “ PEP ” to go with the long list of other Python terms / names they ’ve appropriated ) .
But it ’s hard to tell exactly what “ Django 2.0 ” does and how well it does it , since as far as I can see there ’s no place to actually look at the code or try it out .
Meanwhile , if you ’d like the real Django , the one that ’s free of charge , free to use , freely licensed and developed in the open , the one that has all the features and improvements listed above ( and more ) , the one that ’s used by Fortune 500 companies , the one that has an impeccable dev team , a strong community and a huge ecosystem of ready - made applications , well , you can get it over here , just like always .
In fairness , though , I should point out that I am eagerly awaiting non-Django products from Vyper Logix Corp .
Turley : Cheney war crimes probe would be ' shortest in history ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday March 24 , 2009
Print This Email This President Barack Obama said all the right things on 60 Minutes , according to Jonathan Turley .
But no mere verbal rebuff to the former vice president will see the law upheld .
If Obama would step out of the way and allow prosecutors to look at evidence of alleged Bush administration war crimes , " it would be the shortest investigation in history , " Turley said on a Monday episode of MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show .
President Obama , appearing Sunday on the CBS news program , said the former vice president 's policies on the treatment of prisoners captured in President Bush 's terror war are " unsustainable " and had caused " incredible damage to our image and position in the world . "
" The reason Obama seems very irritated by it is that he is responsible for the conversation , " said Turley , a constitutional scholar and George Washington University professor .
" Because he 's the one that is blocking a criminal investigation of Vice President Cheney and President Bush and other Bush officials .
It is like a bank robber calling up and asking him to debate bank robbery . "
It was only Dec. 15 when the former vice president admitted he approved the interrogation tactics which many , including the international Red Cross , have called torture .
Even Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin ( D - MI ) called Cheney out for his remarks .
" When the Vice President of the United States says that he believes ... waterboarding is ' appropriate , ' there is no other conclusion that I can reach other than I know it 's a form of torture , " said Sen. Levin .
" It 's been acknowledged as a form of torture I think since the Inquisition . "
Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was the first top- ranking Bush administration official to admit that discussions on the techniques took place in 2002 and 2003 .
" These are not just our values , " said Turley .
" They are the law .
" [ Obama ] should be saying , ' What you are describing is a crime . '
And if he would allow an investigation to well - defined war crimes , Dick Cheney would not be making public statements .
He would be surrounded by criminal defense counsel .
" ... Rachel , let 's be honest here .
It is just as bad to prevent the investigation and prosecution of a war crime as its commission because you become part of it .
" ... You know , some people say , what do you need , a film ?
We actually had films of us torturing people .
So this would be the shortest investigation in history .
You have Bush officials who have said that we tortured people .
We have interrogators who have said we tortured people .
The Red Cross has said it .
A host of international organizations have said it .
" What is President Obama waiting for ?
And Im afraid the answer is , a convenient moment . "

Jade Goody , the reality television star who lost her battle with cancer yesterday , will be mourned as she lived – in front of the cameras , her publicist said today .
The former dental nurse , who found fame and infamy on Big Brother , was central in planning a " Jade Goody production " to celebrate her life , her publicist , Max Clifford , said .
Large television screens are likely to be installed outside her local church , St John the Baptist in Buckhurst Hill , Essex , for the expected crowds .
There was speculation yesterday that one person who may miss the funeral is Goody 's widower , Jack Tweed , who may be jailed when he appears before magistrates later this week .
Tweed is due to be sentenced on Thursday for assaulting a taxi driver after being convicted earlier this month by Epping magistrates for attacking Stephen Wilkins last May .
Sentencing was postponed because of Goody 's terminal illness , but the magistrates warned Tweed they were considering imprisonment .
A spokeswoman for Harlow magistrates mourt confirmed yesterday that the hearing was still scheduled to go ahead .
Hundreds of well - wishers have visited Goody 's home in Upshire , Essex , leaving flowers , cards , balloons and soft toys .
Ciarán Devane , the chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support , said Goody 's " honesty and openness " about her cervical cancer had raised awareness of the illness and led to people discussing death and dying in a way they had not done before .
" We have also had calls from parents asking about the benefits of their 12 - or 13 - year - old daughter having the cervical cancer jab at school that has been available since September , " he said .
" They have started off being quite sceptical about the vaccine , yet Jade 's fight with cervical cancer has made them think again .
" If vaccination rates increase as a result , that 's also a consequential good . "
Clifford said Goody , 27 , had originally given the job of planning the funeral to one of her bridesmaids at her wedding last month .
" But within a minute she was saying she did n't want that and she did want this , and how she wanted it to be .
It will be a celebration , but of course there will be a lot of tears .
" It will be very much a Jade Goody production , with Jade doing her own thing her own way . "
The service would be an " open " affair , said her friend , thephotographer Danny Hayward , with opportunities for fans to pay their respects .
Devane welcomed the opening up of the " UK 's ingrained reluctance to talk about the grim realities " of an aggressive cancer .
" The thing I most admire about her is that she has been getting on with it : for example , deciding not only to marry , but to marry in style .
And she did n't let the cancer get in the way of the wedding . "
Goody died with her mother , Jackiey Budden , and husband at her side .
Several online tributes have been set up on the social networking site Facebook , drawing hundreds of thousands of supporters .
More than 300 messages of support have been left on the memorial website Lasting Tribute .
Writing on Twitter , the comedian Stephen Fry described Goody as " a kind of Princess Di from the wrong side of the tracks " .
Tweed is still on licence after being released from prison earlier this year .
He was given an 18 - month sentence at Chelmsford Crown Court last September after being convicted of assaulting a 16 - year - old boy with a golf club during a row in Ongar , Essex , in December 2006 .
Tweed , of Buckhurst Hill , Essex , was seen leaving Goody 's home on Sunday – but there was no sign of him at the house today .
US military officials confirmed today that more than 70 military advisers have been secretly working with Pakistan ’s military as part of a “ secret task force ” training the Pakistani army and paramilitaries , as well as providing them with intelligence .
The program appears to have been running concurrently with a previously announced training program , which involved only the training of army instructors who would then be responsible for training Pakistani paramilitary forces .
The secret program appears to have been much broader and involved direct training of forces as well as advisory roles .
The operation , overseen by both CENTCOM and SOCOM , also seems to have been ongoing even as the Pakistani government publicly spurned the offer for US training in protest of US air strikes which killed several members of the paramilitary Frontier Corps .
I just finished most of my jobs for the Lenny release .
I started , together with Mark Hymers , at 10:23 UTC .
This was ahead schedule , which said 12:00 UTC , but better early than late .
After disabling all our ftpmaster cronjobs , setting up our work environment and whatever else we needed and at 10:43 UTC we got the Release Teams GO .
All of what we did got logged from screen , as we intend to write a dak tool doing such releases .
Anyway , I wo n’t bore you with a detailed set of actions we had to took , way too much for now , just some few moments ( All times in UTC ) :
[ 10:23 ] turned off all cronjobs
[ 10:43 ] Release Team GO
[ 12:00 ] etch is now oldstable
[ 13:07 ] lenny is now stable
[ 13:28 ] squeeze is born ( and lot of the work for it was parallel with the lenny work )
[ 14:18 ] the cd- builder host gets an exclusive push so people can start building cd images .
[ 15:34 ] squeeze is now grown up enough to be ready for the world .
Most of the other work that had to be on the ftp-master machine before we are done is also done .
ftp-master is ready for regular work again ( but wo n’t do any yet ) .
[ 15:40 ] Lets start the work for the security archive
[ 16:54 ]
The security archive is ready .
While writing this entry people are still doing work for the release .
For example the cd building will take time , after all there are well over 500 images ( and 36 live cds ) .
Current plan seems to be that we ftpmaster push the archive mirrors around 23:00 UTC , so it has time to sync everywhere .
Some while later the cd mirror will get a push , and then the official announcement will happen .
Thanks go out to everyone involved in preparing this release , be it in the past by fixing bugs , uploading packages , doing whatever was needed , as well as doing the work today .
But some lawmakers here said they were concerned and disturbed by the new revelations .
Democrats , both in Springfield , Ill. , and Washington , said they were trying to digest the details of Mr. Burris ’s disclosure and would withhold further comment .
Some Republicans said they believed local prosecutors should pursue a perjury investigation against Mr. Burris , and some suggested that his disclosures might actually have been prompted by concerns that some of his conversations with Mr. Blagojevich ’s allies were recorded by federal authorities during the corruption investigation that led to the former governor ’s political downfall .
“ I ca n’t believe anything that comes out of Roland Burris ’s mouth anymore , ” said Jim Durkin , a Republican state representative who served on the impeachment committee and posed the original line of questioning .
“ I just do n’t know how to reconcile this .
I do n’t accept that this is a lapse in memory .
How would you forget talking to the governor ’s brother ?
This is the third variation of him describing his relationship with the governor and the circumstances of his appointment . ”
Mr. Burris ’s description of his contacts with Mr. Blagojevich ’s allies has repeatedly evolved .
On Jan. 5 , Mr. Burris voluntarily submitted a sworn affidavit to state lawmakers saying that before he was selected for the Senate seat days earlier “ there was not any contact ” between himself or his representatives and those of Mr. Blagojevich about his appointment to the seat .
Then , during his testimony under oath in the State Capitol on Jan. 8 , he said he recalled a conversation months earlier about his interest in the Senate seat , which was still occupied by Mr. Obama , with a former Blagojevich chief of staff , Lon Monk .
The disclosure Saturday marked the first time that Mr. Burris has acknowledged any contact with Blagojevich confidants during the period when federal authorities say Governor Blagojevich was trying to figure out how much he could get in return for the Senate seat .
Mr. Blagojevich , who was removed from office last month , has proclaimed his innocence on the federal charges .
The Chicago Sun-Times first reported the new disclosure by Mr. Burris on Saturday , saying that he had provided a copy of the sworn statement to the newspaper on Friday in response to questions about his contacts with the Blagojevich camp about fund - raising .
A mind , once stretched , has a difficult time going back to its original form .

To realize how much fun it was to come of age in the roaring mania of the Great Moderation , one had to be young , possessed of the right credentials , and employed by a top - tier investment bank .
To stroll into any restaurant and know that the bill was completely doable , well within reach , so much so that you never even bothered to glance at the price list , was a little understood , happy fact of my life .
At our favorite haunt , outsized tips turned the staff into fast family ; the stove in our apartment heated little beside water for over a decade .
At this moment in time , with the mania 's wave having crested on the shore , I am shocked to find myself face down and hung over on an Austrian beach , a place where I should never have come ashore , much less feel at home .
Despite a Top - 10 MBA education and being groomed for speed , I am back with the proverbial high school art wing crowd , never to be invited to the cool parties .
The Austrians are going through a back - slappin ' confab , the " I Told You So " tour , and they deserve to — but the arenas are mostly empty .
In 2009 America being a libertarian or , if you prefer the term , a classic liberal , is like being a vegetarian who wandered into a nation of cannibals ; none too many roam these parts and our future looks like stew .
The Love Train
Life 's the allusion , love is the dream , Everybody 's happy nowadays .
~ Buzzcocks
My first ( though minor ) compliant about the big downer that 's at the heart of our Great Unmoderationing ( 2007  ) , for me at least , is that finding yourself on the Austrian fringe , while it may find you on the winning team , vindicated , does n't win you the girl but quite the opposite .
I woke up from a long high party not carried atop shoulders off the football field to my waiting cheerleader prize , but hanging out with the debate society champions , showing off our first prize trophies to each other .
Seeing off my thirties before studying the life that was around makes me late to the game , but some say that everyone is born either a socialist or a libertarian so maybe I was fated to , in my mind , eventually think things through to my own end , which happens to be on the fringe .
I 've always drifted to what was left of the dial and believing in a gold standard certainly puts you firmly in the realm of social standing reserved for those " considered as foolish or as a dangerous extremist " ( in the words of Dr. Pascal Salin ) .
There go my boyhood dreams of working at the Fed .
When you 've read the Austrian tomes , its Moby Dicks and Divine Comedies and your brain decides to agree with it all , you come to feel a mental tug of war about what you hear around you , about all that modern America trumpets , everything starts to sound like lunacy .
I read things that seem to strike nobody but me as absurd , and while I can soothe myself with Thoreau 's all men lead lives of quiet desperation , that it 's not absurd to everyone else because I 'm just such an insightful , smart guy , maybe it 's not quiet desperation on everyone 's part , maybe it 's all lunacy on mine .
I once spent part of a Ron Paul event drinking and smoking with some bearded kid who was dressed as a giant purple dinosaur .
We leaned against the bar , he was trying to sell me on the merits of " riding out the coming storm " in Quito , Ecuador and the female bartender delivered every shot with an accompanying warning about One World Government .
I could n't help to feel a bit like a lunatic .
But the biggest complaint about meeting the Austrians mentally is that it spoils the high , it made what little pockets remained of the paper party appear to me far more frantic , everyone merely putting on airs , as if doing was believing .
People in my world are still vacationing overseas ; I worry about not being able to find gold coins .
There 's a disconnect here and I regret it , despite my thousand dollar suit I no longer fit in .
There are still legions who fervently believe the powerful do have all the answers , that somewhere in that latest plan , based on the latest guesses and assumptions , they 've gotten all the variables correct and things will soon smooth out , we 'll see an upturn by late summer if not sooner , but I no longer believe and am not happy about losing that mind set , ignorance was bliss .
Plus , I want to surf Costa Rica .
Lew Rockwell , bless his heart , is trying to perk up the troops , telling me I should feel " fortunate " to live in such times ; that living through economic calamity has its bright side if you know your economics .
Having knowledge of that sort , he says , " even in the face of calamity , there is no mystery , and hence fear is reduced . "
It 's no mystery that if I suffer a complete parachute malfunction after I jumped from an airplane that I 'm going to die .
That would do nothing to reduce my fear , quite the opposite , and everyday at work I 'm watching Bernanke and Geithner and Barney Frank on CNBC , frantically yanking on every ripcord within reach — all to no avail .
Do n't Worry , Be Happy
We are fortunate to be living in these times , for we are seeing the unfolding of events long explained and predicted by the Austrian tradition .
~ Lew Rockwell ( 2009 )
Dr. Pascal Salin recently stated he was " lucky not to have known the Mises Institute at the dawn of my professional life " and I also feel the same way about being late to the game , though for different reasons .
He would not have been tenured in a French University with such views , and I would n't have spent the past twenty years thoroughly enjoying the party .
A little bit of knowledge can be dangerous , and also depressing .
Knowledge does not necessarily always bring happiness , and in this case it certainly does n't .
The benefits are that it gave me wisdom to re-position , to cut off the alcohol , and I did what I had to before the crash .
But with the knowledge and foresight of what was to come I gave up on the happy ignorance I wore for the Austrian sackcloth .
A large part of me wants to become normal again and nod along to the soothing tones of the latest
Fed minutes , secure that all will be well because we 've got the best people —
Ivy League to their eyeballs — spot on the job , and I can go about my day with a lighter step and lose myself in the crowd , happily debating what plan of all the suggested plans Obama should choose for us .
Instead , having wandered into the fringe where the Austrians and purple dinosaurs roam , I am weighted down like Marley 's ghost , my heavy chains forged from ponderous copies of Human Action and Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles , their thousands of pages of weight all boiled down to my sad bank statements .
They say I 've used up all my tomorrows .
What 's left for me ?
I do n't hold it against any of them , the Rockwells , Norths , and Hayeks who have ruined all the fun for me .
Adam Smith once wrote of how to judge a person by " to the intention or affection of the heart , to the beneficence or hurtfulness of the design , all praise or blame , all approbation or disapprobation , of any kind , which can justly be bestowed upon any action , must ultimately belong . "
So we 're cool .
None of them meant to take my punchbowl away , they just pointed out the turd floating in it .
Unlike so many others , though , I 'm even cool with the politicians despite their being the source of our sorrow .
The political class will always make things as difficult as they can — and they have — but it's in their nature to do so .
I feel them no more at fault over their sleazy , violent behavior than I would that of a lion that chased down and devoured the easy prey of a human toddler — they are merely doing what 's in their nature .
Every form of life on God 's playground has its predator , something to cull the herd , why should humans be exempted ?
God in
His wisdom choose it to be so and who am I to judge ?
Besides , in His infinite wisdom
He makes up for it with sunsets and flowers and Van Gogh and beaches and Paris Hilton , all created to show His love .
I am happy with the world as it is and should be .
The road back to my inner peace , which made me feel fortunate to be living in these times despite it all , was not through any knowledge found in Mises or Hayek , but by my study of a classic of self - actualization , Be Your Own Me , by Spinal Tap lead singer and philosopher David St. Hubbins .
I absorbed its main message on the true path to inner peace and fortunate feelings .
That message is , in the words of the great man himself , " take your sadness and shove it up your ass " — and there you will find your bliss .
Yet , I will always fondly recall my lost lamented ignorance , which lived in the days before " the unfolding of events long explained and predicted by the Austrian school . "
I recall Bill Clinton and Monica brightening our day with laughter , with Hillary thrown in for a foil , trendy dinners with trendy friends and blurry cab rides and trips to the Pacific Ocean , retching and heaving alongside the coast highway because of a bit too much .
And I recall everyone from Fool 's Paradise blissfully unaware , dancing on seaside rooftops to Jon Porter 's spinning .
The sun would come up off Fire Island and we would always cheer as she peeked above the waves , and I too believed the promise of an endless summer .

The Best of C.J. Maloney
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The Aaa-rating coveted by the U.S. is still stable , though it 's unclear how much the government 's interventions in financial markets and economic stimulus will affect its deteriorating financial position , Moody 's Investors Service said Thursday .
U.S. Treasurys issued to the public are " most certain " to be paid , wrote Steven Hess , Moody 's senior credit officer , in a research report .
The government had $ 5.8 trillion in debt held by the public at the end of 2008 , the rating agency said .
The government 's ratio of debt to gross domestic product , and debt and interest payments to federal revenue , will rise to levels that are high for a country rated Aaa -rated .
" Whether in 2010 or after , interest rates are almost certain to rise from their current low levels and the affordability of the federal government debt will deteriorate , " analysts said .
It 's difficult to determine the impact of purchases of preferred stock of housing agencies Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.33 % and Fannie Mae FNM , , any purchases under the Troubled Asset Relief Program or other capital provided to banks .
As " these figures represent the purchase of assets , their ultimate effect on government debt is not clear , " analysts said .
" Government could realize a net gain or a net loss . "
Nonetheless , " structural fundamentals , political stability , and still favorable post - crisis economic prospects support the stable outlook for the Aaa ratings of the United States . "
I see that the Pentagon has reversed its old policy of refusing to allow photographs of those flag - draped coffins as our dead soldiers return from the battlefield .
One wonders , however , how much interest there will be in taking and publishing such photos now that President Barack Obama is in office .
One also wonders how long it will take the media to acknowledge the new quagmire we ’re sinking into if and when the numbers of casualties start increasing  as they are sure to do .
After all , Obama ’s war is going to be taking place on a much larger , more difficult canvas than that of his predecessor ’s , which was confined in large part to Iraq .
All of Afghanistan will soon be teeming with newly - arrived US soldiers , sent there  direct from Iraq  to fulfill the President ’s pledge to start fighting the “ right war ” in the right way , a “ smart ” way .
Oh , these guys ( and gals ) are the Best and the Brightest , are n’t they ?
The smarty - pants tone and style of this administration is already beginning to grate on my nerves , as they pander to their base on the symbolic issues  like the coffin question  in hopes no one will notice as they backtrack on more important matters .
So far , it does n’t seem to be working out all that well .
Glenn Greenwald is n’t cutting them any slack on the torture brouhaha  he ’s already pointed out that they ’ll still be torturing people , albeit not with their own hands in some instances , and that if Guantanamo is closed , Bagram  where similar activities are known to take place  is going to be open for “ business . ”
Most of the Obama - zoids are happy , however , because , after all , Keith Olbermann assures them we ’ve entered the new millennium , the Dear Leader is in the White House , and all ’s right with the world .
But is it ?
Not by a long shot .
Has anyone noticed Obama ’s vaunted 16 - month withdrawal - from - Iraq plan has already stretched into 19 months  and the “ residual force ” he kept talking about during the campaign , as if it were a mere afterthought , turns out to be 50,000 strong ?
Originally , none of those “ residuals ” were supposed to be combat troops  yet now we are told “ some would still be serving in combat as they conducted counterterrorism missions . ”
You have to go all the way to the very end of this New York Times report before you discover that , according to Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell , “ A limited number of those that remain will conduct combat operations against terrorists , assisting Iraqi security forces . ”
In short : we are n’t leaving .
I do n’t care what the status of forces agreement says : that document has more loopholes than the bank bailout bill ’s provisions for paying back the American taxpayers .
Those 50,000 “ residual ” occupiers will simply pull back into their permanent bases , which are even now being constructed throughout Iraq , to be called on when our sock - puppets find themselves unable to tamp down the growing spirit of rebellion .
What kind of a “ withdrawal ” is this ?
It is one so burdened with contingencies , conditional footnotes , and amendatory clauses , that it falls beneath its own weight and collapses into a fair approximation of the status quo .
Antiwar voters who cast their ballots for Obama have succeeded in rolling the stone all the way up a rather steep hill , only to see it fall down the other side  and we are right back where we started .
The next hill is called Afghanistan , and beyond that is yet another : Pakistan .
Not even Bush tried to fight a two - front war : Obama , however , is leaping into Afghanistan with alarming speed .
Sending those 17,000 troops was one of the first acts of his administration , announced well before any of the economic measures .
The economy may be crumbling , but the empire cannot be allowed to go the same way  that ’s the lunatic mentality of our rulers , whose priorities reflect a Washington mindset still stuck in the glory days of American hegemony .
Under Obama , the military budget will rise by 4 percent , and this is n’t counting the costs of Iraq and Afghanistan .
As Cato Institute research fellow Benjamin H. Friedman puts it : “ Many Americans believe that Barack Obama and the Democratic majority in Congress will lower defense spending and restrain the militaristic foreign policy it underwrites .
The coming years should destroy that myth . ”
Yes , but myths die hard .
It will take a couple of shiploads of flag - draped coffins  and perhaps a couple of alarming incidents in Afghanistan and environs  to wake up Obama ’s liberal supporters to what they ’re presently enabling with their silent complicity .
In the meantime , the creaking wheels of empire are turning as we gather our forces for another even more perilous mission that will take us straight into the fabled graveyard of would - be world - conquerors otherwise known as Afghanistan .
Why ?
How ?
To what purpose ?
A thousand questions raise themselves up , like the first crocuses of spring  but the Obama administration is n’t answering , because no one of any importance is asking .
Just little old me  and , maybe you .
And maybe Rachel Maddow , now and then : and that ’s pretty much it .
Surely the alleged “ antiwar movement ” is n’t interested  they ’re too busy hailing Obama ’s election .
The President ’s budget requests for Iraq and Afghanistan total $ 75 billion through the fall , and $ 130 billion for next year .
That means we ’ll be spending nearly $ 11 billion per month for at least the next year and a half .
This bothers exactly no one in Washington , and especially not in the White House or the Democratic caucus chamber : after all , these people believe that government spending  any sort of spending  is what will fix our ailing economy right now .
So why not increase the mis-named “ defense ” budget , anyway  do n’t you want an economic recovery , or are you , like Rush Limbaugh , hoping the President will fail ?
Yes , you know we ’ve entered a new era when I start citing Limbaugh favorably , and yet that ’s the sad part about all this : it is now left to Limbaugh and his talk radio confreres to point out the backsliding and howling hypocrisy in this administration ’s policies , both foreign and domestic , because the liberals  with a few exceptions  have been struck dumb by their “ victory . ”

Can you guess what Alcatel 's trying to do with this one ?
Yeah , Lego 's products are some of the most recognizable in the world -- and while we can't tell if there 's any official Lego brand tie - in here , we certainly would n't be surprised if there was in light of Lego 's recent foray into the bleeding - edge frontier of consumer electronics .
What we 're looking at seems to be a render of a device Alcatel hopes to introduce in 2009 , borrowing heavily from Denmark 's favorite export to provide snap - on faceplates sure to bring a smile to any 6 - year - old 's face .
We do n't have any information beyond the screen cap , but there 's no compelling reason to believe it's not real -- other than the fact that Legos do n't make for the best phone ergonomics , we suppose .
Theme devices like this tend to be more Modelabs ' territory , but that 's not to say Alcatel is n't perfectly capable of pulling this off , either .
Next up : a Duplo - based DynaTAC , perhaps ?
Israel already uses spy drones , automated sentry towers , and slew of sophisticated sensors , to keep watch over its borders .
The latest addition to the arsenal : a group of eight African antelope , each weighing nearly 1100 pounds .
The antelope have been stationed on Israel 's border with Lebanon , to eat up the " problematic foliage that distorts views of the Lebanese side and within which
Hezbollah guerrillas could hide , " * Ha'Aretz * reports .
The beasts , known as " elands , " were introduced to Israel from east Africa in the 1970s , to fill zoos .
But when these animals " impressive chewing abilities were discovered , " the animals were recruited by the military .
" The elands eat tremendous quantities and do a wonderful job clearing the weeds at enormous or secret military installations , and in places were there are ammunition storerooms , where the fear of fires is greater , " says Yossi Ben tells Ha'Aretz .
" In these places the elands save on manpower and obviate the need for spraying chemical herbicides . "
There are now " between
500 and 700 elands " at military bases throughout Israel , according to the paper .
And its not the Israeli Defense Forces ' only four - legged deployment .
The Israel Prison Service uses special microphone and audio - processing software to interpret dogs ' barks into alarms .
And " infantry units have also used llamas to transport supplies into Lebanon . "

In BDSM , there is no place off limits * obviously this is something you have talked about and agreed on prior to the scene or during the process of submission *
Most Doms and Masters like to show thier property off , they like to share with others , be it with others in their poly family or with other friends within the lifestyle , however , that said , most of those I know have always said that the anus is off limits to everyone but them , this is the ‘ Forbidden Hole ’ the one that is used by the Dom or Master only .
Now why this is I really have no idea , it might be because anal sex was something frowned upon up until 10 / 15 years ago , it was alwas considered ‘ perverted ’ and not something ‘ normal ’ people did , how wrong they were !
Anal sex is something enjoyed by most in this life and in the vanilla as well , it is one more step to total submission by a sub or slave when they open all thier body for their Owner to take , to own and make it their own .
It could be said that to take it a step further is to then go ass to mouth but that is up to the people involved as it is not something everyone can do .
Anal sex brings another aspect of pleasure into the BDSM life style , just think , how erotic is it to fuck an ass that you have made warm by spanking or paddling ?
To have a sub or slave tied with her ass in the air waiting for you to decide what you are going to do , or even if you place a butt plug in while you pound her pussy , an ass hook for added fun , the posibilities are endless and the ass is no longer the forbidden hole to you .
Bankers at the state - supported Royal Bank of Scotland may still receive bonuses , the chancellor of the exchequer said today , with an investigation announced by the Treasury last night unable to alter existing contractual obligations .
The government is under pressure to rein in the award of bonuses to bankers at RBS after reports the bank had set aside a bonus pot of £ 1bn for its 177,000 employees .
There is growing anger that bankers who mishandled billions in the run up to the recession may still be rewarded despite RBS being propped up by £ 20bn in taxpayers ' money and in three weeks likely to post losses running to billions of pounds for 2008 .
Speaking on BBC1's Sunday AM programme today , Alistair Darling said he had reached an agreement with the chief executive of RBS that no one " associated with losses " should be rewarded .
However he appeared to concede RBS bankers were likely to receive bonuses out of sync with performance .
The chancellor said : " Obviously there are contractual problems with some staff . "
In some cases , he said bonuses may even be appropriate .
" If you look at your average teller , they 're not terribly well paid , and no - one would quarrel with making sure they are properly rewarded , " said Darling .
The chancellor said that RBS also wanted to make sure they have slimmed bonus payments down to the " absolute " minimum .
" They have to understand that these banks would not be here but for the British tax payers , therefore they have to show the degree of restraint that people would expect , " he said .
Last night the Treasury said that an investigation has been launched into banks and their bonus structures : " There will be a tightening of the banks ' purse strings .
This is about keeping any rewards in line with the public mood , and the public mood is unforgiving , " said a Treasury official .
RBS would n't be drawn on a figure for capped bonuses but said there would be " no reward for failure " .
However a Sunday paper reported that the bank aimed to counter public outrage at bonuses by limiting the cash element being paid to each employee to £ 25,000 with the rest made up in shares in the bank .
Most of the share options would be deferred or withheld if the employee left within a set period or if their part of the bank made " significant " losses in the next two years .
The total payout would be around 60 % lower than last year's .
The Treasury says it has been planning to move on bonuses for some time and points to a review begun in October at how bonuses have incentivised risk - taking .
However , momentum has picked up with the announcement last week by Barack Obama that workers employed at banks involved in the American recapitalisation scheme must have their payments capped at $ 500,000 ( £ 346,450 ) .
Darling announced the pay review in an article for a Sunday newspaper , and said that the pay review would be part of a wider inquiry into banks .
" I am now setting up a review which will examine how banks are managed , " he wrote .
" Bank boards have a duty to ask more searching questions of their executives – when times are good as well as when they turn bad .
" I expect the review to make recommendations about the effectiveness of risk management by banks ' boards , including how pay affects risk - taking .
It will also look at how boards operate , at the balance of skills , the role of institutional investors , and whether our approach is consistent with international best practice . "
The pay caps could be coupled with provisions forcing firms to defer awards or make the majority of payouts in shares rather than cash .
Some of Britain 's leading bankers , who have been blamed for mishandling billions in the run-up to the current economic crisis , will face a grilling in front of television cameras by the Treasury select committee this week .
On Tuesday Fred Goodwin and Tom McKillop – the former chief executive and chairman of RBS – face interrogation , alongside Andy Hornby and Lord Stevenson of Coddenham , the former chief executive and chairman of HBOS .
On Wednesday Barclays ' chief executive , John Varley , and the Lloyds TSB group 's chief executive , Eric Daniels , will appear alongside Stephen Hester , who recently arrived to help clear up the Royal Bank of Scotland .
Lord Mandelson , the business secretary , called last week for banks that have been bailed out by public money to rein in big bonuses for their executives .
" The bankers themselves need to consider their own responsibilities in this situation , " he said .
" They have got to understand the heat , the anger , that many people feel about the mistakes that have been made , and they certainly do n't want to see banking chiefs benefiting from past failure .
" If they want to have incentivised pay , that will have to be linked to their achievements in the future , not what they have done wrong in the past . "
Lloyds and Barclays are also reportedly planning to pay out hundreds of millions of pounds in staff bonuses .
RBS is 70 % owned by the taxpayer , and Lloyds is 47 % publicly owned after the firms tapped a £ 50 bn bail - out fund .
The lenders are also preparing to avail themselves of an insurance fund set up by the Treasury last month to shelter firms from losses on toxic assets .
Daniels was last week ploughing ahead with plans to offer generous payouts to top staff at Lloyds .
He has defied advisers who have warned him that this will inflame public revulsion over " rewards for failure " .
Barclays has so far not received a direct taxpayer bail - out , but has made use of a range of other government facilities , and may tap into the new insurance scheme .
Its investment banking divisions could pay out some of the biggest rewards in the City this month .
It inherited a £ 1.7bn bonus " pot " after buying a chunk of collapsed Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers last year .
Philip Hammond , the shadow Treasury chief secretary , said last night that it would be a " slap in the face for millions of families worried about jobs and paying the bills " if bankers received huge bonuses .
The message to them had to be " that the party is over " .
Leader of the Commons , Harriet Harman , said yesterday that bankers ' " rotten " remuneration systems had led to a 40 % pay gap between men and women in the sector and were a " licence for unfairness and discrimination " .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission announced details last month of an inquiry into sex discrimination in the City , including pay and bonuses .
Harman denounced an " old boys ' network " paying itself millions .
Addressing a Labour party regional conference in Sheffield , she suggested that action should go further than the ban already imposed on board - level bonuses at banks bailed out by the taxpayer .
" There is something rotten in the remuneration system of the banks and finance companies , " she added .
" Men paying themselves millions of pounds of bonuses each – and then saying that they did n't know what was going on . "
Labour has lost all the poll " bounce " that was achieved by Gordon Brown 's bail out of the banks last autumn .
A new ICM poll puts Labour on 28 % – down 4 % since January – the Conservatives on 40 % – also down 4 % – and the Liberal Democrats on 22 % – up 6 % .
Reacting to an online swell of suspicion about changes to Facebook ’s terms of service , the company ’s chief executive moved to reassure users on Monday that the users , not the Web site , “ own and control their information . ”
The online exchanges reflected the uneasy and evolving balance between sharing information and retaining control over that information on the Internet .
The subject arose when a consumer advocate ’s blog shined an unflattering light onto the pages of legal language that many users accept without reading when they use a Web site .
The pages , called terms of service , generally outline appropriate conduct and grant a license to companies to store users ’ data .
Unknown to many users , the terms frequently give broad power to Web site operators .
This month , when Facebook updated its terms , it deleted a provision that said users could remove their content at any time , at which time the license would expire .
Further , it added new language that said Facebook would retain users ’ content and licenses after an account was terminated .
I thought Brit Hume was done littering our airwaves with conservative talking points since he gave up his show to Mr. Baier , but no , he 's still going to be a lead talking head for FOX .
And boy is he ever wanking .
With a straight face and not in clown make up , Brit Hume said this :
HUME : That 's right .
Well , then , the New Deal -- everybody agrees , I think , on both sides of the spectrum now , that the New Deal failed .
The debate is over why it failed .
People on the left believe it failed because Roosevelt , at the end of the day , really did n't do enough spending , that it simply was n't spending -- he was not spending , whether deficit spending or not , on a scale grand enough to lift the damaged U.S. economy out of that depression .
There are people on the other side of the spectrum who would say , maybe , but look at this as well .
President Roosevelt waged what could only be called a jihad against private enterprise .
He prosecuted leading figures in it , Andrew Mellon being a conspicuous example .
He prosecuted little companies , butcher shops in New York , as has been laid out in Amity Shlaes ' book about the new -- book about the history of the Great Depression .
The problem FDR had was that he got caught up in being more conservative with the budget in ' 38 , which slowed it down --- still --- the NEW Deal rescued America out of the depression and was so successful that conservatives have been trying to destroy every part of it ever since .
Bush 's lame attempt at dismantling Social Security was a humiliating defeat for him right after he won reelection in ' 04 .
He thought he had all that political capital to spend and he turned his attention on Social Security .
There 's one thing you can't fool with .
That is Social Security benefits .
Americans will never take that risk . .
Can you imagine if the people had actually been hoodwinked into believing Bush and went along with the mantra that they should invest their Social Security into the stock market ?
There may have been an armed march into DC , not by Blackwater type militia's , but by the AARP crowd that would have been screwed by the market meltdown .
But it will not stop clowns like Brit Hume from trying to rewrite history about FDR .
I agree with Digby when she says :
( Adds Khamenei , Mottaki 's comments , previous DAMASCUS )
TEHRAN , Feb 1 ( Reuters ) - Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told the Palestinian group Hamas to be prepared for possible fresh Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip , the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Sunday .
A delegation from Hamas , headed by its leader Khaled Meshaal , arrived in Tehran on Sunday as part of a regional push to reinforce support for the Palestinian group after the Israeli invasion of Gaza .
Hamas was in close contact with Iran , its main backer along with Syria , during the 22 - day Israeli offensive against Gaza , which was halted last month , with the two sides declaring separate ceasefires .
Khamenei said the war in Gaza had yet to be finished , praising " the resistance of Gazans " .
" The Islamic resistance ( Hamas ) should be prepared for any possible situation , including a fresh war in Gaza , " Khamenei told Meshaal , Fars reported .
" The enemy 's ( Israel ) psychological war ... still goes on . "
Israeli and U.S. officials have accused Iran of providing weapons , cash and training to Hamas militants in Gaza .
Iran insists it only gives moral and political support to Hamas .
Meshaal praised Iran for backing Hamas , Fars reported .
" The Islamic Republic of Iran has a big share in our victory in the Gaza Strip , " said Meshaal , who also met Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Iran 's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki called for the immediate lifting of Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
" The Gaza blockade should be lifted and Gaza port and the crossings should be reopened for reconstruction , " state television quoted Mottaki as saying during a joint news conference with Meshaal .
Hamas views the war as resulting in regional diplomatic gains for the group , with Turkey criticising Israel and Qatar convening a high - profile meeting with the participation of Hamas that supported Hamas 's objectives .
Meshaal visited Qatar last week .
Five other Hamas politburo members are accompanying Meshaal on the visit to Tehran .
Hamas said it would intensify its post war diplomatic efforts to lift the Israeli blockade on the Gaza Strip , imposed with the help of Egypt .
The group has kept a line open with Cairo , which is mediating a deal for a more solid truce that tries to meet Israel 's demands for stopping arms flows into Gaza and Hamas 's demands for lifting the blockade .
Hamas regards the blockade , which damaged Gaza 's economy and further impoverished the majority of the territory 's population , as a form of illegal collective punishment and cited it as a reason for not renewing a ceasefire with Israel in December .

Mac Secrets
When I kicked off Mac Secrets , the first thing I looked at was " a better way to build OS X preferences . "
In this installment , I 'll be looking at various undocumented aspects of PreferencePanes .
framework that happen to be a documented framework .
Moreover , the stuff I 'm looking at has got nothing to do with preference panes !
Confused ?
Let me explain .
Although this framework is documented , it contains a number of classes that most definitely are n't .
Here , I 'm going to concentrate on a class called NSPrefPaneUtils .
As the name suggests , this contains a set of utility functions that are of general use to anyone writing a preference pane - or anyone else for that matter .
To make use of the class , just create an Xcode project and - in the usual way - drag the aforementioned framework from / System / Library / Frameworks into the Frameworks group of the new project .
Most of the methods implemented by NSPrefPaneUtils are class methods , so you do n't need to instantiate an object before using them .
For example :
+ ( BOOL ) isMacOSXServer ; + ( BOOL ) hasBattery ; + ( BOOL ) isTimeMachineEnabled ;
As is obvious from the names , these will tell you whether you 're running OS X Server , whether your machine has a battery , ( not whether or not it 's currently on battery power , which is a different issue ) , and whether or not Time Machine is enabled .
Here 's another useful method :
+ ( void ) enableControls : ( BOOL ) enable inView : ( NSView *) view deep : ( BOOL ) deep ;
Given a specific view , this method enumerates the view looking for any controls and enabling or disabling them as indicated by the " enable " parameter .
If you set " deep " to " YES " , any encountered NSView sub-views are recursively enumerated in the same way .
This is a useful method if you want to - for example - programmatically disable or enable all the controls in a complex group box or even in an entire panel .
The real core of NSPrefPaneUtils , however , is devoted to the representation of key - codes and modifiers .
If you 've ever built an application that uses configurable hot keys , you 'll know that getting this right can be quite tedious .
There are some terrific open - source contributions around for recording key presses like Shortcut Recorder for example , but if you want to do something like simply display an existing key - code complete with modifiers , then even doing that can be a bit messy .
NSPrefPaneUtils contains a number of methods to make life much easier .
For example , suppose you 've used Shortcut Recorder to record the user 's hot - key preference for a particular program action .
This gives you a virtual key code and a modifier mask .
To convert this back into a human readable form , you could do something like this :
NSLog ( [ NSPrefPaneUtils humanStringForVirtualKey : 96 modifiers : NSCommandKeyMask ] ) ;
On my keyboard a virtual key - code of 96 corresponds to the F5 key .
Hence , the output will be " Command F5 " .
If you 'd rather that the user saw " _F5 " , then use stringForVirtualKey : modifiers : instead .
( I 've included all the available selectors in the NSPrefPaneUtils.h file along with the demo program , at the end ) .
If you just wanted to display the modifier mask in human readable form , then stringForModifiers : ( e.g. " _F5 " ) or humanStringForModifiers : ( e.g. " Command " ) .
Likewise , _labelForVirtualKey : will give you a human - readable representation of the key - code on its own .
If , incidentally , you 're wondering what startKeyboardMonitor and endKeyboardMonitor do , they 're used internally within the framework - you should not call these methods yourself .
They simply manage an internal IOKit notification mechanism , which keeps track of whether the currently attached keyboard or keyboards have an " Fn " key or not .
In this way , the routines I 've mentioned automatically take care of whether or not to add " Fn " at the front of a keystroke 's description .
That 's the purpose of the internal _needFN method .
Test the PrefPaneUtils class
Anyway , back to our story .
One especially interesting call is stringForSymbolicKey : if you 're not familiar with symbolic keys , suffice to say that this is a mechanism that lets things like Dock , Exposé and Spaces to allocate numeric identifiers to hot - keys in a persistent , global manner .
The real guts of this are undocumented ( natch ) and buried deep inside CoreGraphics , but it is possible to make use of symbolic keys in your own code .
For now , just take a look at the call below :
NSLog ( [ NSPrefPaneUtils stringForSymbolicKey : 8 ] ) ;
The number eight is n't a virtual key code , it 's a unique number identifying a specific symbolic key .
In this case , the keystroke that moves focus to and from the Dock .
The default setting for this hotkey is Control - F3 and , as expected , the above statement will generate " ^F3 " as output on my machine .
For a lengthy list of available symbolic keys , check the excellent work of Alacatia Labs ' developer Joe Ranieri here .
Hopefully , this has whetted your appetite for those undocumented PreferencePanes .
framework classes .
Next time , I 'll delve deeper into symbolic keys .
Ahead of that , you can get your hands dirty using full source code and demo project , which can be found here .
One word of caution OS X fans : the demo wo n't appear to do anything - but just look at the console output . ®

France admits it sent Jews to the gas chambers during Second World War
France 's Council of State yesterday recognised that the country was responsible for deporting thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps .
The judicial body - effectively the French supreme court - found that the government of Nazi- occupied France at the time held the ' responsibility ' for the deportations .
It is the clearest recognition yet of French involvement in the Holocaust .
France 's President Nicolas Sarkozy walks past the Wall of Names during his visit to the Holocaust Memorial in Paris in 2007 .
The names of the 76,000 Jews deported from France are engraved on the wall .
After the war , subsequent governments took decades to acknowledge any role by the collaborationist Vichy regime in the massacre of millions of Jews .
However , the Council appeared to rule out any reparations for deportees or their families .
It said that the Vichy regime 's actions had been ' compensated for ' since 1945 .
The Council is part of the French national government and its members are largely high - level lawyers .
It gives the executive legal advice and acts as the supreme court for administrative justice .
The Council 's ruling came after a Paris court sought its opinion on a request by the daughter of a deportee who died at Auschwitz for reparations from the French state .
The woman was also asking for damages for her own personal suffering during and after the occupation .
The Council left it up to the Paris court to rule on her request , but said the 'acts and actions of the State led to the deportation of people considered Jews by the Vichy regime ' adding that France should take responsibility for this .
It also called for a ' solemn recognition of the state 's responsibility and of collective prejudice suffered ' by the deportees .
Today , France has western Europe 's largest Jewish community at approximately 500,000 .
( CNN ) -- A NASA satellite crashed back to Earth about three minutes after launch early Tuesday , officials said .
NASA launches a rocket from California 's Vandenberg Air Force Base on Tuesday .
" We could not make orbit , " NASA program manager John Brunschwyler said .
" Initial indications are the vehicle did not have enough [ force ] to reach orbit and landed just short of Antarctica in the ocean . "
" Certainly for the science community , it 's a huge disappointment . "
The satellite , which would have monitored greenhouse gases to study how they affect the Earth 's climate , was launched on a Taurus XL rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 1:55 a.m. PT ( 4:55 a.m. ET ) .
But the payload fairing -- a clamshell - shaped structure that allows the satellite to travel through space -- failed to separate from the rocket , NASA officials said .
See video of launch »
The weight of the fairing caused the rocket and the satellite to come crashing down to Earth about three minutes later .
Do n't Miss iReport.com : iReporter captures image of launch
A team of investigators will look into what caused the payload fairing to fail to separate .
" We 'll get back to flying at a pace that allows us to do so successfully , " said Chuck Dovale , NASA Launch Director , at a press briefing after the failed launch .
The $ 273 million satellite , called the Orbiting Carbon Observatory , would have collected global measurements of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the Earth 's atmosphere to help better forecast changes in carbon - dioxide levels and their effect on the Earth 's climate .
Carbon dioxide is considered a greenhouse gas because it traps heat , which scientists believe contributes to the warming of the planet .
Carbon dioxide also absorbs wavelengths of light , and the NASA observatory would have measured levels of the gas partly by using instruments to analyze light reflected off the Earth .
The OCO also would have provided information about CO2 " sinks " -- areas , like oceans or landfills , that absorb and store carbon dioxide .
NASA officials said all measurements would be combined with the findings of ground observation stations , providing a more complete account of the human and natural sources of CO2 .
The OCO project took eight years to develop , said Michael Frelich , director of the NASA Earth Science Division .
Its failure is a great loss for the science community , he said .
All About NASA
Tonight I worked on my business school project while the Oscar ceremonies were on .
I set my DVR to record the whole show and went back to working on my assignment nonchalantly .
It was only when my dad called me from India and exclaimed " Jai Ho ! " that I realized that my favorite musician A. R. Rahman had won the Oscars for the best original score and the best original song for Slumdog Millionaire .
I said " That 's so awesome " to my dad and went back to studying .
Maybe I was just stressed about the project or maybe it was something else but I felt quite uneasy after that phone call .
That was quite a stereotypical American hipster response coming from me , as if I have become so unfazed by media , splendor , and glitter that Oscars are pass� and winning awards is dull .
Once I completed my assignment , I watched the entire Oscar ceremony in about an hour , with the gratuitous use of the fast - forward button .
In true Oscar - audience fashion , I laughed and I cried , I cheered and I clapped .
When it was over , I went online to read more about the Oscars and hear what others were saying .
I often do that after major events , just to feel like I 'm part of a global community at 1 am .
To my dismay , other than the big media outlets like CNN and BBC , none of the sites I frequent cared much about the Oscars .
One or two even mocked them and the winners .
It was the consequent feeling of cognitive dissonance that prompted me to stay up well past my bedtime and write my thoughts down .
Americans just do n't get the American Dream .
They read about it in books and think it is a house in the ' burbs with a white picket - fence and a big dog .
They think immigrants from all over the world come here just to buy a big house and watch the Super Bowl .
I know this is what they think because I 've been living here for the past eight years and by all accounts I 'm living proof of having achieved it .
But that 's not what THE American Dream is .
The American Dream that millions upon millions of people around the world aspire to achieve someday is not a mediocre life of relative stability with a two - car garage and automated bill payment .
The American Dream is being born as the youngest of eight children , failing medical entrance exam , dropping out of law college , joining film institute against family 's wishes , and fourteen long years later winning a god - damned Oscar in front of the whole world .
The American Dream is not the glory but the never ending struggle that one must go through while everyone around you has become complacent and already accepted the status quo as their fate .
The American Dream is daring to dream that despite the millions before you who tried and failed , you have something within you that sets you apart and ever - so - slightly shifts the odds in your favor .
The saddest part about the American Dream is that for most people , it stops the moment they set foot in the country .
I vividly recall my first flight to the US .
I was nervous but determined .
As the plane reached cruising altitude , I managed to calm my emotions down .
After all , I had just bid my family , friends , and home for twenty years good bye .
I told myself that I will make my parents proud and my friends will someday say " he used to sit right here next to me in class . "
I did not have a specific goal in mind and especially did not care about money or riches .
As boring as it sounds , I just wanted to be " somebody . "
I just wanted my piece of the American Dream .
Eight years later , here I am .
I 've assimilated quite well .
I have a gorgeous loving wife , lots of pets , a wonderful job , a nice house , two cars , and for the first time in my life , a real savings account .
Having all of my wishes come true was n't the American Dream .
Arguing with my dad for two years to let me come to the US against his wishes , was .
Having my sister determine the fate of my life because my dad asked her if I should be allowed to go to the US , was .
Living alone for six of the past eight years and managing to remain optimistic about my future life , was .
And yet , I have n't struggled even one - percent as much as most of the other immigrants who come here .
By most standards , I 've had it pretty easy .
My American Dream delivered above and beyond my expectations .
For most , it does n't .
It stops being a dream when the bills pile up and discrimination begins .
The only glint of hope is that the kids will have a better shot at life someday .
I do n't care to watch the Oscars because Meryl Streep has been nominated for the fifteenth time .
I watch them because I want to see a grown man cry like a baby when he realizes that this very moment is the culmination of forty years of hard work .
I watch them because I want to see lives changed and careers validated .
There are no triumphant awards for programming web services or coding warehouse systems .
Watching others get rewarded for their hard work is the closest that I can get to feeling like there is still some fairness in this world ; that tireless efforts are eventually rewarded and perseverance pays off in the end .
Watching others achieve their dreams helps me keep my dreams alive , however incomparable they might be .
The American Dream is not about money , fame , or power but about beating the insurmountable odds .
The American Dream is never accepting that the best part is already over .
The American Dream is achieving it and starting it all over again .
There ’s something about this article on the process of making communion wafers that makes me take Catholic doctrine even less seriously than before :
The [ Cavanagh Altar Bread ] company sells its wafers to religious supply retail stores and convents , which are ramping up Christmas orders .
Sister Mary Michael of the Corpus Christi Monastery in the Bronx , N.Y. , said her monastery , like many , used to bake altar bread for sale to surrounding churches as a source of income .
But demand outstripped what their antiquated equipment could produce , and for decades the nuns have bought wafers wholesale from Cavanagh , to sell at a markup .
“ It ’s one of our means of support – it helps , ” she said .
Sister Mary Veronica of the Franciscan Monastery of St. Clare in Jamaica Plain said the monastery has sold Cavanagh bread since well before she joined her order 18 years ago .
“ It ’s a good product , ” she said .
“ Better than a number of places that make hosts . ”
The current generation of Cavanagh family members have an awesome sense of humor about what they do — it ’s almost as if they know they ’re making crackers that others take waaaay too seriously :
The company employs 36 full - time people making altar bread .
The family is Roman Catholic , “ but you certainly do n’t have to be Catholic to work here , ” said Brian .
“ It ’s a manufacturing company .
There ’s no fake reverence for the product . ”
Until the wafers are used by a priest in the celebration of the Eucharist , “ it ’s just bread , ” he said .
My favorite part has to be what happens to the discarded Jesus wafers :
Next comes the die cutter .
Sheets of bread automatically drop between two rollers , which cut 112 standard Communion wafers from each sheet in about one second , while simultaneously indenting a cross or a lamb shape into each wafer .
The wafers and the chaff left over from the cut are spun are in perforated tubes , which shake the chaff into waste barrels .
A local pig farmer feeds the waste to his hogs .
“ Holy pigs , we call them , ” said Luke .
The same family makes separate wafers for other faiths :
The Cavanagh Co. also provides wafers for other denominations , such as Lutheran and Episcopal churches , the family said .
They bake an entirely different style of altar bread for Southern Baptist churches .
Those breads are small white squares .
“ They probably would double as a great soup cracker , ” said Andy .
So if you do n’t buy the whole Jesus thing , just use the crackers in your soup .
No difference .
Just a reminder : Catholics make up one - sixth of the world ’s population .
You figure most of them actually believe they are eating Jesus …
We 're probably still a long way off from a realistic , full - immersion game - playing environment , but one vendor is trying to get us a little closer to the experience -- although this company 's approach appears to be more akin to using a Holodeck with the safeties turned off ( alternatively , if you did n't get the Star Trek reference , it 's like paying someone to kick you in the chest or head ) .
The vendor is Redmond , Washington - based TN Games , and it makes force - feedback gaming products that you wear - - designed to help you actually feel what is happening inside the game world .
TN Games refers to its force feedback technology as " 3rd Space , " and its products as " impact generating gear . "
The company currently sells a Gaming Vest that comes in black , camouflage , or pink ( which all sell for $ 139 ) .
The vest uses compressed air to deliver blows to the wearer that are meant to simulate " the impact of punches , kicks , bullets and blasts that happen to your character in the game . "
There are a total of eight air actuators on the vest ( four on the front and four on the back ) that each delivers five pounds of impact force .
What does five pounds of impact force feel like ?
The TN Games Website states that you can simulate what it would feel like by doing the following : " Take a single roll of 50 pennies .
Lay on the ground face up .
Hold the role of pennies end on ( up and down ) 6 inches above your stomach , then release the roll and let the roll strike your stomach .
That is what 5 lb of force feels like .
" The vest attaches to a Windows PC via a USB connection and it currently works with almost 30 games , such as Call of Duty 4 , Crysis , and World of Warcraft , using the 3rd Space Game Driver Software and in some cases , game mods .
Not content to let your torso have all the fun , TN Games now has an impact - generating helmet in the works that will use the same 3rd Space technology as its vest to deliver blows to your head .
There is not a lot know about the product yet , other that this tidbit of info TN Games has posted on its site :
" The HTX Helmet is the next product in development for TN Games using its 3rd Space™ technology .
The HTX Helmet is worn in conjuction [ sic ] with the 3rd Space™ Gaming Vest and delivers blows to the head when you are fired upon .
Feel bullets whizzing by your helmet or the impact of getting shot in the head .
The helmet will communicates [ sic ] with compatible games to give precise , 3 dimensionally accurate impacts where it happens , as it happens .
Release date 2009
" We 're not sure what five pounds of force would feel like on our heads , as we were unwilling to try the experiment with the roll of pennies on our noggins .
However , we suspect that the HTX Helmet probably wo n't use quite as much force as the vest does .
The bigger question to ask , however , is that will anyone truly want to simulate the feeling of getting hit , kicked , or shot in the head ?
If there are any gamers out there who are seriously considering this product , we 'd like to suggest to TN Games that it start working on a pair of impact - generating pants with air actuators positioned in the crotch cranked up to at least 10 pounds .
( Beirut ) - Lebanese authorities should disclose all available information on the whereabouts of Nawar `Abboud , who disappeared three months ago after Lebanese Military Intelligence detained him in Tripoli , Human Rights Watch and the Lebanese Center for Human Rights ( CLDH ) said today .
Following a request for information by the general prosecutor , Military Intelligence stated on February 11 , 2009 that they released `Abboud , a Syrian opposition figure , on December 25 , 2008 , but he has not been seen since .
` Abboud is an accountant in United National Alliance , a political group affiliated with Ref`at al - Asad , a Syrian opposition figure and uncle of the Syrian president , Bashar al - Asad .
Abboud 's family and colleagues fear he may have been forcibly transferred to Syria .
" Lebanon has a painful history of people being detained and illegally transferred to Syria , where they disappear , " said Nadim Houry , senior researcher at Human Rights Watch .
" The best way to show that these dark days are over is for the Lebanese authorities to conduct a transparent and serious investigation of the case . "
On December 24 , plainclothes members of the Lebanese Military Intelligence came to Abboud 's office in Tripoli and took him , along with two Lebanese employees , to the al - Qubbeh military base for interrogation .
Lebanese Military Intelligence released the two Lebanese - one on December 24 and the other on December 26 .
They also stated that they released ` Abboud at 14:20 on December 25 and that his possessions were returned to him , including his two cars , which Military Intelligence had seized .
However , `Abboud 's family and colleagues have not seen him or located his cars despite extensive efforts to find him .
According to a letter dated January 14 from General Security ( the security agency responsible for foreigners and border crossings in Lebanon ) , there is no record of `Abboud leaving Lebanon through an official border crossing .
When the media asked the ministers of justice and interior about Abboud 's disappearance , they deferred to the General Prosecutor 's Office .
In a televised interview on the Arabic News Network ( ANN ) , Justice Minister Ibrahim Najjar stated that the General Prosecutor 's Office is undertaking an investigation into ` Abboud 's disappearance , but did not give further information .
For his part , Minister of Interior Ziad Baroud told the Kuwaiti newspaper al - Ra'i on February 11 that : " When the General Prosecutor is seized of a matter , I do not intervene . "
Following a request for information by `Abboud 's lawyer , the General Prosecutor 's Office has repeated the army 's statement that its intelligence services released `Abboud on December 25 .
" The General Prosecutor 's investigation cannot limit itself to what the army has said , " said Marie Daunay , president of CLDH .
" The investigation needs to dig deeper and shed light about the circumstances surrounding `Abboud 's alleged release and subsequent whereabouts . "
On March 5 , Human Rights
Watch sent a letter to the ministers of defense , interior and justice to request that military intelligence provide further details about the whereabouts of `Abboud .
To date , no answer has been received .
The Mysteries of Textbook Economics
“ Andrew Gelman ” : http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/02/i-received-a-fr.html is puzzled .
I received a free copy in the mail of an introductory statistics textbook .
I showed the book to Yu - Sung and he said : Wow , it ’s pretty fancy .
I bet it costs $ 150 .
I did n’t believe him , but we checked on Amazon and lo !
it really does retail for that much .
What the . . . ?
I asked around and , indeed , it ’s commonplace for students to pay well over $ 100 for introductory textbooks .
Well .
I ’m planning to write an introductory textbook of my own and I ’d like to charge $ 10 for it .
Maybe this is n’t possible , but I think $ 40 should be doable .
And why would anybody require their students to pay $ 150 for a statistics book when something better is available at less than 1/3 the price ?
… It just mystifies me that , in all these different fields , it ’s considered acceptable to charge $ 150 for a textbook .
I ’d think that all you need is one cartel - breaker in each field and all the prices would come tumbling down .
But apparently not .
I just do n’t understand .
Well , perhaps “ crack economist Greg Mankiw ” : https://crookedtimber.org/2008/03/04/principles-and-practices-of-economics/
might be able to solve this particular mystery .
Or , perhaps , not so much .
But more simply , I think that the obvious public choice answer is that the costs of this particular arrangement are borne by the students , who constitute a captive market , rather than by the professors , who actually choose the textbook that is required .
All that you need are some very moderate side - payments to persuade self - interested professors to adopt particular textbooks ( perhaps even just lowering their search costs by sending them free copies ) .
So the cartel - breaker would have to provide sufficient inducement to the professors , which seems rather unlikely given that they would not be making monopoly profits , and hence would be outbid by those who _are_ in a position to capture them .
Of course , if the professor is teaching their own textbook to large undergraduate intro classes and making large amounts of money from each semi-compelled purchase , then no sidepayments at all are needed ( not all professors being as conscientious as Andrew Gelman ) .
There ’s clearly an opening for some enterprising grad student to write a paper ( perhaps for the _Journal of Economic Perspectives_ or some such ) on the characteristics of this very interesting market …
FINANCIAL TIMES HITS STEVE SCHWARZMAN FOR SHARING $ 300 SUBSCRIPTION
This news story gave me a chuckle .
Despite the deluge of stories coming out since last September about Wall Street executives ripping off billions , this one manages to stand out .
The company of billionaire buyout king , Steve Schwarzman , who recently blew a cool million on a birthday party for himself , is being sued over the sharing of a Financial Times subscriber account .
These accounts can cost up to $ 300 per annum .
The Financial Times claims that a " senior employee " at the firm opened one account under the name " the blackstonegroup " with " blackstone " as the password .
( I need to try logging in with that . )
The account then set off alarms at the FT when the " subscriber " accessed far more files than any one mere mortal could be expected to .
Apparently , judging by the IP numbers associated with this user , he or she also zipped around the globe at something approaching the speed of light .
A closer look revealed " widespread use of the single , individual account " by Blackstone employees located both in the US and abroad .
The suit also alleged the abuse goes back as far as 2002 .
Blackstone 's penny - pinching ways stand in stark contrast to the way Schwarzman lives .
Two years ago , his wife threw a $ 3 million 60th - birthday party for the buyout king that featured 500 guests , and included a performance by Rod Stewart .
A Wall Street Journal story chronicled Schwarzman 's fondness for $ 40 crab legs and for running up weekend food bills of $ 3,000 .
The Financial Times is suing both Blackstone and 100 unnamed individuals , which it refers to as John Does 1 through 100 , for copyright infringement and violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
The Financial Times said it is currently uncertain of the identities of John Does 1 through 100 , but said it will name them personally if granted a discovery process that will allow them to be identified .
There 's a very funny picture of Steve Schwarzman with the story .
The lesson here is that wealthy people tend to be very tight - fisted when it comes to parting with money .
Just read their biographies to see that this is an almost universal rule .
However , that stinginess is an integral part of what helped to make them multi-millionaires or billionaires in the first place .
Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - Ky. ) , already in political trouble for 2010 , did n’t help matters any over the weekend .
At a Lincoln Day Dinner speech over the weekend , Bunning predicted that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would likely be dead from pancreatic cancer in nine months , according to the Louisville Courier - Journal .
The paper reports that Bunning reiterated his support of conservative judges , saying “ that ’s going to be in place very shortly because Ruth Bader Ginsburg … has cancer . ”
“ Bad cancer .
The kind you do n’t get better from , ” Bunning went on .
“ Even though she was operated on , usually nine months is the longest that anybody would live after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer . ”
News of his comments comes as Bunning continues to take fire from the very Senate campaign committee tasked to help his re-election .
PolitickerKY , a Kentucky - based political website , reported that state Senate President David Williams met with officials at the National Republican Senatorial Committee to explore a primary campaign against Bunning .
The report suggested that operatives of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were working to assist Williams in a potential primary campaign -- and that McConnell 's pollster is commissioning a survey to assess Williams ’ viability against Bunning .

The $ 787 billion federal spending spree we are all but required by law to call a “ stimulus package ” is many things , all of which are thoroughly contemptible and economically ruinous .
It is a veritable piñata of plunder made plump with plentiful perks and payouts to various Democratic Party - aligned parasites .
For the devout Keynesian , the measure is the fiscal equivalent of hard - core pornography ; perhaps this is the only sense in which it should be called a “ stimulus ” bill .
One imagines the typical Keynesian , his face flushed , his pupils dilated , sweat beading on his upper lip , hair sprouting on his palms , grunting : “ Oh , that ’s it baby — spend harder !
Harder ! ”
Of course , the truly hardcore Keynesians , like Paul Krugman , are cursed with sensibilities so coarsened by collectivism that only the economic equivalent of a snuff film will stimulate their prurient interests .
The act is also a useful instrument for exposing the purulent hypocrisy of most Republican congressmen and governors , none of whom ( with one valiant exception ) displayed so much as a particle of concern over federal profligacy during the reign of Bush the Lesser .
Several of the Republican congressmen who opposed the spending bill are poised to take political credit once the hijacked wealth is sluiced into their districts .
Likewise , many Republican governors — save a few who are wrestling with their conscience , and will probably win — have outgrown whatever principles they may have had and are eager to be in receipt of whatever stolen wealth Washington deigns to send their way .
As with all government spending , the fraudulent “ stimulus ” measure will devour wealth rather than creating it by abetting the growth of government employment at the expense of private productivity .
The only people who will actually benefit from the “ stimulus ” package are those belonging to what the Brits call the “ Quango Class . ”
“ Quango , ” a term I learned only recently , refers to QUAsi- Non-Governmental Organizations , ” or what are more commonly called “ public / private partnerships . ”
Minette Marrin of the London Sunday Times , who introduced me to the term , describes “ Quangocrats ” as “ the vast and growing army of state sector workers — public servants , civil servants , whatever you call them … the actual providers and arrangers of public services .
You can find them in any town hall or local authority … . ”
In socialist Britain , as in the corporate socialist ( that is , fascist ) USA , private sector businesses that actually produce desired goods and offer useful services are shedding jobs by the million ; private citizens are cinching in their belts and — as their retirement plans evaporate — contemplating the prospect of ending their days by expiring with their noses still firmly attached to whatever grindstone is still operating in this economically blighted land .
Meanwhile , writes Marrin , the public is beginning to suspect that “ very large numbers of state sector people are … doing wasteful non-jobs , which we do n’t want to pay anyone for doing … [ And ] the government keeps on creating these jobs despite constant , informed protest . ”
Those who find themselves thus employed are often “ deeply … incompetent and yet very rarely face the consequences of their failure ” and enjoy “ secure pensions and security of employment ” with the option of taking “ very early retirement on full pensions ” even as the rest of us will have to bear increasingly onerous taxes — both directly and through inflation — in order to provide the Quangocrats with the benefits to which they feel themselves entitled .
Is this the “ kind of thing that drives a patient man or woman to fury ? ” Marrin continues .
“ I think so . ”
Although things are bad for our trans -Atlantic cousins , it ’s actually worse on this side of the Great Pond .
Ours is the largest and most expensive government any population has ever inflicted on itself .
And despite its pretense of being some variety of federal republic —
I ’ll pause briefly for the hysterical sarcastic laughter to subside … there , all done ?
— the Regime is as monolithic as the enigmatic extraterrestrial artifact from Kubrick ’s cinematic acid trip 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
This can be demonstrated in many ways , not least of which is the way purportedly local governments are eager to reconstitute themselves as “ stimulus soviets ” — appendages of the central government in charge of receiving and disburse the plundered funds .
Just across the Snake River from where I live can be found Oregon ’s Malheur County .
Pat Caldwell , the editor of the county ’s sole daily ( actually , six - times - a - week ) newspaper , the Argus Observer , recently explained how “ a select group of officials banded together and staged a number of meetings to work out a priority list regarding what project[s ] , if any , should gain federal taxpayer dollars . ”
Oh , sure , Caldwell continued , there are some who contend that the whole process is hopelessly corrupt and immoral .
But “ once one gets past philosophical issues tied to the stimulus … the fact is that the money could be a god- send for a financially strapped county like Malheur . ”
Unlike many others in the media , Caldwell had the minimal decency to mention that the taxpayers themselves had no effective voice in this process .
But hey , he points out , the good news is that the “ stimulus ” bill “ is a huge taxpayer - filled money trough , and just about everyone is going to get a chance to take a big swig . ”
Well — no .
Some will be permitted to swig at the local trough ; the rest of us will be hewers of wood to build that trough , and carriers of the water to be swigged therefrom .
And while we ’re hewing and carrying , whatever we ’ve managed to save will be stealthily stolen from us — via inflation - funded deficit spending — to provide for the continued comfort of the privileged swigging class once the wells run dry .
We are constantly urged to admire the “ sacrifice ” of “ public servants , ” and to revile the “ greed ” and “ selfishness ” of those who choose to make an honest living in the private sphere .
Yet public “ service ” is frequently a much more lucrative racket than honest private work .
Witness the fact , reported in a Washington Post column by Chris Edwards in August 2006 , that the average federal civilian employee is paid twice the amount that was earned by the average private sector worker — a little more than $ 106,000 per year , as compared to an annual salary of $ 56,000 .
Note as well that while real estate prices are plummeting throughout most of the country , the suburbs and exurbs of the Imperial Capital continue to boom , thanks in no small measure to the metastatic growth of government and the lucrative compensation enjoyed by the federal nomenklatura .
Indeed , government “ service ” offers a much faster route to wealth than entrepreneurial ( that is , “ risk - taking ” ) capitalism .
It also offers incomparable security , with respect to both employment and retirement .
Forbes magazine begins a study of the “ Gilt - Edged Pensions ” enjoyed by those in the “ public ” sector by highlighting the case of 46 - year - old millionaire Glenn Goss , formerly of Delray Beach , Florida .
He actually retired from his first job — which paid an annual salary of $ 90,000 — at age 42 .
He immediately began to draw a guaranteed $ 65,000 annual pension .
He then took a second job , with comparable benefits , in nearby Highland Beach .
Goss ’s first job was working as a police commander .
His second position is chief of police in Highland Beach .
Notes Forbes : “ He is already worth nearly $ 2 million , based on the present value of his vested retirement benefits .
Looked at another way , he is a $ 2 million liability to Florida taxpayers . ”
Eugene Gordon , a former assistant city attorney in San Diego , recently retired .
His highest base salary was $ 152,792 — a bit steep for an assistant city attorney , one would think .
His taxpayer - funded pension , however , will be at least $ 235,000 a year .
Now , granted , any “ public servant ” is more valuable as an ex-employee , since he ca n’t do as much damage to the public weal .
But Gordon ’s retirement goldmine — a product of an institutional double - dipping scheme called the Deferred Retirement Option Program — is but one example ( albeit an extreme one ) of the extravagant pension plans enjoyed by government employees nation - wide .
It ’s not just police and city attorneys who are reveling in retirement dough .
John A. Brennan , Jr. , a former Massachusetts state legislator , retired a while ago from a volunteer position on the Malden Public Library Board of Trustees .
He missed a full five - sixths of the board ’s meetings during the past four years .
Yet , owing to his superior knowledge of how to game the system , Brennan was able to use his board membership to enhance his pension package : Instead of $ 19,097 a year , he will now receive $ 41,088 a year .
If he lives out the current 78 - year life expectancy , Brennan will receive $ 740,000 in payouts .
Notes the Boston Globe : " The cost of almost all of that pension , according to state law , must be split proportionately between the state and Malden , a city often strapped for cash , including a $ 1.5 million cut in state aid for the current year . ”
A depression , as Lew Rockwell likes to point out , is more properly called a “ correction . ”
It should lay bare clusters of investment errors , patterns of mal - investment , and pockets of entrenched corruption , which are to be cured ruthlessly and efficiently .
But there will be no depression where the tax - fed Quangocrats are concerned .
One purpose of the “ stimulus ” bill is to keep their ugly truths buried beneath a thick blanket of redistributed wealth .
Those of us in the productive sector will scrimp and save and strain and starve — and the Quangocrats will continue to thrive behind an ever - thickening wall of official protection .
As the Sunday Times ’s Marrin put it , this state of affairs will eventually stimulate the fury of a patient man .
Or , as the late philosopher - sage Sam Kinison once put it , this is the kind of thing that turns Mr. Hand into Mr. Fist .

The number of stars points to there being many rocky planets
There could be one hundred billion Earth - like planets in our galaxy , a US conference has heard .
Dr Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Science said many of these worlds could be inhabited by simple lifeforms .
He was speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago .
So far , telescopes have been able to detect just over 300 planets outside our Solar System .
Very few of these would be capable of supporting life , however .
Most are gas giants like our Jupiter , and many orbit so close to their parent stars that any microbes would have to survive roasting temperatures .
But , based on the limited numbers of planets found so far , Dr Boss has estimated that each Sun - like star has on average one " Earth - like " planet .
This simple calculation means there would be huge numbers capable of supporting life .
" Not only are they probably habitable but they probably are also going to be inhabited , " Dr Boss told BBC News .
" But I think that most likely the nearby ' Earths ' are going to be inhabited with things which are perhaps more common to what Earth was like three or four billion years ago . "
That means bacterial lifeforms .
Dr Boss estimates that Nasa 's Kepler mission , due for launch in March , should begin finding some of these Earth - like planets within the next few years .
Recent work at Edinburgh University tried to quantify how many intelligent civilisations might be out there .
The research suggested there could be thousands of them .

The Prada - wearers are lecturing Obama about arrogance .
A senior Vatican official on Saturday attacked US President Barack Obama for “ arrogance ” for overturning a ban on state funding for family - planning groups that carry out or facilitate abortions overseas .
It is “ the arrogance of someone who believes they are right , in signing a decree which will open the door to abortion and thus to the destruction of human life , ” Archbishop Rino Fisichella was quoted as saying by the Corriere della Sera daily … .
“ What is important is to know how to listen … without locking oneself into ideological visions with the arrogance of a person who , having the power , thinks they can decide on life and death , ” he added .
Apparently it ’s finally sinking it at the Vatican that Him - bo has left the building .
Then there ’s this :
“ I do not believe that those who voted for him took into consideration ethical themes , which were astutely left aside during the election debate .
The majority of the American population does not take the same position as the president and his team , ” he added .
First off , get a spokesman who speaks English , and not German spoken as English .
Second , do n’t lecture us about our elections , when your election is based on a smokestack .
And finally , being lectured to about ethics by a regime run by a former member of the Hitler Youth is , well , choice to say the least .
The Vatican had no problem embracing George Bush , and overlooked his innumerable sins , all because Bush was pro-life and anti-gay .
The Vatican had no problem with Bush ’s warmongering , his torture , or his lack of interesting in the plight of the disadvantaged .
Funny that none of that ever bothered the oh - so - ethical Vatican .
One final point the Vatican keeps overlooking .
We ’re not a Catholic country , and nobody cares what they think .
So go away .

Tonight is the series finale of Stargate Atlantis .
We 'll miss that great SGA humor most of all — here are the moments that made us laugh hardest .
The hardest part about losing Stargate Atlantis is that we 're losing yet another scifi series that did n't take itself so seriously , but respected the actors enough that it did n't become Knight Rider .
Advertisement
SGA , for me , was less about the Wraith , or even character development , but more about what ridiculous one - liner will Ronon try to work this week .
Sure , I cheered when McKay bagged the girl and when Sheppard saved someone 's life ... once again .
But what I 'll remember from the crew of Atlantis was the funny .
It 's the string of clever moments ( some more than others ) is what I 'll look back on fondly over the years .
And yes , I 'll light a candle to say goodbye to dear , sweet Rodney McKay — but he really , truly is only as good as the people who roll their eyes around him .

So here are , in my humble opinion the top 10 funniest moments from Stargate Atlantis .
( Please add on your favorites as well . )
10 . " Crap Indeed "
See above clip , why is everything more funny when the Asgard say it ?
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
9. Steve The Wraith
Only because I will forever know him as " Steve . "
8. World of Warcraft " A Silent Passion "
' Nother WOW Reference
7. " Duet "
The entire episode is hilarious — even Ronon has a few great one - liners here and there .
But check out McKay 's face , after the big kiss with Dr. Carson Beckett .
This episode beats out " Trio " as the funniest episode in my mind , but only by a hair .
6 . " I 'm sorry for shooting everyone "
Sheppard has to apologize , in " Phantoms . "
5. Rodney Always Eating Everyone's Food
Check it out , just about every time someone is injured Rodney eats their food .
4. Ford Never Being Allowed To Name Anything
I could n't find a video clip of this but looking back it 's pretty cute how Sheppard never let Ford name anything .
Thanks for pointing this out , SGA fans .
It 's pretty cute — until he goes crazy .
3. McKay Gets Shot By An Arrow
The Perfect Response
2. Canada Jokes
Advertisement
Between calling the ZPM the " Zed PM " and listening to Sheppard explaining hockey to Ronon , the Canada jokes keep a comin ' , and they 're hilarious .
Not because Canada is a bad place , but because they filmed SGA there , and it 's good to be able to tease your own .
1. McKay Is Invulnerable
" I shot him . "

But how the crap does he not have MEREDITH — it 's his name ! )
Layoffs or Not , How Some Ways Companies Let Employees
Go
Layoffs are never pleasant , but there are some layoff procedures that just makes you feel even worst .
I ’ve heard of a few recently that caught my attention as either unique , disastrous , or both .
Here they are and hopefully business owners can read this and understand how these layoffs not only burn bridges , they actually affect productivity for the people that stay on board .
The One by One – This is a crazy method which will sure kill your employee ’s moral .
Some companies will fire one person each hour for that day , one by one , until they are done with the layoffs .
You might be saying good bye to your long term friend and showing sympathy one hour and be booted yourself the next .
The Yes and No Rooms – During the dot com bust , floors of buildings were being laid off .
One of the least humane ways of layoffs are when everyone would be asked to go to two rooms , where they would wait to see whether they were the room that stays or the one that needs to leave .
My Keys Were Changed – Some companies would just change the security code to prevent you from even enter the building when you get to the office in the morning .
I mean , come on .
Ca n’t you even save me some gas by telling me the day before ?
Just Quit Already – Some supervisors do n’t have the guts to tell people that they are being laid off and instead do everything they can to get you to quit .
Make Them Fight for
It – I did n’t think this was done in reality but my friend told me that her employer asked two people to go into the room and told them that one person is going to be let go and for the two to give reasons why he / she should be the one staying .
I sincerely wish that those people who do this end up losing all the good employees .
Giving
You the Chicken – Here ’s some historic and culture sharing .
Back in the old days when many people work for small businesses in Hong Kong , the owner would always treat all the employees for dinner during Chinese New Years .
It is said that during the meal , the boss giving you the chicken leg means that you are fired .
( I heard this from a TV show long ago and I can’t verify it now , but I remember believing the story at the time )
The Only Kind That is Acceptable – Every employee should be told via a company get together in exactly what ’s happening and each supervisor should have heart - to - heart talks with the employees separately and let them know honestly why they are being let go .
If I spent 40 + hours working for you , I deserve to at least get an explanation .
It ’s already bad that we are being laid off .
Please do n’t upset us even more by doing it the wrong way .
In a new report by the Center for American Progress , researchers David Madland and Karla Walter argue that increasing the number of unionized workers in the United States could stimulate the economy .
Increasing union rates by just 5 % would create $ 25.5 billion in new wages .
According the authors , the economy is driven primarily by consumer purchasing , which would increase if workers had more money .
They cite the fact that 70 % of the nation ’s economy revolves around consumer spending , which has declined as workers have lost money in the current economy .
Unions Key to Increasing Wages
The best way to remedy this problem is to increase employee wages , which can be done by expanding the number of workers in unions .
The authors argue that the since the 1980s workers purchasing power has declined even as productivity–along with corporate profits –have grown .
The report argues that unions were responsible for the growth of the middle class in the mid-1900s :
“ Unions paved the way to the middle class for millions of American workers and pioneered benefits such as paid health care and pensions along the way ”
Unions –which fought for their members interests–organized to tie wage increases to productivity growth :
“ Workers helped the economy grow during this time period by becoming ever more productive , but they received only a small share of the new wealth they helped create .
Throughout the middle part of the 20th century –a period when unions were stronger –American workers generated economic growth by increasing their productivity , and they were rewarded with higher wages .
But this link between greater productivity and higher wages has broken down . ”
However , while productivity has increased , wages have grown slowly :
“ Prior to the 1980s , productivity gains and workers ’ wages moved in tandem : as workers produced more per hour , they saw a commensurate increase in their earnings .
Yet wages and productivity growth have decoupled since the late 1970s .
Looking from 1980 to 2008 , nationwide worker productivity grew by 75.0 percent , while workers ’ inflation - adjusted average wages increased by only 22.6 percent , which means that workers were compensated for only 30.2 percent of their productivity gains . ”
As productivity grows , profits grow , meaning that wage increases could be easily paid for in many industries .
Benefits of being Part of a Union
The report cites numerous benefits for being represented by a union , particularly with regard to wages and health benefits :
Union workers nationwide are 28.2 percent more likely to be covered by employer - provided health insurance
Union workers are 53.9 percent more likely to have employer - provided pensions
Over the four - year period between 2004 and 2007 , unionized workers ’ wages were on average 11.3 percent higher than non-union workers with similar characteristics .
The report further argues that wage increases would likely spread to non-unionized workplaces as well , as companies would likely try to match union salaries to avoid unionization and to match what competitors offer .
Increases could be Won through Employee Free Choice Act
The authors say that a significant increase in the number of unionized workers could be achieved if Congress passes the Employee Free Choice Act .
The Employee Free Choice
Act is legislation currently pending before Congress that would make it easier for workers to form unions .
The authors write :
“ Workers attempting to unionize currently face a hostile legal environment and are commonly intimidated by aggressive anti-union employers .
The Employee Free Choice
Act would help workers who want to join a union do so by ensuring fairness in the union selection process . ”
Current labor laws give employers a number of advantages–via codified and extra-legal but rarely prosecuted tactics –that enable them to prevent workers from forming unions .

Getting Acquainted With the ext4 File System
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 24 , 2009
The majority of computer users do n't spend much time thinking about the file system their operating system uses .
Granted , people installing alternative operating systems might give more consideration to the available file systems than the general population -- unless there 's a specific need for a certain file system , many go with their distribution 's default option .
While your file system type is n't something you should need to think about regularly , and making an informed choice for machines with specialized , dedicated tasks is important , usually choosing the default file system type for your operating system is fine .
Several Linux distributions ( including Fedora and Ubuntu ) are planning to move their default file systems from ext3 to ext4 in upcoming releases , while a number of distributions already ( or will soon ) support ext4 as a file system option .
IBM has a ( rather surprisingly ) interesting look at what 's different about the ext4 file system , including details on why some changes were made , and how moving from ext3 to ext4 works .
The ext4 file system was declared stable with the December release of the 2.6.28 Linux kernel , and borrows some of the best features of other file system types .
For instance , ext4's delayed allocation function was directly influenced by features found in the XFS and ZFS file systems .
Scalability was a major focus in ext4 development , and that 's reflected in one of the file system 's most noteworthy features -- supporting file systems up to 1 exabyte in size ( as an illustration : this file system can function even if it's large enough take up one million 1 TB hard drives ) .
Files within the ext4 system can be up to 16 TB in size , and the number of subdirectories is essentially unlimited ( indexing has been specially optimized , however , so that lookup times remain speedy ) .
It might seem excessive with the technology that currently exists , but the ext4 development team figured looking at the longer term now will return benefits far in to the future .
The ext4 file system , like its predecessor , is a journaling system .
In an effort to increase reliability , decrease corruption , and spend less time on file system checks ( fsck ) , an online defragmentation tool helps maintain both the file system and individual files that ( inevitably ) become fragmented over time .
There are a few resources on how to get the fairly backwards - compatible ext4 running on your system , and some further information from the Fedora Project , which plans to roll out ext4 as its default file system in May , when Fedora 11 becomes available .
Ubuntu has seen some good results with the ext4 file system when tested in the Jaunty alpha , but so far plans on holding back on making ext4 the default file system until October 's Karmic release .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Harry Markopolos , a former investment manager who tried to warn U.S. regulators about Bernard Madoff , joined lawmakers in blasting the Securities and Exchange Commission but said he was forwarding more tips to the agency .
Markopolos told a congressional hearing on Wednesday that SEC staff were neither willing nor able to uncover what Madoff , arrested in December and charged with a record - shattering $ 50 - billion fraud , was really doing .
Calling SEC staff “ too slow , too young and too undereducated , ” Markopolos said the regulator was hindered by lawyers , did not understand red flags , could not do the math and was captive to the financial industry .
“ They looked at the size of Madoff and said he ’s a big firm and we do n’t attack big firms , ” said Markopolos , who became aware of Madoff when the firm he worked for tried to pursue the same kind of strategy Madoff did but never got the same steady , strong returns .
Members of the House Financial Services subcommittee hailed Markopolos but excoriated five SEC officials who declined to answer specific questions about the Madoff case , citing ongoing investigations .
“ You could n’t find your backside with two hands if the lights were on ...
You have totally and thoroughly failed in your mission , ” said New York Democratic Rep. Gary Ackerman ,
Markopolos said he knows the names of a dozen so - called feeder funds that helped Madoff raise money from pension funds and wealthy investors and that he would turn these over to regulators this week .
Markopolos , now a fraud investigator , said Madoff could not have acted alone , citing accountants and people helping convey money to his scheme .
Madoff was arrested after his sons went to authorities saying their father had confessed to them .
LOW POINT FOR THE SEC
Madoff , a former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market , has been accused of running a massive Ponzi scheme in which he paid off earlier investors with money from later investors .
Asked if there were other Madoffs waiting to be discovered , Markopolos said he was forwarding information to the SEC about a Ponzi scheme of around $ 1 billion .
For the SEC , Wednesday ’s testimony marked what some insiders called the worst day in the agency ’s history , further tarnishing its reputation and sending morale to a new low .
Lawmakers angrily questioned the SEC ’s head of enforcement , Linda Chatman Thomsen ; the agency ’s top examiner Lori Richards ; Erik Sirri , the SEC ’s trading and markets chief ; Andrew Donohue , who is in charge of investment management and the SEC ’s acting general counsel , Andrew Vollmer .

Capital markets subcommittee chairman , Paul Kanjorski , a Democrat from Pennsylvania , threatened to reform the SEC out of existence .
And Ackerman , who personally escorted Markopolos out of the hearing room , told the SEC officials : “ We thought the enemy was Mr. Madoff , I think it was you .
You were the shield , ”
Markopolos described his failed efforts to get regulators to probe Madoff from 2000 on .
“ I gift - wrapped and delivered the largest Ponzi scheme to them , ” he told the lawmakers .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
Markopolos became suspicious of Madoff ’s ways in 1996 after he and a friend pored over mathematical models that might recreate Madoff ’s returns only to determine that there was no way Madoff could consistently outperform the markets .
HARSH WORDS
Harsh words were lobbed at former SEC employees including Meaghan Cheung , the agency ’s New York branch chief whom Markopolos contacted in 2005 .
Cheung , Markopolos said , was arrogant , never grasped the concepts in his report or asked him any questions .
Cheung left the SEC in fall of 2008 .
The SEC division heads told the panel that the agency was considering a number of changes in light of the Madoff case , including how frequently investment advisers are examined .
Thomsen , who appeared visibly shaken during the hearing , responded to charges that her enforcement division had too many lawyers .
“ Within enforcement we have lots of accountants , lots of market specialists and investigators . ”
Republican Rep. Spencer Bachus , of Alabama , was the only lawmaker who praised the agency .
“ We do n’t mean to convey that there has n’t been good work by the SEC , ” he said at the end of the hearing .
Kanjorski said he was going to introduce legislation that would give the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board , the authority to examine the auditors of broker - dealers .
Madoff ’s auditor was a small , unknown firm that was not registered with the PCAOB .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) 
Starbucks is moving into the instant coffee market as it works to shake off its reputation as a seller of expensive coffee drinks .
The company , based in Seattle , plans to unveil Via instant coffee on Tuesday and make it available next month .
Starbucks says Via was in development for 20 years and replicates the taste of its coffee .
Three single - serve Via packets will cost $ 2.95 , and 12 packets will be $ 9.95 .
The move pits the company , which already sells its coffee beans in grocery stores and in its own shops , against giant food sellers with established instant coffee brands , including Nestle , the maker of Nescafe , and Kraft Foods , the maker of Sanka .
Recently , Microsoft released Internet Explorer 8 , which boasted much better standards compliance than previous iterations of the browser .
While it passed the Acid2 test , IE8 failed miserably in the Acid3 test , and many people criticised Microsoft for it .
Microsoft Australia ’s Nick Hodge has stated that Microsoft purposefully decided not to support Acid3 , because the test tests against draft standards .
The Acid3 test tests against various standards that are not yet actually standards , as they ’re in draft at the W3C , and not yet agreed upon and and approved .
Because of this , Hodge states that it does not make sense to fully support Acid3 just yet .
“ The concern Microsoft has is that if we burnt [ draft standards ] into Internet Explorer 8 and passed Acid3 with 120 percent and then deploy it on so many machines , especially in the enterprise , [ we have made draft standards de- facto standards ] when the W3C will then want to innovate on the [ evolving ] standards , ” Hodge explained , “ We passed Acid2 with 100 percent which tests against recommendations from the W3C .
Acid2 is about recommended standards , standards that are locked and loaded . ”
He went on to say that Microsoft learnt its lesson with Internet Explorer 6 .
“ Our learning comes from IE6 .
With IE6 we adopted some non-recommended standards and interpreted them in a certain way .
The end result of that has been painful web development . ”
It surely is an interesting view on things , but it ’s also a flawed one .
The standards tested by Acid3 might not be official standards just yet , but with Opera , WebKit , and Gecko all working towards supporting it , Trident could ’ve just followed and make it the standard .
This would ’ve certainly earned Microsoft some good karma , something it could use in the browser market ( what , with IE bleeding market share like a decapitated bunny ) .
The day began gently here on the U.S. - Mexico border .
The cold , starry sky gave way to the orange smile of a sunrise .
Over at the Pancho Villa Cafe , short - order cook Maria Gutierrez whipped up her egg and chopped tortilla special .
Down the street , Martha Skinner , still in her housecoat , brewed a pot of coffee for guests at her bed and breakfast .
Her husband , the local judge , walked two blocks to his courtroom to hear the week ’s entire caseload : one pet owner cited for keeping her dog chained up , another for allowing her dog off - leash .
Columbus , a settlement of 1,800 people clinging to a wind - swept patch of high desert in southern New Mexico , was a picture of tranquillity .
But less than three miles south , in the once - quaint Mexican town of Palomas , a war is being waged .
Over the last year , a drug feud that has killed more than 1,350 people in sprawling Ciudad Juarez has spread to tiny Palomas , 70 miles west , where more than 40 people have been gunned down , a dozen within a baseball toss of the border .
More -- no one knows how many -- have been kidnapped , and the Palomas police chief fled across the border last year and has asked for political asylum .
Now Columbus is on edge .
A haven for baby boomer retirees seeking cheap living , small - town values and blissful , if unpolished , solitude , Columbus ca n’t quite believe that a bloody brawl has broken out on its doorstep .
The anxiety increased recently when Columbus disbanded its five - member police force after a local political squabble , putting its safety in the hands of the county sheriff based half an hour away .
Many are ruing the decision .
Angry and fretful residents packed a recent village trustees meeting to argue the case .
“ What is going on across the border is going to go on for a while , folks , ” said Joseph Rivera , a regal figure with a bushy , silver mustache who works for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection .
“ People are leaving Palomas like jack rabbits and coming here . ”
Robert Odom , a former town trustee , warned that the town was pushing its luck .
“ So far , knock on wood , it ’s been narco - traffickers attacking their own people , ” he said .
“ But it ’s only a matter of time before it spills over here . ”
The last time an internal war in Mexico spilled over into Columbus , as every schoolchild here knows , was in 1916 , when the Mexican revolutionary Francisco “ Pancho ” Villa led a predawn raid that killed 18 Americans and touched off an international incident .
A yearlong U.S. military expedition in Mexico failed to capture Villa .
Time healed those wounds , though .
A state park and a handful of businesses in Columbus bear Villa ’s name .
And the town celebrates his assault each March by inviting Mexicans on horseback over to reenact the raid .
Like so many towns hugging the 2,000 - mile frontier between the United States and Mexico , Columbus and Palomas are inextricably linked .
Several hundred children , most of them U.S. citizens born to Mexican parents , cross from Mexico daily to attend public school , while some Columbus residents commute daily to work in Palomas , or to see the less expensive dentists , pharmacists and auto mechanics there .
But another , newer brand of cross - border activity has fed the town ’s paranoia .
Several residents of Palomas have bought property in Columbus recently , paying cash .
Skinner , the B&B owner who ’s also the town ’s lone real estate agent , had her best sales year in 2008 , even with the market nationwide in a nose - dive .
New Cadillac Escalades , and cars with thousand - dollar chrome rims , have appeared suddenly , in a town without a single traffic light .
Columbus residents think they know what those trends mean :
The men who traffic drugs in Mexico are moving their families to Columbus for sanctuary .
And where the drug lords go , residents assume , violence is sure to follow .
“ Everybody knows this is happening .
It ’s a small town and everyone knows everybody else , ” said Eugene Sierra , 57 , a former Columbus police chief .
“ Our concern is that they ’ll be followed by people who want to do away with them , and innocent people in the line of fire will be hurt .
Without any law enforcement here , it ’s wide open . ”
Columbus would appear to be about as well protected as any border city in America .
The crossing here is flanked by six miles of 15 - to 18 - foot - tall fencing and another 35 miles of waist - high vehicle barriers .
Motion sensors and cameras sprout among fields of onions and jalapenos , and a beefed - up Border Patrol force of 350 has helped drive arrests of illegal crossers to a tenth of what they were two years ago .
Luna County Sheriff Raymond Cobos said drug seizures are down sharply , and violence linked to Mexican drug cartels remains rare -- though the shooting death of a 15 - year - old high school student in Deming late last year appears to have been drug - related .
“ There are definitely drug connections here , but it ’s hard for them to carry on their trade openly , ” Cobos said .
“ So they have to go way , way underground . ”
The assurances of the sheriff and from the Border Patrol have n’t calmed fears .
Some of those kidnapped in Mexico have relatives in Columbus .
Photos of men beheaded by the cartels pop up on cellphone messages here , a not - so - subtle warning of what can happen to those who betray the drug families .
Columbus residents who cross into Palomas say they are unnerved by the eerie calm of what once was a bustling , growing community of 7,000 .
The population has fallen by a third and tourist crossings have slowed to a trickle .
On a recent weekday the streets were empty , save for a lone mariachi band serenading a local man on his birthday .
There ’s no hospital in Palomas .
The Columbus ambulance service averages a call a day at the border , mostly for heart attacks and pregnancies .
Ken Riley , an EMT for the service who lives in Palomas , considers the nature of the call before deciding whether to meet his colleagues at the border .
“ I have my own little rule , ” Riley said .
“ Any time there ’s a call for an ambulance at the port of entry , and it ’s for someone with a gunshot wound , I pull my covers up and stay in bed . ”
Columbus has had long - standing trouble keeping a police force .
The latest crisis began three months ago when the town closed its dilapidated police station because of a faulty lock on the evidence room .
Not long afterward , an officer was injured while trying to break up a bar fight and two off - duty officers were suspended .
Then , the police chief resigned .
With no police station , and just one police officer , the town dissolved the department and asked Sheriff Cobos to take over .
But the sheriff ’s 30 deputies , based in Deming , cover an arealarger than the state of Rhode Island , and the county was asking for $ 26,000 a month to provide policing here .
Residents felt exposed and they directed their fury at the mayor , Eddie Espinoza .
Like his constituents , Espinoza , a burly , combative 49 - year - old retired Navy man , was concerned about the disintegration across the border .
On a Sunday morning last year , he was undergoing a root canal in Palomas when bandits broke in and robbed his dentist .
“ It took all of three minutes , ” Espinoza recalled .
But the mayor had n’t had much luck with his police chiefs .
Since his landslide election in 2006 , six chiefs have left .
A few quit ; he fired the others .
“ I do n’t know why it ’s so hard to be a police officer in Columbus , ” Espinoza said .
“ It ’s not that difficult to be a police officer . ”
Some blame the mayor for hiring poorly .
“ They have this history of hiring people we ’ve fired , and then expecting great results , ” Cobos said .
One of the mayor ’s main critics is Robert Odom , a 58 - year - old writer who moved here from Santa Fe , N.M. , three years ago .
Odom , the author of “ Autobiography of a Redneck Hindu , ” about his spiritual journey , was elected a village trustee last year but resigned a few months ago in a dispute with Espinoza .
“ We need our own police department , no matter what , ” Odom said , preparing a pot of French press coffee at the home he shares with his partner .
“ It ’s impossible to live next door to someone -- and we live literally next door to Palomas -- without being affected by what ’s happening in their yard . ”
Odom and 70 other residents signed a petition last month urging the mayor to “ save our Columbus police . ”
Espinoza seemed to get the message : within days , he appointed a committee to search for a new chief .
As for Odom and the petition co-signers , Espinoza said , “ Columbus has its share of characters , and you ’ve got to be able to be tolerant . ”
He paused .
“ Sometimes it ’s difficult having to deal with the public . ”
Espinoza agreed with his opponents , though , that the city ca n’t count on the county or federal authorities for protection .
“ The problem is that we ’re like a stepchild to everybody , ” he said .
“ We ’re just a small municipality . ”
It was , in fact , the drowsy remoteness of this community that attracted people like Skinner .
Now 71 , she came here 20 years ago from Glendale , Calif. , and built Martha ’s Place Inn .
She preceded Espinoza as mayor , and during her tenure the population tripled , driven mostly by retirees who fell in love with the mild weather , rustic beauty and low cost of living .
( The top sale price for a home last year ?
$ 82,000 . )
Farming has been the economic backbone , supplemented by tourists who came to see Pancho Villa State Park , Villa ’s death mask at the depot museum or the restored buildings on Broadway that figured in Villa ’s raid .
A few came to see City of the Sun , a commune where residents live in homes built from rusted car parts , jalapeno barrels , tires , bottles and other recycled material .
( “ They ’re different up there , but they ’re nice people , ” said Linda Werner , the town librarian . )
But most tourists came to take advantage of inexpensive medical care and pharmaceuticals across the border .
That trade has mostly evaporated with the drug violence .
Martha ’s
Place has been kept afloat for the last year by temporary workers building the border fence .
“ The tourism business has been awful , ” Skinner said .
“ But that fence has kept us in business . ”
The inn ’s guests one recent week included a customs officer , a fence welder , a contractor working on lighting at the border fence and a Los Angeles writer researching his next novel .
The welder was forced to check out early , though .
Four state police officers showed up on a cold night and arrested him at gunpoint , leading him away in handcuffs to face an auto theft charge .
“ There ’s nothing like a small town , ” Skinner said the next morning , pausing from a game of computer solitaire and smiling serenely .
“ It ’s like living in a comic book most days . ”
But that small - town charm is showing signs of fatigue .
“ I wake up every morning and thank God my wife and I found this little place , ” local developer Gene McCall told the village trustees recently .
Then , pointing his walking cane at the mayor , he added , “ Let ’s keep it that way . ”

Like all online video sites , Hulu is at the mercy of its content partners :
If someone yanks Hulu 's Web rights to a show , Hulu has to pull the show .
The best Hulu can do is offer a warning so that it 's not a complete surprise to its viewers .
So it 's understandable that Hulu 's viewers might have gotten upset when the site deleted almost three seasons worth of FX's " It 's Always Sunny In Philadelphia " with basically no notice .
( We 'd note that the show 's recent popularity should be credited in large part to Hulu . )
In a blog post today , Hulu CEO Jason Kilar apologized to his customers for the inconvenience , vowed to give longer notice in the future , and replaced the episodes for two more weeks -- something he noted corporate relative FX " was very quick to say yes to . "
( Hulu is a joint venture of News Corp. and NBC Universal . )
But the sad - but - true reminder to Hulu 's viewers : Until digital revenue can offset media companies ' offline revenue , this is going to keep happening as content companies shift online content on - and off - sites , as TV seasons rotate , DVDs come out , etc .
Meanwhile , for the next two weeks , enjoy one of our favorite episodes .

WASHINGTON --
The drug and medical - device industries are mobilizing to gut a provision in the stimulus bill that would spend $ 1.1 billion on research comparing medical treatments , portraying it as the first step to government rationing .
The fight over the provision is highlighting the tensions behind President Barack Obama 's plan to overhaul the health - care system .
The administration hopes to expand coverage while limiting use of treatments that do n't work well , but any efforts that might reduce coverage are politically sensitive .

Lloyds TSB , the biggest mortgage bank in Britain , was nationalized this weekend by the British government .
This is bad news for the British Pound .
HBOS “ inherited ” the bad assets to Lloyds , and now it pays the price .
The British government now guarantees the banks money , but the bank , which was once successful , is now in the hands of the government .
Here ’s someone who does n’t like it at all , calling it the “ biggest bank robbery in British history ” .
This is bad for the British Pound .
Traders do n’t like these moves of bank nationalization .
Two weeks ago , the US dollar plunged on fears of nationalization .
CitiGroup and Bank of America were then on the American government ’s watch .
The British economy is deeply suffering from the global economic crisis , especially due to its big financial sector that is now getting more bruises .
Bad Banking news is n’t exclusive to Britain this weekend :
In Georgia USA , the Freedom bank is n’t free anymore .
It has been closed by the government , being the 17th bank to be closed in America since the beginning of the year .
Also in Europe , new bad news comes from banks in Belgium , but in a smaller magnitude .
The big news of nationalization in Britain might cause a bad start for the pound , which showed some relative strength last week .
Will there be a weekend gap in GBP / USD ?
-- THE MUSICAL SAW --
NOTE : 6 additional photos and a sound sample of this instrument are available .
Click here for information .
Yuppie music catalogs would have you believe that you can only play music on professional , $ 50 + musical saws .
This is simply not the case .
My very favorite saw is a $ 6 - red plastic handled " Vermont - American " off - the - shelf general purpose saw .
In general , just about any straight - backed saw ( not curved , like the old - time saws were ) will work just fine .
Some have a slightly better range than others ( you ought to see the stares I get from store clerks when I start tapping and bending their saws to determine range ! )
In other words - experiment !
A super - simple , but perfectly satisfactory bow can be made in a half hour or so out of a yardstick ( or other similar strip of wood ) , some 8 Lb nylon fishline & a few dabs of Elmer 's glue .
HOW TO MAKE THE BOW Materials needed : - A wooden yardstick , or similar piece of wood - Nylon fishing line .
8 pound test strength is best , but other strengths will work - Elmer 's , Titebond or similar harmless glue - A cake of fiddle rosin Instructions : - Cut the yardstick in half ( 18 " ) - Drill a small hole about here ( marked with asterisk ) " the other edge " ________________________________________________
| * | '------------------------------------------------'
" one edge " -
Tie one end of the fishing line through this hole - Bend the wooden strip as much as you can without breaking it - WHILE BENT * carefully wind 75 to 100 continuous loops of the line around and around and around the bow -- have the line lay against the convex part of the bow , then have it " bridge the gap " , in free air .
Wind as evenly as possible , working your way from one edge of the bow , to the other edge .
Be careful not to let the line run off the back of the bow .
*
It 's hard to keep the strip bent and wind it with the fishline at the same time -- one trick I 've used is to drill two small holes along the strip 's centerline about an inch from each end - & hook one end of a fairly stiff length of wire through one hole , bend the wood strip as much as you safely can , then hook the other end of the wire through the 2nd hole .
This wire will hold the strip in a nice bent position until the fishline can be wound on .
-
When finished winding , cut the line and tie it off to the same hole the other end is secured to , then carefully ( using your fingers ) smear Elmer 's glue over the part of the wound - on fishing line that is laying against the convex part of the wood .
This secrues the line in place so it wo n't fall off of the bow .
Be careful not to get any glue on the straight part of the line .
Allow to dry overnight or longer .
When completely dry , rub the bow over a cake of rosin for several minutes until it is thoroughly covered with rosin ( musical saws require a LOT of rosin to get such a big mass of steel vibrating ) .
HOW TO PLAY THE MUSICAL SAW
While sitting down , preferably in a straight - backed chair , clamp the saw handle ( with saw in a vertical position ) , teeth facing you , tightly between your legs .
Now with your left hand grab hold of the saw's tip like you would grab the lever of a slot machine .
Bend the whole blade leftwards 8 " to 12 " or so then rotate your left wrist a bit clockwise ( to the right ) to give the tip of the sawblade the all - important tip - bend .
The musical pitch is changed by making the " big bend " larger or smaller ( see diagram below ) -- all the while taking care to maintain the bend at the tip .
So - essentially , the properly " bent " saw takes on a bit of an " S " configuration - as shown below : ( This view is what you 'd see while sitting & playing it ) o o o <--- small bend ( MUST be maintained or saw o will not sing !
o o o o o o o o o <--- big bend ( varies musical pitch ) o o o o o o [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ___ ]
Another key point is to try to orient the bow as close to 90 degrees to the sawblade as possible .
Also , low - pitched notes are bowed closer to the saw's handle whereas higher - pitched notes are bowed further out towards the tip of the saw .
This is not hard to get used to , but does take a bit of experimentation to get right .

A pair of criminal masterminds recently executed a daring daylight robbery -- of a 99 - cent store .
Police are on the lookout for two black males carrying old Alf lunchboxes , soon - to - expire cans of pseudo - tuna , plastic spatulas , wads of crumbled dollar bills and boxes of detergent that looks like a name brand if you do n't check it too closely .
Seriously , dudes , if the name of your targeted store is " Nothing Over 99 Cents , " then your plan probably needs a little rethinking .
Compounding the brilliance , the two guys had apparently cased out the store that day before robbing it -- and wore " distinctive " footwear both times , making them easily identifiable .
They no doubt intended to leave business cards with their name and address , but had n't picked them up yet from the Print - While - U - Wait store , which they also intended to then rob .
Call Crime Stoppers with any tips .
Like , say , if the guy in the apartment next door is suddenly feasting on tins of plankton .
I remember when Grey ’s Anatomy actor ( but do we really know for how much longer ? )
T.R. Knight “ came out ” as a gay man .
I admit , I was bit disturbed – NOT because Knight was gay , but because even though we are several years into the twenty - first century , “ coming out ” – for celebrities , anyway – has barely come any farther than a freaking press release , appearances on multiple talk shows , and a month ’s worth of story material for Entertainment Tonight .
Of course , Knight ’s situation was n’t ideal ( if you remember , former fellow Grey ’s Anatomy star Isaiah Washington kind of took it upon himself to “ out ” Knight during a behind - the - scenes verbal showdown ) , and I do n’t think any of us really know if Knight would have came out so publicly had Washington not set the wheels in motion .
Given the level of public scrutiny and ignorance ( which , for the most part I believe , can be blamed on inexperience and inexposure rather than character flaws ) , I think many celebrities feel the need to hide their sexual orientation to prevent the public from viewing them a certain way .
Then , in the event someone “ outs ” them without their consent , they feel compelled to make public statements in order to smooth out any wrinkles that might develop in the public ’s view of them .
Basically , gay celebrities have stigma of their own to deal with ( as do gay noncelebs ) .
It ’s sad ( pathetic , really ) that people would automatically gauge a person ’s worth , talent , and overall likability based on his or her sexual orientation , and because of that judgment , it ’s easy to see why publicly coming out can be such a big – and tricky – deal , and one that some celebrities , such as T.R.
Knight , try to avoid if they can help it .
What ’s interesting is that , despite the fear that coming out will significantly affect their personal and professional lives in negative ways , one survey shows that more people would rather come out than admit to having a mental illness .
According to a recent Time to Change poll :
Nearly one in three people in the UK say they would find it hard to admit to having a mental health problem compared to one in five who would find it difficult to come out as gay [… ] .
You know , a person ’s health – just like a person ’s sexual orientation – is his own business .
Having bipolar disorder or being gay does n’t mean you automatically have to announce or admit anything .
According to these results ( which came from 2,300 adults ) , the fear and stigma attached to mental illness trumps the fear and stigma attached to homosexuality .
Personally , I do n’t think there should be any fear or stigma attached to either , but I understand that stigma exists .
If a person wants to keep her mental health a secret – out of fear of stigmatizing labels or simply out of wanting a shred of privacy – fine .
What I find scary is the fact that sexual orientation is n’t a health problem that requires treatment .
Depression , bipolar disorder , and schizophrenia , on the other hand ?
They all are .
Hopefully , these people are at least not finding it difficult to “ come out ” with their mental health problem to themselves , their doctors , and the loved ones who can help them .
Otherwise , how on earth are they going to receive proper treatment and support ?

Hardline groups say Valentine 's Day symbolises Western corruption
Radical Hindus have been arrested in India for targeting young couples on Valentine 's Day , police say .
The activists belong to Shiv Sena , a group accused of carrying out assaults that included clipping the hair and blackening the faces of young lovers .
Valentine 's Day has become popular among young Indians in recent years .
But public shows of affection are still generally frowned upon .
Hardline groups say Valentine 's Day is a symbol of " cultural corruption " .
Groups such as Shiv Sena say they are protecting Indian culture from Westernisation .
' Breach of peace '
Six arrests took place in the northern Indian city of Agra , home to the Taj Mahal - the monument built by Emperor Shah Jehan in memory of his beloved wife .
The protesters used scissors to cut the hair of overtly romantic couples in a nearby park , superintendent of police VP Ashok said .
" The six belonging to Shiv Sena group were arrested for causing a breach of the peace , " he told The Associated Press news agency .
Meanwhile , the AFP news agency reported that five members of the same group were arrested in Delhi for threatening couples in a park .
Many couples had their faces blackened in western Aurangabad and northern Bijnaur , Reuters reports .
Such disruption of Valentine 's Day by hardliners is becoming an annual event , and police this year were on high alert .
Another group vandalised a shop selling Valentine 's cards and raided a restaurant in Indian Kashmir looking for romantic couples , the AP reports .
Protestors also burnt flowers and Valentine Day cards to mark their protest .
How to Make the Most of the Cost of Social Media Marketing
If you own a business , then you need a social media marketing strategy .
Facebook alone has over 1.5 billion active daily users .
Instagram has over a billion users .
That ’s a huge pool of potential customers waiting to discover your products or services .
Are you a small business with a tight advertising budget ?
What is the best use of your social media money ?
Read on for the cost of social media marketing and ways to make sure that you ’re maximizing your ad dollars .
Focus on the Right Platform
Each social media channel has a specific type of culture .
Users conform to the culture by approaching the platform in an established manner .
Look at these social media platforms first :
Facebook
Instagram
YouTube
Pinterest
Snapchat
Twitter
LinkedIn
These platforms all generate tons of traffic .
Find one or two platforms that fit with your company ’s brand and culture .
Do n’t worry about posting on all of them .
These platforms are free .
But they also offer paid advertising .
Once you get a handle on the platform , then you can work on sponsored content .
You can spend as little as $ 1 dollar on an ad on Facebook or Instagram .
But spending a little more guarantees a wider audience .
Speaking of your audience …
Know Your Audience
Knowing your audience is crucial .
Tailor your content to your target audience .
Spending money on ads that target the wrong demographic is a waste of your time and money .
You can also purchase more followers to increase brand awareness .
If you do that , make sure you ’re paying for high - quality followers .
How do you define your target audience ?
By understanding who buys your product .
What segment of the population buys the most ?
Is it 25 - 35 - year - old men ?
Then that ’s the audience for whom you ’re creating content .
Focus on that narrow niche and do n’t worry about leaving other people out .
Trying to advertise to everyone is as bad as advertising to no one .
Once you know who your target audience is , focus on their pain points .
Use social media platforms to show how you solve those pain points for your clients .
Paid Advertising on Social Media Platforms
Social media is free .
But advertising on social media platforms is n’t free .
The good news ?
You can pay as little or as much as you want .
You set the budget !
Create ad campaigns and then notice how they drive traffic to your website .
Start with a small budget first .
The cost of social media marketing does n’t have to break the bank .
The Cost of Social Media Marketing for Your Company
The cost of social media marketing differs for every company .
If you ’re a small business with a small advertising budget , you can keep your costs small too .
Find the social media platform that suits your company brand and culture the best .
Then only spend ad dollars that target your specific audience .
Always track your website traffic after paying for ads on any social media platform .
Find what ads drive the most traffic and conversions .
It takes patience and experimentation .

Amazon 's new E Ink - powered Kindle 2 is all the rage right now , but a Canadian bookseller is confident it can give you the same experience on your smartphone , and without the hefty pricetag .
Shortcovers -- occasionally touted by its makers as " the Kindle Killer " -- is set to launch in the coming days as an app for the iPhone , the BlackBerry , and the Android operating system .
So can it really live up to its king - sized claims ?
Read on and decide for yourself .
An Expanded E-Book Reader
Shortcovers is owned and operated by Indigo Books & Music , the largest book retailer in Canada .
While smartphone - based e-book readers have been available in places like Apple 's App Store for a while , it 's Shortcovers ' close ties to the publishing industry that set it apart from the pack .
Because of the company 's connections with major publishers , it 's been able to secure the rights to brand new books that are often tough ( if not impossible ) to find on other services .
Like Kindle , Shortcovers will let you read the first chapter of any book free of charge .
From there , the app offers you two options :
You can either buy a chapter at a time , or opt to purchase the whole book .
Single chapters are expected to cost around 99 cents a pop , while full books will range between $ 10 and $ 20 , on average .
If you decide you want to get a book physically shipped , you can do that , too .
Shortcovers says it'll have about 50,000 full books available upon launch , with another 200,000 individual chapters and excerpts in its library .
Only a third of the titles will be public domain or copyright - expired works .
The rest will be current commercial offerings .
Shortcovers plans to offer news and magazine articles , short stories , and blog posts in addition to the book content .
Kindle Comparisons
Compared to the Kindle , Shortcovers comes up a little short with the bells and whistles .
You wo n't find a built - in dictionary , for example , nor will you be able to highlight text .
There 's no high - tech E Ink to make the pages look like real paper .
The program 's advantage , though , is its convenience :
It 's already right there in your pocket , so there 's no need to tote around a second device .
Fittingly , then , much of Shortcovers ' publicity thus far has focused on the application 's ability to let you read on - the - go -- a chapter here , a chapter there , wherever you happen to be .
As far as navigation , Shortcovers uses your phone 's standard interface .
With the iPhone , for example , you click onto your chapter of choice in a contents list , then scroll down the screen just like you do in other apps .
Shortcovers allows you to adjust font size and choose from either standard or landscape mode on the phone .
And , like the Kindle , it 'll remember where you leave off in a book when you shut down , then bring you back to the same page when you return .
You can go back and forth between reading on your phone and reading on the Shortcovers Web site with automatic synchronization as well .
The program offers some interesting social features , too , including a rating and sharing system , a tagging function , and a set of mashup tools in which you can build your own literary mixes .
You 'll even be able to upload your own writing and add it in .
The Long and Short of It
Shortcovers is scheduled to launch in the U.S. in late February , then in Canada shortly thereafter .
Company exec Mike Serbinis talks more about the app and how it's come into existence in the following video interview with USA Today , conducted on the floor of last month 's Consumer Electronics Show .
The security community has long had a tendency to focus on the identification and repair of vulnerabilities .
There have been significant public debates about the ethics of publicly discussing unpatched vulnerabilities , and coders will happily brag about their ability to have a fix ready immediately after a vulnerability is disclosed .
A new study by a pair of Swiss academics and a Googler , however , suggests that much of this focus has been misdirected .
They argue that the ergonomics of the end - users ' update process has a far more significant effect on the adoption of secure web browsers than any discussion of the severity of a vulnerability .
The authors reached their conclusions thanks to the presence of the Google employee on their team .
That got them access to the anonymized search logs for use as their base data set .
Since many of these requests come from shared IP addresses and proxies , the authors combined them with a unique ID in Google 's PREF setting to distinguish individual end users .
Although this ignores users of other search services , three of the four browsers sampled default to using Google .
The authors also realize that this probably eliminates the most security conscious of web browsers -- those searching anonymously and with cookies disabled -- and those with User Agent strings that identify their browsers as something other than what they are .
They suspect that this is a small minority .
Regardless of the limitations , the raw data provides not only information on security , but a glimpse into the dynamics of browser choice and use .
Major version dynamics
Their survey period ran from January of 2007 through April of 2008 ; for part of that period , the authors sampled only three days per week , but the rest involved daily tracking .
This allowed the authors to identify what they termed the " weekend effect . "
People tended to use more up - to - date browsers on the weekends than they do during the week , an effect the authors ascribed to browsing at work , where departmental dictates often limit the adoption of newer software .
There was also a cross - browser weekend effect , as use of Firefox went up on weekends at the expense of Internet Explorer , presumably because work policy dictates the use of IE .
They were also able to track the migration dynamics as end users switched to new major versions of the four browsers they tracked .
For IE , the switch from version 6 to 7 occurred gradually , with one exception : many computers bought near the holidays included Vista , which gave IE7 a significant boost .
Firefox 2 saw its biggest boost when version 1.5 was end - of - lifed , and the automatic update system switched a big chunk of its users to the 2.0 track .
Mac users seemed more willing to live on the cutting edge , as the Safari 3 beta release was accompanied by a major jump .
Widespread adoption , however , did n't occur until the release of the final version , bundled in with 10.5 ; at that point , it shot past the 2.0 version in less than a month .
In contrast , Opera saw an extremely slow , if steady , migration from the 8.0 to 9.0 branches during the entire period .
Security - driven dynamics
To explore how security warnings and patches influence end - user adoption of minor updates , the authors focused on Firefox and Opera .
They argue that these browsers are the most comparable : they 're both free , they are n't controlled by makers of operating systems , and they both include minor version information in their User Agent string , which makes it possible to track security patches .
But they do differ in one very significant way : Firefox has an auto - update feature built in to the browser , while Opera 's procedure is comparable to a manual download and install of a new browser .
In the end , they argue that this difference in ergonomics matters .
Most Firefox users had minor version updates installed within three days of their release , although a weekend effect was layered on top of this , as many users did n't update until they fired up the software at home .
In most cases , the newest version ramped up to over 70 percent of the browser 's share .
That 's a big contrast with Opera .
It took 11 days for a new version to surpass the market share of its predecessor , and the share of the updated software never exceeded half of the browser 's total market share .
The authors note that these figures -- 80 percent for Firefox , 45 percent for Opera - - only represent upper bounds of the users running a secure browser , as plugins create their own set of security risks .
There was also at least one case where Firefox experienced a surge of an out - of - date , insecure version , which they assume occurred because a software vendor bundled it with another product .
Were the upgrades influenced by a general awareness of security problems ?
Not as far as the authors could tell .
They rated the security flaws fixed by these minor version upgrades , and found no correlation between the relative risk and the upgrade dynamics .
The analysis clearly suggests that most users are n't driven by an awareness of security , a finding that 's in keeping with other studies of end - user security practices .
Instead , it 's the convenience of engaging with secure practices that drives their adoption .
And , since the practices of the average web browser impacts us all by influencing the rate at which we 're subjected to spam and malware , developers have a vested interest in fostering better security ergonomics .
The study , along with related research on security threats , has been made available by one of its authors .
There are two types of people when it comes to the games - as - art debate : those who spend too much time and energy arguing one way or another , and those who ignore it altogether and simply create games that are art .
Jenova Chen and thatgamecompany belong firmly in the second category , and after playing Flower to completion on the PS3 , we can confirm that they have given us another game to talk about , puzzle over , and enjoy .
In Flower you control the wind , causing a trail of flower petals to fly around each level , gathering more petals to itself by touching flowers , which makes them blossom .
Touch a group of flowers and a splash of color spreads out across the land .
These transformations are oddly satisfying , as if you 're painting the landscape with a heavenly brush .
The music also works with the graphics to create a soothing , evocative mood for the game .
These aesthetic issues are only part of the story , however .
The mechanic of awakening these flowers in order to change the landscape remains throughout the entire game , although the settings you explore do not .
The game takes an odd turn about halfway through , causing a change in both how the game looks and how it plays .
I wo n't describe what happens , and how you deal with it , in order for you to enjoy the game as fully as possible , but after the credits rolled — in an interactive sequence that you play — I was left thinking about what I had just seen .
The game is played by tilting the Dual Shock 3 , and only one button is required to cause the wind to " blow , " so this is a title that allows you to absorb what 's happening while playing .
In a world where publishers are spending millions trying to get the most desolate warzones imaginable , a game that knows how good actual colors can look and feel on the screen is more than welcome — it 's almost required .
Whether or not Flower has a story is up to what you think is going on , and I 'm unconvinced that the most topical explanation for the events in the game is the right one , or even the only one .
Games are interactive in more ways than one , and playing Flower before it is released is actually something of a handicap ; part of the draw of this game is going to be the discussions that it spawns across the gaming blogs and forums .
There will be some that simply do n't get it , and that 's OK .
There will be some that do n't care for it ; this is a game that is n't for everyone .
There will be others , and I am one of them , that will hear the game whisper to them when they close their eyes .
More ambitious than flOw , thatgamecompany 's last release for the PS3 , and much more satisfying , this is a game for those interested in gaming as emerging media can't miss .
Even if you do n't like it , working out why will give you insight about game design — and what can and possibly can't be done in gaming .
Or you can opt out of thinking about the deeper meanings and just use the game as a way to relax and enjoy the beautiful swaying grass and gently blossoming flowers .
Perhaps giving the game too much though is , in its own way , completely missing the point .
Flower is coming to the PlayStation 3 as a downloadable title on February 12 , for $ 9.99 .

Barack Obama
Obama , in The Post , Calls for Action on Stimulus
President Obama today lays out his case for the stimulus bill in The Washington Post , writing in an op - ed page piece , " The Action Americans Need " :
" By now , it 's clear to everyone that we have inherited an economic crisis as deep and dire as any since the days of the Great Depression ....
What Americans expect from Washington is action that matches the urgency they feel in their daily lives -- action that 's swift , bold and wise enough for us to climb out of this crisis . "

By Thomas Sowell - February 10 , 2009
Letters from parents often complain of a sense of futility in trying to argue with their own children , who have been fed a steady diet of the politically correct vision of the world , from elementary school to the university .
Some ask for suggestions of particular books that might make a dent in the know - it - all attitude of some young people who have heard only one side of the story in classrooms all their lives .
That is one way of going about trying to de-program young people .
There are , for example , some good books showing what is wrong with the " global warming " crusades or showing why male - female differences in income or occupations are not automatically discrimination .
Various authors have written a lot of good books that demolish what is currently believed -- and taught to students -- on a wide range of issues .
Some of those books are listed as suggested readings on my website ( www.tsowell.com).
Yet trying to undo the propaganda that passes for education at too many schools and colleges , one issue at a time , may not always be the best strategy .
There are too many issues on which the politically correct party line is considered to be the only way to look at things .
Given the wide range of issues on which students are indoctrinated , instead of being educated , trying to undo all of that would require a whole shelf full of books -- and somehow getting the students to read them all .
Another approach might be to respond to the dogmatic certainty of some young person , perhaps your own offspring , by asking : " Have you ever read a single book on the other side of that issue ? "
Chances are , after years of being " educated , " even at some of the highest - priced schools and colleges , they have not .
When the inevitable answer to your question is " No , " you can simply point out how illogical it is to be so certain about anything when you have heard only one side of the story -- no matter how often you have heard that one side repeated .
Would it make sense for a jury to reach a verdict after having heard only the prosecution 's case , or only the defense attorney 's case , but not both ?
There is no need to argue the specifics of the particular issue that has come up .
You can tell your overconfident young student that you will be happy to discuss that particular issue after he or she has taken the elementary step of reading something by somebody on the other side .
Elementary as it may seem that we should hear both sides of an issue before making up our minds , that is seldom what happens on politically correct issues today in our schools and colleges .
The biggest argument of the left is that there is no argument -- whether the issue is global warming , " open space " laws or whatever .
Some students may even imagine that they have already heard the other side because their teachers may have given them their version of other people 's arguments or motives .
But a jury would never be impressed by having the prosecution tell them what the defendant 's defense is .
They would want to hear the defense attorney present that case .
Yet most students who have read and heard repeatedly about the catastrophes awaiting us unless we try to stop " global warming " have never read a book , an article or even a single word by any of the hundreds of climate scientists , in countries around the world , who have expressed opposition to that view .
These students may have been shown Al Gore 's movie " An Inconvenient Truth " in school , but are very unlikely to have been shown the British Channel 4 television special , " The Great Global Warming Swindle . "
Even if we assume , for the sake of argument , that students are being indoctrinated with the correct conclusions on current issues , that would still be irrelevant educationally .
Hearing only one side does nothing to equip students with the experience to know how to sort out opposing sides of other issues they will have to confront in the future , after they have left school and need to reach their own conclusions on the issues arising later .
Yet they are the jury that will ultimately decide the fate of this nation .
CNN should be ashamed of themselves for keeping a Republican smear merchant on their staff as an analyst .
He acted like a pig during the primary and had to publicly apologize when he said on air that it was OK to call some women " bitches . "
And they still have him working for them .
I know credible Republican talking heads are pretty hard to find , but this guy is out right garbage that should go out with the TV trash .
Here 's what he said to Blitzer :
Blitzer : Powerful new criticism of President Obama 's economic rescue plan coming from the Nobel Prize - winning economist Paul Krugman .
Did too much get cut out or is compromise the right thing to do ?
Let 's discuss in our strategy session .
Joining us now , the Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons , and CNN contributor the Republican strategist , Alex Castellanos .
Here 's what Krugman writes in the New York Times today , among other things :
What do you call someone who eliminates hundreds of thousands of American jobs , deprives millions of adequate health care and nutrition , undermines schools , but offers a $ 15,000 bonus to affluent people who flip their houses ?
A proud centrist .
... [ And ] how did this happen ?
I blame President Obama ’s belief that he can transcend the partisan divide — a belief that warped his economic strategy .
Pretty strong words coming from Paul Krugman .
Simmons :
They are .
And Paul Krugman 's a very well - respected and seemingly very good economist .
I 'm not sure he 's ever passed one single bill in the United States Senate .
So if you take a look at it that way , President Obama 's got a real challenge .
Which is that he's got to get a bill not only through the House but also through the Senate , where he needs 60 votes and then he 'll need some Republicans to go along to get cloture .
So this looks like the best he can get to get through the Senate and get some money immediately into the economy .
Blitzer :
In the Senate , he not only needed some Republicans to get above that magic number of 60 but he also needed those moderate or conservative Democrats who could have bolted as well .
Castellanos :
He 's caught between the rock and the hard place on this one .
He 's got Democrats who want him to spend more on the left and Republicans who say , hey , this is crazy .
And I know Krugman won the Nobel Prize , but so did Al Gore .
It ca n't be that hard .
( laughter . )
And if economists were that good , they 'd all be rich and they 're not .
So let 's take all this with a grain of salt here .
I mean , what the Democrats are telling the country now is , they 're having a debate , ' We 're gonna take a big pile of money and set it on fire .
We 're going to borrow it , make a big pile and set in on fire . '
And the argument is that the pile of money is not big enough .
So while the Democrats are having this internal debate , the message they 're sending is : Big Spending .
Blitzer :
We 're all looking forward -- when we celebrate your winning the Nobel Prize one of these days -- obviously something you 're looking forward to .
A golden Queen Cleopatra bathing in milk , a female dancer pushing the limits of Carnival tolerance , and the high - kicking Moulin Rouge troupe kept 70,000 spectators in Rio's Sambadrome buzzing through to dawn .
Behind the scenes , next to a putrid canal and out of sight of the throng , the near perfect symmetry and order of the parades seemed a world away as the Samba schools frantically prepared for their annual coming - out show .

Stewards dressed in bow ties scampered here and there fixing last - minute wardrobe malfunctions and trying to hold back the tide of Brazilian tardiness and high spirits .
Enterprising vendors from nearby slums dangled ice boxes full of beer over a wall for nervous performers seeking a drop of Dutch courage .
Like a scene from Alice in Wonderland , performers dressed as 19th century nobles , wide - skirted " Baiana " dancers , and musical notes mingled as they sought their starting positions , practiced their lines or enjoyed a last - minute cigarette .
" People who have never paraded do n't understand they need to be here in front instead of chatting , " fumed 47 - year - old Malucia Camacho , who was in charge of a " wing " of about 80 costumed dancers for the Mocidade Samba school .
" It 's not a lack of practice , it 's because they like turning up late and do n't like to work .
They are undisciplined , " she added , before bustling off to chide a group of nobles .
Nearby , a musical note relieved himself against a wall .
The nationally televised annual parades featuring up to 5,000 dancers each and near - naked Carnival queens is a serious competition for the top Samba schools , judged on choreography , atmosphere , organisation , and singing among other points .
A disorganised wing or a faulty float can cost a school the tile and bragging rights over the next year .

" A bit of my wing broke and my costume is too tight , " said Daniella Cremer , a raven - haired 25 - year - old model and dancer , about half an hour before being winched by a crane on to the front of one of Mocidade 's floats .
" If something falls off , I 'll just keep going to the end . "
Last year a school was famously disqualified when a tiny strip of material , called a " tapa - sexo " , covering its top dancer 's crotch fell off .
A Mocidade dancer , Dani Sperle , may have taken the record for the smallest tapa - sexo on display in the Sambadrome on Monday with a 3 cm ( one inch ) wisp of material , Brazilian media breathlessly reported .
She appeared at the preparation area bare - breasted wearing just a headdress , necklace and boots .
Other omens were not looking good for Mocidade .
During the last - minute preparations , its main parade designer was run over and injured by one of the floats , which also briefly caught fire .
Undeterred , 57 - year - old steward Francisco Dos Santos drew on a cigarette and reflected on the importance of a good result .
" We 're going to go out there with enthusiasm in our blood and get this title .
We 've deserved it for a long time , " he said .
Moments later , fireworks boomed and Mocidade was on the move , parading past a still noisy crowd at around 3 am , including Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
Its parade went smoothly , but others suffered mishaps .
A dancer in the French - themed parade with cancan performers from Paris ' Moulin Rouge fell over and an electrical fault left its Eiffel Tower in the dark .
That parade was also invaded by a bemused - looking Labrador .
On the edge of a lush , well - tended park , palm trees swaying in the evening breeze , a small delegation of demonstrators silently clutched candles as they condemned the bloodshed in Gaza .
Their vigil was watched benignly by clusters of policemen strategically grouped nearby ; passing pedestrians and drivers offered words of support and condemnation in equal measure – and within an hour the protest had run its course and disbanded .
On the face of it , last night 's show of solidarity for Gaza epitomised Israel 's commitment to free and fair expression for all its citizens , but the reality behind the mask tells a very different story .
This was Jaffa , after all , a largely Arab city on the edge of Tel Aviv , where the locals find themselves in a precarious position at the best of times , and even more so when the country is firmly on a war footing .
Seven days ago , I attended a protest at the same spot , which boasted a far larger – and far more vocal – crowd than last night 's vigil : scores of demonstrators loudly denouncing Israel 's leaders as war criminals , rowdy brandishing of incendiary placards and flags , and a proud mixture of Israeli Jews and Arabs joining forces to voice their opposition to the war .
However , a week is a long time in internal Israeli politics , during which time several local Arab activists were arrested on trumped - up charges and held in jail , purportedly to prevent them carrying out future acts of sedition .
Their detention served to scare off not only them from attending subsequent demonstrations , but also their friends , families and the rest of the Jaffa community , leading to the sharp drop in attendees at last night 's protest .
" It feels like old - school state intimidation , " said one man who braved the threat of arrest to show his support for yesterday 's vigil .
" What 's worse is that Israel trumpets itself as a democracy , yet takes measures such as these [ to stifle dissenting voices ] .
At least in places like Syria , the public are n't fooled into thinking their rulers are in any way democratic . "
He described the reaction he had encountered when handing out leaflets advertising the demonstration to fellow members of the community : " People are frightened to come , and there 's nothing we can say to convince them differently .
We can't tell them they wo n't be arrested , since the evidence of the last week proves otherwise . "
He told me that stop - and - search tactics have increased in the area since the outbreak of hostilities in Gaza , adding to the sense of state - sponsored pressure on the local Arabs .
Yesterday , at the same time as the watered - down vigil was taking place , Israel 's Central Elections Committee upped the ante in the anti-Arab stakes , banning two Arab political parties , Balad and UAL , from running in the upcoming general election .
After two petitions claimed that Balad's and UAL 's political platform aimed to undermine Israel 's existence as a Jewish , democratic state , and that the parties were supporting armed struggle against Israel , the committee voted decisively to kick them out of the electoral race .
Balad 's chairman Jamal Zahalka was defiant in the face of the committee 's stance , declaring that " Israeli democracy , not Balad , is being put to the test today .
Balad is a democratic and progressive party , and we believe in the basic principle of equality for all people .
All we demand is democracy !
What are you afraid of when we ask for equality ?
We are the sons of this country , we were born here and we are willing to treat you with equality , so why do n't you ? "
UAL chair Ahmed Tibi was equally scathing in his attacks on the Israeli government , asserting that " Any vote given to Kadima is a bullet in the chest of a Palestinian child in Gaza . "
He had short shrift for those accusing his party of undermining the Israeli status quo : " We never said that we do n't recognise the state of Israel .
We are part of it , but we will never accept Zionism , which is an ideology that aspires to banish us from our homes . "
While appeals are expected to be lodged in the Israeli high court of justice by the suspended parties ' chairmen , Zahalka maintained that the damage had already been done , predicting that the move would lead to a deeper crisis between the country 's Jewish and Arab citizens .
There is little doubt that he is right on that front ; the already - strained relationship between Israel 's Jews and Arabs has now suffered two body blows this month alone , in the shape of the Gaza offensive and , now , the clampdown on Arab political activity .
Whether on the balmy streets of Jaffa , or in the upper echelons of Israeli officialdom , the message appears to be the same : if you raise so much as a murmur of dissent in a time of war , the strong arm of Israeli law will come crashing down and stifle your protests in a flash .
Israel 's boast that it is the " only democracy in the Middle East " rings more hollow now than ever before .

THE economic meltdown has popularised a new term : deglobalisation .
Some critics of capitalism seem happy about it — like Walden Bello , a Philippine economist , who can perhaps claim to have coined the word with his book , “ Deglobalisation , Ideas for a New World Economy ” .
Britain 's prime minister , Gordon Brown , is among those who fear the results will be bad .
But is globalisation really ending ?
The world 's economies are certainly slowing fast .
And the speed and scale of this recession are raising doubts about the assumptions that had underpinned the drive to integrate world markets .
At the end of 2008 the IMF said the world economy would grow 2.2 % in 2009 , less than half the rate in 2007 .
Now it thinks growth will be just 0.5 % this year , the lowest for 60 years .
Even that may be optimistic ; in the last quarter of 2008 , some economies shrank at annualised rates of over 10 % .
Nobody ever said globalisation had ended economic ups and downs , but this feels different : prima facie evidence of big problems at least , and possibly of the failure of globalisation to deliver many of its advertised benefits , especially to the poor .
True , economic slowdown is not the same as deglobalisation .
And the slowdown has yet to affect one thing .
For years , poor countries have been growing faster than rich ones ; so far , they still are .
The gap between real GDP growth in emerging markets and in rich countries widened from nothing in 1991 to about five points in 2007 — and , says the IMF , it will stay at 5.3 points in 2008 and 2009 .
Helping poorer countries catch up has long been among the benefits touted for globalisation .
And yet the process is going into reverse .
Globalisation means the global integration of the movement of goods , capital and jobs .
Each of these processes is now in trouble .
World trade has plunged .
As recently as the first half of 2008 , boosted by rising commodity prices and a falling dollar , trade was growing at an annualised 20 % in dollar terms .
In the second half of 2008 , as commodities sagged and the dollar rose , growth slowed fast ; by September , says the IMF , it was in reverse .
In December , says the International Air Transport Association , air - cargo traffic ( responsible for over a third of the value of the world 's traded goods ) was down 23 % on December 2007 — almost double the fall in the year up to the end of September 2001 , a result affected by the 9/11 terror attacks .
The downturn has been sharpest in countries that opened up most to world trade , especially East Asia 's tigers .
Singapore 's exports are 186 % of GDP ; its economy shrank at an annualised rate of 17 % in the last three months of 2008 .
Taiwan 's exports are over 60 % of GDP ; and its economy may fall as much as 11 % this year .
The downturn has also hurt rich countries that specialise in staid old - fashioned manufacturing — supposedly a safer activity than the reckless delusions of finance .
On average , says the IMF , rich countries will contract 2 % this year .
But Germany and Japan , big exporters of capital goods , cars and electronics , will do worse , their economies shrinking by 2.5 % and 2.6 % respectively .
In the last quarter their economies contracted alarmingly , falling at an annualised rate of 8 % in Germany and by 13 % — the worst since 1974 — in Japan .
Small countries which went into businesses that grew in globalisation 's wake , like tourism , are also suffering .
The World Tourism Organisation says international tourist arrivals fell 1 % in the second half of 2008 , which may not sound bad , but compares with growth of more than 5 % a year for the previous four years .
In the Caribbean , visitors may fall by a third this season ; in some islands hotels are half empty , flights are being cancelled and national budgets , reliant on tourism , are strained .
In contrast , the biggest emerging markets are doing less badly so far .
In India , where exports are around 15 % of GDP , the government recently said growth in the year to April 2009 would be 7.1 % ; most forecasters put growth for the 2009 calendar year lower , but still about 5 % .
In Brazil the economy has been harder hit by falling commodity prices and declining exports .
Most economists still think output grew a bit in the year to the fourth quarter , and put growth for 2009 at 1.5 % to 2 % .
China was still growing by 6.8 % in the year to the fourth quarter , though like Brazil it is probably stagnating .
Chinese exports fell 18 % and imports 43 % in the year to January .
All three countries have large domestic markets and relatively stable banking systems , which have not been liberalised .
The gap between toothless tigers and friskier BICs ( ie , BRICs minus Russia , a special case because of oil ) raises questions not so much about globalisation as a whole — after all , Brazil , India and China have been beneficiaries — as about particular aspects .
Can one be too dependent on trade ?
How far should one liberalise banking ?
Is there a trade - off between taking advantage of good times and providing shock absorbers for bad ones ?
Emerging markets ' trade problems have been worsened by shifts in capital flows , globalisation 's second big plank .
According to the World Bank , net private debt and equity flows to developing countries will fall from $ 1 trillion in 2007 to $ 530 billion in 2009 , or from 7.7 % to 3 % of those countries '
GDPs .
The Institute for International Finance sees an even steeper fall ; it says that this year banks will extract more from emerging markets in debt repayments than they inject in new loans .
Bond markets in those countries collapsed in the last quarter of 2008 , doing less than $ 5 billion of business ; in the second quarter , they had issued about $ 50 billion of bonds .
As with trade , financial deglobalisation is hitting countries in a variety of ways .
In this case , East Asia has been less affected because most countries there are net creditors .
But eastern Europe and Russia have been hammered because local banks went on a foreign - borrowing binge , foreign banks piled into their markets ( and piled out again ) and because some countries lacked insurance policies against tough times .
Although many big emerging markets have built up foreign - exchange reserves and cut their external debts , in eastern Europe reserves have been flat , external debts have risen and current - account deficits have grown considerably in the past decade .
In these countries , the reversal of globalisation has exacerbated problems that were building up anyway .
People in emerging markets have mixed feelings about financial liberalisation and may not regret its reversal .
But foreign direct investment ( FDI ) is different .
Most people welcome new factories and new jobs .
FDI is also one of the commonest routes by which skills and technology are transferred from rich to poor countries .
This , too , is falling .
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) says worldwide FDI inflows shrank 21 % in 2008 to $ 1.4 trillion .
The World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies says FDI will contract by a further 12 - 15 % this year .
In contrast to trade , the investment impact of the global downturn has so far been hardest on the countries where the woes began : rich ones .
They have seen FDI falls of one - third on average and by half or more in Britain , Italy and Germany .
Finland and Ireland have seen net outflows .
FDI flows to developing countries were still growing in 2008 , albeit by only 4 % , after a rise of 21 % in 2007 .
Flows to big South American countries were up by about a fifth ; those to India more than doubled , though they may ebb as GDP falters .
The third of the three main aspects of globalisation — jobs — is following the other two , with a lag .
The International Labour Organisation forecasts that unemployment worldwide will rise by around 30 m above 2007's level in 2009 .
Most of that rise will be the result of recession , not deglobalisation , but some will be attributable to the fall in trade ( exporting companies will lay off workers ) and some to declining investment ( if expansion plans are cut , new jobs will not be created ) .
Deglobalisation will have a dire impact on migrants .
In the past decade , more people have been moving voluntarily than ever before ; now , some are going home .
Those who provided labour for the housing boom in America ( notably Latinos ) , Ireland ( Poles ) and China ( rural Chinese going to cities on the eastern seaboard ) have been among the first to be laid off .
In Spain newly jobless builders are competing with migrants there for jobs picking fruit .
This will surely have an effect on the flow of remittances from rich countries to poor ones , although it has so far ( see article ) been quite resilient .
In any case , economies that absorbed large numbers of foreign workers may take fewer .
Some of the millions of South Asians who work in the Gulf , or the young Africans who flock to South Africa , or the Central Asians who work in Russia , may have to stay at home .
Yet for all the economic pain , the social and political fallout from deglobalisation has not yet been severe .
Protests may still come .
Or maybe national governments are absorbing most of the ire .
In December , Greece saw riots after a police bullet killed a teenager .
In France , unions brought over 1 m people onto the streets for a one - day strike , and a riot in Latvia over economic policy ended in more than 100 arrests .
But only in Britain , where workers have picketed refineries and power stations over the hiring of foreigners , has protest had a very anti-global tone .
This lag may be explained by residual support for globalisation , especially in emerging markets .
A poll in 2007 by the Pew Global Attitudes Project found that majorities in 47 countries saw international trade as good for them ; majorities in 41 out of 46 welcomed multinational firms ; in 39 out of 47 , most felt better off with a free market .
In more than half the countries where changes could be tracked , support for free markets was rising .
When consensus wobbles
But is that still true ?
Last summer , on the eve of the meltdown , European Union pollsters reported that two - thirds of EU citizens saw globalisation as profitable only for large firms , not citizens .
In 2002 , according to the Pew poll , 78 % of Americans thought foreign trade helped the country ; by 2007 it was only 59 % .
A CNN poll in July 2008 showed that , for the first time , a small majority of Americans saw trade as a threat , not an opportunity .
Of the few worldwide polls to have been completed since then , one by Edelman for the World Economic Forum found that 62 % of respondents in 20 countries said they trusted companies less or a lot less now .
Manifestly , popular opinion backs more state regulation .
So far , this has mostly taken the form of pouring public money into banks and selected industries , notably cars .
Last week Barack Obama set out plans for another vast bank rescue , and the French government promised € 6 billion ( $ 7.8 billion ) in preferential loans to Renault and Peugeot - Citroën in return for pledges that no car factories would be closed in France .
There has been somewhat less evidence of trade protectionism .
India has raised some steel tariffs .
The EU has reintroduced export subsidies for some dairy products .
Russia has raised import duties on vehicles .
But there has also been movement the other way .
The American Senate softened the “ Buy America ” provisions of the stimulus bill .
Mexico said that by 2012 it would cut tariffs on thousands of kinds of manufacture .
And some countries have sought a safe harbour , rather than embracing pure nationalism .
East Europeans are even keener on the shelter of the euro ; Iceland has applied to the EU ; the Irish are more likely than they were to vote for the EU 's Lisbon treaty .
Despite the downturn , the nations of the world have not shunned globalisation .
It has been protected by the belief of firms in the efficiency of global supply chains .
But like any chain , these are only as strong as their weakest link .
A danger point will come if firms decide that this way of organising production has had its day .
Terracotta Army - The Terracotta WARRIORS Xi’an Shanxi province .
China
China ’s 2,000 - year - old Terracotta Army was one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the 20th century ( 1974 actually ) .
These world - famous Terracotta Warriors are part of a vast underground necropolis for China ’s first Emperor , Qin Shi Huangdi , that took 700,000 workers 36 years to create .
Myth says that in 206BC the first Emperor of Unified China , Ch’in ShiHuangdi , decreed that after his death his body would be clothed in jade and cast adrift in a lake of Mercury .
The lake , within a pyramid , was to be protected by an everlasting army .
Like Tutankhamun , in Egypt , lord Pacal , in Mexico and the Viracochas ’ , of Peru Shi Huangdi taught the super - science of the sun and the higher orders of spirituality .
They say that , after he died , he flew to the sun to live forever .
In 1974 , archaeologists actually discovered the first of more than 8,000 life - size terracotta warriors buried near the pyramid tomb of Ch’in Shi Huangdi , confirming that the legend was more than just a myth .
But why were the massive soldiers , each weighing more than half a tone , buried there at all ?
Was it simply to guard the Emperor in the afterlife ?
Maybe one day we ’ll get the answers to this questions .

All revolutions , I suppose , have a symbol .
In Chekhov 's Cherry Orchard , it 's the sound of a distant chain snapping , like that of a bucket in a mineshaft .
In France , it was the sans culottes .
Maybe in Iran , it was the discovery an American colleague of mine made when he ventured up to the Iranian - Soviet border .
He found one of America 's old listening posts still operating , with tired Iranian revolutionaries still staring listlessly at the glowing screens , tracking aircraft deep inside Soviet airspace .
Why were they still manning these US bases , he asked ?
The problem was simple : the Iranians did n't know how to turn them off .
For me , revolutions have to have trains – Strelnikov 's great steam loco in Dr Zhivago comes to mind – and Iran 's huge post - revolutionary trains , 20 or 30 carriages long , windows smashed , smothered in tulip - draped posters of martyrs , would pull out of Tehran , taking me on massive journeys across the country .
We drew into Qom station to find a crowd on their way to a revolutionary court , where a young officer in the Shah 's army was fighting for his life , accused of killing anti-Shah demonstrators .
I still remember his name – Rustomi – and his brother , in tears , pleading with me to intervene .
What could I do ?
The crowd bayed at him , the same mob , I suppose , that would have mocked the aristocrats in Paris as they faced the guillotine .

There was not much mercy in the Iranian revolution : all the courts did was sentence men to death .
But then there had n't been much mercy before the revolution , when the Shah 's imperial guard , the Javidan , or " immortals " , slaughtered the crowds .
I remember another court , in Tehran , where a man shouted at a torturer from the notorious Savak security service : " You killed my daughter .
She was burned all over her flesh until she was paralysed .
She was roasted . "
And the torturer looked back at the bereaved man and said quietly : " Your daughter hanged herself after seven months in custody . "
The killers even had a few secrets for us – their close and friendly relationship , for example , with British agents and their Savak counterparts .
Not unlike , I suspect , our relationship with Pakistan 's state torturers ( or , I suppose , with America 's torturers ) .
It was easy to hear evil .
In fact , there was even a face - mask that you could buy for a few riyals , a grotesque version of the Shah 's face with horns sticking out of it .
The moment I put it on , a whole crowd of Iranians started shrieking at me .
So I took it off .
It 's easy to forget that the longest - running show in town was not the trials and their brutal aftermath – the condemned men would appear on front pages next day in their final moments – but the takeover of the US embassy by the " Students Following the Line of the Imam " .
It destroyed Jimmy Carter , all 444 days of it , and it is remarkable , looking back now , to see that Carter , the wise old peacemaker of the Middle East today , simply did not comprehend what had happened in Iran .
How on earth did he allow the Shah into America , the catalyst for the embassy sacking ?
It was Henry Kissinger , of course , always the éminence grise .
The " students " spent years pasting together shredded US diplomatic traffic , incriminating past and present Iranian officials with their CIA contacts .
Led by a woman , other teams worked like carpet - weavers , sewing back to life the whole rotten , corrupted empire of the King of Kings .
I padded round his libraries ; leather - bound volumes of Voltaire , Verlaine , Flaubert , Plutarch , Goebbels , Shakespeare , Charles de Gaulle , Churchill and Coleridge .
Abba Eban's My People was dedicated by the author to " His Imperial Majesty , the Shah of Shahs " .
Grandiosity became him .
He staged a pitiful rodeo down in Persepolis to honour his forebears – the Pahlavi dynasty was actually introduced as a British colonial project – to which the great and the good and Princess Anne came along .
I even found the Shah 's bath , with its gold - plated taps , which outraged the millions of poor in a nation that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini himself had described as a " slum " .
And yes , of course , it was that other man we stared at , the one in the black robes whom I once , piggy - backing a US network interview , sat before .
When he spoke , the Ayatollah would stare at a small emanation of light on the floor , as if it represented something holy .
No Robespierre he , no Trotsky .
This was a serious matter , the first Islamic revolution of our time , in which the leader proclaimed himself supreme leader and arbiter of all the revolution 's cares .
While he would remain the same , the revolution he created went on to become a strange creature , at once brutal and naive , provocative and dangerous .
When obligingly invaded by our good friend Saddam Hussein , it sent its young men to their deaths in their tens of thousands .
A crimson tide overflowed the fountain at the great cemetery of Behesht Zahra – close to where the great man himself now lies – and we would later watch corpses coming back by the hundred .
I think the eight - year war between Iran and Iraq was final proof of the revolution .
Iran did not , as the US hoped , fall to pieces , but it entered a kind of stasis , a sort of childishness from which it never awoke .
The French word infantilism may be closest .
It was government for and by the dead .
Iran had become a necrocracy .
There were many who saw what was happening .
Ayatollah Taleghani , for instance , was highly critical of Khomeini 's auto - theocracy , arguing that even socialists had suffered martyrs in the revolution , that they , too , should be embraced by the revolution 's children .
But it was not to be .
When Mohammad Khatami , a genuinely good and civil man , tried to change the legacy of the now - dead Khomeini , he was defeated because he would not let his supporters die in the streets of Tehran .
And so this week , it is his successor , the childish President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , with his love for all things nuclear – or maybe not all , we shall see – who represents this great nation , a boy clutching power rather than a titan , prattling on at Holocaust " conferences " and making small talk with children .
The real test for Iran , of course , is how it casts itself adrift from this ghostly regime .
It 's not that the priests are fools – that was a mistake Carter made – but that running a modern , powerful nation takes more than a degree in Islamic jurisprudence .
Foreign affairs is where the Iranian revolution has always failed .
It has consistently underestimated – or overestimated – its enemies , although fortune has smiled on her .
The Iranian mullahs hated both the " Black Taliban " and the wicked Saddam , and the Americans came along and destroyed both these enemies .
So did the revolution win ?
Up to a point .
It might well have failed in the early days when Khomeini 's courts feared a counter - coup , which was the reason for all the firing squads .
They had not forgotten how the CIA and MI6 destroyed Mohammed Mossadeq 's democratically elected government in a coup in 1953 .
Operation Ajax , the Americans called it ( the British chose the more prosaic Operation Boot ) , and I met the Brit who staged it .
Christopher Montague Woodhouse was a gentle Greek scholar , and a ruthless guerrilla fighter under German occupation in Greece .
More than 40 years later he recalled for me his own feelings of guilt .
" I 've sometimes been told that I was responsible for opening the doors to the Ayatollah – for Khomeini and the others , " he said .
" But it 's quite remarkable that a quarter of a century elapsed between Operation Boot and the fall of the Shah .
In the end , it was Khomeini who came out on top – but not until years later .
I suppose that some better use could have been made of the time that elapsed . "
What happened next : After the flight of the Shah
After months of violent protests , the Shah fled Tehran on 16 January 1979 .
He ended up in the US where he received treatment for lymphatic cancer , from which he died in 1980 .
His arrival in the US led to more than 50 Americans being taken hostage in the Tehran embassy .
A bungled attempt by the US military to rescue them was one reason President Jimmy Carter served only one term in office .
He has since rebuilt his reputation as an international peace mediator .
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr became Iran 's first elected president in 1979 , but failed to maintain his authority against Ayatollah Khomeini .
After 17 months he was impeached and fled to France where he still lives .

Even in the best of times , carrying a balance on your credit card is a risky -- and costly -- proposition .
These days , it can be downright foolish , at least if there ’s a chance you might miss a payment or two .
Millions of cardholders have recently received letters from the likes of Citibank , Bank of America Corp. , Wells Fargo & Co. and American Express Co. notifying them that their interest rates are going up , in some cases to 30 % if a single payment is missed .
JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the nation ’s largest issuer of plastic , has begun charging hundreds of thousands of cardholders a $ 10 monthly fee for having carried large balances for more than a couple years .
Why ?
In part it ’s because default rates are rising and banks are dealing with additional risk .
But lawmakers and consumer advocates say the higher rates also reflect banks ’ massive losses from betting wrong on the housing boom , and they ’re basically sticking credit card customers with the tab .
Advertisement
At a Senate Banking Committee hearing last week , Sen. Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn . ) , the committee chairman , said lenders are “ gouging ” customers to boost their bottom lines .
“ The list of questionable actions credit card companies are engaged in is lengthy and disturbing , ” he said .
At the same time , rising layoffs and tough economic conditions have caused many people to lean more heavily on their plastic -- sometimes too heavily .
Corona resident Louis Martinez , 39 , is carrying about $ 45,000 in debt on eight credit cards .
He says it ’s not that he ’s been deliberately reckless .
Rather , the debt piled up after his wife got sick several years ago and half the family ’s income disappeared .
Advertisement
“ What can you do ? ” Martinez asked .
“ You still want to provide for your family . ”
He said he grows more anxious with each bank letter that arrives warning him of potential interest - rate increases .
“ I ’ve never missed a payment , ” Martinez said .
“ But with the way things are now , I wonder every day how I ’m going to get through the month . ”
By ratcheting up the pressure on customers , major banks -- some of which have received billions of dollars in bailout cash from taxpayers -- are making it likely that a growing percentage will be forced to either default on their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection .
Advertisement
Last week , letters arrived at the homes of Citibank cardholders throughout California warning that their rates could rise to 29.99 % if they miss a single payment -- even for cards with low - low - low introductory rates .
Citi customers have the right to decline any such rate hike .
But if they do , their account will be closed as soon as the card expires .
And that ’s one of the more generous conditions offered by a leading bank .
Other lenders say cardholders who do n’t want higher rates can close their accounts immediately and pay off the outstanding balance .
Samuel Wang , a Citi spokesman , blamed the rate hike on the “ difficult market environment ” and “ severe funding dislocation . ”
In other words , business has gone down the tubes .

Citi lost $ 18.7 billion last year and received $ 45 billion in bailout cash from taxpayers .
“ In light of these unprecedented developments and others , Citi is repricing a group of customers in our Citi - branded consumer credit card business in the U.S. to appropriately manage these risks , ” Wang said .
“ We are carrying out this repricing in order to continue lending in this environment . ”
American Express cited a similar rationale to explain why it had raised interest rates by up to 3 percentage points for millions of cardholders last month .
“ It was because of the challenging environment that we ’re in and the cost of doing business , ” said Desiree Fish , a company spokeswoman .

A Chase spokeswoman declined to comment on the company ’s new $ 10 fee , saying only that “ we make changes to pricing , terms or credit lines based on borrower risk , market conditions , and the costs to us of making loans . ”
So what can you do to protect yourself ?
The best thing , obviously , is to not carry a balance on your plastic .
Or if you do carry a balance , do n’t let it grow larger .
But that ’s not an option for many people , especially with jobs disappearing and money growing tighter .
If you have to carry a balance , limit the damage by using only one or two cards .
Always make at least the minimum payment required .
Late fees and higher rates ensue when payments are missed .
If you run up thousands of dollars in debt on multiple cards , you may want to contact a credit counseling service ( as opposed to so - called credit repair services or debt settlement firms , which are frequently rip - offs and should be avoided ) .
Advertisement
A reputable credit counselor can help restructure your debt into more manageable payments and perhaps even bargain for better terms from banks , which ultimately would rather that you pay less than the total amount owed than nothing at all .
A good place to start is the National Foundation for Credit Counseling , which can help steer you toward resources in your area .
In many cases , the counselor ’s fees will be paid by the lenders themselves .
Watch out for any credit counselor who demands hefty fees upfront or who is n’t affiliated with either the National Foundation for Credit Counseling or the Assn. of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies .
“ There ’s no pretty picture for being deep in debt right now , ” said Linda Sherry , a spokeswoman for Consumer Action .
“ If you start missing payments , chances are you ’ll end up ruining your credit . ”

That might not sound like such a terrible thing at the moment .
But down the road , when we finally get through this mess , you may be in the market for a car or a house or some other purchase requiring banks to be your buddy .
Keep your eye on the bigger picture .

After all the hullabaloo last week about Hulu dropping support for Boxee , the popular Mac - based XBMC port , a new beta of Plex ( another Mac XBMC port ) drops , which offers a working Hulu plug - in in its new App Store .
As a fan of the entire XBMC project , any new release on any platform is exciting , but besides the original Xbox version , I ’ve spent the most time with Plex .
( Here ’s a Plex writeup I did over at Macworld last October . )
To install Plex plug-ins via the new App Store , install the latest beta version 0.7.8 , and under Applications visit the store .
There you can install apps–like the Hulu , YouTube , TED Talks , and TWiT viewers , for example –upgrade and restart them .
Right now I ’m streaming red carpet highlights from the Oscars last night thanks to Hulu through Plex without a hitch ( or a hack ) .
Nice work , Plex crew .
Update : I asked Plex ’s lead developer Elan Feingold if he could explain why Hulu got pulled from Boxee and other XBMC ports but works on Plex .
He said ,
Gentle Giant were a British progressive rock band founded in London , United Kingdom active between 1970 and 1980 .
The band was known for the complexity and sophistication of its music and for the varied musical skills of its members .
All of the band members , except the first two drummers , were multi-instrumentalists .
Although not commercially successful , they did achieve a cult following .
The band 's onetime stated aim was to " expand the frontiers of contemporary popular music at the risk of becoming very unpopular , " although this stance was to alter significantly with … read more
Sponsorship by corporate brands will replace the disappearing record label , Avril Lavigne 's manager Terry McBride told us one soggy summer day last year .
" We 'll have Dorito™ - sponsored bands .
They 'll come to an artist with a $ 5 m ad budget , and they will say will add x money to your business , but we want something for that . "
Recorded music would be " an upsell technique " to sell you something else - like a T - shirt .
A few months later , Avril Lavigne left to get a new manager .
Perhaps it 's a coincidence , or perhaps she was n't inspired by Terry 's Doritos™ - centric vision of the future .
Chris Castle calls the dependence on advertising and sponsorship the most worrying trend in music .
" I can't see this new music business producing another Bob Dylan - or anyone like that who openly defies corporatization , " he told us gloomily last year .
Well , a music business dictated by a guy marketing deodorant gets nearer every day .
Announcing its results last week , EMI said it was switching its focus away from the CD , where sales are falling , and focussing on brand advertising " partnerships " and sync licensing deals .
Elio Leoni-Sceti , EMI 's chief executive , had already announced a reorg designed to capture this revenue .
CD sales at EMI declined by 8 per cent to under £ 300 m over the past six months , while digital recorded music sales grew by over a third to top £ 100 m for the first time .
EMI 's publishing business brought in £ 205 m , but did n't show any growth .
A long shadow of debt falls over the company : £ 125 m in interest payments alone , and £ 2.4bn in all .
EMI 's annual loss in 2H 2008 fell to £ 155 m with revenues up to £ 667 m .
The Sony music companies also announced a decline in overall revenue , 22 per cent down year on year .
EMI 's 2H -2008 by numbers
In both cases , they 're large publishing companies as well as recorded music companies .
And in both cases , investors view the publishing side as undervalued , while the recorded music side is a dead duck .
( Sony was one of the labels which helped put the Virgin P2P scheme on ice - the first real new revenue for recorded music in the digital era . )
Yet despite the gloomy prognosis for big labels , there 's interest from corporate sponsors in the total revenue a big artist can generate , as their managers are well aware .
So why not fill the gap by turning bands into singing , dancing , beer and crisp and aftershave adverts ?
The problem is that the future is n't evenly distributed .
With an ad man in charge of music , money flows to the already - established artists : good news for Bryan Adams and Madonna .
If brand sponsorship finds its way to an up - and - coming band , then it comes with strings attached .
I know of one successful Asian rock band that found it could n't play festivals abroad sponsored by a rival beer brand .
This reduces them to chattel .
Disputes between artists and labels are legendary , but at least the artist could still play live , if he or she wanted , down the pub .
The much vaunted " 360 deal " ends that freedom .
As Castle put it here , you 'll have two extremes : " You 'll have extreme commercialization on one hand , and the very indie - oriented artist on the other who rejects taking the king ’s shilling .
There ’s not much in between . " ®

Obama to Arabs : “ what you ’ll see is someone who is listening ”
It ’s impossible to exaggerate the symbolic importance of Barack Obama choosing an Arabic satellite television station for his first formal interview as President — and of taking that opportunity to talk frankly about a new relationship with the Muslim world based on mutual respect and emphasizing listening rather than dictating .
His interview promises a genuinely fresh start in the way the United States interacts with the Arab world and a new dedication to public diplomacy .
Obama on al - Arabiya ( screen capture )
In his conversation with the estimable Hisham Milhem ( a good choice for an interlocutor ) , Obama reached out directly to the Arab public via the Saudi TV station al - Arabiya ( which shrewdly posted the transcript immediately ) .
It signals the importance of the Middle East to the new President , his commitment to engaging on Arab - Israeli peace , his genuinely fresh thinking and new start with the Muslim world , and his recognition of the importance of genuine public diplomacy .
I admit that I ’m a little biased here .
How can I not be thrilled that Obama has adopted the policy advice I ’ve been offering since the publication of “ Taking Arabs Seriously ” in Foreign Affairs back in 2003 ?
And in his first interview anywhere , less than a week into job , no less .
I have to admit it feels a bit odd to see an administration doing things right after all these years .
But that said , credit should go where credit is due .
I do think that this is an extremely significant gambit which signals his commitment to real public diplomacy , his engagement with Middle East issues ( repudiating all the pundits expecting him to neglect foreign policy ) , and his ability to speak in a genuinely new way to the Muslim world .
His remarks hit the sweet spot again and again .
He repeatedly emphasized his intention of moving past the iron walls of the ‘ war on terror ’ and ‘ clash of civilizations ’ which so dominated the Bush era .
“ My job is to communicate to the Muslim world that the United States is not your enemy , ” Obama said , emphasizing as in his inaugural address that he is “ ready to initiate a new partnership [ with the Muslim world ] based on mutual respect and mutual interest . ”
And where so much of the Bush administration ’s ‘ public diplomacy ’ was about manipulating and lecturing , Obama begins — as he should — with listening : “ what I told [ Mitchell ] is start by listening , because all too often the United States starts by dictating .. so let ’s listen . ”
He clearly understands that this wo n’t be easy , that there are real conflicts and obstacles and enemies .
He obviously recognizes that the Gaza crisis and eight years of the Bush administration have left a heavy toll on America ’s reputation and credibility .
He stressed the importance of engaging on Israeli - Arab issues right away , the need for new ideas and approaches , and the interrelationships among the region ’s issues that I ’ve always seen as the key to his Middle East policy ( “ I do think that it is impossible for us to think only in terms of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what ’s happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan .
These things are interrelated . ” )
And above all , he understands that words are only the beginning , and that ultimately deeds and policy will determine Arab views of the United States .
Public diplomacy is not about marketing a lousy policy — it ’s about engaging honestly , publicly , and directly with foreign publics about those policies , explaining and listening and adjusting where appropriate .
Obama gets it :
“ But ultimately , people are going to judge me not by my words but by my actions and my administration ’s actions .
And I think that what you will see over the next several years is that I ’m not going to agree with everything that some Muslim leader may say , or what ’s on a television station in the Arab world — but I think that what you ’ll see is somebody who is listening , who is respectful , and who is trying to promote the interests not just of the United States , but also ordinary people who right now are suffering from poverty and a lack of opportunity .
I want to make sure that I ’m speaking to them , as well . ”
I could n’t have written this script better myself .
Arabs are both impressed and skeptical .
As one prominent Jordanian blogger commented ,
” I agree that , generally , Americans are not the enemy of the Muslim world .
However , I ’m just not sure how to classify those Americans who have big guns , big tanks and big jets that occupy a neighboring country and have a habit of killing a lot of its people .
Or , at least , the Americans who sell those big guns , big tanks and big jets to other people that occupy another neighboring country and have a habit of killing a lot of its people . ”
I will update with additional Arab reaction as it begins to pour in ( it ’s a day too soon for editorials , for the most part there are only a few straightforward news reports like this one in Jordan ’s al - Ghad ) .
Three other important points which have thus far been missed in the general commentary :
This is also outreach to Saudi Arabia .
Al - Arabiya is the Saudi contestant in the Arab media wars , and scoring the first interview with Obama is a major coup .
It has lost a lot of ground because of Gaza , and this will help it regain some buzz .
After the initial perceived snub of the Saudis , Obama has now had a much - hyped phone call with King Abdullah and now given the Saudi al - Arabiya his first interview .
Feathers have been smoothed in Riyadh .
Not al - Jazeera .
Granting the first interview to al - Jazeera would have reached a much larger audience , and would have been more daring — like going on to Fox News instead of MSNBC .
Bush administration officials almost always used al - Arabiya on those rare occasions when they wanted to talk to the Arab public , so this is n’t a change .
That said , there will be time for al - Jazeera down the road , and I hope Obama does n’t shy away from that challenge .
Not al - Hurra .
Would n’t it be nice if the United States had its own Arabic - language satellite television station to present such exclusive , desirable interviews ?
Oh , wait … the U.S. has spent half a billion dollars on one which nobody watches .
Forget the Broadcasting Board of Governor ’s endlessly optimistic presentation of fabulous increases in al - Hurra ’s audience and market share .
Obama ’s choice to give his ground - breaking interview to the Saudi al - Arabiya and not to the American al - Hurra is as clear a statement as it is possible to make of al - Hurra ’s failure .
It ’s time to face the facts and clean house to recoup some of that investment .
More to come , no doubt .
This is only a start and wo n’t solve anything on it ’s own , but this is simply an outstanding way to start transforming the American engagement with the Arab world .
Well done .
UPDATE : in light of its relevance to Obama ’s outreach to Arab television , Foreign Affairs has made the full text of my 2003 article available online for free .

My wife is a smoker .
Except for one year when she quit , she ’s been a smoker since she was about 18 .
But she ’s cut back , from as many as three packs a day to just three cigarettes .
And , she now smokes outside the house .
At various times , she was asked to show an ID .
When in her 20s she saw it as an annoyance .
By her 30s and 40s , it was a compliment .
Now it ’s just downright annoying .
The law restricts persons under 18 years of age from buying or smoking cigarettes .
My wife understands why she must be “ carded . ”
Yesterday she was carded when she wanted to buy two lighters .
The sweet lady at the grocery checkout counter said that the chain store is carding everyone who buys lighters .
Something about a juvenile who used a lighter and accidentally set his house on fire .
The law does n’t say a person must be at least 18 to buy a cigarette lighter .
But , the reasoning is that people buy cigarette lighters to — well — light cigarettes .
Therefore , cigarette lighters — which can be used for many things other than to light up — also must be controlled .
So , every adult , from the 20s to the gray - haired elderly , will also be “ carded ” when they buy lighters .
If this restrictive and selective enforcement continues , we might soon see stores carding people who buy cups , because they could be used to hold beer .
Anyone who buys watermelons would be carded since plugged , spiked , and corked watermelons are a delightful summer treat .
Jello , once promoted by all - American “ dad ” Bill Cosby , would be suspect , since there are n’t many college parties without Jello shots .
Unlike the sale of cigarettes and liquor , there is no age restriction on most foods .
So , various health - nut organizations and not - so - bright legislators have decided to tax foods they do n’t think are acceptable .
Several legislators have tried , but so far have failed , to enact legislation that would tax high - calorie foods .
New York Gov. David Patterson wants to levy a 15 percent tax on any juice or drink except diet sodas , bottled water , coffee , tea , and milk .
Eventually , we ’ll see a special “ obesity tax ” placed against anything sold at a fast food restaurant .
When you break through the smoke and mirrors , governments really do n’t care about anyone ’s health .
They do care about ways to generate revenue .
Gov. Patterson readily acknowledges that the “ obesity tax ” in New York would generate about $ 400 million additional revenue .
New York also leads the nation in cigarette taxes .
A smoker in New York City pays about $ 9 per pack , which includes a 39 cents federal tax , a $ 2.75 state tax , a $ 1.50 city tax , plus an 8 percent sales tax on top of everything else .
Chicago is second , with taxes totaling $ 3.66 a pack .
States and the federal government collect about $ 26 billion a year in cigarette taxes , according to a New York Times report in August 2008 .
Liquor taxes are n’t meant to make anyone healthy , except the state economy .
In California , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed a five cent a drink tax that , had the legislature not tabled the suggestion , would have raised $ 600 million a year .
Overall , the federal government collected more than $ 9 billion in taxes , while states collected an additional $ 6 billion , according to a comprehensive analysis published in June 2007 by the National Center for Policy Analysis .
With budgets being pumped up by numerous “ sin taxes , ” it wo n’t be long until someone figures out they need not only to card buyers of cigarette lighters , cups , watermelons , and Jello , but that there also needs to be special excise taxes upon these products as well .

The long - awaited game Storytron , from legendary game - designer Chris Crawford , is now visible to the public .
Storytron is a system for creating games in which real stories take place — and it's designed to allow you to create your own stories as well .
The launch - game , Balance of Power is " a geopolitical strategy storyworld . "
You begin on September 12th , 2001 .
You are the President of the United States and your job is to advance American interests , as expressed in a list of policy goals .
These policy goals can be found by clicking on the Things button .
Each of these is a policy of some sort , with its " owner " ( the country that would actually do it ) listed first .
The USA 's own policy actions are at the top of the list .
If you select any of these policy goals , you will see a lot of text explaining exactly what it entails .
The desirability of that policy goal to the USA is also displayed next to the bold text Undesirable_Desirable .
You want to make certain that the policy goals that are desirable are eventually executed , and the ones that are undesirable are never executed .
For now you can just skim through this list , but in order to do well in BoP2 K , you 'll need to familiarize yourself with each of these , even those that do n't appear to affect you .
Why ?
Because you will need to make deals with other countries involving some of those policy - treaties .
Your first task is to select which policy goal you want to pursue first .
You 'll see the incomplete sentence : " I " followed by a menu entitled " Do What ? " listing two choices : " set goal " and " set goal to prevent . "
The first means " I want to set a goal for something I want to achieve . "
The second means " I want to set a goal to prevent something from happening . "
Select the first menu item ( " set goal " ) and a list of twelve policies desirable to the USA is presented .
This being September 12th , 2001 , you want to get your hands on Osama bin Laden .
Select that option and click on the little period button that appears .
( It means : " period–end of sentence –that 's what I want to say . " )
Still , being in thrall to Twitter has n’t stopped Laporte from joining a conversation that ’s taking hold on the service ’s fringes .
As this group of Web subversives sees it , the once - tiny Twitter has grown like a magic beanstalk into a full - fledged communications medium — taking its place alongside Web pages , e-mail and maybe even television .
And though the 30 - person , San Francisco start - up is not exactly General Electric , digital trust - busters believe the same rules apply :
One company should n’t have a monopoly ...
“ They kind of have you , ” said Laporte , who now has more than 100,000 followers on the service .
“ The same way that Facebook has you : because you have to go where the community is . ”
But in spite of his absence , Laporte still became the most - followed user on the service , beating out front - runners like then - Sen .
Barack Obama for the top spot , with more than 30,000 followers .
Walking away from a megaphone that big just did n’t seem like good business .
So he came back .
“ I thought , jeez , I ’m building value in this company that is ultimately vying for my trademark , ” he said recently via phone .
“ So I left . ”
The rise of Twitter has long been a favorite topic of conversation on TWiT , and with an audience of around 150,000 , Laporte found himself in a strange pickle :
The more he talked about Twitter on his show , the more followers he accrued — and the more publicity he gave his brand rival .
The host of one of Silicon Valley ’s most popular podcasts was none too excited that of all the names in the world , the burgeoning message service had picked one that hit piercingly close to home .
The online broadcasting network that Laporte owns and runs a short walk from his house in Petaluma is called TWiT.tv , after his company ’s flagship show , “ This Week in Tech . ”
Leo Laporte at the controls during a recent episode of This Week in Tech ( TWiT ) .

... on an entire medium — even if it invented it .
" Those of us who are participating are pumping value into this closed system and trusting that Twitter will do the right thing with it , " said Laporte , referring to the tweets users pour into Twitter 's databases every day by the million .
People love the convenience and reach of social media systems like Twitter , he said .
" But what they ignore is that there ’s a dark side to all of that , which is that these companies have a huge amount of control over what ’s going on . "
Dave Winer , a Berkeley - based entrepreneur and Web innovator , sounded a similar note on a recent podcast posted to his Scripting News blog .
“ It ’s a very dangerous network because it ’s all centralized , ” he said , “ not only on a technological level , where it goes through one set of servers — but it also goes through one set of business interests that ’s anything but transparent . ”
Danger may sound a bit overzealous for a Web service that barely existed two years ago , but for a media landscape in the middle of a profound shift , two years can be the span between eras .
Twitter is becoming a major source for news , commerce and free expression and , as with a free press itself , defenders do n’t want a few profit - motivated individuals making all the decisions about how it should evolve .
Like Facebook and YouTube before it , Twitter is now transitioning from a freely available , much - loved Web service to a well - funded business venture looking to cash in on the audience and cachet it built in its freewheeling early days .
A few weeks ago , Twitter created a page of several dozen suggested users to help newcomers decide whom to follow .
If you were n’t sure how to proceed , you can follow CNN , Lance Armstrong or Britney Spears .
Being recommended by Twitter , it was quickly discovered , translated into tens or hundreds of thousands of new followers , and anointed accounts have since shot to the top of the Twitter hierarchy .
The giant , instant audiences Twitter bestowed on these select users are thought to be so valuable that Web businessman Jason Calacanis offered Twitter $ 250,000 for a two - year ride on the list .
As visibility and influence gets funneled upward to the companies , celebrities and politicians that already have plenty of both , Twitter risks inviting a comparison to the overinflated economy — it ’s creating a bubble at the top , and potentially alienating regular users who labored to build their audiences over months or years .
Well - known tech figures like Laporte and Winer do n’t exactly represent the voiceless online rabble , but neither are they the types of guys you want leading a charge against you .
Winer recently wrote a post called “ Why it 's time to break out of Twitter , ” where he said of the service ’s management , “ we need to get that power out of their hands . ”
Laporte told me , “ I ’m more interested in seeing if we can go beyond Twitter — a more open system would be a better system . ”
Both critics have installed their own smaller , open - source micro-messaging systems outside of Twitter ’s domain .
Laporte calls his the Twit Army .
The software they ’re using was developed by Evan Prodromou , a developer in Montreal .
Prodromou is the force behind Laconica — an open - source , Twitter - like system that anyone can install ; hundreds of administrators already have , creating a dispersed , decentralized network of Twitter clones that can all talk to one another .
Prodromou compares the state of micro-messaging to the early days of consumer e-mail .
In the early 1990s , the e-mail world was dominated by proprietary dial - up entities like CompuServe , MCI and Prodigy .
But because those systems were competitive , they did n’t connect to one another , and you could send messages only to people inside your own service .
“ I could n’t send you e-mail and you could n’t send me e-mail , ” Prodromou explained .
“ We were on these separate islands .
Making the change to an open standard for Internet e-mail has meant e-mail has become ubiquitous .
I think that ’s where we ’re at now with microblogging . ”
A distributed , networked messaging landscape would have the same advantages as the Web itself : no oligarchy with a final say about what ’s good , and a redundant structure so one part can fail without the whole thing crashing down .
On the other hand , said Twitter creator Jack Dorsey in an e-mail , “ with any new technology , early and strict guidance is needed to foster it . ”
And certainly , without the control Dorsey and his co-founders had over the growth and development of Twitter , the system would n’t exist to fight over .
But maybe that ’s an academic argument .
Twitter is on the radar now , big time , and its competitors and critics are homing in .
If those banging on the gate have their way , micro- blogging will splinter into a thousand pieces , like websites and blogs already have , and Twitter may find itself starting with a lowercase “ t . ”

The economic crisis should be treated as " the difficult birth - pangs of a new global order " , with new rules introduced on trade , Gordon Brown says .
The prime minister set out a series of actions designed to " replace fear with confidence " and warned against just " muddling through as pessimists " .
During a speech defending his handling of the crisis he also warned against the " deglobalisation threat " .
His speech came as a poll suggested the Tory lead had grown to 15 % over Labour .
The UK is now officially in recession for the first time since 1991 , with many businesses blaming difficulties in obtaining loans for the crisis .
' Fill the gap '
Last week the government announced a scheme to offer banks insurance against losing more money from the bad debts which started the credit crunch .
The Bank of England will also be able to buy up to £ 50bn worth of assets in companies in all sectors of the economy .
Addressing the Foreign Press Association in London , Mr Brown said such measures were intended to " fill the gap " in lending .
He added : " We face a choice .
We could allow this crisis to start a retreat from globalisation .
It will be like turning around a supertanker
George Osborne , Conservatives
" As some want , we could close our markets - for capital , financial services , trade and for labour - and therefore reduce the risks of globalisation .
" But that would reduce global growth , deny us the benefits of global trade and confine millions to global poverty .
" Or we could view the threats and challenges we face today as the difficult birth - pangs of a new global order - and our task now as nothing less than making the transition through a new internationalism to the benefits of an expanding global society - not muddling through as pessimists but making the necessary adjustment to a better future and setting the new rules for this new global order . "
' Gloomsters '
He said : " As the downturn spreads across the world , we are , for the first time , seeing cross border flows growing more slowly than domestic flows .
And we are seeing banks favouring domestic lending over foreign lending .
" This is a trend which must be halted if we are to avoid the risk of a damaging worldwide spiral of deleveraging and deglobalisation - with adverse consequences for all economies . "
Mr Brown received some support for his attempts to brighten the gloom as Barclays Bank shares soared 60 % after its chairman and chief executive wrote an open letter to investors saying its profits would be above £ 5.3 bn .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The effects of the recession are now really starting to bite Chris Beaven , Stevenage
And the director general of the Confederation of British Industry , Richard Lambert , wrote in the Daily Telegraph that " the UK is not about to go bust " and that recent government measures " will be enough to prevent something much worse ( than the current recession ) - provided we do n't allow ourselves to get swept away by the gloomsters " .
But SNP spokesman Stewart Hosie described Mr Brown 's comments as " meaningless rubbish " designed to deflect criticism from the prime minister .
" Gordon Brown might be better answering why he allowed a credit bubble during his tenure as chancellor or why debt levels were so high that the recession can now only be fought by doubling the national debt to over £ 1 trillion , " he said .
Meanwhile , shadow chancellor George Osborne told the Institute of Chartered Accountants that a Conservative government would make Whitehall more accountable .
' Incentives '
He promised to include a clause on the responsibility to taxpayers in the employment agreements of senior civil servants , with the Civil Service Code being rewritten to incorporate " responsible financial management " .
Public sector employees should also be rewarded for suggesting waste - cutting ideas , Mr Osborne added .
He said : " We need a new culture of financial discipline across Whitehall .
That means new incentives , new information and new powers of investigation . "
Mr Osborne added : " Creating a new culture of financial discipline in Whitehall is not going to be easy .
It will be like turning around a supertanker .
" But with a determined political will and the right plans , we can do it .
We can turn the Whitehall supertanker and put Britain on the right course . "
A ComRes opinion poll for the Independent suggests the Conservatives have increased their lead over Labour to 15 points - from five points last month .
It puts the party on 43 % , with Labour on 28 % and the Liberal Democrats on 16 % .
ComRes telephoned 1,012 adults from 21 to 22 January .

Tesco refused to sell wine to a suburban mother aged 46 ... in case she gave it to her 14 - year - old daughter
Staff at supermarket giant
Tesco refused to sell wine to a mother - in case she gave it to her 14 - year - old daughter .
Fraud investigator Karen Dumelow , 46 , and her daughter Emily were at the check - out when a cashier said she could not serve her in case the wine was given to the youngster .
She had been about to pay for two bottles of white wine at the Portsmouth store while doing her weekly shopping with her daughter .
Embarrassed and angry : Karen Dumelow with 14 - year - old Emily outside the store that refused to sell wine to her
Mrs Dumelow said she spoke to three senior members of staff who agreed with the cashier who had wanted to see identification for the teenager .
But because Emily was unable to do so Mrs Dumelow was told she could not buy the wine .
She said today : ' The checkout assistant asked Emily for ID and I just told her that obviously she did n't have any because she is only 14 years old .
' I could n't believe what I was hearing .
It was crazy .
Do you have to leave your children at home if you want to buy alcohol now ?
She was then forced to put aside the wine , pay for the rest of the shopping and then send off her daughter to the car before she could pay for the alcohol separately at the same till .
' I was paying for the shopping , not her , how extreme can something get ? "
Mrs Dumelow told the Portsmouth News .
' I would never purchase alcohol for an under - age person .
The supermarket giant tries to stop adults buying alcohol for minors as part of its efforts to curb under - age drinking .
Mrs Dumelow , from Milton near Portsmouth , said today : ' The part that incensed me the most was that literally one minute later I bought the wine from the same till - it was unbelievable .
' All I had to do was send my daughter to the car and all of a sudden everything was OK . '
Emily said she was embarrassed by the incident in the crowded store , adding : ' I do n't understand why they wanted ID for me because the wine was n't for me and I was n't paying . '
Her mother has sent Tesco a written complaint .
Mrs Dumelow , a fraud investigator , said : ' In my job I have to be squeaky clean and that 's how I am outside the office too .
' I would never try and buy my daughter or any other under - age person alcohol and I find it extremely distressing to have been treated this way .
' I have sent Tesco a two - page letter explaining how angry I am .
And I have shown them that my till receipts prove how crazy the whole thing was . '
Tesco today apologised for the incident and the embarrassment it caused .
' We work hard to prevent under - age sales , including proxy sales where adults purchase alcohol for under - 18s .
However in this instance we got it wrong and sincerely apologise . '
As bad as things are for public private equity firm Blackstone ( BX ) , things continue to look worse .
In its earnings announcement , the company warned that it may have to cut its dividend in future quarters , as losses continue to pile up .
Its economic net loss in the quarter was $ 509 million , compared to a profit of $ 99 million a year ago .
Like the rest of the financial world , the company is now playing up its stable , low - margin lines , like financial advisory -- revenue up 91 % to $ 160.7 million !
Heidi Moore at Deal Journal liveblogged the 9:30 call , where the company offered up a few more positive comments :
9:36 : How did the hedge fund business do ?
“ Negative revenues of $ 48 million , ” which reflects declines in values across asset classes in the quarter .
If you ’re wondering how a firm can have negative revenues , it ’s largely due to Blackstone ’s bete noire , mark - to - market accounting .
9:37 : Corporate restructuring , which advises on bankruptcy , had revenues of $ 161 million .
9:38 : “ We believe our balance sheet can withstand an extremely challenging environment , ” James explains .
9:39 : 75 % of portfolio investments are running ahead of last year , in terms of Ebitda .
60 % of Blackstone ’s debt has no appreciable covenants , and the first appreciable maturities are in 2013 .
9:40 : Blackstone is in the “ enviable ” position of being a buyer of assets .
If they do say so themselves .
Shares are currently down over 11 % .

LOS ANGELES , Feb. 17 ( UPI ) -- Elton John 's Rocket Pictures production company is working on " Pride and Predator , " a film that drops space aliens into Jane Austen 's " Pride and Prejudice . "
Variety.com said Will Clark is set to start shooting the latest adaptation of the period romance in London this year .

" Pride and Predator " will feature an alien who crash lands in Regency - era England and butchers some of Austen 's most beloved characters , the entertainment industry trade newspaper said .
Pop star Elton John is serving as executive producer and will supervise the music on the film .
His Rocket Pictures partners Steve Hamilton Shaw and David Furnish are producing .
" It felt like a fresh and funny way to blow apart the done - to - death Jane Austen genre by literally dropping this alien into the middle of a costume drama , where he stalks and slashes to horrific effect , " Furnish told Variety.com .
Colin Firth starred in a wildly popular BBC miniseries version of " Pride and Prejudice " in 1995 , then reprised his iconic Mr. Darcy role in " Bridget Jones 's Diary " and its sequel " Bridget Jones : Edge of Reason , " a modern take on the Austen classic .
Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen starred in a 2005 big - screen version of " Pride & Prejudice " and Bollywood offered its own musical adaptation of the tale , " Bride & Prejudice , " in 2004 .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Secreted in the House version of the stimulus bill the President is trying to rush through Congress is the germ of a major overhaul of the American health care system .
One provision causing increasing concern is the future role of the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology , who will be in charge of collecting and monitoring the health care being provided to every American .
Think of it , a centralized , federal database tracking your every visit to a health care provider - where you went , who you saw , what was diagnosed and what care was provided .
Chilling .
The immediate concern is privacy - traditionally these matters are between a doctor and patient , but now the federal bureaucracy will interpose itself into that relationship .
The bill contains some boilerplate , assuring everyone that the records will be held in strictest confidence , but given the weakness of database security these days , that can be considered more a hope than a guarantee .
The purpose of the database is to help increase health care “ quality , safety and efficiency . ”
The first two goals are commendable , but what does efficiency mean ?
The word is omnipresent in that section of the bill , but not defined .
For guidance one can consult tax - impaired former HHS nominee Tom Daschle ’s 2008 book “ Critical : What We Can Do About the Health - Care Crisis , ” which seems to have inspired that section of the legislation .
In it he discusses various approaches to reducing the costs of health care , including restricting the types of expensive treatments available to seniors and people with severe maladies .
According to Daschle , Americans consume too much expensive health care .
Thus one way to drive down costs is to limit the availability of or access to certain costly services .
To many this sounds like denying care .
But therein lie the efficiencies , making sure that providing health care is tied to a return on investment for society .
If it costs too much to treat you , and you are nearing the end of your life anyway , you may have to do with less , or with nothing .
You just are n’t worth the cost .
Daschle ’s book recommends , and the bill appears to institutionalize , a body free of political influence to make the hard choices regarding how these efficiencies will be realized - what care will be limited , and who will be denied what services .
Naturally politicians would prefer to stay clear of these critical decisions , but do the American people really want questions this important to be free of oversight ?
One would think that the hard questions are the ones most in need of transparency and accountability , and not be buried in bureaucratic secrecy .
It brings to mind Hannah Arendt ’s observation about the banality of evil .
What nondescript GS - 11 will be cutting care from Aunt Sophie after her sudden relapse before he or she heads to the food court for some stir fry ?
There is no telling what metrics will be used to define the efficiencies , but it is clear who will bear the brunt of these decisions .
Those suffering the infirmities of age , surely , and also the physically and mentally disabled , whose health costs are great and whose ability to work productively in the future are low .
And how will premature babies fare under the utilitarian gaze of Washington ’s health efficiency experts ?
Will our severely wounded warriors be forced to forgo treatments and therapies based on their inability to be as productive as they once might have been ?
And will the love between a parent and child have a column on the health bureaucrats ’ spreadsheets ?
Consider the following statement : “ It must be made clear to anyone suffering from an incurable disease that the useless dissipation of costly medications drawn from the public store cannot be justified . ”
This notion is fully in the spirit of the partisans of efficiency but came from a program instituted in Hitler ’s Germany called Aktion T - 4 .
Under this program , elderly people with incurable diseases , young children who were critically disabled , and others who were deemed non-productive , were euthanized .
This was the Nazi version of efficiency , a pitiless expulsion of the “ unproductive ” members of society in the most expeditious way possible .
The program was publicly denounced in 1941 by Clemens Galen , the Catholic Bishop of Muenster , who said in a sermon , “ Here we are dealing with human beings , with our neighbors , brothers and sisters , the poor and invalids … unproductive - perhaps !
But have they , therefore , lost the right to live ? ”
The efficiency - based approach to health care reform is a betrayal of the compact between those who are most capable of work and those who are least capable of defending themselves .
And we have come a long way from what was supposed to be a “ targeted , timely and temporary ” stimulus bill .

The senator from Big Corn is now the president - elect .
And he 's buying the hype on biofuels .
On Tuesday , Stephen Power of the Wall Street Journal reported that Barack Obama 's transition team has been talking to the Renewable Fuels Association ( RFA ) – the trade group funded by the corn ethanol producers – about a bail - out for the ethanol industry .
And on Wednesday , Obama announced that the former governor of Iowa , Tom Vilsack , would be the next secretary of agriculture .
Announcing the selection , Obama said Vilsack would be part of the " team we need " to strengthen rural America , create " green jobs " and " to free our nation from its dependence on oil " .
According to Power 's story , the RFA provided Obama 's team " with some ideas on how to craft the language " on an economic recovery package .
Those suggestions include the creation of up to $ 1bn in short - term credit facilities that could allow ethanol producers to finance their operations " and " a $ 50 bn federal loan guarantee programme to finance investment in new renewable fuel production capacity and supporting infrastructure . "
The RFA also wants the feds to require that any automaker getting federal bail - out money must begin producing fleets that are " flex - fuel " – thus , able burn fuels containing up to 85 % ethanol – no later than 2010 .
Vilsack has long been a biofuels booster .
While governor of Iowa – America 's biggest corn- and corn ethanol - producing state – he promoted corn ethanol production and " cellulosic " ethanol , which can be made from various plant sources .
During his run for the White House , which ended in early 2007 when his campaign ran out of money , Vilsack said he wanted to have the US producing 60 billion gallons of renewable fuel per year by 2030 .
( Current US production , nearly all of it from corn ethanol , is about 10 billion gallons . )
" By picking Vilsack , Obama has bought into the same old deceits about biofuels .
No matter how you slice it , they cannot provide the scale of energy needed to supplant large amounts of oil , " says Tad Patzek , chairman of petroleum engineering department at University of Texas and a longtime critic of biofuels .
" In terms of environmental impacts , biofuels are always worse than conventional gasoline . "
To bolster his point , Patzek points to recent studies which show that biofuels produce more carbon emissions than gasoline .
There are myriad other problems with biofuels , including serious deforestation and pollution impacts .
But the key problem is their effect on food prices .
This year , about 4.1 billion bushels – fully one - third of the entire US corn crop – has been diverted into ethanol distilleries .
Those 4.1 billion bushels of corn is more than two times as much corn as that produced by the entire EU and more than five times as much as that produced by Mexico .
With the corn ethanol scam , Congress has created a system of subsidies and mandates that requires the US to burn food to make motor fuel at a time when there is a growing global shortage of food and no shortage of motor fuel .
And numerous studies have pointed to the link between the ethanol scam and higher food prices .
An April 8 , 2008 internal report by the World Bank ( pdf ) found that grain prices increased by 140 % between January 2002 and February 2008 .
" This increase was caused by a confluence of factors but the most important was the large increase in biofuels production in the US and EU .
Without the increase in biofuels , global wheat and maize [ corn ] stocks would not have declined appreciably and price increases due to other factors would have been moderate . "
In May , Mark Rosegrant of the International Food Policy Research Institute , a Washington , DC - based thinktank whose vision is " a world free of hunger and malnutrition " , testified before the US Senate on biofuels and grain prices .
Rosegrant said that the ethanol mandates caused the price of corn to increase by 29 % , rice to increase by 21 % and wheat by 22 % .
And he estimated that if the global biofuels mandates were eliminated altogether , corn prices would drop by 20 % .
Rosegrant added : " If the current biofuel expansion continues , calorie availability in developing countries is expected to grow more slowly ; and the number of malnourished children is projected to increase . "
Yet another telling report comes from the US department of agriculture .
The first page of the 2007 Food Security Assessment ( pdf ) , released in July , says : " The use of food crops for producing biofuels , growing demand for food in emerging Asian and Latin American countries , and unfavorable weather in some of the largest food - exporting countries in 2006 - 07 all contributed to growth in food prices in recent years . "
Despite these many reports , the ethanol scammers continue to claim that they are not to blame for any increases in food prices .
For instance , the RFA , the same industry now hoping for an Obama bail - out , recently claimed on its website that " corn demand for ethanol has no noticeable impact on retail food prices . "
Perhaps most depressing is the lunacy promoted by the ideologues at Set America Free , a group founded by a group of pro-Iraq war neoconservatives who continue to promote the delusional concept of " energy independence " .
In a May 6 editorial in the Chicago Tribune , one of the group 's leaders , Gal Luft , and his fellow traveler , Robert Zubrin , declared : " Farm commodity prices have almost no effect on retail prices . "
The two stalwarts concluded their screed by saying that the goal should be to " take down " the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries .
" Rather than shut down biofuel programmes , " they wrote , " we need to radically augment them . "
Unfortunately , Obama has bought into the neoconservatives ' absurd claim that biofuels are the answer to America 's energy challenge .
Consumers around the world are going to pay dearly for that delusion .
Barack Obama extended the olive branch to Iran 's leaders last Friday in a videotaped message praising a " great civilization " for " accomplishments " that " have earned the respect of the United States and the world . "
The death of Iranian blogger Omid-Reza Mirsayafi in Tehran 's Evin prison two days earlier was , presumably , not among the accomplishments the president had in mind .
Mr. Obama 's solicitous message , timed to the Persian New Year 's celebration of Nowruz , met a blunt response from the Islamic Republic 's supreme leader , ...

Not so long ago I started finding some car ads that never aired here ( in the UK ) and would only hit screens elsewhere ( from South Africa to France ) but for unknown reasons were deemed unsuitable for presumably innocent British eyes .
Now , these two think it ’s fairly obvious why they did n’t air in the UK , or at least what excuse would be given , but wanted to put em up so they could be more fully enjoyed .
The first , is for a Toyota – though really it ’s just a great ad for air - con :
And this one , again … you can kinda see why it never hit screens here .
Now , I know that the culture is supposedly more laid back in Australia but I still think this ad would ’ve done well over here too .
Put it on after the water - shed and I know that people are going to be thinking they want a new Nissan and ( if they ’ve seen both ads ) they ’re gonna want it with air - conditioning too .
Are we really that politcally correct over here in terms of advertising standards that we could n’t permit a bouncing pair on our screens for 30 seconds ?
I ’m sure the intro for Baywatch was longer than that and featured a lot more bouncing .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A pilot wanted on financial fraud charges parachuted out of his plane over Alabama and allowed the aircraft to crash in neighboring Florida in an apparent attempt to fake his death , sheriff ’s investigators said on Monday .
Authorities launched a manhunt for the pilot , who survived and checked into an Alabama hotel , and then fled , the Santa Rosa County , Florida , sheriff ’s office said .
The pilot , identified as Marcus Schrenker , 38 , was the only person aboard the plane that took off for Florida on Sunday from Anderson , Indiana .
Over Alabama , the pilot made a bogus emergency call , saying the plane ’s windshield had imploded and he was bleeding profusely .
He then put the plane on autopilot and parachuted out , investigators said .
Military jets were scrambled to aid the plane , a Piper PA - 46 Turbo Prop , and the military pilots noticed the Piper ’s door was open .
They followed the empty plane to northwest Florida , where it crashed on Sunday night near the city of Milton , in a swampy area within a few hundred yards of some houses , said Sgt. Scott Haines of Santa Rosa County Sheriff ’s office .
A man believed to be the pilot approached police near the Alabama city of Harpersville on Sunday night , wet up to the knees and seeking help .
He told them he had been in a canoe accident , showed them a drivers license identifying him as Schrenker and was taken by police to a hotel , investigators said .
By the time Alabama authorities learned about the plane crash , he had fled the hotel , Haines said .
“ After Schrenker paid for his room with cash , he put on a black toboggan cap and ran into the woods located next to the hotel , ” he said .
Insurance regulators in Indiana had charged Schrenker with misleading consumers and misappropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars , the Indianapolis Star newspaper reported .
On December 31 , investigators executed criminal search warrants for three wealth management businesses he owned , the newspaper said .
Bank lending has stalled despite the large sums of cash provided to recapitalize banks .
Why ?
Well , bank deposits are down .
And we have to remember that there is a systemic relationship between savings and investment that is at the heart of institutions of financial intermediation .
That is , in fact , why these institutions exist in the first place --- to coordinate economic affairs in a way that the savings of some become investment funds for others .
Now politicians such as Barney Frank are demanding that banks lend even if their deposits do n't justify it because , well , that is why we gave them the money .
Interesting that this comes from Barney Frank , one of the main political agitators for riskier lending practices that got the banks into trouble in the first - place .
Barney Frank personifies the politician as economic criminal throughout this entire episode of public policy errors .
His current policy urgings will just lead to the same sort of behavior by banks that got us here .
I am pretty sure Barney and his friends would think an earthquake in NYC would be good for economic growth because we would have to rebuild the city so construction would go up .
What is seen and what is unseen anyone ?
What we have here in the case of the bank bailout is another confirmation of a general rule that is seen in a variety of walks of economic life --- aid just does n't work , whether to a foreign country or your local bank or to a private citizen , unless it is ( a ) embedded in a favorable rule environment , and ( b ) results in fundamental change to the practices of the recipient .
Ironically , if the receiver is already embedded in a good rule environment , they would already be making the fundamental changes due to profit / loss signals .
Countries , for example , that have good poliitcal / economic rules of the game will attrack foreign direct investment and thus do not need foreign aid .
As Vernon Smith is fond of saying : " It is trade , not aid that is needed . "
Similarly , local banks that are in a rule environment that protects private property , permits free price adjustment , and works on the basis of profit and loss statements will either act in ways to meet consumer demand in the most profitable way available to them , adjust in that direction , or go out of business .
Government bailouts only reinforce BAD decisions by making the consequences of those bad decisions less deterimental than they should be to the firm and the individuals making them .
So we are back to an age old economic concept --- if you subsidize something you get more of it , if you tax something you get less of it .
It is an empirical question about " how much " , but the tendency and direction is a theoretical point .
In the efforts to kick start the banking industry , US policy has simply subsidized bad decision making .
The money transfers have " recapitalized " banks in name only .
Insolvent banks have used the funds to stay afloat , to cover their acquisitions of other failed banks , to cover their own bad decisions , etc .
They have NOT used the funds to lend and fuel investment .
The relationship between savings and investment is n't broken as in the simpliest Keynesian model .
But , it is the Keynesian policy responses that have been pursued which are preventing private actors from making the correct adjustments to the new economic realities and thus bring into alignment saving and investment in a prudent and productive manner .
Why is it so hard for everyone to see this ?
I am always astounded at the speed with which Facebook has enabled the creation of " groups " supporting all manner of things .
Before you can say " coalition government " a number of Facebook groups have sprung up , including Canadians for a Coalition Government , launched by Vancouverites .
Elsewhere in the Facebooksphere there 's For a Coalition Government in Canada / Pour un Gouvernement de Coalition and For a coalition government in Canada / Quebec to save the climate and economy ; and another Canadians for a Coalition Government which has no connection to the other group of the same name .
Before any more groups get started , maybe someone should send invites to Gilles Duceppe , Jack Layton , and Stéphane Dion ?
OTTAWA – The battle against " crass politics " barring controversial British MP George Galloway from entering Canada is headed to court today , Toronto lawyer Barbara Jackman says .
" We will file an application to review the decision that he is inadmissible to Canada , and the decision taken presumptively that he can't have an exemption , " Jackman said yesterday .
Galloway was barred from Canada based on allegations he funded Hamas when he recently led an aid convoy into Gaza .
Canada has banned Hamas as a terrorist group .
" I 've never seen something quite so blatant in terms of crass politics frankly , " said Jackman , an immigration specialist , who accused Immigration Minister Jason Kenney of letting his political beliefs get in the way of doing his job .
" It is not up to him to say Canadians can't hear this member of ( Britain's ) parliament because he does n't like his political views or his activities , " she said .
" This is the problem , he is running the ministry as though it 's the Conservative party ... but he 's not doing that , he running the government for the people of Canada . "
Galloway was to speak on his views of the war in Afghanistan and the Middle East conflict next week in Toronto , Mississauga , Ottawa and Montreal , but officials with the Canada Border Services Agency flagged him as a terrorist sympathizer and closed the door .
Kenney declined to use his powers as immigration minister to overturn the decision .
" He has a right to continue to express his odious opinions , his support for terrorist organizations around the world , " Kenney said .
" But that 's not the issue .
It has nothing to do with freedom of speech and everything to with maintaining the integrity of our immigration act , which says individuals that provide materials and financial support to an illegal terrorist organization are inadmissible for entry into Canada , and I have no intention of second guessing ( that ) , " he said .
The decision to bar Galloway was made under Canada 's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act .
The government informed Galloway by letter , obtained by the Star , that there " are reasonable grounds to believe you have provided financial support for Hamas .
" Specifically , we have information that indicates you organized a convoy worth over £ 1 million in aid and vehicles to Hamas , and personally donated vehicles and financing to ( former ) Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniyeh .
Your material support for this organization makes you inadmissible to Canada , " the letter said .
Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae ( Toronto Centre ) said that while Galloway does have " bizarre opinions , " he should be allowed to share them .

I 've already asked if you could pay for a Costco membership by saving on gas alone ?
( answer : probably not . )
But now comes this question :
Can you pay for a Costco membership by eating free samples ?
Here 's why I ask :
A few days ago , a friend told me that at least once a week he and his wife head off to Costco to shop .
When there , they eat enough samples that they are no longer hungry and that these trips serve as a meal for them .
Yep , true story -- I 'm not making this up .
So let 's say you would have spent $ 2.50 on the meal ( which is a decent meal if cooked / prepared at home but very low if you were looking to eat out . )
So if you saved $ 2.50 per week for 52 weeks , that 's a savings of $ 130 per year .
And this is per person .
So if my friend and his wife each skipped a meal each week because they ate at Costco , they were saving $ 260 per year .
At this rate , they are certainly saving enough money to justify the Costco annual membership costs .
A few other factors that influence the payout calculation :
If by " shopping " at Costco once per week they ended up buying more than they would have otherwise and / or spent more on items they would have purchased elsewhere at cheaper prices , then their savings could be eaten up quickly .
If they would have spent more than $ 2.50 per meal per person , then their savings would be greater .
If they had more people eat the samples ( like their kids ) , then their savings would be greater .
Once a week is a bit extreme , but even if you employ this strategy only once a month , a husband and wife can still save $ 60 per year eating a Costco and pay for their entire annual membership this way .
I 've talked before about how we often eat at Costco during sample time and often we 're so full that we skip meals ( or at least postpone them ) because we 're so full , but we do n't use this as an intentional money - saving technique .
In addition , we often each the samples because we 're genuinely interested in trying something new -- something we probably would n't buy anyway without the sample -- that we may or may not buy after trying it .
I 'd guess that we end up buying one in ten items we sample , maybe a bit fewer .
So , what do you think ?
Is this a valid way to save money ?
Or do you think people would end up buying too much that would erase their savings ?
Or maybe using this strategy is in some way dishonest and over - the - top when it comes to saving money ?
I 'm interested in your thoughts .

I seldom have anything nice to say about the games I play , and realize that to a casual observer it would seem I should find a new hobby .
But all of you know better .
A video game is like pizza - even when it 's bad it 's good .
Or is that sex ?
Whatever .
The point is that there are gems buried in all the shit we play ; gems buried in all the shit we do .
Sometimes it just takes some digging to find them .
That , and a healthy appetite for shit .
Take Vampire Rain , for instance .
No , seriously :
Special thanks to kn0thing for the Don LaFontaine impressions .
Now there was a man with a healthy appetite for shit ...
Believe it or not , IBM has filed for a patent on tech that heightens our reflexes so that we could , theoretically , dodge bullets like Neo in The Matrix .

This " Bionic Body Armor " would continuously scan the area for incoming projectiles .
If one is detected , the system would deliver a shock to the muscles causing a swift , reflexive action away from the bullet .
The present invention relates generally to the protection of an individual against a projectile propelled from a firearm .
More particularly , the present invention relates to a body armor system and its method of use that is capable of detecting a projectile propelled from a firearm , computing the trajectory of the projectile , and moving the individual out of the path of the projectile to avoid being hit .

Damn , that might actually work .
I mean , think about how fast you move your hand away from a hot stove .
Would that kind of movement actually be fast enough to dodge a bullet ?

Pennsylvania native Curtis Clark readies his boat for a day on quagga - mussel - infested Lake Mead .
Clark tows his boat all over the West , and he ’s willing to do what it takes to make sure his boat is n’t spreading mussels — and misery — to fresh bodies of water .
Researchers believe Lake Mead was infested by a pleasure boat carrying mussels from the Midwest .

Since 2003 , reporter Dan Egan has been reporting on threats facing the lakes .
His groundbreaking work has shown the damage caused by invasive species and has laid out the bold steps that could be taken to restore and protect the world ’s largest freshwater system .

By of the
Lake Mead , Nev. -
It took some of America 's best engineers , thousands of laborers and two years of around - the - clock concrete pouring to build the 726 - foot - high Hoover Dam back in the 1930s .
It took less time than that for the tiny , brainless quagga mussel to bring operators of this modern wonder of the world to their knees .
While federal lawmakers continue to squabble over how to stop overseas ships from dumping unwanted organisms into the world 's largest freshwater system , the Great Lakes ' most vexing invasive - species problem has gone national .
And so is the pressure to change the way the lakes ' shrinking overseas shipping industry operates .
An average of fewer than two ocean ships per day now arrive in the Great Lakes during the nine - month shipping season , yet the industry is still responsible for most of the invasive species introductions into the lakes since the St. Lawrence Seaway opened 50 years ago .
" Some people think we just have a handful of ships coming in and that it 's just a Great Lakes problem , but it 's not , " says Jennifer Nalbone of the conservation group Great Lakes United .
" Our invasions are spreading like wildfire across the continent . "
Zebra and quagga mussels have been making a particular mess of the Great Lakes ecosystem and economy since they were discovered in the late 1980s .
The filter - feeding machines have cost this region billions of dollars by plugging industrial water intake pipes , starving fish populations and spawning noxious algae outbreaks that have trashed some of the Midwest 's most prized shoreline .
For nearly two decades the western U.S. was spared this havoc .
No more .
The first quagga mussel west of the Continental Divide was discovered on Jan. 6 , 2007 .
It was likely a stowaway hiding on the hull or in the bilge water of a Midwestern pleasure boat pulled across the Great Plains , over the Rockies and down a boat ramp at Lake Mead near Las Vegas , where a marina worker found some suspicious shells clinging to an anchor .
" We did n't think much about it , " says Bob Gripentog , general manager of the Las Vegas Boat Harbor & Lake Mead Marina .
" There was just one or two .
Literally . "
When the find was confirmed to be quaggas , biologists knew it meant big trouble for an arid region of the country that would wither without its complex plumbing system of hydroelectric dams , reservoirs , irrigation tunnels , pump stations , canals and aqueducts .
They just did n't know how quickly that trouble would come .
What took decades to unfold in the Great Lakes has played out in a matter of months in Lake Mead .
Quaggas can lay eggs six or seven times a year in the warmer water , compared with once or twice a year in the Great Lakes .
If you drained Lake Mead above Hoover Dam , says National Park Service biologist Bryan Moore , it would reveal that brown canyon walls that were mussel - free just two years ago are now black with quaggas at densities of up to 55,000 per square meter .
The pattern for most biological invasions is a population explosion followed by a crash to stable , sustainable levels .
Thus far , the mussels show no sign of declining .
Divers report them smothering everything on the lake bottom , from beer cans to a downed B - 29 bomber .
The rapacious , razor - sharp invaders are bloodying Lake Mead marina workers and are so thick in some places they 've even sunk buoys .
And they 're spreading into fresh waters .
As of last week , zebra and quagga mussels turned up in 33 bodies of water across Nevada , Arizona , California , Colorado and Utah .
Staggering costs
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation researcher Leonard Willett works in the lower intestines of Hoover Dam , in a windowless office converted into a war room to beat back the clustering mussels with chemicals , heat and even bacteria .
He says common sense tells him this little speck of a critter should n't be a threat to something as grand as this concrete dam , which is thicker than the lengths of two football fields .
Yet Willett is in a nonstop fight against a foe that is clogging the dam 's cooling pipes like plaque in the arteries of a heart - diseased patient .
If he loses , the generators will overheat , and a power plant that can supply electricity to half a million homes will shut down .
" You would n't think that a little fingernail - sized mollusk could stop or slow down a dam this size , but when you see what these little critters can do , it is amazing , " he says .
" They can quickly start shutting down even the largest infrastructures . "
About a half - hour down the road from Hoover Dam , Ron Zegers , director of the Southern Nevada Water System , pulls up a video on his computer .
The grainy images taken by scuba divers reveal mussel colonies beginning to clog the Lake Mead intakes for the two giant pipes that turned Las Vegas from a dusty railroad town into . . .
Las Vegas .
" Last year we did n't have a problem at all , " he says .
This year his agency is looking at spending up to $ 20 million to build a chemical system to keep the waterworks mussel - free , and that excludes annual operation and maintenance costs that will include sending divers to plunge more than 100 feet below the Lake Mead surface to periodically scrape mussels off the water intakes .
Zegers , who used to live in Illinois , says he is familiar with the problems invasive mussels can cause .
But he says it is a different deal out West because of the climate and the way water is used and delivered .
He points to some Las Vegas - area golf courses that rely on untreated water drawn directly from Lake Mead .
Because the golf courses open for business all year , the pipes do n't have a chance to dry out and kill invading mussels .
That leaves them primed to get plugged .
It 's a similar story for farmers .
Nobody can put an exact price tag on what all this will cost the West , but in his testimony to Congress last summer , Ric De Leon of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California noted that the annual pipe - clogging cost for mussels in the Great Lakes is about $ 100 million .
He predicted costs in the West could exceed $ 250 million annually because of the extensive waterway networks lacing this dry side of the continent .
He noted there are about 1,800 public water systems in the West drawing on surface water to serve 47.5 million people .
De Leon does n't expect the mussels to ever be eradicated from the West .
" We just want to try to keep them at a level where they do n't interfere with our ability to convey water . "
Transport consequences
It 's not just water - consuming businesses that are going to pay the bill for this unnatural disaster spawned by the relatively tiny Great Lakes overseas shipping industry .
Great Lakes oceangoing ships primarily haul steel and grain , and the whole enterprise is worth $ 55 million a year in terms of transportation savings , according to a 2005 Joyce Foundation - funded analysis of overseas cargo flows on the Great Lakes .
In other words , it would cost the region that much more if overseas ships were n't allowed into the Great Lakes and their cargo were instead hauled by some other mode , such as truck , rail or Mississippi River barge .
In contrast , Lake Mead Marina manager Gripentog predicts the costs to the West 's recreational boating industry alone will be immense in the coming few years .
Mussels are smothering everything under the waterline at his 1,400 - boat marina , making simple maintenance on boats and floating docks expensive , time - consuming and dangerous .
" The financial impact is huge , but it trickles through so you do n't see it all at once , " he says .
" You 're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars ( at this marina ) over three or four years .
And it 's going to get worse . "
It 's already pretty bad for marina dock worker John Koeller , who figures he cuts himself 10 to 15 times a day because anything he plucks from the water " is like grabbing something that 's covered in broken glass . "
The worst is when hot weather hits - which is , of course , much of the year - and he can't wear a protective wetsuit while working in the water .
His thumb freshly sliced up from a morning 's work on a dock truss , Koeller lifts his T - shirt to reveal arms scored by mussel shell scars .
He says there are some days he comes out of the water so bloody " it looks like you 've been attacked by a shark . "
An oblivious public
Bob Walsh , a lanky and laconic spokesman for the Bureau of Reclamation , turns to a Journal Sentinel reporter after listening to colleague Willett tick off all the troubles mussels have suddenly caused dam operators .
" It would have been nice , " he deadpans , " if you had kept them on the other side of the Rockies . "
We had the chance .
The first zebra mussel was discovered in the Great Lakes in 1988 , and its cousin , the slightly larger quagga , turned up the following year .
But warnings that the mussels could be on their way into the lakes had been sounded for decades before then , including a 1981 Canadian government report detailing the hazards of ocean vessels dumping their ship - steadying ballast water at Great Lakes ports .
It zeroed in on zebra mussels - which at the time were plaguing Britain and Russia - as a species uniquely suited for surviving an open sea journey in a ship 's ballast tanks .
Nearly three decades later , Congress has yet to force ships to stop dumping this never - ending biological pollution .
The Great Lakes are now home to at least 185 non -native species .
A new one is discovered , on average , about every six months , and in recent decades most have arrived as hitchhikers aboard oceangoing vessels .
History shows that once an invasive species becomes established in the Great Lakes , it likely will never be eradicated .
That does n't mean the lakes - or the nation - have already seen everything the outside world can throw at them .
The viral fish - killing disease known as VHS , for example , was not detected in the Great Lakes until 2005 .
Zebra and quagga mussels are the marquee name today .
Tomorrow it might be the monkey goby , one of the species singled out by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a January report that identified 30 organisms that have yet to colonize the lakes but are medium - to high - risk candidates to do so - if more is n't done to protect the lakes .
The primary protection the lakes have at the moment is a requirement that ships exchange their ballast water with mid-ocean saltwater before arriving at the gates of the St. Lawrence Seaway , a step that scientists say goes a long way toward reducing unwanted freshwater species , but not all the way .
A national ballast bill that would require all ships entering U.S. waters to install treatment systems to kill ballast dwellers passed the House last summer .
It was supported by many Great Lakes conservationists , but it stalled in the Senate over concerns by some who said it was not tough enough .
Among them was Nina Bell , executive director of the Oregon - based Northwest Environmental Advocates , a group that has chosen to use the courts to push the federal government to treat ballast water like any other industrial pollutant spilling from a pipe .
Bell says many Westerners have yet to awaken to the fact that the Great Lakes ballast problem is now their problem .
" There are very , very few people who consider the Great Lakes invasive species issue to be a national problem , " she says .
" The people who are running the irrigation systems and the drinking water systems and other infrastructures have their eye on the issue , but everybody else is kind of oblivious . "
Great Lakes advocates are n't happy to see the misery spread , but they are hopeful it will alert lawmakers in other regions of the country to the damage being done .
" An invasion into the Great Lakes , " says conservationist Nalbone , " is an invasion into the heartland of North America . "
Dozens of conservation groups have said they support a moratorium on overseas freighters in the Great Lakes if the ballast problem cannot be solved with a new law .
The battle grows
Left on their own , quagga and zebra mussels expand their range when the microscopic juveniles catch rides on river or lake currents .
That means every waterway on the Colorado River downstream from Lake Mead is likely to be infested eventually .
The waters above Lake Mead , however , are also vulnerable because mussels can be carried in the bilge water and hulls of recreational boats .
The Park Service , which figures the mussels have been in Lake Mead since 2005 , is trying to protect the rest of the West 's waters by requiring boats that have been docked in a slip to be decontaminated with jets of scalding water before departing Lake Mead .
A killer hotwash costs about $ 40 for a small boat and up to $ 200 for a houseboat .
The rules are targeted directly at guys such as Curtis Clark , a retired oil fields worker originally from Pennsylvania who now travels the West in his pumpkin - colored Ford Ranchero trailing a 26 - foot MacGregor sailboat .
" They 've got to do something , " he says of the new rules as he prepped his boat on the shore of Lake Mead .
" Look at the frustrations we have going on here . "
Lake Mead biologist Moore says the majority of boaters are cooperative like Clark , but there are still plenty of scofflaws .
" You can't control every boater , " he says .
" It only takes one guy that does n't care , and there are a lot of those guys . "
That 's got states such as Utah taking drastic steps .
Sitting in his Ogden police chief 's chair at the bottom of the mountain that hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics downhill , part - time legislator Jon Greiner pulls up a computer map of the U.S. freckled with red dots representing mussel - infested waters .
He points to the Great Lakes , where dots meld into swaths of red over what should be blue waters .
" We do n't want to look like this , " he says .
So Greiner sponsored a bill last year that gives Utah law enforcement workers authority to stop and detain a boat if it might be coming from infested waters .
State officials also now have the authority to close entire lakes to boaters to check the mussels ' spread .
These are some heavy - duty measures for an anti-regulation state .
" I was floored by how quickly they acted on this issue , " says Mark Vinson , a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who recently moved to Wisconsin after spending 17 years on the faculty at Utah State University .
Vinson said he worked with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources on a number of other invasive species issues over the years , trying to persuade state lawmakers to spend money and pass laws to slow their spread , and they got nowhere .
Then quagga mussels showed up in Lake Mead .
" And it was boom , " he says , " instant money . "
Their motives , he figures , also have to do with money .
" It was n't just a sporting or recreation or aesthetic issue , " he said .
" It was industry . "
Pondering solutions
Radical steps are being pondered elsewhere .
Californians are considering poisoning a 175 - acre reservoir south of San Francisco recently confirmed to be infested with an isolated colony of zebra mussels .
The hope is to kill the population before it becomes a launching point to spread invasions into area waters .
Estimates for the plan range from hundreds of thousands of dollars to $ 5 million , and there is no guarantee it will work .
The biggest body of water to be successfully poisoned for zebra mussels is a 12 - acre quarry in Virginia .
Lorri Gray , regional director for the Bureau of Reclamation in Boulder City , Nev. , meanwhile , worries about the ecological damage the mussels could do to dozens of native species already suffering from the dam construction projects during the past century .
This is more than an ecological concern .
The federal government plans to spend about $ 1 billion in the coming decades to help these species recover , and zebra and quagga mussels have a history of ravaging native species in the waters they invade .
In Lake Michigan , for example , prey fish numbers are less than 10 % of what they were before the invasive mussels arrived .
Gray also frets for the farmers downstream who could lose the irrigation water .
" The last thing they need is another operation and maintenance cost or burden , " she says .
That has her thinking big .
She 's thinking it might be a good idea to bring in some sterilized mussel - eating Asian carp .
She 's thinking black carp , specifically , which are the biggest of the four species of Asian carp that are loose in the Mississippi River basin and threatening to invade the Great Lakes .
Black carp can grow to nearly five feet long and weigh 150 pounds , thanks to human - sized molars in the backs of their throats that make them mussel - crunching machines .
The fish are , however , also an invasive species and are illegal in most cases to transport across state lines .
But Gray is desperate .
" That may be a good thing or a bad thing , " she says .
" But that 's something we 're willing to explore . "
Lake Mead marina manager Gripentog says he expects the Great Lakes region to consider equally radical measures to keep the next mollusk , virus or fish from making a fresh mess in his backyard .
He says a Great Lakes - specific fleet that could pick up overseas cargo somewhere near the East Coast might do the trick .
He says it 's no crazier than what Westerners are being forced to do now .
" Transferring cargo between boats , that 's probably costly , " he says .
" But in the long run that 's probably cheaper compared to what average people are having to deal with . "

On February 8 , Karen DeYoung , writing for the CIA ’s favorite newspaper , the Washington Post , reported that “ President Obama plans to order a sweeping overhaul of the National Security Council , expanding its membership and increasing its authority to set strategy across a wide spectrum of international and domestic issues . ”
National security adviser and former Marine commandant James L. Jones .
According to national security adviser and former Marine commandant James L. Jones , the “ world that we live in has changed so dramatically in this decade that organizations that were created to meet a certain set of criteria no longer are terribly useful . ”
Obama will issue a presidential directive that will “ expand the NSC ’s reach far beyond the range of traditional foreign policy issues and turn it into a much more elastic body . ”
So dangerous is the world now , according to the argument offered by Jones , the NSC will apparently encompass “ the Energy Department , Commerce Department and Treasury , all the law enforcement agencies , the Drug Enforcement Administration , all of those things . ”
After Obama issues his directive , the NSC will strive to “ embrace a broader membership ” and roll these government agencies into the National Security State , initially created in 1947 when Congress passed the National Security Act .
In addition to the NSC , this legislation created the CIA and institutionalized under the rubric of “ national security ” the justification for new weapons systems , huge military expenditures , and military interventions in the third world .
“ National Security State institutions like the NSC and CIA are also dangerous because they greatly expand the power of the executive branch and thereby threaten the constitutional system of checks and balances , ” writes Jack Nelson - Pallmeyer in his book , Brave New World Order .
“ The institutions that make up the National Security State apparatus are supposedly set up to defend national security and the integrity of the state .
However , they often abuse power , violate national and international laws , and may actually erode the democracy they supposedly defend .
Senate investigations led by Frank Church in 1975 detailed numerous illegal activities conducted by the CIA against U.S. and foreign individuals and groups .
The recent Iran - Contra scandal … offers frightening testimony to abuses of power by the National Security Council , including numerous violations of the U.S. Constitution . ”
It appears the ruling elite will now expand these abuses of power and numerous violations of the U.S. Constitution far beyond the Defense Department and “ a little bit of the State Department , ” as Jones characterizes it .
In one fell swoop , Obama may expand the reach of the Pentagon , the CIA , and the military - industrial complex president Eisenhower warned against in his 1961 farewell speech to the nation .
New NSC directorates will deal with such department - spanning 21st - century issues as cybersecurity , energy , climate change , nation - building and infrastructure .
Many of the functions of the Homeland Security Council , established as a separate White House entity by President Bush after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , may be subsumed into the expanded NSC , although it is still undetermined whether elements of the HSC will remain as a separate body within the White House .
In other words , with a stroke of Obama ’s pen , the military and intelligence policy - making and control functions of the shadow government operating under cover of the NSC — unanswerable to Congress or the American people — will dictate energy policy , computer network security , “ climate change ” mandates , national infrastructure , and the homeland security surveillance gird .
It should be noted that the secret 5412 Committee ( now known simply as the Special Group ) , responsible for black operations , is a component of the NSC .
According to the research of David Guyatt , ( The Secret Gold Treaty : The Truth Behind WW II Gold , Nazi Plunder & Elite Plans To Control Our Financial Future ) the
5412 Committee , which met in Room 40 at the CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia , became the de facto parallel government of the United States , a fact that was later acknowledged by President Eisenhower in his speech regarding the dangers of the “ military industrial complex . ”
At the heart of the US secret government lay a doctrine that was “ driven by the twin goals of reinforcing the private interests that largely control the state and maintaining an international environment in which they can prosper . ”
The broader interests of the people are not permitted to enter the equation , which is reserved entirely for men of wealth and power .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As the Post story notes , Jones ’s deputy , John O. Brennan , a CIA veteran who serves as presidential adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security , “ will review options for the homeland council , including its responsibility for preparing for and responding to natural and terrorism - related domestic disasters . ”
On January 27 , Paul Joseph Watson , writing for Prison Planet , reported on a bill introduced in Congress authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to set up a network of FEMA camp facilities to be used to house U.S. citizens in the event of a national emergency .
“ Ominously , the bill also states that the camps can be used to ‘ meet other appropriate needs , as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security , ’ an open ended mandate which many fear could mean the forced detention of American citizens in the event of widespread rioting after a national emergency or total economic collapse , ” wrote Watson .
Obama ’s directive will pass operational responsibility for this proposed network of internment camps from the DHS directly to the parallel government in the NSC .
The DHS plan — soon to become a plan implemented by the NSC and the Special Group — followed on the heels of the Pentagon ’s announcement late last year that it “ expects to have 20,000 uniformed troops inside the United States by 2011 trained to help state and local officials respond to a nuclear terrorist attack or other domestic catastrophe , ” as the Washington Post reported on December 1 , 2008 .
“ The Pentagon ’s plan calls for three rapid - reaction forces to be ready for emergency response by September 2011 .
The first 4,700 - person unit , built around an active - duty combat brigade based at Fort Stewart , Ga. , was available as of Oct. 1 , said Gen. Victor E. Renuart Jr. , commander of the U.S. Northern Command . ”
According to Bert B. Tussing , director of homeland defense and security issues at the U.S. Army War College ’s Center for Strategic Leadership , the new Pentagon approach “ breaks the mold ” by assigning an active - duty combat brigade to the Northern Command for the first time .
It now appears the ruling elite have plans to break many more molds as they continue their slow motion coup d’état against the Constitution and the American people .
Obama was installed to add finishing touches to the globalist plan to decimate the Constitution , destroy the sovereignty of the United States , impose a military dictatorship — of particular importance to the parallel government as the engineered implosion of the global economy commences — and reduce the greatest nation on earth to third world status .

Growing support for nuclear energy in the U.S. has hinged on three key arguments in recent years :
It offers a carbon - free alternative to coal ; a domestic alternative to petroleum ; and a supposedly cheaper , more reliable alternative to renewable sources like wind and solar .
But according to a new analysis from Climate Progress , existing nuclear power plant technology can generate electricity at no less than $ 0.25 to $ 0.30 per kilowatt - hour ( including fuel and O&M , excluding distribution ) for the first year of operation .
Costs would drop slightly in following years , but that ’s triple today ’s average utility rate , about 10 times the estimated per-kilowatt - hour cost of efficiency - boosting measures , and more than some generation costs for existing renewable energy technologies .
As a result of the research , Climate Progress , which is published by the Center for American Progress Action Fund , said it may nix nuclear energy from the 14 “ stabilization wedges ” included in its proposed climate change response .
The current list suggests 700 gigawatts of nuclear energy plus radioactive waste storage capacity equivalent to 10 Yucca mountains .
In addition to assessing business risks for new nuclear power facilities , study author Craig Severance set out to clarify the notion that short - sighted , anti-nuclear environmentalists halted carbon - free energy development .
High costs , he writes , have thwarted nuclear all along :
Utility executives and Wall Street financiers were the ones who stopped nuclear power ’s expansion in the 1970’s .
As more evidence of the business risks and the costs associated with nuclear power became clear through utilities ’ own experiences , utility boards across the country , and the financial houses who fund them , stopped considering nuclear power a serious future option .
Orders for new plants that had already been advanced , were quietly withdrawn .
The nuclear industry simply failed to compete against other available options , whose risks and costs were significantly lower .
Climate Progress challenged nuclear energy advocates today to go beyond touting relatively low operating costs for paid - off nuclear plants , and provide detailed documentation of cost estimates for energy from new facilities .
As for next - generation nuclear technology ( like Hyperion ’s nuclear - in - a - hot - tub - sized - box device ) , Climate Progress considers it a fine idea — and worth pursuing — but not likely to help us meet 2020 or even 2030 greenhouse - gas emission reduction targets .
As Time ’s Michael Grunwald noted last week , “ It turns out that new plants would be not just extremely expensive but spectacularly expensive . ”
The fallout from overly optimistic early estimates can now be felt around the world , from Finland , where costs have ballooned and progress slowed at a nuclear plant , to Florida , where a plant planned for just off the Keys could cost up to $ 18 billion .
TORONTO , ON - University of Toronto quantum physicists Jeff Lundeen and Aephraim Steinberg have shown that Hardy 's paradox , a proposal that has confounded physicists for over a decade , can be confirmed and ultimately resolved , a task which had seemingly been impossible to perform .
" For nearly a century , the widespread interpretation of quantum mechanics suggests that everything is uncertain until it is observed , and that observation inevitably alters reality , " says Professor Steinberg .
" However , in the 1990s , a technique known as ' interaction - free measurement ' seemed to promise the ability to ' see without looking , ' as a Scientific American article put it at the time .
But when Lucien Hardy proposed that one could never reliably make inferences about past events which had n't been directly observed , a paradox emerged which suggested that whenever one attempted to reason about the past in this way they would be led into error . "
Over the course of nearly two years of work , Steinberg and then - student Jeff Lundeen , now a research associate at the National Research Council of Canada , built a complicated quantum optical experiment and developed new theoretical tools .
In essence , they combined Hardy 's Paradox with a new theory known as weak measurement proposed by Tel Aviv University physicist Yakir Aharonov , showing that in one sense , one can indeed talk about the past , resolving the paradox .
Weak measurement is a tool whereby the presence of a detector is less than the level of uncertainty around what is being measured , so that there is an imperceptible impact on the experiment .
" We found that all of the seemingly paradoxical conclusions in Hardy 's Paradox can , in fact , be experimentally verified , " says Steinberg , " but that the use of weak measurement removes the contradiction . "
" Until recently , it seemed impossible to carry out Hardy 's proposal in practice , let alone to confirm or resolve the paradox , " he says .
" We have finally been able to do so , and to apply Aharonov 's methods to the problem , showing that there is a way , even in quantum mechanics , in which one can quite consistently discuss past events even after they are over and done .
Weak measurement finds what is there without disturbing it . "

It was considered a harsh , if necessary , measure when the U.S. military decided in November to ban all USB drives and removable media from its networks to stop a worm assault .
But compared to what the Air Force 's leaders are doing now , that step seems downright wimpy .
The air service is cutting off its bases ' internet connections , if they do n't comply with strict network security rules .
Recently , internet access was cut off at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama , because personnel at the facility " had n't demonstrated — in our view at the headquarters — their capacity to manage their network in a way that did n't make everyone else vulnerable , " Air Force Chief of Staff Gen .
Norton Schwartz tells InsideDefense.com :
*" This is the kind of effort that 's required up and down the line . " ... * * The internet shutdown at the Alabama base was in response to a specific , " significant " intrusion that threatened the entire service 's networks , according to Schwartz .
* The Maxwell event served as an example to everyone in the Air
Force " that this is not voluntary , that this is the real deal , that we have standards and we will collectively enforce those standards or you wo n't be on the net , " said Schwartz .
Network administrators at Air Force bases already put strict limitations on what sites their troops can and cannot visit .
Many airmen can't access Danger Room , for example — or any site with the word " blog " in the URL .
That 's in addition to Defense Department - wide bans on YouTube , MySpace and other social networking sites .

An Exercise in Species Barcoding
I was able to acquire a data set of 1248 barcode sequences , all of them Lepidoptera ( butterflies and moths ) from Australia .
Each entry gives the name of the specimen ( if known ) , the location it was collected , and a 659 base ( i.e. ACTG ) barcode .
The Big Questions
Can I figure a way to cluster the barcodes into species ?
How many species are there in this data set ?
Will there be a clear answer , or will there be many possible solutions ?
Is the notion of a species even well - defined ?
That is , do the individuals cluster into groups with large - margin boundaries between them , or do they overlap ?
Really we can only hope to answer this question with respect to this particular data set , but perhaps it will give us some insight into other data sets , and into the nature of species in general .

The first two fields are identifiers , the Acantholipes juba is the collector 's guess at the identity of the specimen , and the long field is the DNA barcode .
( I have put in line breaks every 80 characters ; in the actual file the barcode is all on one line . )
By playing with this data , I hoped to answer a few questions .
I started by parsing the data ( using a simple Python script ) and printing some aggregate statistics :
Number of genomes : 1248 ( 801 distinct ) Multi- named genomes : 0 Genome lengths : min=659 , max=659 Character counts : -:1531 A:249466 C:126358 G:120017 N:1505 T:323555
As I said , there are 1248 genome sequences , of which 801 are distinct ( that is , 447 are duplicates of some other sequence ) .
Of those 447 pairs of duplicates , none had different identifying names assigned by the collector , so that 's a good sign .
Every sequence consists of exactly 659 bases .
The sequences consist mostly of the familiar ACTG ( with significantly more T and A than C or G ) but about 0.2 % of the total consisted of either " N " or " - " .
These represent places where it was not possible to get a good read of the actual base .
Now I want to deal with sequences that are similar but not identical .
There are two standard ways to measure the difference between two sequences of characters .
The first , Hamming distance , just compares the first character of one to the first of the other , etc. and sums the number of places where they mismatch .
This might be good enough in a case like ours , where every string has the same length .
But I noticed that many strings end in " N " or " - " , indicating that they might be truncated , and that the truncation might appear earlier in the string .
Consider two strings that are identical , except that one is missing the first character and has a " - " appended at the end .
These two would have a high Hamming distance , because the corresponding characters do n't match ( except by accident ) .
But the Levenshtein distance , which considers insertions and deletions as well as substitutions , would give these two strings a distance of just 1 : 1 point off for the deletion of the first character , then 0 distance for all the characters that are the same , then another 0 for matching the " - " against any character .
There is a well - known dynamic programming algorithm for Levenshtein distance .
I coded this into my script in a few lines , and started it going .
But I measured that my naive implementation was taking 0.8 seconds per comparison , and thus would need around a week to compute all the distances between pairs of sequences .
So I stopped that job and looked for something more efficient .
I easily found a Java implementation by Chas Emerick that did what I wanted .
Since it only computes the distance , and does not give the full derivation of the difference between the two sequences , it needs only O ( n ) storage instead of O ( n2 ) .
I modified it to match " N " and " - " for free , and to return immediately as soon as the difference reaches 4 % of the total number of characters .
You can see the resulting Java file and the output it produces ( see note on Java verbosity ) .
I then went on to analyze the distance data , creating some histograms :
Nearest neighbor counts : 0:774 1:177 2:67 3:16 4:10 5:4 6:1 7:4 9:1 10:2 11:2 12:1 13:2 17:4 25:2 >25:181
Number of neighbors at each distance : 0:5060 1:2774 2:1096 3:570 4:340 5:258 6:112 7:100 8:76 9:194 10:24 11:110 12:356 13:350 14:98 15:20 17:4 19:44 20:52 21:30 22:20 23:20 24:12 25:2
These are easier to visualize with pictures ( leaving off the counts for distance 0 ) :
Number of nearest neighbors at each distance Number of neighbors at each distance ( all at distance > 25 shown at 26 ) ( not counting distance > 25 )
We can see in the graph on the left that most barcodes have a nearest neighbor that is no more than an edit distance of 4 away ( it turns out to be 84 % ) .
If we look ( graph on the right ) at all pairs that are within 4 % of each other , we see again that many are within a distance of 4 , but then there is a small hump at a distance of 12 or 13 ( which is 2 % of 659 ) , and then very few others at larger distances .
So this preliminary analysis is a hint that the species boundary , if it exists at all , might be in the 1 % to 2 % range .
Starting to Cluster
I decided to start by considering both possibilities at once .
That is , I would define a clustering algorithm that takes two parameters , d , the threshold distance to the closest member of the cluster , and dc , the threshold difference to every member ( or equivalently , to the farthest member ) of the cluster .
We call this distance between farthest members of a cluster the diameter of the cluster .
Here is a table of the number of clusters that result for values of d from 0.9 % to 2.1 % ( along the vertical axis ) and for dc between 1.7 % and 2.4 % , as well as 100 % ( along the horizontal axis ) .
A dc value of 100 % means that we are only considering d ( and opposite ends of chains in a cluster can be any distance apart ) .
100 % 2.4 % 2.3 % 2.1 % 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 0.9 % ( 6 ) 390 390 390 390 390 390 390 1.1 % ( 7 ) 386 386 386 386 386 386 386 1.2 % ( 8 ) 384 384 384 384 384 384 384 1.4 % ( 9 ) 383 383 383 383 383 383 383 1.5 % ( 10 ) 381 381 381 381 381 381 382 1.7 % ( 11 ) 378 378 378 380 381 381 382 1.8 % ( 12 ) 377 377 377 379 381 381 382 2.0 % ( 13 ) 375 375 375 377 381 381 382 2.1 % ( 14 ) 375 375 375 377 381 381 382
It looks like the median value is about 382 , and that the high ( 390 ) and low ( 375 ) values are within 2 % either way of the median .
That tells us the variation in the number of clusters , but what about the composition of each cluster ?
How many of them are variable ?
We 'll consider a cluster half changed if exactly one element is added or subtracted , and fully changed if there are two or more additions or subtractions .
Then we consider the list of clusters formed with d=1.7 % and dc=2.1 % , and get the following table of percent of changes according to this half plus full metric :
100 % 2.4 % 2.3 % 2.1 % 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 0.9 % ( 6 ) 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.1 % ( 7 ) 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.2 % ( 8 ) 1.0 % 1.0 % 1.0 % 1.0 % 1.0 % 1.0 % 1.0 % 1.4 % ( 9 ) 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.9 % 1.5 % ( 10 ) 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.9 % 1.7 % ( 11 ) 0.8 % 0.8 % 0.8 % 0.0 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 1.0 % 1.8 % ( 12 ) 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 0.4 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 1.0 % 2.0 % ( 13 ) 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 1.2 % 1.4 % 0.7 % 1.0 % 2.1 % ( 14 ) 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 1.2 % 1.4 % 0.7 % 1.0 %
It looks like the percentage change in clusters is similar to the percentage change in number of clusters .
In other words ( roughly speaking ) , as we put tighter bounds on d and dc the main changes are in splitting up a few clusters into finer grained ones ; beyond that there is very little additional change where elements change clusters .
Note that if we only consider the d parameter ( that is , if we start with some element and then spread out from there , forming a cluster of all elements that can be reached by individual steps of length d or less ) then the results will be deterministic -- they will be the same every time , regardless of the order in which we consider elements .
This is not true of the dc parameter .
If we try to keep every element of a cluster with distance dc of each other than we may get different results if we start with different elements .
To see if this has a major effect , I modified the clustering algorithm to consider elements in random order , and replicated the tables above .
There was almost no difference .
( On a minority of the runs , one of the " 381 " and one of the " 383 " entries changed to " 382 " .
No other changes were observed . )
Now let 's look at the margins between clusters : how far are the elements of a cluster to elements of another cluster ?
For each individual , we ask is it within some multiple of the diameter of its cluster to another cluster ?
We will answer the question for multiples of 1.2 , 1.33 , and 1.5 .
In other words , for 1.2 we are asking how many individuals that we have assigned to a cluster c are also within a distance of 1.2 times the diameter of c to some other individual that is not in the cluster .
Here are the results , again for various values of d and dc :
Percent of individuals within 1.20 * diameter of another cluster .
100 % 2.4 % 2.3 % 2.1 % 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 0.9 % ( 6 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 1.1 % ( 7 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 1.2 % ( 8 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 1.4 % ( 9 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 1.5 % ( 10 ) 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % 1.7 % ( 11 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 20.9 % 33.4 % 1.0 % 1.8 % ( 12 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 20.9 % 33.4 % 1.0 % 2.0 % ( 13 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 21.6 % 33.4 % 1.0 % 2.1 % ( 14 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 21.6 % 33.4 % 1.0 % Percent of individuals within 1.33 * diameter of another cluster .
100 % 2.4 % 2.3 % 2.1 % 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 0.9 % ( 6 ) 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.1 % ( 7 ) 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.2 % ( 8 ) 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 1.4 % ( 9 ) 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 1.5 % ( 10 ) 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.7 % 1.7 % ( 11 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 20.9 % 34.1 % 3.6 % 1.8 % ( 12 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 20.9 % 34.1 % 3.6 % 2.0 % ( 13 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 21.6 % 34.1 % 3.6 % 2.1 % ( 14 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 21.6 % 34.1 % 3.6 % Percent of individuals within 1.50 * diameter of another cluster .
100 % 2.4 % 2.3 % 2.1 % 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 0.9 % ( 6 ) 26.3 % 26.3 % 26.3 % 26.3 % 26.3 % 26.3 % 26.3 % 1.1 % ( 7 ) 25.7 % 25.7 % 25.7 % 25.7 % 25.7 % 25.7 % 25.7 % 1.2 % ( 8 ) 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 1.4 % ( 9 ) 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 1.5 % ( 10 ) 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 51.8 % 1.7 % ( 11 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 23.5 % 57.1 % 52.7 % 1.8 % ( 12 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 23.5 % 57.1 % 52.7 % 2.0 % ( 13 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 24.1 % 57.1 % 52.7 % 2.1 % ( 14 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 3.1 % 24.1 % 57.1 % 52.7 %
We can see that most of the time the individuals are all or almost all at a distance greater than 1.2 times the diameter .
The only exceptions are for the combination d ≥ 1.7 % and 2.1 % ≤ dc ≤ 1.8 % .
I have no idea why that combination is bad .
At a distance of 1.33 times the diameter the same region is bad , and the rest of the parameter space is up slightly , mostly to between 1.3 % and 2.7 % .
At a distance of 1.5 , the results are uniformly bad , with the exception of the lower - left corner of the graph , corresponding to the combination d ≥ 1.7 % and dc % ge ; 2.3 % .
Comparing Clusters to Labels
The next step is to compare the clusters generated by the clustering algorithm to the labels recorded by the collectors who gathered the samples .
The following table gives the number of clusters that are labeled with more than one name , for various choices of d and dc :
100 % 2.4 % 2.3 % 2.1 % 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 0.9 % ( 6 ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.1 % ( 7 ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.2 % ( 8 ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1.4 % ( 9 ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1.5 % ( 10 ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1.7 % ( 11 ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1.8 % ( 12 ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.0 % ( 13 ) 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2.1 % ( 14 ) 3 3 3 3 3 2 2
This looks good ; the algorithm generates very few clusters that the collector thought had different names .
If we want to minimize these , we would choose d=0.9 % or 1.1 % , and would get 390 or 386 clusters .
But we know the collectors are not perfect , so that should not be the only criteria .
Now let 's look at the labels the other way around .
Consider all the specimens with the same label as a cluster , and ask what is the diameter of each cluster according to our metric ?
There are only 291 such clusters , and most of them have a diameter of 7 or less :
Number of clusters formed by labels
at each diameter
There are 17 clusters with a diameter over 2 % .
We give the diameter , the label , and the number of elements in each such cluster :
diameter 15 for Polyclysta hypogrammata ( 3 elements ) diameter 17 for Compsotropha strophiella ( 2 elements ) diameter > 25 for Pyralidae ( 34 elements ) diameter > 25 for Agriophara sp. ( 8 elements ) diameter > 25 for Tortricidae ( 54 elements ) diameter > 25 for Oecophoridae ( 28 elements ) diameter > 25 for Musotima ( 2 elements ) diameter > 25 for Geometridae ( 3 elements ) diameter > 25 for Crambidae ( 11 elements ) diameter > 25 for Lepidoptera ( 31 elements ) diameter > 25 for Proteuxoa ( 6 elements ) diameter > 25 for Plutella xylostella ( 3 elements ) diameter > 25 for Edosa ( 2 elements ) diameter > 25 for Hellula undalis ( 12 elements ) diameter > 25 for Xyloryctinae ( 4 elements ) diameter > 25 for Nolinae ( 4 elements ) diameter > 25 for Noctuidae ( 23 elements )
Note that many of these are labeling problems .
For example , there are 31 specimens that are gabelled just Lepidoptera ( which is the entire Order for " moth or butterfly " ) ; it is no wonder that this cluster has a diameter > 25 .
Most of the other large - diameter clusters are gabelled with family or subfamily names , not with species .
Answering the Big Questions
Can I figure a way to cluster the barcodes into species ?
Yes .
We can cluster barcodes together .
We can get good agreement for about 96 or 97 % of the individuals , but are uncertain of the remaining 3 or 4 % .

How many species are there in this data set ?
I explored answers from 375 to 390 , or equivalently 383±2 % .
There is some evidence ( and some hunches ) to support 384±1 % , but I would hate to have to be more precise than that .

The data does not seem to support a single answer .
But asserting an answer within ±1 % seems reasonable .

But asserting an answer within ±1 % seems reasonable .
Is the notion of a species even well - defined ?
Inconclusive from this data .
There are 1 % to 4 % or so of individuals that are on the border between two species , according to this data .
one way or another .
But you could also say the glass is 95 % full -- most individuals are conclusively clustered together , in a way that makes sense to the person doing the collecting .
More generally , " species " is often defined as a " group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring . "
That 's a start , but it 's not a perfect definition .
First of all , the majority of organisms do not even reproduce sexually .
Birds do it , bees do it , most macroscopic eukaryotes do it , but bacteria and archaea do not , nor do some plants and fungi .
Second , what does " capable of " mean ?
Historically , the Capulets and Montagues did not interbreed ( nor the Sharks and Jets ) , but most observers would say they would be capable .
But what is an observer to say about two groups of frogs that disdain each other ?
How do we know if they are capable of interbreeding ?
Third , there is the problem of transativity of species membership .
Consider the Ensatina salamander .
These exist in the mountains surrounding the Central Valley in California .
The mountains are laid out in a horseshoe shape , and as you traverse the horseshoe , you notice variations in the salamanders .
Each variation can interbreed with its near neighbors , but the ones at the extreme western end cannot interbreed with those at the far eastern end .
They can't be all one species , because they do n't all interbreed , but then neighboring pairs do interbreed , so there is no clear answer as to where to draw the barriers .
Biologists describe this as a ring species which is neither a single species nor a set of multiple discrete species .
It seems we have to accept that species is a natural kind term which has clear prototypes -- paradigmatic cases where everyone can agree what is and is n't a species -- but does not have crisp boundaries .

Abraham Lincoln 's penny has been around since 1909 , when it was inaugurated with several firsts .
It was the first U.S. coin to include the words " In God We Trust , " and the first to include a portrait .
" A strong feeling had prevailed against using portraits on our coins , " said a Treasury Department fact sheet , " but public sentiment stemming from the 100th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln 's birth proved stronger than the long - standing prejudice . "
Now , in honor of the 200th anniversary of Abe 's birth , the U.S. Mint is planning to release four new Lincoln pennies this year .
Of course these days , given the rising price of zinc and copper , it costs about 1.4 cents to make a penny .
As the Washington Post suggested , maybe Congress should change the metal content of the coin to steel .
The first Lincoln penny had Abe 's face on the front and two stalks of wheat on the back .
That was replaced 50 years ago with the ubiquitous image of the Lincoln Memorial .
But this time , the Mint has really thought outside the box and come up with four separate images for the back of the coin -- four images in the life of the 16th president .
The first depicts the one - room log cabin in Kentucky where Lincoln was born .
It 's already in circulation .
The second shows him as a rail splitter in Indiana .
( The mint says it should start moving into circulation in mid-May ) .
The third , due out in August , shows him reporting to work at the Illinois Legislature , and the fourth penny , due in November , depicts the U.S. Capitol without its dome -- a symbol of the civil war that divided the nation when he was president .

No man knows the day or the hour - except those with clock - in swipe cards
The Vatican has reintroduced a system of clocking in , nearly 50 years after it was last phased out .
Senior clerics will have to swipe plastic cards when entering and leaving , all in a drive to improve time - keeping and efficiency .
It was Pope John XXIII , fondly known as the Good Pope , who phased out clocking machines in the early 1960s .
Now the Vatican has brought back a high - tech version involving electronic swipe cards for 2,000 employees .
Lay and ecclesiastical staff working in the tiny city state , are now using the swipe cards .
The cards have been issued to everyone from the lowest office staff to the heads of departments , even if they are priests and archbishops , though there has been no mention if Pope Benedict XVI carries one .
According to reports some elder clerics in the Vatican have complained that clocking in and out is a headache , especially when they have to leave on pastoral duty .
It is all part of a drive to increase efficiency and to make the Vatican more meritocratic .
Next year there are plans to introduce performance - related pay .
SUPPOSE the climate landscape in recent weeks looked something like this :
Half the country was experiencing its mildest winter in years , with no sign of snow in many Northern states .
Most of the Great Lakes were ice - free .
Not a single Canadian province had had a white Christmas .
There was a new study discussing a mysterious surge in global temperatures - a warming trend more intense than computer models had predicted .
Other scientists admitted that , because of a bug in satellite sensors , they had been vastly overestimating the extent of Arctic sea ice .
If all that were happening on the climate - change front , do you think you'd be hearing about it on the news ?
Seeing it on Page 1 of your daily paper ?
Would politicians be exclaiming that global warming was even more of a crisis than they 'd thought ?
Would environmentalists be skewering global - warming " deniers " for clinging to their skepticism despite the growing case against it ?
No doubt .
But it is n't such hints of a planetary warming trend that have been piling up in profusion lately .
Just the opposite .
The United States has shivered through an unusually severe winter , with snow falling in such unlikely destinations as New Orleans , Las Vegas , Alabama , and Georgia .
On Dec. 25 , every Canadian province woke up to a white Christmas , something that had n't happened in 37 years .
Earlier this year , Europe was gripped by such a killing cold wave that trains were shut down in the French Riviera and chimpanzees in the Rome Zoo had to be plied with hot tea .
Last week , satellite data showed three of the Great Lakes - Erie , Superior , and Huron - almost completely frozen over .
In Washington , D.C. , what was supposed to be a massive rally against global warming was upstaged by the heaviest snowfall of the season , which paralyzed the capital .
Meanwhile , the National Snow and Ice Data Center has acknowledged that due to a satellite sensor malfunction , it had been underestimating the extent of Arctic sea ice by 193,000 square miles - an area the size of Spain .
In a new study , University of Wisconsin researchers Kyle Swanson and Anastasios Tsonis conclude that global warming could be going into a decades - long remission .
The current global cooling " is nothing like anything we 've seen since 1950 , " Swanson told Discovery News .
Yes , global cooling : 2008 was the coolest year of the past decade - global temperatures have not exceeded the record high measured in 1998 , notwithstanding the carbon - dioxide that human beings continue to pump into the atmosphere .
None of this proves conclusively that a period of planetary cooling is irrevocably underway , or that anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are not the main driver of global temperatures , or that concerns about a hotter world are overblown .
Individual weather episodes , it always bears repeating , are not the same as broad climate trends .
But considering how much attention would have been lavished on a comparable run of hot weather or on a warming trend that was plainly accelerating , should n't the recent cold phenomena and the absence of any global warming during the past 10 years be getting a little more notice ?
Is n't it possible that the most apocalyptic voices of global - warming alarmism might not be the only ones worth listening to ?
There is no shame in conceding that science still has a long way to go before it fully understands the immense complexity of the Earth 's ever - changing climate (s ) .
It would be shameful not to concede it .
The climate models on which so much global - warming alarmism rests " do not begin to describe the real world that we live in , " says Freeman Dyson , the eminent physicist and futurist .
" The real world is muddy and messy and full of things that we do not yet understand . "
But for many people , the science of climate change is not nearly as important as the religion of climate change .
When Al Gore insisted yet again at a conference last Thursday that there can be no debate about global warming , he was speaking not with the authority of a man of science , but with the closed - minded dogmatism of a religious zealot .
Dogma and zealotry have their virtues , no doubt .
But if we want to understand where global warming has gone , those are n't the tools we need .

A masked gunman has killed a human rights lawyer who exposed one of the most notorious cases of abuses by Russia 's army in Chechnya , together with a journalist who died later in hospital .
Law enforcement sources confirmed that lawyer Stanislav Markelov had been gunned down on a busy street in central Moscow , while a woman , Anastasiya Baburova , was hospitalised with a bullet wound to the head .
The opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta confirmed the death of the 25 - year - old intern reporter Baburova in hospital on Monday evening .
" The doctors did everything in their power .
A few minutes ago , Novaya Gazeta journalist Anastasiya Baburova died , " the paper said on its website .
Following the lawyer 's death , the prosecutor 's investigative department said : " The investigation is studying various theories on the killing , including a link to the deceased 's professional activities . "
Ms Baburova had written a number of reports on Russia 's growing problem of racism and ultra-nationalism for Novaya Gazeta , the paper of the campaigning journalist Anna Politkovskaya , who was assassinated in 2006 .
Human rights campaigner Lyudmila Alexeyeva , who heads the Moscow Helsinki Group , said : " The murder in the centre of Moscow of a man , of a lawyer involved in cases of political importance , has as much significance as the assassination of Anna Politkovskaya . "
Mr Markelov and Ms Baburova had just emerged from a press conference given by Mr Markelov on the latest turn in the case of Elza Kungayeva , the 18 - year - old Chechen whose 2000 strangling by Russian army colonel Yury Budanov became a cause celebre , highlighting systematic abuse by the Russian army in the war in Chechnya .
Budanov was released from jail on Friday after serving most of his 10 - year sentence for the young Chechen woman 's murder .
Mr Markelov had vowed to challenge the granting of early release to Budanov , who was convicted in 2003 after pressure for a conviction by human rights activists , while ultra-nationalists had rallied to his side .

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) are looking into using radio waves to control plasmas and possibly making energy efficient fusion reactors viable .
Current fusion models rely on feeding plasmas through large magnets in controllable ways .
One of the key elements of achieving fusion through these generators , called tokamak generators , is keeping the plasma away from the walls of the containment vessel .
Radio waves can help with this effort and , although more testing is needed , the technique seems to be capable of handling stronger plasma pressures and magnetic fields than currently existing control mechanisms .
The tokamak reactors rely on driving hot plasma fields of various isotopes of hydrogen in toroid shapes through large magnetic fields without touching the walls of their containment units .
The plasmas are millions of degrees hotter than their containers and even the slightest of touches would cool them beyond the level needed to achieve fusion reactions .
At sufficiently high temperatures , two hydrogen atoms – usually the heavier isotope deuterium – fuse into a helium atom when they collide .
The helium atom has a lower binding energy than the hydrogen so excess energy is released when the reaction occurs .
This extra energy could then be harnessed and distributed to meet the power needs currently filled by coal plants and oil and other fossil fuels .
MIT ’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center is home to the Alcator project , currently the largest tokamak - style fusion reactor at any university in the world and the reactor with the most plasma pressure and largest magnetic fields of any reactor , university or otherwise .
The larger and more powerful International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) is in the process of ramping up , but plasma containment and control is expected to pose problems .
Researchers hope this new method of control using radio waves will solve any difficulties in this area , making a viable demonstration fusion power plant possible by 2040 .
The Alcator team has successfully tested the radio wave controllers several times and believes it can be used with the larger and more powerful ITER reactor once it becomes operational .
They ’ve also discovered an additional benefit to using radio waves – a decrease in the turbulence level of the plasma .
Lower levels of turbulence make the reactors more efficient .

Lee Sustar explains how auto company managers -- backed by politicians -- are shifting the blame from their own mismanagement onto autoworkers .
AUTOWORKERS
WILL take sweeping cuts in their paychecks and the elimination of key union work rules if they vote to accept the terms of concessions negotiated as part of $ 17.4 billion in government loans to the Detroit Three automakers .
The negotiations were conducted under duress .
Under the terms of the government loan granted by the outgoing Bush administration the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) was prohibited from striking against concessions , which were mandated under terms of the deal .
What 's more , retiree health care and pensions would be severely underfunded if General Motors ( GM ) , Chrysler and Ford bosses get their way .
According to the government 's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. , pensions at the Detroit Three are $ 41 billion short of the companies ' obligations to workers and retirees .
Now , the companies are trumpeting the UAW 's concessions as well as sweeping job cuts in their bid to get further government loans .
GM , which plans to close 14 plants in the U.S. over the next three years , wants an additional $ 16 billion from the government , on top of the $ 13.4 billion it received in the waning days of the Bush administration .
Workers leaving a shift at the General Motors Powertrain Plant in Warren , Mich . ( Rebecca Cook | Reuters )
Chrysler , which took a $ 4 billion loan in December , wants another $ 5 billion by the end of March .
It plans to cut another 3,000 jobs and further cut production .
The other member of the Detroit Three , Ford , did n't take a government loan , but says it may have to tap a line of credit with the government if its business continues to deteriorate -- so Ford is seeking union concessions as well .
The UAW already granted huge concessions in the 2007 contract , which is still in force .
Under that deal , the union agreed to allow new hires who work off the assembly lines to be paid just $ 14 per hour , about half the current rate .
But when the auto crisis worsened dramatically following last fall 's financial crash , Detroit Three managers and union - hating congressional Republicans piled on to demand further cuts -- making workers pay for decades of bad management by U.S. auto executives .
THE UAW has so far refused to comment officially on the latest concessions to the Detroit Three .
But the Automotive News reported February 18 that the union agreed to concessions so steep that they all but eliminate the differences between pay and working conditions at union and non-union auto plants in the U.S. owned by foreign companies .
According to those reports , the UAW has surrendered overtime pay that kicks in whenever a worker 's eight - hour shift is complete .
Instead , overtime pay will only be paid when a UAW member works more than 40 hours in a given week .
This will have a major impact on take - home pay .
Because hourly wages for UAW members have essentially been flat since 1980 , most workers have boosted their income by working overtime .
Management has encouraged this , since it was cheaper to pay existing workers the higher overtime rate than hire new workers .
Also , the UAW reportedly agreed to eliminate lump - sum bonuses over the next two years , and to allow Chrysler to cancel the $ 600 Christmas bonus .
A further major giveback was a limitation of supplemental unemployment benefits ( SUB ) .
Workers with 20 or more years of seniority can collect pay equivalent of 72 percent of gross pay for 52 weeks , and receive half pay for an additional 52 weeks .
But workers with less than 20 years on the job will get 72 percent pay for just 39 weeks and half pay for another 39 weeks .
What 's more , the automakers -- and the union - busters in Congress , like Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) -- succeeded in getting the UAW leadership to abandon work rules built up over decades .
Management has long hated these work rules because they give workers power and dignity on the job , enabling them to resist unsafe work practices , bullying supervisors and relentless speedups of production .
At Toyota 's Georgetown , Ken. , plant , for example , some 2,000 workers were forced off the job by injuries between 2002 and 2007 , according to pro-UAW activists in the plant .
The concessions do n't end there , however .
The companies are trying to force the UAW to accept drastic cuts in funding for retiree health care , which is set to shift to a union - controlled funds known as the Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Associations ( VEBAs ) in 2010 .
The health plans were already badly underfunded in the original agreement to create the VEBA in the 2007 contract .
Then , GM agreed to hand over to the UAW some $ 35 billion in cash and securities to cover $ 55 billion in retiree health obligations .
The UAW 's VEBA fund managers , it was claimed , would make up the shortfall through wise investments .
The picture was similar at Chrysler , which agreed to pay the UAW $ 8.8 billion to cover health care obligations of $ 18 billion .
For its part , Ford got the UAW to accept just $ 13 billion to cover retiree health care liabilities of $ 23 billion .
Now the Detroit Three want the UAW to accept less cash and more stock to fund the VEBA -- even though GM 's stock , which traded for $ 40 per share in 2007 , is now worth only about $ 3 .
" The government also wants the automakers to pay half of what they owe a UAW health care trust in company stock rather than cash , a move that could save them billions of dollars , " the Detroit News reported .
If the UAW agrees to accept that much stock , it ties itself even more closely to management .
If GM or Chrysler were to go bankrupt , the stock would become worthless and retiree health care would be eliminated .
In any case , UAW President Ron Gettelfinger has sought to do whatever it takes to keep the automakers profitable -- on their terms .
The UAW has barely challenged the media propaganda that workers make $ 72 per hour - - a figure that includes health care costs .
And the union has n't challenged job cuts that have seen the number of UAW workers at GM fall from 265,000 in 1992 to just 73,000 in 2007 -- even though the number of vehicles produced each year actually increased from 4.4 million to 4.5 million .
As retired autoworker Gregg Shotwell put it in his Live Bait & Ammo newsletter :
It ’s not easy being a white supremacist these days .
Already reeling from Obama ’s win in November , believers in white superiority were dealt another blow last week when former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele became the first African - American to head the Republican Party .
Extremists view Steele ’s election to the helm of the Republican National Committee as a betrayal by the party that many considered , in their words , “ the lesser of two evils . ”
On blogs and online forums , they excoriated the Republican Party for supposedly pandering to minorities while abandoning what they see as its white base .
No one professed more outrage than David Duke , the ex-Klan boss and former Louisiana state legislator .
“ GOP traitors appoint Obama Junior as Chairman of the Republican Party , ” proclaimed the sub - headline on his website .
Yet ever the optimist , Duke saw a silver lining in Steele ’s election , just as he had in Obama ’s win .
“ I am glad these traitorous leaders of the Republican Party appointed this Black racist , affirmative action advocate to the head of the Republican Party because this will lead to a huge revolt among the Republican base , ” he wrote .
“ As a former Republican official , I can tell you that millions of rank - and - file Republicans are mad as hell and are n’t going to take it anymore !
We will either take the Republican Party back over the next four years or we will say , ‘ To Hell with the Republican Party ! ’
And we will take 90 percent of Republicans with us into a New Party that will take its current place ! ”
Despite such rhetoric , white supremacists seem to be doing more whining than strategic planning .
The Council of Conservative Citizens ( CCC ) , a white nationalist organization descended from the pro-segregationist White Citizens ’ Councils , complained that Steele supports affirmative action , gun control and “ more Federal handouts . ”
Under the heading “ GOP continues shooting bullets into it ’s [ sic ] own corpse , ” the CCC wrote : “ Meet the new improved GOP .
Steele ’s supporters actually believe that having a black chairman will cause the media to be nice to them and blacks to leave the Democratic party [ sic ] . ”
Vdare.com , an anti-immigration hate website , called the election of Steele a “ disaster ” and weighed in with a blog post titled “ RNC to White Men : --- Off ” that referred to Steele as a “ professional Black ” and called white Christians “ the new Slave class . ”
“ Apparently Chairmanship of the Republican National Committee has become another of those positions , like being head of an Ivy League School or Governor of the Federal Reserve , to which white men of Christian heritage Need Not Apply , ” fumed the writer of the post , Patrick Cleburne .
James Edwards , host of the white nationalist radio show The Political Cesspool , blogged that the Republicans were trying to “ outpander ” the Democrats — a strategy he said would fail as more white conservatives stopped going to the polls .
“ Now they ’ve got a black man heading up their party , just like the Democrats do , and the GOP could n’t be happier .
It simply would n’t do to have a white chairman .
Not with a black man in the White House heading up the Democrats . ”
And the League of the South , a neo -confederate hate group , blasted Steele for reaching out to moderates in a blog post titled “ New GOP chair to Southerners and conservatives : drop dead . ”
It concluded : “ Remind me again why I should vote Republican ? ”
Latent Semantic Analysis ( LSA ) is a mathematical method that tries to bring out latent relationships within a collection of documents .
Rather than looking at each document isolated from the others it looks at all the documents as a whole and the terms within them to identify relationships .
An example of LSA : Using a search engine search for “ sand ” .
Documents are returned which do not contain the search term “ sand ” but contains terms like “ beach ” .
LSA has identified a latent relationship , “ sand ” is semantically close to “ beach ” .
There are some very good papers which describing LSA in detail :
An introduction to LSA : http://lsa.colorado.edu/papers/dp1.LSAintro.pdf
Creating your own LSA space : http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jquesada/pdf/bookSpacesRev1.pdf
Latent Semantic analysis : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing
This is an implementation of LSA in Python ( 2.4 + ) .
Thanks to scipy its rather simple !
1 Create the term - document matrix
We use the previous work in Vector Space Search to build this matrix .
2 tf-idf Transform
Apply the tf - idf transform to the term - document matrix .
This generally tends to help improve results with LSA .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 def tfidfTransform ( self , ) : " " " Apply TermFrequency ( tf ) * inverseDocumentFrequency ( idf ) for each matrix element .
This evaluates how important a word is to a document in a corpus With a document - term matrix : matrix [ x ] [ y ] tf [ x ] [ y ] = frequency of term y in document x / frequency of all terms in document x idf [ x ] [ y ] = log ( abs ( total number of documents in corpus ) / abs ( number of documents with term y ) )
Note :
This is not the only way to calculate tf*idf " " " documentTotal = len ( self .
matrix ) rows , cols = self .
matrix .
shape for row in xrange ( 0 , rows ) : # For each document wordTotal = reduce ( lambda x , y : x + y , self .
matrix [ row ] ) for col in xrange ( 0 , cols ) : # For each term # For consistency ensure all self .
matrix values are floats self .
matrix [ row ] [ col ] = float ( self .
matrix [ row ] [ col ] ) if self .
matrix [ row ] [ col ] != 0 : termDocumentOccurences = self .
__getTermDocumentOccurences ( col ) term Frequency = self .
matrix [ row ] [ col ] / float ( wordTotal ) inverseDocument Frequency = log ( abs ( documentTotal / float ( termDocumentOccurences ) ) ) self .
matrix [ row ] [ col ] = termFrequency * inverseDocumentFrequency
3 Singular Value Decomposition
SVD : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition
Determine U , Sigma , VT from our MATRIX from previous steps .
U . SIGMA .
VT = MATRIX
We use the scipy svd implementation here .
Note that numpy ( version : 1.0.4 ) also has an implementation of svd but I had lots of problems with it .
I found it did not work with anything larger than a 2 dimensional matrix .
1 2 3 # Sigma comes out as a list rather than a matrix u , sigma , vt = linalg .
svd ( self . matrix )
4 Reduce the dimensions of Sigma
We generally delete the smallest coefficients in the diagonal matrix Sigma to produce Sigma ’ .
The reduction of the dimensions of Sigma combines some dimensions such that they are on more than one term .
The number of coefficients deleted can depend of the corpus used .
It should be large enough to fit the real structure in the data , but small enough such that noise or unimportant details are not modelled .
The real difficulty and weakness of LSA is knowing how many dimensions to remove .
There is no exact method of finding the right dimensions .
Generally L2 - norm or Frobenius norm are used .
5 Calculate the Product with New Sigma ’
Finally we calculate :
U . SIGMA ' .
VT = MATRIX '
1 2 # Reconstruct MATRIX ' reconstructed Matrix = dot ( dot ( u , linalg .
diagsvd ( sigma , len ( self . matrix ) , len ( vt ) ) ) , vt )
Giving use our final LSA matrix .
We can now apply the same functionality used in Vector space search : searching and finding related scores for documents .
LSA In Action – Matrices
We start with out Model - Term frequency matrix with is generated from creating a Vector Space Search with four documents ( D1 - D4 ) : D1 : “ The cat in the hat disabled ” D2 : “ A cat is a fine pet ponies . ”
D3 : “ Dogs and cats make good pets ” D4 : “ I have n’t got a hat . ”

Could Hot Air Balloons Replace Wind Turbines ?
January 26th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Many people complain about the unsightliness of wind turbines , but I ’ve never met anyone who has a problem with hot air balloons — and that ’s precisely why balloon power could catch on .
Environmental consultant Ian Edmonds has developed a “ balloon engine ” that could potentially compete with wind power .
According to Edmonds , a 44 meter - diameter balloon could generate 50 kW of power — enough energy for 10 homes .
If the balloon ’s diameter is doubled , power production increases tenfold .
Edmond ’s system works by using solar energy to fill a balloon with hot air .
The rising balloon pulls a tether , which turns a generator on the ground .
Once the balloon has floated up to 3 kilometers , air is released and it loses buoyancy .
The balloon needs less energy to be pulled down and a net power gain is reached as a result .
What do you think — would NIMBY - ers protest hot air balloons ?

The company is adding support for the Phoenix Hyperspace pre-boot shell and Xandros Linux ; 3G connectivity ; and a price ( perhaps ) as low as $ 200 for its netbook reference design .
At the 2009 Mobile World Congress ( MWC ) , Freescale Semiconductor is out to prove that the Intel Atom platform is n't the only game in town .
It was earlier this year that that focuses on two things : 3G connectivity and all - day battery life .
And instead of running an Intel Atom processor , Freescale will be using its own : the new i.MX515 , which is based on ARM's Cortex - A8 technology and promotes energy efficiency more than anything else .
But this is old news .
Expanding its netbook ecosystem , Freescale has added support for additional operating systems including Phoenix 's Hyperspace pre-boot shell and Xandros Linux .
( It had previously been announced with just Ubuntu . )
With the promise of 3G in every netbook , Freescale also announced partnerships with wireless chip makers like Wavecom and Option .
The reference design , which consists of an 8.9 - inch widescreen display , with awkward , side - flanking mouse buttons , and an undersized keyboard , is available through Pegatron  an original design manufacturer ( ODM ) and a spin - off of Asustek .
In other words , Freescale is in the process of recruiting partners who will slap their own branding on this netbook .
The best part : it 's gunning for a $ 200 price point .

Petition denied .
OPINION
PER CURIAM .
This matter is before our court on a petition of Al Franken brought under Minn.
Stat. § 204B.44 ( 2008 ) .
The petition seeks an order requiring respondents , Governor Timothy Pawlenty and Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , to promptly prepare and countersign a certificate of election and deliver the certificate to the Secretary of the United States Senate , without awaiting the conclusion of an election contest pending in state district court under Minn.
Stat. ch. 209 ( 2008 ) .
Because we conclude that neither state nor federal law requires issuance of a certificate of election before the election contest is completed , we deny the petition .
...
We conclude that there is no federal statutory mandate that a state issue a certificate of election by the date designated by Congress for the commencement of newly - elected Senators ' terms .
And because the Senate has authority to seat a Senator without a state - issued certificate of election , application of the contest tolling provision in Minn.
Stat . § 204C.40 , subd .
2 , to an election for the United States Senate does not usurp the Senate 's power and does not conflict with federal law , either statutory or constitutional .
Petition denied .

Rails is an model - view - controller Web framework written in the Ruby programming language .
One of its great appeals is being able to quickly crank out CRUD - based Web applications .
A big advantage of Rails over other frameworks is that it values convention over configuration .
If you follow the correct conventions , you can avoid lengthy configuration of files , and things just work !
Therefore , you spend less time writing boring config files and more time focusing on business logic .
By Greg Borenstein and Michael ‘ MJFreshyFresh ’ Jones
Now , we love Rails .
But do n’t get us wrong .
Like any tool , it ’s not the perfect solution to every problem .
A lot of the biggest complaints people have about the framework come from using it in situations where something simpler , smaller and more lightweight would do just fine .
We love Sinatra for anything with minimal server - side involvement .
Merb is another excellent minimal framework .
And nothing beats apps that run completely in the browser with JavaScript : they can be deployed nearly for free , can scale almost infinitely and never have to be restarted .
Be sure to check out the following articles :
In the overview below we present 10 useful tips , ideas and resources for Ruby on Rails - developers ( both newbies and professionals ) .
Please feel free to share your tips , ideas and suggestions in the comments to this post !
1. Plug -Ins Save Time
Rails has a well defined plug - in structure that enables you to easily install and use plug-ins in your application .
David Heinemeier Hansson , the father of Rails , once stated that he uses five to six plug-ins in each Rails application .
There ’s an old nugget of developer wisdom that “ the best code is no code at all . ”
Part of what makes us so productive when developing in Rails is that all the code that we do n’t have to write because someone else in the community has already written a plug - in that provides the functionality we need .
There are a few ways to install a plug - in in Rails , however the most common is using script :
# Install from a git repo script / plugin install git://github.com/mislav/will_paginate.git #
Install from a url script / plugin install http://topfunky.net/svn/plugins/calendar_helper
You can save yourself a ton of time and hassle by becoming good at searching the Web ( and especially the almighty GitHub ) .
A couple of places to find plug-ins are Core Rails , Railsify and Rails Plug - in Directory .
Need to integrate with an existing API or consume some kind of standard format data ?
Need tagging , pagination , or another common Web application feature ?
Odds are that some great Rails or Ruby developer out there already has a project going that will get you at least most of the way there .
2. Testing is Fun and Easy with Rspec
For most people , the word “ test ” brings back scary memories of school exams .
When working with Rails , however , automated testing can make your development experience much more enjoyable .
While lots of people have strong , nearly religious , opinions about them , at their core , automated tests are just little helper programs you write that run bits of your main code to make sure they do the right thing .
When done right , testing will improve your workflow and increase your confidence in the results .
Rails ships with a test framework baked right in , but for the last couple of years all the cool kids have been using an alternative called Rspec .
Rspec ’s biggest advantage is its syntax for specifying tests :
describe " My Cool library " do before do @cool = Cool.new end it " should be full of penguins . " do @cool.get_penguins !
@cool.penguin_count.should == 10 end it " should melt if it gets too warm " end
What ’s great about Rspec ’s syntax is how much English it uses .
The describe block that sets the context and each assertion within it takes strings that you use to explain what your code should do .
Often , this is the most important stage : you sit down to write the assertion , getting as far as you can , and then you think , “ Right , what should this code actually do then ? ”
Because Rspec lets you leave off the block that implements the assertion ( as in the second melt example ) , you can quickly brainstorm all of your functionality , and then go back and implement the tests later as you write the code .
In the meantime , Rspec will consider those tests as “ pending ” and give you little reminders about them in your test runs .
Besides helping you write code in the first place , another great thing about tests is that , once you have enough of them , they let you see how all of your code is related , making it easy to know if your recent change broke anything else in your application .
Rspec makes it easy to get good test coverage through the use of custom generators that create the tests right along with the rest of your code :
$ script / generate rpsec_scaffold MyModel
Once you ’ve got tests to ensure that the basic functionality works successfully , you can make changes and add new code with confidence without worrying about introducing invisible bugs .
As long as you run your tests regularly , you ’ll know as soon as you break something .
And as GI Joe taught us , knowing is half the battle !
3. Save Time , Use Rake
Projects often include more than just application - specific code .
Sample data have to be created , Web services have to be queried , files have to be moved , code snippets rewritten , etc .
Resist the urge to shell script or to cram in a migration or controller .
Use Rake .
It rocks !
Rake is a build tool written in Ruby , very similar to make .
Rails projects have several Rake tasks already defined ; to see these , run the rake - T command .
macbook $ rake - T rake data : bootstrap # load in some basic data [ caution : will nuke and replcace cate ... rake db : create : all # Create all the local databases defined in config / database .
yml rake db:drop #
Drops the database for the current RAILS_ENV ... rake ts:run #
Stop if running , then start a Sphinx searchd daemon using Thi ... rake ts : start # Start a Sphinx searchd daemon using Thinking Sphinx 's settings rake ts : stop # Stop Sphinx using Thinking Sphinx 's settings
Adding your own Rake tasks is quite easy .
In the example below , you see that the task is name - spaced and has a description and task name , allowing you to write in Ruby .
namespace : data do desc " load in some basic data [ caution : will nuke and replcace categories , categorizations and inventory items ] " task : bootstrap => : environment do # clean out existing : [ Category , Categorization , InventoryItem].each{|m| m.find(:all).each{|i| i.destroy}} InventoryItem.create ! : name => " Compass " c = Category.create ! : name => " Basic Apparel " [ " Men ’s Heavyweight Cotton T " , " Men ’s Heavyweight Polo " , " Women ’s Organic Cotton Fitted T " , " Women ’s Fitted Polo " , " Children ’s T - Shirt " , " Jr’s Distressed Hoodie " , " Hemp Messenger Bag " ] . each do |name| c.inventory_items.create !
: name => name end ... end
4. Track Application Exceptions
Exceptions happen , and when they do , you want to know about them !
Your client should n’t be the one telling you that a problem has occurred ; you should already be aware of the issue and working to resolve it .
Exception notification has been available in Rails for a while .
There are exception notification plug-ins that make it easy to be notified .
However , some services such as Airbrake Bug Tracker and Get Exceptional add a lot of value to your application .
Both of these services are easy to install and provide a great UI for tracking your exceptions .
You can even sign up for a free account to try things out .
By centralizing the application exceptions , you are able to see how frequently these exceptions occur , what environment they occur in ( a particular browser ?
a particular location ? ) , what parameters were present and the full stack trace .
This centralization of data helps you see patterns and resolve the issue more quickly , which results in a better application and happier users .
5. Mix and match between frameworks and servers with Rails on Rack
As of version 2.3 , Rails runs on top of Rack .
Rack makes it possible to mix and match between Ruby Web frameworks and servers .
If you ’re using a framework that supports it ( like Rails , Sinatra , Camping , etc ) , you can choose from any of the servers that do also ( Mongrel , Thin , Phusion Passenger , etc. ) , and vice versa .
In addition to introducing all kinds of new options for deployment , this change means that Rails now has access to the exciting world of Rack middleware .
Because Rack lives at the intersection of your app and your server , it can provide all kinds of common functionality directly .
A great example of this is Rack : : Cache .
Rack :: Cache provides a caching layer for your application that you control simply by sending the correct headers in your responses .
In other words , all you have to do is install a bit of code in the Rack config file :
require ' rack / cache ' use Rack :: Cache , : metastore => ' file:/tmp/rack_meta_dir' , :entitystore => ' file:/tmp/rack_body_dir' , :verbose => true
And make sure your controller actions send the right headers ( for example , by setting request .
headers [ “ Cache - Control ” ] ) and Bam ! , you ’ve got caching .
6. Easy Data Dumping
You ’ll often need to get data from production to dev or dev to your local or your local to another developer ’s local .
One plug - in we use over and over is Yaml_db .
This nifty little plug - in enables you to dump or load data by issuing a Rake command .
The data is persisted in a yaml file located in db / data.yml .
This is very portable and easy to read if you need to examine the data .
rake db : data : dump example data found in db / data.yml --- campaigns : columns : - id - client_id - name - created_at - updated_at - token records : - - " 1 " - " 1 " - First push - 2008-11-03 18:23:53 - 2008-11-03 18:23:53 - 3f2523f6a665 - - " 2 " - " 2 " - First push - 2008-11-03 18:26:57 - 2008-11-03 18:26:57 - 9ee8bc427d94
7. Keep Your Constants in One Place
All applications have constants , variables that are defined with data that do n’t change , such as the name of the application , the tagline , values for crucial options , etc .
We use the Rails initializer feature to define a config / initializers / site_config.rb for housing these constants .
By using this convention , all developers on a project know exactly where to look for the constants and can quickly make changes .
Many people have questions about when to put a constant in the site_config.rb instead of the class it is used in .
For a constant that are only used in a single class , we suggest putting it in that class .
However , if the constant is used in more than one location , put it in the site_config.rb .
For more on constants , have a look at Rubylearning .
# File config/initializers/site_config.rb REPORT_RECIPIENT
= 'jenn@scg.com '
REPORT_ADMIN = 'michael@scg.com '
8. Console for Working on Code
Sometimes you may have code that you ’re curious about .
Will it work this way ?
What ’s the output ?
What can I change ?
Rails ships with a wonderful tool called console .
By running script / console you will enter an interactive environment where you can access your Rails code just as though the application were running .
This environment is incredibly helpful .
It is often used in production environments at times to quickly peek at data without having to log in to the database .
To do this in a production environment , use script / console RAILS_ENV =production :
macbook $ ./ script / console
Loading development environment ( Rails 2.1.1 ) >> a = Album.find ( : first ) => # >>
9. Ugly Views Getting You Down ?
Try Haml .
Views are how your Rails application generates the HTML pages your visitors actually see and use .
By default , Rails uses the ERb templating system to let you embed bits of Ruby in your markup so that you can insert your data as needed .
However , recent versions of Rails let you take your pick of templating languages , and nowadays the Ruby interwebs have been all abuzz about an alternative system called Haml .
Haml is marketed as “ markup Haiku . ”
Its CSS - inspired syntax lets you focus on the semantics of your data rather than worrying about closing all the angle brackets that come with using ERb and HTML .
For comparison , here ’s a bit of markup in standard ERb :
<%= print_date %> <% = current_user.address %> <% = current_user.email %> <%= h current_user.bio %>
And here ’s the equivalent in Haml :
# profile .left.column #date= print_date #address= current_user.address .right_column #email= current_user.email #bio= h( current_user.bio )
Haml ’s not for everyone , and many people will find this syntax quite alien .
But if you value concision and are fluent in CSS , Haml may be just the ticket .
10 . Know Where to Watch What ’s Happening in Rails
Rails and Ruby both have large and active communities that constantly generate changes , improvements and new projects .
Trying to keep up with all the activity can be daunting , but it ’s essential if you want to benefit from the community ’s best work and continue to increase your Rails and Ruby knowledge .
Thankfully , a number of sources aggregate some of the most important activity :
GitHub has a most - watched projects page , which is a great place to start .
Similarly , RubyInside ’s monthly What ’s Hot on Github and
the GitHub blog ’s Rebase series both feature selections of interesting work from the website .
There ’s also a whole universe of Rails training :
Rails Envy
PeepCode
and news aggregators :
follow ruby_news on Twitter ,
subscribe to Ruby Inside ,
subscribe to Ruby Flow .
Another avenue is the Rails Core mailing list and the #rails - core IRC channel .

StepChange designs , develops and manages social media widgets and Facebook applications in partnership with leading brands and agencies .
Outside of work , Greg builds drum - playing robots and other hardware hacks , and MJ leads a local group of Unicycle - borne pirates .
They live and work in beautiful , moist Portland , Oregon .
They worked on Droids in Star Wars , so why not an al - Qaeda communications center .
" They " are electro - magnetic grenades -- not something you 'll find in the typical armory but apparently something that could soon be in the hands of GIs .
" EMP grenade technology is out there , but I 've never had my hands on one , " said Col.
Laurie Buckhout , chief of the newly formed Electronic Warfare Division , Army Operations , Readiness and Mobilization , during a bloggers roundtable Tuesday from the Pentagon .
A Web search for " Electro Magnetic Pulse grenade " turns up a number of hits , many related so Star Wars and gaming sites .
One Star Wars - oriented site notes EMPs also are known as Electrostatic Charge Detonators and were an anti-droid weapon used during the Clone Wars .
The EMP grenade was one of several sci - fi type weapons that the military has been developing and , in some cases , fielding .
Buckhout also mentioned lasers for taking out missiles and the so - called Active Denial System , which uses microwaves which heat a person 's skin to uncomfortable levels .
The purpose of the roundtable to was discuss the Army 's new Electronic Warfare career field , a 29 - series MOS that will include officers , warrant officers and enlisted personnel .
The career field grew out of the Army 's need for an expert force able to counter radio - controlled IEDs , though the troops making up the new specialty will be doing more than that , according to the Army ; they 'll also be the go - to people for commanders wanting to know how they can exploit the electromagnetic spectrum tactically across their operations .
The Army has wanted an organic EW corps for some time .
Personnel responsible for EW in Iraq and Afghanistan are mostly drawn from the Navy and Air Force , according to Buckhout .
Using portable jammers , they can dominate the radio spectrum defeat any signal coming from a cell phone or other device used to trigger a roadside bomb .
But there 's a problem : the jammers may also interfere with legitimate radio signals .
These can include U.S. troops ' own systems , radio - controlled links to robots used by IED demolition teams and emergency communications systems .
Thus , the Army 's drive to come up with signal - jammers that can be slewed into specific emitters .
Large systems , such as those employed by aircraft , can do the job , Buckhout said , but it 's " like using a sledgehammer to kill a mosquito . "
It kills the mosquito , she said , but it does a lot of damage , too .
" The Army needs to have its own ... on - the - ground assets to complement our abilities , " she said , " to get the enemy first or stop them from getting us on the ground . "
" Electronic warfare is going to be fought on the ground , not just in the air , and you have to have an attack from the ground point of view . "
The new Army career field will number 1,619 Soldiers in all , and th-ey will come from the active - duty , reserve and National Guard , she said .
It will give the Army the largest professional ED cadre of any branch of the U.S. or NATO militaries , she said .
The Soldiers will operate at the battalion , Brigade Combat Team , and division levels , as well as joint billets , she said , enabling the troops to have a full career path available to them .
The equipment they will develop and use , meanwhile , will be tailored for Soldiers .
Weapons or systems wo n't be heavy or single - purpose , but will allow for electronic attack at different levels .
The target may be a small building or a village , she said , and so a small jammer could be used , or EMP grenades .
EW training is being held at Fort Sill , Okla . , home of the Army 's artillery school .
Buckhout said that 's because EW is seen as something to be targeted and fired , and that 's what they do at Sill .
She said the first EW Soldier should be fielded by the end of Fiscal 2010 and that all authorized positions should be filled by sometime in Fiscal 2011 .

Phish bankrolled 200 cops , including feds , for reunion ' security ' Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday March 10 , 2009
Print This Email This EXCLUSIVE : Law enforcement group expresses skepticism at quoted value of seized narcotics
Hampton , Virginia police say they seized over $ 1.2 million in narcotics , arrested 250 people and collected over $ 68,000 in cash during a highly publicized , three - day reunion concert by psychedelic rock jam bad Phish .
While media outlets reported that the rock band paid for the police presence , RAW STORY has found out that the force , intended for security , was nearly 200 agents strong and involved three federal agencies .
Additionally , a group of former police officers who advocate for drug policy reform expressed skepticism of the narcotics ' quoted value .
" There were 194 concertgoers and others in the area of Hampton Coliseum charged with various misdemeanor and felony offenses  mostly possessing , using and selling drugs , " reported Peter Dujardin with the Daily Press .
" Some faced multiple counts , for a total of 245 charges in all . "
Tuesday , police revised their arrest figure from 194 to 250 , said the Associated Press .
" The cost of paying police officers to work the special shifts  providing traffic management as well as overall security  was borne by Phish and its promoters , said Hampton City Manager Jesse Wallace , " reported the Daily Press .
It is unclear exactly how much was paid to police an estimated 75,000 fans .
" The Hampton Police Division had 113 officers that worked each of the three nights as well as 85 officers from the nine other agencies each of the three nights , " Hampton police public information officer Corporal Allison Quiñones told RAW STORY .
" That money was paid out by the band and the information would have to come from them or their promoter . "
Federal involvement
In a release ( PDF link ) , Hampton police thank numerous agencies for their participation in the operation , including : " Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) , Virginia State Police , Newport News Police Department , Alcohol Beverage Control ( ABC ) , Poquoson Police Department , Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) , Criminal Investigations Division ( CID ) , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , Office of Special Investigations ( AFOSI ) and the Hampton Sheriffs Office . "
Police also issued a special thanks to Hampton Chevrolet for allowing them to set up a temporary holding facility on their premises .
A follow - up question to the Hampton police as to what , exactly , NCIS and ICE were doing at a Phish concert went unanswered .
" NCIS is part of a task force such as this because of the huge
Naval presence in the Hampton Roads area , " said NCIS spokesman Ed Buice in an e-mail to RAW STORY .
" Thousands of sailors and their families live and work there and narcotics enforcement is a large part of what we do worldwide .
Not only is it a quality of life issue it's a legitimate operational readiness concern that the Navy approaches from several directions . "
" I 'm not sure how many NCIS special agents actually took part in the task
force , " he added .
A call to ICE 's public affairs headquarters returned a new number to call and instructions to ask for the " duty officer . "
However , an operator claimed the duty officer has no voicemail and his phone was turned off .
Repeated calls to ICE 's public affairs branch for Virginia yielded ' call could not be completed ' errors for the number listed on ICE 's Web site : 202-514-2648 .
Several redial attempts resulted in an ' all circuits are busy ' automated response and twice the number came back ' no longer in service . '
RAW STORY held its report for a full day seeking response from Phish or management as to how much they paid for police presence at the concert and whether they were aware of federal involvement .
E-mails to the curator of the band 's official Web site , the band 's official contact address and Red Light Management , which handles Phish 's business affairs , drew no response .
Fans react
The vast majority of narcotics seized during the reunion concert was marijuana , according to the Hampton police .
Other drugs taken up included " magic " mushrooms , cocaine and prescription painkillers .
Writers on the Phish fan forum " Oh Kee Pa " relayed reports of several arrests for nitrous oxide , with one poster relaying a story of a man caught with " as many as 15 tanks [ of the substance ] in his van . "
" [ So ] that could account for a lot of that money if they go on street value , " opined user ' McDLT . '
Nevertheless , the $ 1.2 million figure coming from 250 arrests , is surprisingly high .
Asked for comment , Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , a drug policy reform lobbying group , directed RAW STORY to an episode during which Ohio police discovered " the world 's most expensive marijuana . "
Ohio officers , having caught a motorist with 104 pounds of pot , estimated the bust to be worth $ 4.7 million .
" [ W ] e 're talking about an ounce that 's worth $ 2824.51 ! " Scott Morgan with Stop the Drug War wrote last July .
" That just blows away everything listed at High Times 's market quotes section , where ounces of high - grade marijuana in Ohio last month were listed at $ 400 . "
" [ Cops inflating prices ] is definitely something our members have encountered before , " said Tom Angell , LEAP 's media director .
Apart from the Hampton police advisory , authorities gave no evidence to support the alleged value of the narcotics , citing to RAW STORY " an ongoing investigation . "
" [ W ] hen we got there [ F ] riday , we set up camp and started to make something to eat and about 20 cars in total , vans , cars , suvs , and a giant police bus , came in and raided the camp ground , a shitload of people got arrested .
[ I ]t scared the shit out of me , " wrote ' vwdeadhead . ' " [ T ] here were [ DEA ] , state police , locals , drug dogs with the k - 9 units .
[ R]eally started the weekend off bad . "
However , most comments on the forum seemed ambivalent to the police presence .
The large majority of respondents were merely elated to have attended the Phish reunion .
In a telephone interview , Hampton police Corporal Quiñones refused to provide details on any of the drug seizures , but claimed there was a single , " very large quantity of marijuana " taken during one of the busts .
She refused to elaborate on the weight of the seizure or the number of people involved .
On the Phish forum , another writer reported a girl 's arrest in her hotel room for " a QP [ quarter - pound ] of nug [ high - grade marijuana ] . "
" I think there were some SERIOUS Narcs , " wrote ' phunkyphresh4000 . '
" Police used a combination of undercover and out - in - the - open tactics , those at the scene said , " reported the Daily Press .
" In one case , an undercover police officer offered to sell concert tickets in return for drugs , then arrested the man who tried to buy them . "
" [ In this ] scenario presented , entrapment did not likely occur because the law enforcement officer only presented an opportunity for an individual to demonstrate that he / she was in possession of a controlled substance , " Pennsylvania attorney Brian W. Carter of Goldfein and Joseph , P.C. , told RAW STORY .
" If the individual was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance , making an offer to exchange a concert ticket for the controlled substance would not be entrapment because the individual was in possession of the controlled substance prior to the individual being approached by the law enforcement officer , " he wrote .
" I feel certain the seized drugs were overvalued , but the confiscated [ $ 68,000 in ] cash is real , " opined the blog , The Impolitic .
" What this means is every person they busted , whether is was for a few grams of marijuana or 3000 hits of acid , lost every cent in their pocket under the forfeiture laws .
" ... I doubt if most the arrests were for any kind of threatening conduct .
The cops were just capitalizing on a legal moneymaking scheme .
They get to keep the cash so they have a perverse incentive to make unnecessary arrests .
And it 's an invitation for corruption .
Ending that dynamic would go a long way toward bringing some balance back into law enforcement . "
In 2006 , Phish founder and guitarist Trey Anastasio was arrested for driving under the influence of narcotics and police allegedly found three prescription drugs in his vehicle : hydrocodone , Percocet and Xanax .
Hampton police made " 81 Felony arrests and 113 Misdemeanor arrests for a total of 194 , " stated an advisory .
" There were 119 Felony charges and 126 Misdemeanor charges for a total of 245 .
A total of 46 criminal summonses were issued .
A total street value of narcotics seized was $ 1,213,882.80 . "
Several days before the concert , Phish asked a federal judge to issue an order against the sale of unlicensed band merchandise .
The judge agreed , but refused to allow Phish staff the right to confiscate bootlegged goods .
Free recordings of the three - day reunion are available on livephish.com .
The band plans to kick off a summer tour on June 4 in Wantagh , N.Y .
This story has been updated with a statement on the NCIS ' involvement in the arrests and modified from an original version .

Is Someone Spying on Your Phone ?
How to Tell If You ’ve Been Hacked
Mobile phones are our lifeline for everything from social media to shopping .
We keep sensitive information and pictures on them assuming their safe .
In fact , it ’s expected mobile banking will reach 2 billion people by 2020 .
With all that valuable data , thieves are pulling out the stops to grab it .
How do you know if you ’ve been hacked ?
There are signs that something strange is going on with your phone .
They might be subtle , but if you know what to look for , then you can fix it before it compromises your data .
Do n’t risk your data and find out if you ’re at risk for hacking .
Android Phones vs. Apple Phones
Since Android is an open source operating system , people are more likely to hack it .
Open source mean the code that makes it up is free for anyone to see and use .
This allows third parties to create apps and other programs for the phone without going through the Google Play Store .
The benefit of an open source operating system is transparency , but it lacks security .
There are also many phones from many companies that use the Android operating system , making it difficult to control .
This makes it easier for them to steal identities and information .
Apple has an almost draconian control over their operating system , apps , and programs .
It ’s more difficult to hack an iPhone because Apple filters and approves everything .
Battery Level Dropping Fast ?
You ’ve Been Hacked !
If you download malware , then it sits in the background and messes with your phone .
The malware is a program and requires resources on your phone .
If your battery starts draining faster , then you could have malware .
The malware can steal data and passwords or use your email address to spam other people .
You Clicked on a Phishing Scam
Hackers use phishing to infect cell phones with viruses and other malware .
It uses email and messenger apps to send you links that contain the malware .
The emails look like they ’re from legitimate businesses or friends , and many people click on it .
If you click on an email link and something does n’t feel right , then you could be hacked .
Check with the company to see if they sent the email .
Mobile security tips include never clicking on a link you do n’t know and going to the company ’s website instead of clicking on an email link .
The Case of the Mystery Apps
The goal of many cell phone hacks is to inflate the number of downloads for various apps .
The apps themselves may have nothing to do with the scheme .
Unscrupulous marketing companies use it to make it look like their efforts work .
The malware downloads one or many apps on your phone but does n’t put them on the home screen .
It ’s not until you look through all your apps that you notice it .
Malware creates other mysteries as well .
There may be emails , texts , etc. that people received from you , but you never sent .
These are common Android virus symptoms .
Keep Your Phone and Data Safe
Do n’t click on any URLs you do n’t trust and be wary of changes in your phone .
They could mean you ’ve been hacked .
These are some of the best ways to be aware of malware and viruses on your mobile devices .

Exclusive to STR
Nine or ten thousand years ago , mankind began to plow fields .
I do n't know what tools he used -- perhaps some kind of wooden spades or trowels , fashioned with flint from a cedar of Lebanon ; but somehow he turned the earth and cereal seeds were planted and some months later his little society had something to eat -- without having had to strike camp and move along every few days or weeks in search of tasty new goodies to pluck or spear .
This discovery of agriculture was perhaps the most significant single advance in the history of living creatures .
It was also a fine example of true capitalism ; the group agreed , presumably by a form of consensus , that this year they were going to invest the labor of plowing and sowing in fields reserved for that exclusive purpose , and harvesting so as to store some food for later consumption .
Probably it was not a solo performance ; one man can hunt and gather , or else plow and sow - - but not both .
So the Board met , heard and discussed an R&D report , made a financial projection and a decision , had the Secretary memorize the minutes , adjourned the meeting and the deed was done .
Little could they guess that they had just changed humanity forever .
Today mankind does exactly the same , worldwide , though in this country the efficiency of planting and harvesting is such that the agricultural surplus allows over 95 % of us to engage in profitable work elsewhere than in agriculture , and yet be very well fed -- while celebrating the errors of Rev. Thomas Malthus .
It 's not so everywhere , but worldwide there has been a dramatic mechanization , compared to that first turner of sod .
That mechanization happened because capital was repeatedly invested -- and , certainly , because knowledge was uncovered and technology invented .
But those things , too , are a form of capital investment ; students and inventors produce nothing , while they are studying and tinkering , and yet they too need to eat .
Graduates of government schools may well suppose that the money used for such capital investment grows on trees , but it 's not the case ; in true , free capitalism , the resource comes from postponed consumption .
In that first village , perhaps there was an unusually good natural harvest -- but the decision was that ( say ) half of them would continue to hunt and gather while the other half cultivated next season 's crop ; and that may well have meant that everyone lived on short rations for a while .
That was the act of investment .
They worked and went a little hungry today , so as to eat more tomorrow .
Real capital has no other source , ever .
I ran a small business for some years , and in one of them made what was , to me , a large gross profit ; I chose to plow some of it back into the hope of further growth , consuming only part .
That 's also called " saving . "
As it happens , it did n't work out , but if the investment had produced what I hoped it would , I 'd now be a very rich curmudgeon instead of just a curmudgeon .
Free capitalism comes with risk as well as the possibility of wealth , and even that investment was the best that I could possibly have made , for it was mine .
Money can not be invested more wisely than by its owner .
In the sort of refined , developed and still partly free economy such as prevailed here and in parts of Europe during the 19th Century , new ways were found to enable savings to be invested well .
Everyone could put some aside and place it in ventures in which they took no other active part at all .
We know this as the buying of shares , or stock .
It 's a clever way of both raising capital and letting large numbers of people share the wealth -- but at root , people postpone some consumption and place the saved resource well , so as to eat better tomorrow , exactly as humans did ten millennia back .
That 's why very few of us need till the soil at all , and why those who do till it can sit in air conditioned cabs and listen to Brahms - - on noise - canceling Bose headphones .
It 's also why ( absent government , its distortion and taxes ) it 's perfectly feasible for everyone to retire and live comfortably off the investments he has made .
I once worked out that if one labors for 21 years , saves 5 % of what is earned and invests it so well that it yields 15 % a year compound , one could then retire and enjoy exactly the same as dividend as one was earning in salary -- aged about 40 .
If you think 15 % is a bit high , build a model on your PC , plug in different figures and do the math yourself ; the point is that anyone ( in that free society ) could , if he chose , postpone consumption and then live off capital for many years .
And pass on a nice legacy to the next generation .
But government , alas , is not absent at all , and nor are its distortions and taxes , and right now we are living through the most massive distortion , or misallocation , in history .
The media , which seem to know nothing at all , parrot it as a " stimulus . "
What 's being done is ( a ) to fabricate some money that has not been saved by postponed consumption and is not owned by someone who earned it ( because fiat money is n't earned by anyone and stolen money is certainly not owned by the thief ) and then ( b ) to spend it on projects that seem likely to give jobs ( of some kind . . . any kind ) to people who will vote , come next election -- so that , presumably , the cycle can be repeated .
It may be a slightly less idiotic investment strategy than scattering freshly - printed C - notes from helicopters , but only just .
Probably there is also the thought , in what passes for the minds of these government macro-managers , that this injection of alleged money will trigger a round of spending by those who are paid the wages , which will deceive producers yet again into producing for real , which will truly re-start a stalled economy .
This is the fiction that dominated the 20th Century , thanks to the mistaken theories of my countryman John Maynard , Lord Keynes .
He was n't all bad , mind ; he made a personal fortune in the stock market , and walked out of the Versailles peace conference protesting accurately that its savage terms would produce a second war with Germany .
But on economics , he was dead wrong ; pols still follow his advice today because ( a ) they imagine it is up to them to do something , rather than to get out of the way and do nothing , and ( b ) they have no idea what else to do .
In the event that it should " succeed , " the only possible outcome is a worse crash a few years later , when the deception is revealed .
So the much - hyped " stimulus package , " regardless of its details , is a total fraud ; it is investing money that does n't exist in schemes that wo n't produce -- an irrational act of an irrational organization , or as Forrest Gump would say , " Stupid is as stupid does . "
Some of the funny - money will stimulate the production of more automobiles to which buyers prefer competing alternatives ; some will arrive in bank vaults whence it will again be loaned out to people unlikely to repay ( because the laws compelling such loans have not been repealed ) and many of whose managers have already demonstrated their incompetence ; and some may reach the hands of homeowners whom it will " enable " to continue paying off mortgages they cannot afford , just so as to continue to overstate the asset column on the lender 's account of financial health .
Some , it 's true , may do something useful like improving the quality of roads and bridges , or even building more power stations and wind farms and other renewable - energy projects ; but those are not true investments either , because the figures are rigged from the get - go .
How can one possibly estimate the ROI from investing $ X million to build a bridge , when no toll revenue from it will ever flow ?
Or consider : if the owners of a few thousand square miles of badlands could erect windmills for producing useful supplies of electricity at competitive rates , they would have no difficulty in attracting genuine capital , which someone had truly saved -- there would be no need for funny money .
To the extent that that has n't happened , there is something doubtful about the ROI projections ; and I noticed that last year 's persuasive promoter of large wind - farm projects , T. Boone Pickens , was advertising not so much to raise capital as to raise political support so that capital could be channeled his way after having been stolen from those who would not otherwise choose to lend it to him .
Is there a better way ?
You betcha .
In the coming free society , there will be no major misallocations of wealth because all of it will be placed by its owners , whose decisions while fallible will be the wisest possible and so the most productive possible .
When mistakes do occur , those with money will spot the chance to buy up assets cheap , fly in as fast as vultures , and put them rapidly into use again so that the progress resumes .
The biggest such operation ever likely to take place will be in the few years following E - Day , and it will last a while because there will be such a vast amount of carrion to consume ; but given time those ugly but libertarian birds will do their good work and clear up the mess .
So they could today , if only E - Day could be brought forward ; but it can 't -- or not very much .
A quiet but huge program of re-education is prerequisite and it is under way , but several more years are needed .
GRAPEVINE , Texas ( Reuters ) - Denise Blackerby is hitting the road again .
When retail gas prices scaled historic peaks above $ 4 a gallon last year , she found she could no longer make monthly trips from the Dallas area to Houston in her Ford Explorer SUV to visit her family .
An advertisement is seen outside a gas station in the Queens Borough of New York December 9 , 2008 .

“ When gas was $ 4 a gallon , I did n’t go anywhere .
Now it ’s all good , ” Blackerby , who is 44 and works in the information technology industry , told Reuters as she bought soft drinks at a Shell gas station in Grapevine , a town near Fort Worth .
With U.S. pump prices now averaging below $ 2 a gallon , she ’s making those regular Houston trips again .
As gasoline prices surged to record highs last year , drivers in the world ’s top energy consumer cut fuel use at the greatest pace since 1983 .
For U.S. consumers pinched by the economic crisis , falling gasoline prices have created what some analysts call a sort of “ stimulus package ” that has pumped billions of dollars in disposable income back into their wallets .
The modest increase in demand comes as average U.S. gasoline prices run at about $ 1.93 a gallon , down $ 1.23 from a year ago and about half the price of last July , according to government data issued this week .
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that demand for motor fuel over the four weeks to February 27 hit 9.03 million barrels per day , up 2.2 percent from a year ago , as the price drop rekindled Americans ’ famous love affair with their cars and the road .
Struggling U.S. car makers may see a glimmer of hope in evidence that Americans are taking to the highways again .
In Grapevine , Shell service station owner David Oatman said he reckoned his business was up about four percent this year on what it normally would be .
Retirees Bob and Debbie Smith , who live on the road year round in a recreational vehicle and are currently in Georgia , will certainly be putting more rubber to the pavement this year .
When fuel prices peaked around $ 4 a gallon , they limited their journeys , although now they see no obstacles .
“ Last year we , in the spring time , we thought of driving back home to West Virginia from Kentucky .
It ’s about a thousand miles , but we did n’t because fuel was so expensive ...
It would probably have been $ 800 in fuel , ” Debbie Smith said of the cost of filling with diesel the 75 - gallon tank of their 2006 Monaco Dynasty RV with diesel .
“ This year , with the fuel prices , we ’re hoping to get up there in June to visit family , ” she said in a telephone interview .
“ We do n’t have to watch where we travel , we can just go ahead . ”
In Little Rock , Arkansas , Kristy Evans , 41 , who was recently laid off as a pharmaceutical sales representative , said she was relieved at the lower price as she filled up her Dodge SUV at $ 1.899 per gallon .
“ It ’s better now because it used to cost me $ 60 to fill up .
Now it ’s $ 38 , ” she said .
But costs remained a concern to her .
“ I have two school - aged kids and there ’s a lot of mom-driving , school events and after - school sports and things like that .
I ’m on the road all the time , even though I ’m not working .
It adds up . ”
STILL CAUTIOUS
Other Americans said they remained cautious after forking out to fill up last year .
U.S. gas prices remain low compared to most developed countries but the American lifestyle has long run on cheap gasoline .
Residents of Atlanta and other cities in the Southeast are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in gas prices , which hit $ 4.75 a gallon last September after hurricanes disrupted oil operations along the Gulf Coast .
“ The high price ( last year ) has had the major impact and it still has some effects because people know prices could go up again , ” said Ben Hoffman , an Atlanta resident .
“ Now there is an incentive to conserve . ”
Hoffman said planning for a long road trip later in the year would still go ahead but he was conscious of the amount of trips he did around Atlanta , a city crisscrossed with highways in which owning a car is considered essential .
People often recoil at the term parasite .
An image of an alien parasite would probably be the first thing to come to mind thanks to those science fiction movies .
Some may even believe that parasitic infections do not happen that often .
That is not entirely true .
Humans are highly susceptible to hosting parasites within our bodies .
One example of this is the tapeworm .
Tapeworms are disgusting and freakish looking when seen up close through a microscope .
Despite their unappealing looks , these flatworms have some fascinating information associated with them .
Information that is important to know to have a better understanding of how people can get infected and what to do in case one becomes sick .
These parasitic worms are often found in their host ’s intestines where they attach themselves to soak up nutrients , therefore , depriving the host of those same nutrients .
People infected with intestinal tapeworm do n’t exhibit any symptoms .
But if a person starts to notice certain stuff like loss of appetite , nutrient deficiencies , and abdominal pain , it would be best to consult with a healthcare provider to have stool checked for any possible parasitic infection .
A parasitic infection would be an unfortunate circumstance , so it is definitely good to know more about the tapeworm .
What other facts do you know about these scary - looking parasites ?

Detailed discussions of diarrhea ( Survivor ) .
On - camera vomiting ( The Bachelor , The Biggest Loser ) .
Extensive cosmetic surgery ( The Swan ) .
Endless hot - tub makeout sessions ( take your pick ) .
On reality tv , no subject is too personal to reveal , no biological function too intimate to discuss — except for one final taboo too terrible to mention : menstruation .
Have n't you wondered what those women on Survivor do when they have their periods ?
The very premise of the show is that the cast ­members are thrown into the wilderness with nothing but the shirts ( or bikinis ) on their backs and one personal “ luxury item . ”
Yet while all other bodily details , from rashes to dehydration , are examined in minute detail , not one woman ever talks about what it 's like to live hundreds of miles from the nearest tampon dispenser .
On the archetypal dating show The Bachelor , all the rose - hungry ladies vying for the Bachelor 's love live together .
We see them applying makeup , confiding in each other about their dates , crying their hearts out to the camera , and occasionally vomiting after one too many wine spritzers .
Last season , the ladies had late - night , alcohol - fueled discussions on such topics as sex with married men ( moral of the story : nice girls do n't ! ) , sex with women ( same moral ) , and their reactions to bachelor Jesse Palmer 's admission of past one - night stands .
They clashed and bonded , but they never asked each other , “ Hey , do you have a tampon ? ” or commiserated over pms—despite the fact that , after weeks of living together , they were probably all on the same cycle .
Inquiring minds want to know how period protocol plays out on these shows .
When I ask Christa Hastie , a contestant on Survivor : Pearl Islands , if the women had access to menstrual ­products , she exclaims , “ That 's the ­number - one question I had ! ”
After noting that none of the former contestants had named tampons as their luxury item , she asked the pro­ducers : “ Am I going to be the first person to have that as my lux­ury item ? ”
Jenna Morasca , the winner of Survivor : Ama­zon , says the topic was also foremost on her mind before the show .
She then recalls of her eight - woman team : “ Everybody except me started cycling at the same time .
Everybody was crabby and bloated and hungry .
It was like a slumber party gone terribly wrong . ”
Then Hastie gives me what they call , in reality parlance , the “ reveal ” :
The women do have access to tampons , which are in a shared medical box ( along with contact lenses and prescription medication ) .
Of all reality tv , one might assume that PBS 's historical series detailing the hardships and challenges of life in days gone by , like Colon­ial House and Frontier House , would be the most likely to address the topic .
But public television , much as it wants to educate us on other matters , shies away from details of old - time menstrual hygiene .
( By contrast , the BBC 's 1900 House , which was the inspiration for PBS 's historical series , featured female inhabitants lamenting the work and discomfort involved in using cloth rags as sanitary napkins . )
On PBS 's 2004 offering , Colonial House , the producers even went so far as to zoom in on a bucket of urine and feces to show the inconvenience of emptying one 's bowels in the 1600s .
But although the show 's women complained about not being able to take showers or wash their hair , they seemed conveniently menses - free .
In fact , I found out , some of them were :
As on Survivor , a number of the women stopped having their periods altogether while filming , due to the extreme physical conditions and lack of food .
But what about the others ?
At Plimoth Plantation , the Massa­chusetts museum that provided two weeks of training to Colonial House participants prior to filming , it was a subject of intense debate .
“ When the project started , we asked ourselves : How authentic do we get ? ” says Kathleen Curtin , a social historian at Plimoth .
“ The information on exactly what women did at the time is spotty , but we know that they ­did n't use tampons .
One historian , who will remain nameless , suggested having the women use dry moss !
That really bothered me — the par­ticipants on the show had bug spray , they had flashlights .
To not give women tampons seemed too biased .
Part of our job as historians is making sure that practices of the past do n't cause health issues in the ­present .
So we came up with a compromise [ and gave them both ] cloth rags and ­tampons . ”
Why , I ask her , did this issue — clearly of interest behind the scenes — never arise on the show ?
“ My guess is that they wanted to create a story arc , ” she muses .
“ They filmed constantly and only used a minute amount of filming .
They had a certain story they wanted to tell , and edited it down that way . ”
But , she adds : “ Back in the 1600s , women were considered unclean when they were menstruating .
Part of the reason we even have the information we have is because the terms used at that time for menstrual cloths and rags are synonymous with filth .
And I think our culture has a similar kind of mentality . ”
Survivor 's Morasca makes the point that , due to the finite amount of airtime , not everything can appear on the program .
But , she adds , there 's more to it : “ It 's kind of like the taboo subject of the show .
And it 's a guy producer , so he 's probably not willing to show certain things .
If it were from a woman 's perspective , it might be different . ”
You might think so — but the producers of Colonial House are all women .
Colonist Amy - Kristina Herbert 's observation puts the topic in a larger context : “ The comparison I make is there were certain social behaviors that we engage in now that are contrary to the way the colonists engaged … .
But it was interesting to see which issues people were willing to draw the line on and which ones they were n't .
They would n't treat the [ Native Americans ] as the colonists would .
But it would n't even cross their minds that it was n't ok to be unfair to women .
When you 'd say , ' But that 's sexist , ' in response to something the men did , they 'd answer , ' But that 's how the colonists treated women , so I 'm going to do it . '
And I 'd say , ' Then why do n't you be racist ? '
But they would n't cross that line .
So it tells me more about our society now than it does about the past . ”
It 's not like I expect menstruation to be the focus of these shows , or for Survivor to have a menstrua­tion - related challenge .
But there 's something really off when , in a media ­culture where no subject is ­unmen­tionable , the only thing that is is a biological function most adult , premenopausal women experience once a month ; the omission is even more glaring on the shows that actually focus on physical hardships .
And , as Herbert points out : “ Not only were the producers of Colonial House women , three of the four directors were women , so it 's mind - blowing that more women 's issues were n't raised .
I mean , if women wo n't do it , who will ? ”
A dead monkey found in a forest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) could be one of the sources behind the recent outbreak of Ebola in the countrys southwestern Kasai province .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) says that improper handling of dead monkeys felled by the virus could have infected hunters and women who came in contact with the simians .
According to WHO statistics , three cases of the hemorrhagic fever have recently been recorded in the DRC , with at least another 36 suspected cases that include 12 deaths possibly linked to the disease .
This is the second outbreak of its kind in just over a year in Kasai , where the current emergence claimed its first life on November 27 , 2008 .
Doctors Without Borders says it has hired and trained a dozen local “ home visitors ” to help reduce the spread of the outbreak .
The new local staff will identify and follow up with those who have had any contact with the disease .
Currently , there are 184 people who must be tracked .

We 're raising GM goats to make human breast milk , say Russians
Scientists are genetically engineering goats to produce the same milk as a human mother .
They claim the breakthrough will allow babies whose mothers can't feed them to receive all the goodness of breast milk .
Researchers behind the experiments reject fears of Dr Frankenstein - style tinkering with nature .
The goats being bred at a secret farm near Moscow
They say their work will also lead to the development of medicines exploiting the antibiotic qualities of lactoferrin , a protein found in women 's milk .
The revelations follow research by scientists in Russia and Belarus in which male mice were implanted with human genes .
' This led to surprising amounts of lactoferrin being produced in their female offspring - 160 grams per litre of milk , ' said the project 's chief , Dr Elena Sadchikova .
Researchers then switched to goats to obtain much larger quantities of lactoferrin .
Now 90 females sired by GM male goats are being raised on a secret farm outside Moscow .
They believe that from later this year when the goats mature they will obtain larger amounts of lactoferrin than found naturally in human breast milk .
' The new programme will be aimed at producing milk with the human protein , as well as making medicines from it , ' said Dr Pyotr Vitsyaz , of the Belarussian National Academy of Sciences .
The scientists say that the medicines will be used to treat cancer and illnesses of the immune and digestive systems .
Igor Goldman , head of the transgenebank at the Russian Academy of Science , said : ' Human lactoferrin is a natural antibiotic , and it provides babies who do n't have their own developed immune system . '
He dismissed complaints about genetic engineering .
' In this case , genetically modified milk is a drug , not a food .
' I am personally concerned about GM products .
You never know how they would affect your body .
But with drugs it 's different .
There is no way to create protein .
It is too expensive to get it from human cells and impossible on an industrial scale .
' Protein in this form is the best drug invented by God .
It is a natural thing that we already have in our bodies .
You do n't get allergies to it , nor any side effects . '
Dr Goldman said the ' transgenetic ' milk could be drunk by adults as well as children .
Two years ago GM rice crops containing human genes were approved for commercial production in America .
The rice was altered to produce human proteins found in breast milk which could then be used in drinks , desserts and muesli bars .
That came ten years after scientists made a major breakthrough by inserting copies of genes from flounder fish into tomatoes to help them withstand frost .

WILMINGTON , Calif . --
Awash in debt , behind on his mortgage and recently fired from his job at a hospital , Ervin Lupoe was planning on leaving California .
He 'd pulled his kids out of their school , packed his sport utility vehicle with snow chains and winter clothing for him and his family and appeared ready for the trip to his brother - in - law 's home in Garden City , Kan .
It 's not yet known if he was planning on leaving for good in a bid to flee his mounting money problems or if the trip would have only been temporary .
Whatever his intention , Lupoe never got to Kansas .
Instead , police say , he shot his five children and wife to death before turning the gun on himself .
" Something happened in the last 48 hours that made him snap , " said Detective David Cortez , the lead investigator in the case .
" ( He saw ) no other way , no other direction . "
Investigators found evidence of spiraling financial woes .
Lupoe owed the Internal Revenue Service at least $ 15,000 and a check he wrote the agency for that amount had just bounced .
He also was at least one month behind on a mortgage for his home in Wilmington , near the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach .
Jobs are scarce in the area and the real - estate market is sinking .
Lupoe owed about $ 2,500 and a late fee , Cortez said .
He also owed thousands more on a home equity line of credit .
Police found the bodies of Lupoe , his wife and five children Tuesday morning .
It appears the family had been killed the evening before and Lupoe shot himself the next day , Cortez said .
Lupoe and his wife Ana had both recently been fired from their jobs at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center West Los Angeles .
The two technicians had understated their income on an application for childcare in a bid to get cheaper rates , Cortez said .
On Wednesday , the LAPD identified the children as Brittney , 8 ; twin girls Jaszmin and Jassely , 5 ; and twin boys Benjamin and Christian , 2 .
The three girls had attended Crescent Heights Elementary School , but the parents took them out of school more than a week ago , according to the principal .
Crisis counselors were on hand at the school Wednesday to meet with students or faculty who need help coping with the tragedy .
Photos of the family were posted on the family 's Facebook page ( see gallery , left ) .
Details of Suicide Note Revealed
The father faxed a two - page typewritten letter to KABC - TV and the police department 's communications division , said LAPD Deputy Chief Kenneth Garner .
The Burbank - based television station called police , Garner said .
" Obviously he wanted somebody to find the bodies , " Garner said .
" In the note , he clearly said he was going to kill himself , his wife and his kids . "
KABC reported that Ervin Lupoe claimed in the fax that a medical center administrator rebuffed them when they showed up to work , told them to file a union grievance and said , " You should have blown your brains out . "
He wrote that they filed a grievance but nothing was done and two days later they were fired , KABC reported .
" They did nothing to the manager who started such and did not attempt to assist us in the matter , knowing we have no job and five children under 8 years old with no place to go .
So here we are , " the note said .
At the bottom of the note , he wrote , " Oh lord , my God , is there no hope for a widow 's son ? "
Read the full note here .
Bodies Discovered in Home
The " grisly scene " was discovered shortly after 8 a.m. in the 1000 block of MacFarland Avenue , Garner said .
Wilmington , about 18 miles south of downtown , is a 10 - square - mile community adjacent to the Port of Los Angeles .
" Like I said , I 've been on the police department for 32 years and I 've never seen anything like this , so I doubt if there 's too many officers who have ever seen anything like this .
So it 's horrific .
It 's a tragedy , " Garner said .
Garner said the bodies of the father and three girls were found in an upstairs bedroom at the front of the home .
The bodies of the twin boys and wife were found in a back bedroom , Garner said .
" We 're trying to get a timeline and understand exactly what was heard and when , " Garner said .
" When officers entered , they smelled gunshot residue .
We 're operating off the premise it happened within minutes before officers got here . "
Garner said a revolver was found in the home , and the residence had not been ransacked .
All Signs Point to Murder - Suicide
Garner said he was not aware of any 911 calls placed by neighbors .
A note was found inside the house , and police were working on the theory that the case was one of murder - suicide , but were following all leads .
" We do n't want to have conjecture out there .
We want to make sure that we absolutely know what happened and what the timeline is , " Garner said .
" ( Murder - suicide ) is the main possibility . "
Garner urged people to take advantage of community assistance and hotline numbers if they are going through financial difficulties .
" That would be our hope -- that people would seek that guidance , seek that assistance rather than taking this route , which is not the way to go , " Garner said .
" It 's clearly not the way to go . "
" No Words Can Describe This Tragedy "
At a Tuesday afternoon news conference , Villaraigosa said , " No words can describe this tragedy . "
" There 's no way to comprehend this unspeakable act , " the mayor said at the crime scene .
Villaraigosa stressed that the city and county both offer services for people who have lost their jobs or are in need of mental health counseling .
" Whatever was the cause of the desperation that triggered this violence , there 's help out there , " Villaraigosa said .
" We want the people of this city to know that there 's help out there .
...
There 's nothing , no option so horrible that can make you do something as horrific as this . "
City Councilwoman Janice
Hahn , who represents the area , echoed the mayor 's comments and encouraged people who are struggling financially to seek help .
" No matter how desperate you are , no matter how frustrated you are , to think that this was the only answer , to take your whole family with you in death , is too much to understand , " she said .
Do You Need Help ?
Villaraigosa offered up a variety of city and county resources available to people who may be feeling pressure in light of the nation 's current economic slump .
" Help is available , resources exist , job centers , foreclosure counselors and mental health professionals are ready to provide whatever services are necessary to get people on their feet and to keep families afloat , " Villaraigosa said .
He cited a variety of hotlines and other resources .
The city of Los Angeles information line at 311 and the county information line at 211 or 800 - 339-6993 can also provide specific referrals .
Available resources include :

Other Recent Mass Slayings in SoCal
This was the third mass slaying of a family in Southern California since fall .
On Dec. 24 , Bruce Pardo , 45 , dressed up as Santa Claus invaded a Christmas Eve party at his ex-wife 's parents ' home in suburban Covina , opened fire with a gun and set the house ablaze with racing fuel .
Ex-wife Sylvia Pardo and eight relatives were fatally shot or burned .
Pardo later killed himself .
In October , a 45 - year - old unemployed financial manager despairing over extreme money problems shot and killed his wife , three children , mother - in - law and himself in their home in the Porter Ranch area of the San Fernando Valley .
Karthik Rajaram wrote in a suicide letter he felt the honorable choice was to kill himself and his family instead of just himself , police said .
Solar energy development could get boost .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
One of the more interesting areas of technological development in the coming years is likely to be energy development -- specifically green energy development .
With new advances in physics allowing for such items as organic thin - film solar cells , it appears that energy technology could be one of the uses for cutting edge scientific advancements .
U.S. President Barack Obama is hoping to spur further advancements in energy technology through increased funding for research and development .
Monday , President Obama announced that money would be provided for research at the national laboratories for the Department of Energy .
Additionally , grants will be available for those wishing to do research in renewable energy .
Areas such as wind , solar , biofuels and hydrogen will be encouraged .
Even nuclear energy and questions about storing carbon dioxide underground will be eligible for grant funding under the new rules .
The funding is in addition to tax credits and spending approved in the recently passed economic stimulus package .
Some of the technologies and companies that are like to benefit from energy R&D funding include :
* Serious Materials , which uses energy efficient materials to make drywall .
an energy - draining process of mixing raw materials in a wet slurry and then using outside energy to dry it , the company has a recipe that makes use of chemicals -- and their reactions -- for the drying heat necessary .
* Solyndra , a solar power start - up .
This company is receiving the first Department of Energy loan given out in years .
Instead of using silicon , Solyndra manufactures soalr cells out of copper , indium , gallium and selenide ( CIGS ) and shapes them into cylinders that are placed on panels .
The efficiency of Solyndra 's solar panels is between 12 an 14 percent -- a number boosted by a special reflective coating on the roof below the panel .
* 1366 Technologies is on a quest to make solar energy cheaper than coal .
The company is associated with Emanuel Sachs , who is on leave from MIT right now .
The company claims it cracked the $ 1 barrier using cadmium telluride for its thin - film cells .
But further advances in chemistry and physics are needed to reach that sort of cost - efficiency using silicon .
* Winsupply , a company that offers geothermal , wind and solar equipment , could use tax credits and other funding to make its products more widely available .
* Universities might also receive some funding .
MIT is one of the hottest places right now for developing technology that can boost energy efficiency .
Additionally , projects like those at different universities to use LED lights as wi-fi access points could also bring energy use dollars to higher education institutions languishing due to the economic crisis .
The biggest needs in green technology R&D involve using scientific breakthroughs to make renewable energy cost - efficient .
Until science and technology can give us energy that costs less than fossil fuels , renewable / green energy will be limited .
But this funding may put energy R&D on that track .

Home wind turbines are generating a fraction of the energy promised by manufacturers , and in some cases use more electricity than they make , a report warns today .
The results of what is thought to be the most comprehensive study undertaken of the industry show the worst performers provided just 41 watt - hours a day - less than the energy needed for a conventional lightbulb for an hour , or even to power the turbine 's own electronics .
On average the turbines surveyed provided enough electricity to light an energy - efficient house , but this still only represented 5 % - 10 % of the manufacturers ' claims , said consultants Encraft .
The findings will be an embarrassment for an industry which was an early winner from the small but high - profile rush to adopt green technologies .
Trendsetters included the actor Pete Postlethwaite at his country house in Shropshire and novelist Iain Banks at his home near Edinburgh .
Opposition leader David Cameron applied for permission for a turbine on his west London home .
But the results also prove that when turbines are put up in the right places they are a good investment , said Matthew Rhodes , Encraft 's managing director .
" Sadly , an average semi- detached house , like the areas where most people live , where there are obstructions like trees and buildings , are poor locations , " he said .
The " vast majority " of customers had been poorly advised , said Rhodes : " There 's a risk they [ customers ] will go off the whole agenda . "
The study , funded by the Pilkington Energy Efficiency Trust and the BRE Trust , looked at turbines made by five manufacturers in four rural , 10 suburban and 12 urban sites for a year .
It found the best performing turbines would generate " clean " electricity equivalent to that needed to manufacture them in less than two years , while the worst performing ones would take 40 years .
However , Alex Murley , the BWEA 's micro-generation expert , said the study had been skewed unfairly , with few sites , and too many in areas with poor wind .
New codes of conduct for manufacturers and installers had been introduced , he added .
The latest BWEA figures show 1,000 building - mounted small turbines had been installed in the UK by the end of 2007 , with 900 of those installed during that year .
• This article was amended on Friday 16 January 2009 .
The Encraft Warwick wind trials , which tested building - mounted wind turbines , were not funded by the British Wind Energy Association and the government , as we reported above .
The research element of the project was funded by the Pilkington Energy Efficiency Trust and the BRE Trust .
This has been corrected .

Engineers have long lived by a simple , seemingly obvious rule when designing new computers :
The machines have to deliver correct answers .
If asked to compute 2+2 , a computer must answer 4 .
But what if computers did n’t always have to answer correctly ?
Nearly a decade ago , a Houston computer scientist posed this heretical question .
Today , it has led to a movement dubbed " probabilistic computing , " which he believes will revolutionize the future of computing .
On Sunday , Krishna Palem , speaking at a computer science meeting in San Francisco , announced results of the first real - world test of his probabilistic computer chip :
The chip , which thrives on random errors , ran seven times faster than today ’s best technology while using just 1⁄30th the electricity .
Just think :
One need never again worry about draining an iPhone battery in a day or even a week .
“ The results were far greater than we expected , ” said Palem , a Rice University professor who envisions his chips migrating to mobile devices in less than a decade .
Results in the lab often do n’t translate into real - world applications .
But Palem believes his most recent results will go a long way toward muting skepticism about probabilistic computing , which at one time was nearly universal among computer scientists .
Al Barr , a computer scientist at the California Institute of Technology , said he and a number of experts are now eager to pursue applications of probabilistic computing in areas such as computer - generated graphics .
“ Initially there was definitely a lot of skepticism , ” he admitted .
Around 2000 , when Palem began thinking about the future of computer chip technology , power consumption was n’t a big consideration .
Only speed mattered .
But today , the energy consumed by information technology — a January news story likened the energy used in just two Google searches to boiling a kettle of tea — has become a major consideration .
“ Today , the global carbon footprint of information technology is non-negligible , ” Palem said .
Filling up the chips
Conventional computer chips are power hungry by the nature of their design .
To feed the ever - greater processing demands of modern computer applications , engineers have continually squeezed more and more transistors onto semiconductor computer chips .
This allows computers to process more calculations at once and , therefore , perform faster .
The trend toward a doubling of the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit was first noticed by Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore in the 1960s and since has been dubbed Moore ’s Law .
But most computer scientists believe they will soon hit a wall where they can no longer cram more transistors into ever tinier spaces .
The high density of transistors on existing chips also leads to a lot of background “ noise . ”
To compensate , engineers increase the voltage applied to computer circuits to overpower the noise and ensure precise calculations .
Palem began wondering how much a slight reduction in the quality of calculations might improve speed and save energy .
He soon realized that some information was more valuable than other information .
For example , in calculating a bank balance of $ 13,000.81 , getting the “ 13 ” correct is much more important than the “ 81 . ”
Producing an answer of $ 13,000.57 is much closer to being correct than $ 57,000.81 .
While Palem ’s technology may not have a future in calculating missions to Mars , it probably has one in such applications as streaming music and video on mobile devices , he said .
Much as the brain automatically fills in missing words in incomplete sentences , Palem said , the brain compensates for a few errant pixels in a mobile phone ’s video screen .
“ In effect , we are putting a little more burden on the CPU in our heads and a little less burden on the CPU in our pockets . ”
All of this worked well enough in mathematical theory and simulations , but Palem could n’t prove his concept until he built and tested a chip .
The first test results came back late last year .

“ At first , I almost could n’t believe them , ” he said .
“ I spent several sleepless nights verifying the results . ”
Probabilistic computer chips have already caught the attention of industry , especially with the end of Moore ’s Law looming for conventional chips .
“ This logic will prove extremely important , because basic physics dictates that future transistor - based logic will need probabilistic methods , ” said Shekhar Borkar , director of Intel ’s Microprocessor Technology Lab .
GRAND RAPIDS --
The judge , prosecution and even the defense lawyer were surprised when what was supposed to be a quick court appearance Friday turned into a demand by the accused to plead guilty to drunken driving causing serious injury .
Odilon Castillo - Morales , 24 , is charged with two counts of drunken driving for a Jan. 18 crash that injured two people .
Investigators said his borrowed SUV cut across multiple lanes of 28th Street SE and crashed head - on into a vehicle driven by Osma Abdi , 18 , near Breton Avenue .
Also in the vehicle was Abdi 's mother , 40 - year - old Amina Abdi , and 30 - year - old Masa Kamana .
Osma Abdi was not seriously injured , but Kamana received a broken arm and several cuts and Amina Abdi remains hospitalized with broken legs , a broken arm and closed - head injuries , according to Assistant Kent County Prosecutor Timothy Doyle .
Hours after the crash , police determined Castillo - Morales ' blood alcohol level was 0.13 -- the legal definition of drunk is 0.08 .
Castillo - Morales ' lawyer , Brett Stevenson , was in the midst of telling Grand Rapids District Judge Michael Christensen that his client wished to waive the probable cause hearing Friday when the defendant told the judge he was not waiving his hearing .
After a moment of stunned silence , Stevenson asked Castillo - Morales why and , through an interpreter , he said " because I am guilty . "
A few moments of intense three - way conversation ensued before Stevenson told Christensen that his client wanted to plead guilty on the spot .
Doyle rose quickly to support that idea , saying that injured victim Kamana was at the courthouse and was apprehensive about the American legal process and would like to get the process over with as soon as possible .
Kamana and Abdi are from Western Africa .
Doyle offered Castillo - Morales a deal in which he pleaded guilty to one count of operating under the influence of liquor , with a call for restitution to both victims , in exchange for dropping the second OUIL charge .
The charge is a felony , which are handled by Kent County Circuit Court except for rare occasions .
But Christensen took the plea in District Court to accommodate the wishes of both victim and defendant .
" I may get yelled at by a Circuit Court judge in the elevator , but so be it , " said the 17 - year veteran of the District Court bench .
As Kamana watched , Castillo - Morales admitted his guilt and pledged to pay the hospital bills , car damage costs and any other related expenses .
A March 5 sentencing is planned for Circuit Court .
Castillo - Morales faces a maximum of five years in prison .
When he is released , he likely will be deported .

Lijjat Papad celebrates 50 years on 15 March
By Zubair Ahmed
BBC News , Mumbai
Eighty - year - old Jaswantiben Jamnadas Popat defies her age .
She seems more agile and active than her grandchildren .
" I do n't want to stop working , " she says with youthful determination .
Mrs Popat is the only survivor of a group of semi-literate Gujarati housewives who founded Lijjat Papad 50 years ago .
She will be celebrating the Lijjat golden jubilee on 15 March with 45,000 other women who are part of the women - only co-operative .
Mrs Popat cannot believe that what started as a desperate move to " supplement the family income " 50 years ago has come so far .
She says after taking a deep breath : " I feel I am living in a dream world .
When we started our business it was not meant to become so big . "
' Seven sisters '
It is indeed a big business today , with an annual turnover of nearly $ 100 m and a flourishing exports account to boot .
' I feel I am living in a dream world , ' says Mrs Popat Papads , or poppadoms , are the traditional restaurant starter and go with dips and chutneys .
They are a thin wafer of lentil , chickpeas , black gram , salt and oil .
Various types of seasonings are added .
The Lijjat trade began when seven Gujarati housewives decided to exploit the only skill they knew - cooking .
Mrs Popat says : " We were semi-literate which restricted our chances to get jobs .
But we realised our papad - making expertise could be used to earn small amounts of money to help our husbands reduce their financial responsibility . "
On 15 March 1959 , they gathered on the terrace of an old building in a crowded South Mumbai locality and rolled out four packets of papads to sell .
The " seven sisters " , as they are fondly remembered , started production with the princely sum of 80 rupees ( now $ 1.50 ) , borrowed from a good Samaritan , Chaganlal Karamsi Parekh , a social worker with entrepreneurial brains .
The business has expanded from poverty - stricken shanty towns Mrs Popat pays handsome tribute to Mr Parekh 's contribution to their success story .
" He advised us that if we wanted to experience success , never accept donations .
We have never ignored his advice . "
Soon the entrepreneurship expanded in Mumbai 's overcrowded and poverty - stricken shanty towns .
Three months later the business had 25 women .
Word quickly spread about the quality and taste of the poppadoms .
The trade began to expand as a co-operative .
In a few years they had branches all over Mumbai and in subsequent years all across India .
Foreign dignitaries visited their factories .
The women received one award after another .
Exports flourished .
They were on a roll - from poppadoms they branched out into soaps , savouries , chutneys and pickles .
Sustainable model
But apart from following the advice of Mr Parekh , what is the secret of Lijjat 's success ?
After all there are other poppadom makers all across the country .
These women work here to help raise their children and be financially independent
Jyoti Naik , Lajjit head office Mumbai - based businessman and entrepreneur Sushil Jwarijka explains : " Lijjat papads are a perfect example of how a sustainable business can be built , providing large - scale employment to rural women , who are illiterate but skilled .
" And when such skills are given an organisational structure on a co-operative basis a long term sustainable model assures success . "
Jyoti Naik , who runs Lijjat 's head office in a Mumbai suburb , joined the co-operative 40 years ago .
She says it is the women 's sense of financial independence that has made a small enterprise into a big business .
" These women work here to help raise their children and be financially independent , " Ms Naik says .
Priyanka Redkar , 35 , was just nine when she began rolling out poppadoms alongside her mother .
A deeply family - oriented mother of two children , Priyanka exudes the confidence of a woman who knows her place in society .
" Today I can say I am financially independent .
If my husband does n't give me any money I can support myself and children .
I do n't need to beg and borrow . "
Ranjana Khandare was born into the Lijjat family .
Hardships and extreme poverty meant she began helping her mother when she was barely a few years old .
Financial independence for the women translates into empowerment
She has no regrets : " All my life I have worked here .
I know no other skills .
But papad - making has made me independent .
I pay tuition fees for my three children and my husband runs the kitchen . "
Financial independence for these women translates into empowerment .
Most of the 45,000 - strong female workforce live in slums or one - room hutments , with communal bathrooms and toilets .
They are still part of what is known as the working class .
But working for Lijjat Papads gives them financial security .
They are now capable of taking decisions , sending their children to schools and keeping their men on the straight and narrow .
Mr Jwarijka says it has done their self - esteem the world of good .
Indeed the Lijjat women seem to have proved that success does not necessarily need money and infrastructure , as long as there is determination .

One of the major break through in a device more effective than nano - device .
The engineers of Yale have under the process of the development of this device .
They have created a process that will manufacture the nano - device from computer memory to biomedical sensors by exploiting a metal like novel .
This material has some good specifications like this material can be molded like plastics to create features at the nano - scale and also more durable and stronger than steel .
It will beneficial in the lesser cost and manageable process for higher –density computer chip production at the nano - scale .
One solution is making nano - scale devices by simple stamping or molding , like the method used for fabricating CDs or DVDs .
This however requires stamps or master molds with nano - scale features .
While silicon - based molds produce relatively fine detail , they are not very durable .
Metals are stronger , but the grain size of their internal structure does not allow nano - scale details to be imprinted on their surfaces .
Unlike most metals , “ amorphous metals ” known as bulk metallic glasses ( BMGs ) do not form crystal structures when they are cooled rapidly after heating .
Although they seem solid , they are more like a very slow - flowing liquid that has no structure beyond the atomic level — making them ideal for molding fine details , said senior author Jan Schroers of the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science .
These engineers has been exploring the use of BMGs for about a decade , according to Schroers .
“ We have finally been able to harness their unusual properties to transform both the process of making molds and producing imprints , ” .
he said “ This process has the potential to replace several lithographic steps in the production of computer chips . ”
Schroers says BMGs have the pliability of plastics at moderately elevated temperatures , but they are stronger and more resilient than steel or metals at normal working temperatures .
“ We now can make template molds that are far more reliable and lasting than ones made of silicon and are not limited in their detail by the grain size that most metals impose , ” said Schroers .
To actually get detail at the nano - scale the researchers had to overcome an issue faced in any molding process — how to get the material to cover the finest detail , and then how to separate the material intact from the mold .
Surfaces of liquid metals exhibit high surface tension and capillary effects that can interfere in the molding .
Postdoctoral fellow Golden Kumar found that by altering the mold - BMG combination they could create surfaces so that the atoms take advantage of their favorable interaction with the mold — to both fill the mold and then release the product .
In this paper , Schroers ’ team reports nano - patterning of details as small as 13 nanometers — about one ten - thousandth the thickness of a human hair — and the scientists expect that even finer detail will be possible since the BMGs are only limited by the size of a single atom .
While ‘ plastics ! ’ was the catchword of the 1960’s , Schroers says , “ We think ‘ BMGs ! ’ will be the buzz - word for the coming decade . ”

This is Congressman Paul ’s foreword to Thomas Woods ’ new book , Meltdown : A Free -Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed , the Economy Tanked , and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse , a New York Times bestseller as of March 1 .
Many Americans are looking to the new administration to solve our economic problems .
Unfortunately , that is probably a vain hope .
Although we were promised " change , " we are likely to get a continuation of the same superficial economic fixes that have damaged so many economies in the past , and that will only delay the return of prosperity .
These fixes are based on the false belief that the free - market economy has failed .
But it is not the market that has failed .
It is intervention into the market that has failed .
The Federal Reserve and its manipulation of money and interest rates have failed .
None of this can be blamed on the free market , but that is n’t stopping newspaper columnists from doing so anyway .
Keynesian so - called economists , led by Paul Krugman , are vainly reaching into their usual bag of tricks to try to solve the problems of intervention with more intervention , and nothing is working .
But they are persistent .
They ’ll keep scrounging around in that bag all throughout the Obama administration .
The slump will continue , since none of these tricks has the slightest thing to do with the underlying problems in the economy .
All we ’ll have to show for them is an empty Keynesian bag and lot more unpayable debt .
Meanwhile , who ’s being ignored during this crisis ?
The free - market economists of the Austrian School of economic thought , the very people who predicted not only the Great Depression , but also the calamity we ’re dealing with today .
The good news is that Austrian School economists are gaining more acceptance every day , and have a greater chance of influencing our future than they ’ve had for a long time .
I ’m told that Google searches for " Austrian economics " are off the charts .
We can probably expect an avalanche of books in the coming months that purport to tell us what happened to the economy and what we should do about it .
They ’ll be dead wrong , and most of the advice they provide will be dreadful .
You can count on that .
That ’s why Meltdown is so important .
This book actually gets things right .
It correctly identifies our problems , their causes , and what we should do about them .
It treats the architects of this debacle not with the undeserved reverence they receive in Washington and on television , but with the critical eye that is so conspicuously missing from our supposedly independent thinkers in academia and the media .
Tom Woods reserves his admiration for those few who , unlike the quacks who would instruct us now , actually saw the crisis coming , have a theory to explain it , and can show us the way out .
In a short span , Tom introduces the layman to a range of subjects that have been excluded from our national discussion for much too long .
Topics our opinion leaders thought they ’d buried forever , or never heard of in the first place , are suddenly back , and not a moment too soon .
This book is an indispensable conduit of these critical ideas .
Among many other things ,
Tom explains Austrian business cycle theory , which he correctly identifies as the single most important piece of economic knowledge for Americans to have right now .
In so doing , Tom provides Americans with the most persuasive and rational account of how we got here .
Only if we correctly assess the causes of the debacle can we hope to propose a path to recovery that might actually work and not simply prolong the agony .
Our years of living beyond our means , buying everything on credit and on money printed out of thin air , are over .
Sure , our government will carry on with its nonsensical policy of curing indebtedness with more indebtedness , inflation with more inflation , but the game is up .
It ’s not going to work .
What are they going to do when the entitlement crisis hits and the federal government is suddenly on the hook for tens of trillions of dollars ?
If they try to print their way out of that one , they ’ll destroy the dollar for good , if they have n’t done so already with all these bailouts .
The resources are n’t there .
It ’s time we recognized this like adults and adjusted our behavior accordingly .
The more we intervene and the more we prop up economic zombies , the worse off we ’ll be .
But the sooner we understand what has happened , assess our economic situation honestly , and rebuild our economy on a sound foundation , the sooner our fortunes will be restored .
Ideas still matter , and sound economic education has rarely been as urgently necessary as it is today .
There is no better book to read on the present crisis than this one , and that is why I am delighted to endorse and introduce it .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Switzerland 's largest bank , UBS , has admitted helping U.S. taxpayers hide money from the IRS , and has agreed to pay $ 780 million in fines and restitution , and to turn over account information .
The deferred prosecution agreement was approved Wednesday by a federal court judge in Fort Lauderdale , Fla .
" UBS admitted to conspiring to defraud the United States by impeding the IRS , " the Justice Department announced late Wednesday .
The statement says that UBS , " in an unprecedented move " based on an order by Swiss authorities , has agreed " to immediately provide the U.S. government with the identities of , and account information for , certain U.S. customers of UBS 's cross - border business . "
UBS ( UBS ) also has agreed to end its business practice of providing banking services to U.S. customers with undeclared accounts .
" Swiss bankers routinely traveled to the United States to market Swiss bank secrecy to United States clients interested in attempting to evade U.S. income taxes , " the Justice Department said .
The government document says Swiss bankers made a total of about 3,800 trips to discuss their clients ' accounts .
The government said that because the bank has acknowledged responsibility for its actions , has cooperated fully , and has taken remedial actions , the United States will recommend dismissal of the criminal charge " provided the bank fully carries out its obligations under the agreement . "
Two former UBS bankers have pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy for similar conduct .
The acting head of the Justice Department Tax Division called Wednesday 's agreement " but one milestone " in the effort to make sure U.S. citizens pay their fair share of taxes .
" The veil of secrecy has been pulled aside , and we will continue to aggressively pursue those who shirk their federal tax obligations , or assist others in doing so , " said John DiCicco , acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department Tax Division .
IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman issued a warning to the taxpayers who held the accounts , telling them to voluntarily pay up .
Shulman said the taxpayers should note that Wednesday 's agreement also stipulates that the U.S. government will continue to seek enforcement of its court action .
" People who have hidden unreported income off shore need to get right with their government .
They should come forward and take advantage of our voluntary disclosure process , " Shulman said .

A little over a month ago there were some DVD 's stolen from work , I have been the most contacted staff by the police , they have shown up at my house unannounced and even recorded me on a tape recorder in my own home without my permission , I was being very cooperative and answering all there questions without argument , now they want me to take a polygraph to " rule me out as a suspect " .
Get an attorney and have NO FURTHER contact with the police .
Tell them to talk to your attorney .
Unless you have been FORMALLY CHARGED , and since you have already answered their questions .
you no longer have to give them the time the day .
" Eliminate you as a suspect " ?
We had a cop post here about a month ago that that is just what they say .
What they are really after is interrogating you under duress WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY PRESENT , in an attempt to force a confession out of you .
Bottom line , it is in your best interest to :

The Arsenal manager , Arsène Wenger , has suggested that Cristiano Ronaldo would be fouled less often if he were less " arrogant " .
Sir Alex Ferguson has claimed that opponents resort to manhandling the Manchester United winger when they can find no other way to thwart him and criticised Newcastle 's Steven Taylor for striking the Portuguese on Wednesday night , for which the FA yesterday said the defender would not face disciplinary action .
While Wenger expressed support for Ferguson 's view , he also claimed that the player invites hostility and that , moreover , United are sometimes treated too gently by referees .
" With Manchester United I 'm a bit cautious because sometimes I feel they get too much protection and sometimes they do n't get enough , " said Wenger .
" Ronaldo is a specific example of that .
Sometimes his arrogance is provocative , and his class as well . "
Irked that Taylor escaped a red card when he caught Ronaldo with a flailing arm during United 's 2 – 1 win at St James ' Park , Ferguson said he was being victimised by officials .
" Ronaldo is an easy target for referees , " he told MUTV .
" It 's easy to give decisions against him because he is such a great player and he is so celebrated .
When he is away from home the crowd boos him , so he has to handle that .
But it is not helping him . "
If Ferguson felt aggrieved , Taylor was both relieved and riled yesterday .
Although lucky to escape a suspension for that challenge on Ronaldo , the England Under - 21 international was irritated by suggestions he had rowed with the same adversary in the tunnel at half - time .
It was reported that the world player of the year had called Taylor " rubbish " and the Newcastle right - back had retorted by dubbing Ronaldo " ugly . "
It has subsequently emerged that the pair were not involved in any such exchange .
In his report to the FA , the referee , Steve Bennett , wrote that the fourth official had been in the tunnel at the time and said that " nothing happened " .
Taylor also added : " There was no bust - up with Ronaldo – he was nowhere near me .
I have no problem with Cristiano and I shook hands with him at the end . "
Minutes before the teams headed down Newcastle 's narrow tunnel at half - time , Taylor had caught Ronaldo in the neck area with a raised arm before proceeding to lunge in on Michael Carrick and subsequently receive a booking .
In his report , Bennett admitted that he had not seen the challenge on Ronaldo and booked Taylor solely for the tackle on Carrick .
However , after reviewing video evidence of the initial incident , he said that he would merely have yellow - carded Taylor for fouling the Portuguese .
If Bennett had claimed he would have shown the defender a straight red card , Taylor 's offence could have been upgraded to a sending - off and he would have been suspended .
Yet while the two bookings he would have received had Bennett spotted both infringements would have amounted to a dismissal , Fifa regulations state that no retrospective action can be taken in situations where referees failed to spot yellow rather than red card offences .
Indeed they specify that , in such circumstances , yellow cards can never be upgraded or added to other misdemeanours .
Israeli aircraft bombed Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip on Sunday , the Islamist group said , after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert vowed a " disproportionate " response to mortar fire that injured three Israelis .
Intentions Report : IDF warns Rafah residents to evacuate Ali Waked Palestinian civilians said to receive phone calls from Israeli security forces warning ' those residing near terror hubs , tunnels , weapons caches ' to evacuate area ' immediately '
Report : IDF warns Rafah residents to evacuate
Security sources confirmed the strike , citing that the Israeli Air Force struck six targets in Gaza during the evening hours .
The targets included a Hamas stronghold , and several tunnels on the Philadelphi Route .
According to the sources , the fire triggered several explosions , indicating that Hamas as resumed its arms smugglings .
No casualties were reported .
One attack was on a security headquarters in a village in central Gaza that residents said had been vacated after Israel telephoned warnings to Palestinians to leave buildings that housed any weapons .
About a dozen rockets and mortar bombs fired from Gaza struck Israel on Sunday .
Three Israelis were wounded , including two soldiers and the first Israeli civilian hurt since a Jan. 18 truce ended Israel 's 22 - day offensive in the coastal enclave .
They suffered shrapnel injuries , medics said .
The al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , a group belonging to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ' Fatah faction , said it fired some of the rockets , but not all were claimed .
Israeli leaders have taken a hard line against rocket fire in the run-up to a Feb. 10 national election , which opinion polls predict right - wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu will win .
" The government 's position was from the outset that if there is shooting at the residents of the south , there will be a harsh Israeli response that will be disproportionate , " Olmert , who is not a candidate , said at the weekly cabinet meeting .
" We will act according to new rules which will ensure that we will not be drawn into a war of incessant shooting on the southern border , which would deprive the residents of the south of a normal life , " he said , without elaborating .
Palestinians in the southern Gaza town of Rafah , not far from the village targeted , received recorded voice messages by telephone warning " everybody who is near any place used for terror or weapon storage facility or tunnels , should evacuate the area immediately . "
Similar warnings have preceded Israeli attacks in the past .
' Decisive and strong response needed '
A spokesman for the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip condemned what he described as Olmert 's " aggressive statement " .
But the spokesman , Taher al - Nono , also urged all Palestinian factions to " respect the national consensus " on the ceasefire the Islamist group declared two weeks ago after Israel announced it was halting the Gaza offensive .
Israel was criticized internationally for the deaths , according to the Hamas - run Health Ministry in Gaza , of more than 1,300 Palestinians , including at least 700 civilians .
Critics said Israel had responded disproportionately , in its air and ground offensive in heavily populated areas , to cross - border rocket attacks over eight years that killed 18 people .
Ten Israeli soldiers and three civilians were killed in the Gaza campaign .
Israel said Hamas militants bore responsibility for civilian deaths in Gaza by operating inside its towns and refugee camps .
Since the truce , in addition to Sunday 's injuries , an Israeli soldier was killed and three others were wounded when a bomb exploded next to their patrol .
Israeli air strikes since Jan. 18 have killed three Palestinians and wounded 10 .
Egypt has been trying to broker a long - term ceasefire that would end Hamas weapons smuggling into Gaza and also lead to a reopening of Gaza border crossings , one of Hamas ' main demands .
Olmert 's comments were echoed by Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , a candidate for prime minister who trails Netanyahu in opinion polls ahead of the election whose campaign has focused on Israel 's tensions with Islamist Hamas .
Livni has replaced Olmert as head of the ruling centrist Kadima party since he quit the government in a corruption scandal in September .
He has remained caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed after the election .
" Israel will respond , " said Livni .
" This is my position .
It was clear before , during and after the operation , and this is how I will conduct myself as prime minister . "
Netanyahu said Israel should make " a decisive and strong " response to the latest rockets .
" No matter how strong the blows that Hamas received from Israel , that 's not enough , " he said .
Over the years I have produced a range of tutorials on artistic use of the computer .
Most of them concerns rather general concepts and can hopefully give something regardless of which program you are using or even be of some interest for traditional , non-digital artists .
Some examples of my art can be found in the gallery
That said , to get the most out of these you should know that I mainly use the open - source image manipulation program GIMP .
I also work a lot with the painter program MyPaint .
These are both very powerful programs capable of great artistic expression .
Being open - source programs , they are both legally free to download and use without any cost .
They exist for many platforms , including Linux , Mac and Windows , so they are worth trying out if you have n't already .
The tutorials listed below tend are ( very roughly ) beginning by covering the basics then going onto small tricks and particular effects .
They then gradually expand into bigger projects and creating more complete works .
You do n't have to do them in any order though - the latter ones may on occation refer back to the earlier ones , but it should n't be a problem .
If you are just starting out in making art on the computer in general and GIMP in particular , I suggest checking out the first few at least before trying the larger ones .
A lot of people have , creating some really cool stuff from them in process !
Each tutorial has an image ( which might link to the deviation being created ) and one or more links .
The links lead to the actual tutorial .
If one link is down , try another one .

Credit Suisse has written off billions in bad loans
Troubled Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse has said it is shedding another 5,300 jobs from its global workforce .
Most of the jobs being lost are in investment banking .
The firm has already shed 1,800 posts this year .
The bank has struggled since the onset of the financial crisis and has been forced to write off assets worth billions owing to bad loans .
It said it had a net loss of about 3bn Swiss francs ( $ 2.5 bn ; £ 1.7 bn ) in the two months to the end of November .
Credit Suisse said the loss , primarily in investment banking , was due to adverse market conditions and risk reduction .
In addition it will take a restructuring charge of 900 m Swiss francs .
" Investment banking had a significant pretax loss , reflecting the challenging conditions in the financial markets in the quarter and the costs associated with risk reduction , " Credit Suisse said in a statement .
Without state aid
The bank is shedding 11 % of its workforce as it strives to make savings of 2bn Swiss francs .
These job cuts will take place by the middle of the next year , the bank announced .
On Monday it said that it would cut 650 jobs from its UK workforce .
Credit Suisse said on Thursday that its chief executive and other top managers will not receive salary bonuses for 2008 .
So far Credit Swiss has managed to weather the global financial crisis without state aid .
While Australia is doing fine for now , the same certainly can't be said of the U.S .
The 3 numbers released today said : Durable goods orders fell another 5.2 % and are now down 26.4 % in the last 12 months .
Specifically , " core capital goods " orders fell 5.4 % and are down 20.2 % .
This suggest that actual capital spending , as measured in the " core capital goods " shipments will fall further as they are down " only " 11.1 % compared to a year earlier .
On a monthly bases , they fell 6.6 % and will almost certainly fall further in coming months .
This means that we could see a really dramatic decline in the " equipment and software " component of business investment , at least 20 % at an annual rate , but possibly as much as 30 % .
- Both initial and continuing jobless benefit claims rose to new highs , both with regard to the weekly numbers and the 4 - week averages .
- New home sales plunged more than 10 % compared to the previous month and 48 % compared to 12 months earlier to reach the lowest level ever since records began in 1963 .
While inventories fell in absolut numbers , they reached a new high relative to sales .
This happened despite a 17.6 % decline in the average price .
Not only does the slump show no sign of ending or even abating , the rate of decline is actually accelerating now .
Some argue that because of higher money supply growth ( more on that in a later post ) , we will see a recovery later this year .
That might happen , though it is first of all not certain as it might simply mean higher price inflation and secondly , it is not likely to be sustainable .
As we mark the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's birth , there is much focus on evolution in animals and plants .
But new research shows that for the countless billions of tiniest creatures – microbes – large - scale evolution was completed 2.5 billion years ago .
All living organisms need nitrogen , a basic component of amino acids and proteins .
But for atmospheric nitrogen to be usable , it must be " fixed , " or converted to a biologically useful form .
Some microbes turn atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia , a form in which the nitrogen can be easily absorbed by other organisms .
But the new research shows that about 2.5 billion years ago some microbes evolved that could carry the process a step further , adding oxygen to the ammonia to produce nitrate , which also can be used by organisms .
That was the beginning of what today is known as the aerobic nitrogen cycle .
" For microbes , it appears that almost all of their major evolution took place before we have any record of them , way back in the dark mists of prehistory , " said Roger Buick , a University of Washington paleontologist and astrobiologist .
The microbes that accomplished that feat are on the last , or terminal , branches of the bacteria and archaea domains of the so - called tree of life , and they are the only microbes capable of carrying out the step of adding oxygen to ammonia .
The fact that they are on those terminal branches indicates that large - scale evolution of bacteria and archaea was complete about 2.5 billion years ago , Buick said .
" Countless bacteria and archaea species have evolved since then , but the major branches have held , " said Buick , a UW professor of Earth and space sciences .
He is the corresponding author of the research , which appears in the Feb. 20 edition of Science .
Lead author is Jessica Garvin , a UW Earth and space sciences graduate student .
Other authors are Ariel Anbar and Gail Arnold of Arizona State University and Alan Jay Kaufman of the University of Maryland .
The work was funded by NASA and the National Science Foundation .
The scientists examined material from a half - mile - deep core drilled in the Pilbara region of northwest Australia .
They looked specifically at a section of shale from 300 to 650 feet deep , deposited 2.5 billion years ago , and found telltale isotope signatures created in the process of denitrification , the removal of oxygen from nitrate .
If denitrification was occurring , then nitrification – the addition of oxygen to ammonia to form nitrate – also must have been taking place , Buick said .
That makes the find the earliest solid evidence for the beginning of the aerobic nitrogen cycle .
" What this shale deposit has done is record the onset of the modern nitrogen cycle , " he said .
" This was a life - giving nutrient then and remains so today .
That 's why you put nitrogen fertilizer on your tomato plants , for example .
"
The discovery gives clues about when and how the Earth 's atmosphere became oxygen rich , Buick believes .
Geochemical examination of stratigraphic samples from the core indicates that atmospheric oxygen rose in a temporary " whiff " about 2.5 billion years ago .
The whiff lasted long enough to be recorded in the nitrogen isotope record , then oxygen dropped back to very low levels before the atmosphere became permanently oxygenated about 2.3 billion years ago .
It is unclear why the oxygen level declined following the temporary increase .
It could have been that the oxygen was depleted rapidly as it reacted with chemicals and minerals that had not been exposed to oxygen previously , Buick said .
Or something could have halted the photosynthesis that produced the oxygen in the first place .
But it seems clear , he said , that the tiniest creatures played a crucial role in completing the nitrogen cycle that life depends on today .
" All microbes are amazing chemists compared to us .
We 're really very boring , metabolically , " Buick said .
" To understand early evolution of life , we have to know how organisms were nourished and how they evolved .
This work helps us on both of those counts , " he said .
A PRESIDENT'S first budget proposal is more than a set of figures .
It is also an outline of his philosophy of government .
The plan Barack Obama delivered on February 26th envisages an ambitious and costly expansion of the government 's role in the lives of Americans .
Its centrepiece is a big expansion of state - provided health care — for which he has budgeted $ 634 billion over the next decade while admitting that yet more will be needed .
He will fill in the details in coming weeks ( see article ) while insisting the plan meets several criteria : it must extend insurance to the 15 % of Americans who now lack it , it must help slow the growth in costs , and it must be paid for .
Add increased spending on education , energy and other initiatives , and federal expenditures , excluding defence , would rise to a new high of 18 % of GDP in the coming decade .
Small - government conservatives fume , yet this is what Mr Obama victoriously campaigned on and , at least in the case of health care , what Americans seem to want .
The ranks of the uninsured have grown as care becomes more expensive and more employers , through whom most workers get insurance , drop or curtail benefits .
Losing a job often means losing health insurance too , making unemployment doubly traumatic .
Although Mr Obama 's revenue plans are not clad in the ambitious rhetoric of his spending initiatives , they are just as profound .
To pay for his plans and get the deficit down to manageable levels , he would return top tax rates to where they were before George Bush cut them , extract more from the rich by capping their deductions , increase taxes on corporations and auction carbon - emission permits .
At the same time , he promises permanent tax cuts for 95 % of workers .
Sadly , these plans are deeply flawed .
First , Mr Obama 's budget forecasts that the economy will shrink 1.2 % this year then grow by an average of 4 % over the following four years .
It might if the economy were to follow a conventional path back to full employment .
But this is not a conventional recession .
The unprecedented damage to household balance sheets could well result in anaemic economic growth for years , significantly undermining the president 's revenue projections .
The economic outlook continues to darken and the stockmarket has already tumbled to 12 - year lows .
Mr Obama may either have to renege on his promise to slash the deficit to 3 % of GDP in 2013 from more than 12 % now , rein in his spending promises or raise taxes more .
Second , Mr Obama 's scattershot tax increases are a poor substitute for the wholesale reform America 's Byzantine tax code needs .
Limiting high earners ' deductions for mortgage interest , local - government taxes and other things is certainly more efficient than raising their marginal tax rates even more .
But it would be better to replace such deductions for everyone with targeted credits , abolish the alternative minimum tax ( an absurd parallel tax system that ensnares a sizeable chunk of the upper middle class ) , and implement a broad sales tax .
Rather than simply eliminating the sheltering of corporate income from abroad , Mr Obama could have broadened the corporate tax base and lowered the rate .
In sum , Mr Obama could simultaneously raise more revenue and make the tax code simpler and more conducive to growth .
But he has n't .
Tell it like it is
Finally , by asking only the richest 2 % of Americans to pay more , Mr Obama is building his vision of a more activist government on a shaky foundation .
Mr Bush 's tax cuts raised the proportion of American families that pay no federal income tax ( or are net recipients of tax credits ) from 33 % to 38 % ; Mr Obama 's will raise it to 44 % , according to the Tax Policy Centre , a research group .
Although many of these people do pay payroll taxes , Mr Obama is also intent on reducing the link between payroll taxes and the pension and health - care benefits they were supposedly designed to pay for .
It certainly makes sense to keep poor people off the income - tax rolls , but removing a sizeable chunk of the middle class weakens the political bond between taxpayer and government , and will lead to pressure for more such spending .
Mr Obama 's team rightly points out that Mr Bush 's tax cuts disproportionately benefited the wealthy at a time when their share of income was anyway rising for more fundamental reasons .
But the recession is already undoing some of the rise in inequality as the capital gains , bonuses and Wall Street profits that fuelled much of the gains in top incomes turn to dust .
This could further imperil Mr Obama 's revenue projections , if the rich people he is relying on to pay virtually all his bills end up a lot less rich than they were .
Much as Mr Obama would like to shield the middle class , he needs to level with Americans : if they want a bigger government , one that will help them in all sorts of ways , they should be prepared to pay for it .
Finance executives expressed anger and betrayal at Washington 's latest anti-Wall Street rhetoric during Tuesday 's sessions of the Future of Finance Initiative , a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal .
The conflict suggested that the lines of communication between government and the private sector remain limited just as government is hoping to expand cooperation with private investors .
Those tensions flared over the last week , as the U.S. House passed a bill taxing bonuses by 90 % for banks and other companies receiving ...
Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren Welcome a Boy
The world 's top golferand his stunningly beautiful wifewelcomed a second child into their family yesterday .
This time the couple were blessed with a baby boy ,
Daughter Sam Alexis , their first child , was born in June 2007 .
If you 've seen photos of Sam , then you are already aware of the fact that she has inherited both of her parents good looks .
Tiger announced the news on his website and said that Charlie and Elin are both doing great .
If not for the arrival of Charlie , Tiger would have been competing at Torrey Pines in the Buick Invitational .
The golf great has won an amazing six times at the event : 1999 , 2003 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 .
Tiger plans to be back in full swing on the tour now that he has recuperated from extensive knee surgery .
Congratulations to the Woods family .

Exploring MapReduce with F# Tuesday , March 3 , 2009
With my exploration into mass concurrency and big data problems , I ’m always finding challenges to give myself on how I might solve a given issue .
Such examples that have intrigued me along the way as PLINQ , MPI /.
NET , Data Parallel Haskell , but one in particular has intrigued me more – MapReduce .
A challenge I gave myself is to fully understand this paradigm and implement a version using F# .
What Is MapReduce ?
MapReduce is a Google programming model and implementation for processing and generating large data sets .
Programs written using this more functional style can be parallelized over a large cluster of machines without needing the knowledge of concurrent programming .
The actual runtime can then partition the data , schedule and handle any potential failure .
The Google implementation of it runs on a large cluster of machines and can process terabytes of data at a time .
The programming model is based upon five simple concepts :
Iteration over input Computation of key / value pairs from each input Grouping of all intermediate values by key Iteration over the resulting groups Reduction of each group
So , where does this Map / Reduce wording come in ?
Well , let ’s explore each :
Map
Function written by the user to take an input pair and produce a result of intermediate key / value pairs .
The intermediate values are then grouped with the same intermediate key and passed to the Reduce function .
Function written by the user to take an input pair and produce a result of intermediate key / value pairs .
The intermediate values are then grouped with the same intermediate key and passed to the Reduce function .
Reduce
Function also written by the user to take the intermediate key and sequence of values for that key .
The sequence of values are then merged to produce a possibly smaller set of values .
Zero or one output value is produced per our Reduce function invocation .
In order to manage memory , an iterator is used for potentially large data sets .
How useful is this programming model ?
Using this model , we ’re able to express some interesting problems such as the following :
Word counts in large documents
Distributed Grep – Find patterns in a document
Count of URL Access Frequency
Reverse Web - Link Graph – Find all source URLs for a given destination
Term - Vector per Host - Summarize most important words in a document
Inverted Index
Distributed Sort
That ’s only a start to what we can do .
After the paper which explained the technology was published in 2004 , there have been several implementations including the open - source Hadoop project and the Microsoft Research Project Dryad .
Of course , it does n’t come without some criticism about the resource usage such as this post called “ eBay does n’t love MapReduce ” .
Dryad is more interesting in that its functionality subsumes MapReduce and can do in regards to job creation , resource management , job monitoring , visualization and more .
What ’s even more interesting is the associated project DryadLINQ , which allows us to compile LINQ expressions to have sent across the cluster so that I could perform intense data analysis using LINQ operators that we ’re used for our other data tasks .
What does the future hold for Dryad remains to be seen , but the possibilities seem plenty .
F# Implementation
The challenge I gave myself was to understand the basics of the programming model .
Ralf Lämmel , formerly of the Microsoft Programmability Team , published a paper entitled Google ’s MapReduce Programming Model – Revisited which I used as a source for how my F# implementation works .
If you want to understand not only the deep internal details , but also how an implementation in Haskell would look , I highly recommend this paper .
In our example , we ’re going to use a MapReduce implementation to look for the most frequent IP addresses from our IIS logs .
Let ’s first start by defining the outer skeleton needed .
Let ’s define what the map_reduce function and associated steps will look like :
# light
namespace CodeBetter .
MapReduceExample
module MapReduceModule =
let map_reduce
// Map function take pair and create sequence of key / value pairs
( m : ' k1 -> ' v1 -> seq <'k2 * ' v2 > )
// Reduce function takes key and sequence to produce optional value
( r : ' k2 -> seq <'v2 > -> ' v3 option )
// Takes an input of key / value pairs to produce an output key / value pairs
: Map <' k1 , 'v1 > -> Map <' k2 , 'v3 > =
map_per_key >> //
1 . Apply map function to each key / value pair
group_by_key >> //
2 . Group intermediate data per key
reduce_per_key // 3 . Apply reduce to each group
I ’m using the standard sequences instead of lists for this because the data may be large and the List < T > in F# by default is eagerly evaluated .
The case could be made to use the LazyList < T > to model the data , but as I might want to use the Parallel Extensions and the PSeq module I used before , I ’ll stick with the IEnumerable < T > .
The comments here in the code say a lot about what ’s going on .
Our map_reduce function takes two functions , the map and the reduce which are explained in the code comments .
It ’s important to understand what happens last is our series of three functions , our map_per_key , group_by_key and reduce_per_key .
Each of those steps fall into line with the explanation from above .
At this point , we have n’t actually yet implemented the functions , but let ’s go ahead and do that now to flush out our map_per_key , group_by_key and reduce_per_key .
The following code comes before the last statement which ties our three functions together :
let map_per_key : Map <' k1 , 'v1 > -> seq< ( ' k2 * ' v2 ) > =
Map .
to_seq >> //
1 . Map into a sequence
Seq . map ( Tuple .
uncurry m ) >> //
2 . Map m over a list of pairs
Seq .
concat // 3 . Concat per-key lists
let group_by_key ( l : seq< ( ' k2 * ' v2 ) > ) : Map <' k2,seq <'v2 >> =
let insert d ( k2 , v2 ) = Map .
insert_with Seq .
append k2 ( seq [ v 2 ] ) d
let func ( f : Map <'a , seq <'b >> -> Map <'a , seq <'b >> ) ( c : 'a * 'b )
: ( Map <'a , seq <'b >> -> Map <'a , seq <'b >> ) =
fun x -> f ( insert x c )
( Seq . fold func ( fun x -> x ) l ) Map .
empty
let reduce_per_key : Map < ' k2 , seq <'v2 >> -> Map <' k2, 'v3 > =
let un_some k ( Some v ) = v //
Remove optional type
let is_some k = function
| Some _ -> true // Keep entires
| None -> false // Remove entries
Map . mapi r >> //
1 . Apply reduce per key
Map .
filter is_some >> //
2 . Remove None entries
Map .
mapi un_some // 3 . Transform to remove option
There you have it , our implementation of a MapReduce .
Now let ’s step ahead with our implementation to step through our IIS logs .
Let ’s first retrieve the data for our logs from a given directory .
We can use the async workflows in F# to retrieve this data in parallel given a base directory .
Next , we need a way to harvest the data from the given logs so that we can get the IP address from it .
module LogCount =
open System .
IO
let processed_logs : ( string * string ) array =
Async .
Run (
Async .
Parallel
[ for file in Directory .
GetFiles @ " C:\Logs\ " ->
async { return file , File .
ReadAllText file } ] )
let harvest_data ( data : string ) : seq < string > =
seq { for line in String .
lines data do
if not ( line .
StartsWith " # " ) then
yield line .
Split ( [ | ' ' | ] ) . [ 2 ]
}
Finally , we can count get the IP occurrence count by implementing our map and reduce functions and calling our map_reduce implementation .
let ip_occurrence_count : Map < string , string > ->
Map < string , int > =
let m = const ' ( harvest_data >>
Seq . map ( flip Tuple . curry 1 ) )
let r = const ' ( Seq . sum >>
Some )
MapReduce .
map_reduce m r
module MainModule =
[< EntryPoint >]

The m function above harvests the data from the string value and then mark each IP address with an occurrence of 1 .
Then our reduce function will sum the sequence of 1s for each given key to produce our result .
There is some boilerplate code that has been omitted due to space constraints but will be available at the end of this post .
Once we run this against a known set of data , we might get the following results :
seq
[ [ 192.168.1.2 , 46 ] ; [ 192.168.1.8 , 339 ] ;
[ 192.168.1.10 , 11 ] ; [ 192.168.1.15 , 43 ] ]

With this simple example , we can see some of the power and possibilities such a programming model can bring .
This exercise is more of an idea of how one might be written using the programming model , as I did n’t write any system to handle concurrency , scheduling and so on .
Conclusion
In many of my adventures in big data analysis and data parallel concurrency , MapReduce is one of the more interesting solutions .
By utilizing functional programming constructs , we are able to write rich code to analyze our data that may not as structured as we wish .
But , does our adventure stop here with this implementation ?
Not necessarily , but either way it was a lot of fun .
You can find the source code for this example here .
What a wonderful world it would be if every industry were like Web browser software .
Companies entangle themselves in a fiery arms race to deliver us the absolute best products , free !
Can we get the automakers in on this ?
The new Top Sites feature in Apple 's Safari 4 beta .
Apple released a beta version of Safari 4 on Tuesday , and it gets a lot of things right .
The company bills Safari 4 as the " fastest browser ever , " and while my feeble brain has trouble deciphering differences in fractions of a second , it certainly feels snappy .
ZDNet put the claim to the test on the PC and Mac using speed - benchmark software , producing some nifty graphs .
Safari did indeed rank in as the fastest -- producing far better results than Firefox , Opera and Internet Explorer ( and even the new IE8 that has n't officially come out yet ) .
Its only main competition in terms of speed are Minefield ( the code name for the next major release of Firefox , presumably version 4 ) and Chrome .
Chrome , Google 's Web browser , quickly snapped up about 1 % of market share in January , according to Net Applications , an Internet statistics firm .
( And in the browser world , 1 % is no small potatoes . )
Safari 4 takes one of its most notable new features from Chrome -- the relocation of the tab bar , which lists the window 's open Web pages .
Apple has moved it to the top of the browser -- probably to preserve space .
( Some have expressed outrage over the change , so we 've provided a tip at the end of this post to switch back to the old tab format . )
This version of Safari also boasts the addition of Cover Flow -- the visual browsing feature in iTunes , on the iPhone and in just about every new Mac application -- and a similar feature called Top Sites .

U.S. retail sales fell 2.7 % in December

Retail carnage continued as government figures released Wednesday showed a record six months of sales declines , and December turned out even worse than analysts had predicted .
Sales fell by 2.7 percent in December from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis , according to the Commerce Department .
Economists had predicted a 1.2 percent sales decline for December , but consumers held onto their wallets even tighter during the holiday season due to job losses and the credit crunch .
Also on Wednesday , two companies - including Gottschalks Inc. of Fresno - added to the growing number of companies filing for bankruptcy protection or going out of business .
Gottschalks , which operates 58 stores in six Western states , filed for bankruptcy with the hope of finding a buyer .
Goody 's Inc. , a Tennessee clothing store chain that has no California stores , resorted to total liquidation in its second filing .
" The reality is this is the long , cold winter following a holiday season that did n't appear for retailers , " said Greg Segall , a partner with Versa Capital Management , a private - equity firm that specializes in distressed sectors .
Reorganization experts predict the number of retailers that will file for bankruptcy will accelerate in the coming months , and many of these companies will be unable to survive and ultimately just go out of business .
Companies typically file for bankruptcy protection with the hopes of emerging smaller , but solvent .
Shoppers have already seen the demise of such well - known retailers as Shoe Pavilion Inc. , Mervyns LLC and Linens 'n Things .
Circuit City Stores Inc. , which filed for bankruptcy protection , is considering liquidation if it can't find a buyer within days .
Other retailers are shuttering stores and reducing staff .
Cost Plus Inc. of Oakland said last week it will close 26 stores and cut jobs at its distribution center and home office by 18 percent as part of a plan to save $ 21 million annually starting in fiscal 2009 .
Luxury department store operator Neiman Marcus Group Inc. , which posted a 27.5 percent drop in same - store sales for December , said this week that it is cutting about 375 jobs .
Last week , Macy's Inc. said it will close 11 underperforming stores , which will affect about 960 employees .
Retail experts took Macy 's closures in stride , saying shedding less profitable locations is a smart business move for such a large national chain .
But they said some companies wo n't be able to stave off bankruptcy even if they close stores and employ other cost - cutting measures .
And they expect smaller , regional chains like Gottschalks to have a tough time emerging from bankruptcy proceedings .
" In this economic environment , it will be very difficult for Gottschalks to be successful , " said Helen Bulwik , managing director of New Market Solutions , a retail consulting firm in Oakland .
" It is very difficult for a regional retailer today to survive .
They just do not have the buying power of a large national retailer like Macy 's or Kohl 's or Target . "
Thirty - eight of Gottschalks ' 58 stores are in California .
The bulk are concentrated in the Central Valley , a region that has been hit particularly hard by the housing crisis and the credit crunch .
The company , founded in 1904 by German immigrant Emil Gottschalk , said in a statement that it had negotiated a $ 125 million debtor - in - possession financing arrangement with a group of lenders and is looking for a buyer .
Gottschalks said last week that its same - store sales , those at stores open at least a year , dropped 9.6 percent in December compared with the same month in 2007 .
Harlan Platt , a turnaround expert and finance professor at Northeastern University College of Business Administration in Boston , said a growing number of Chapter 11 filings will turn into what he calls a Chapter 22 filing : a second bankruptcy that results in liquidation .
" The retail sector has always been one of the most problematic to reorganize because they are lacking in hard assets , " he said .
" Retailers have stores they lease , have merchandise sold on credit and they have a lot of debt .
That 's not a healthy combination . "
While some retail losses are considered good for the overall economy - most experts say the United States is " over stored " - the expected closures are likely to have a ripple affect , hitting suppliers hard and leading to additional empty storefronts and shuttered malls .
Local retail expert Bulwik said she expects the central Bay Area , particularly San Francisco 's Union Square , to weather the retail fallout better than many other parts of the state and country .
" However , as you get further out into more suburban locations where there has been a lot of building of malls , strip malls ... that 's where we 're going to see a lot of store closures , " said Bulwik , referring to such areas as Antioch , Fairfield and Brentwood .
Platt , of Northeastern University , said a government bailout is not likely to be an option for U.S. retailers , who have to wait behind the financial and auto industries .
" The line is so long , when they get to the front of the line , there wo n't be any money left , " he said .
Only prey runs from a lion .
You might escape a buffalo with a desperate sprint for a nearby tree , while a dash and body swerve could evade the full - blooded charge of an angry rhino .
But lions are different .
Faced with a wild lion , millions of years of evolutionary pressure crushes your senses and floods your brain with urgent messages to fight or take flight .
Either would be suicide .
A lion will wait for you to make that first move , so you must stand your ground , avoid eye contact and wait for the beast , tired of the game , to lose interest .
Then , and only then , edge slowly backwards towards the rest of your lucky , lucky life .
That , at least , is the theory .
Lawrence Anthony , a rugged South African with decades of experience with wild animals , knows the theory well .
In spring 2003 , he was walking through a patch of knee - high grass when he saw the distinctive twitch of an ear .
He knew it belonged to a large male lion .
He saw another of the animals , and then a third .
Without knowing it , Anthony had wandered into a pride of four starving lions , two of which were slowly padding towards him .
" The golden rule is that you stay dead still , you do n't make a fuss , then you gently back off , " he says .
" Well , that all went out of the window .
I did n't know how big they were and then one stood up .
I thought , that 's big enough , and I just turned and bolted . "
These were no ordinary lions , and they , and Anthony , were far from their African home .
The lions were in an enclosure in downtown Baghdad , at the grand palace of the late and unlamented Uday Hussein , son of the former Iraqi dictator .
Anthony had travelled to Iraq not as a soldier , but as a conservationist .
And he had gone to Uday 's palace to save the lions as part of an unlikely wartime animal rescue .
Just days after the US and Britain launched their invasion of Iraq , Anthony was leading a ragtag group of locals , former Iraqi fighters and off - duty US soldiers , united by their love of wildlife , in an extraordinary effort to save the Baghdad zoo and the terrified animals that called its wrecked cages home .
Home for Anthony is the South African game reserve , Thula Thula , which he shares with his wife Françoise , some 30 miles inland from the port town of Richards Bay , 100 miles along the coast from Durban .
A sprawling oasis of brown scrub and trees amid an unnatural green desert of planted sugar cane , the reserve and its animals offer a focus for his lifelong passion for conservation and wildlife .
Tall , bearded and a heavy smoker , Anthony looks every inch a bushman .
Sat on the terrace at Thula Thula 's tourist lodge , as monkeys chatter in the trees , Anthony recalls how he watched the 2003 US 's shock and awe bombardment of Baghdad on TV .
" I knew Baghdad had the biggest zoo in the Middle East and I could n't stand the thought of the animals dying in their cages .
I contacted the Americans and the British and said , ' You have any contingency plans ? '
Nobody was interested .
I could n't get any support from anybody so I thought , I 'll just go .
I went there for the animals . "
Stories of how thousands of animals perished in Berlin and other German zoos during the second world war made a big impression on him as a child .
" I remember being shocked that the animals were n't in Africa , that they were in zoos and that they were killing them there .
When Iraq invaded Kuwait they killed all the animals in the zoo .
The same thing happened in Kosovo and the same thing happened in Afghanistan .
I just thought that somebody should be taking responsibility . "
Within days he was on the Kuwait - Iraq border , in a hire car packed with veterinary supplies , trying to talk his way into a rapidly emptying country .
" When I got there the tanks were going into Baghdad already and the Americans would n't let me cross the border .
Nobody would let me in .
Then I realised it was n't the American border , it 's the Kuwaiti border , so I went to the Kuwaitis and they said , ' Sure you can go in ' . "
Television pictures of smiling Baghdad citizens cheering US troops suggested the situation in the city was under control .
So , with two Kuwaiti zoo workers , Anthony joined the tanks and convoys in his car and began the all - day drive to the Iraqi capital .
A US soldier at the border , after incredulously asking if they realised the country was at war , said to keep their heads down as the trio were the first civilians in , apart from journalists .
" And they do n't count . "
Ignoring advice to drive on the main roads for fear they would be targeted , they took back roads to Baghdad .
" It was just like a holocaust had gone through .
We got half way and realised we should n't be there .
This war is still very much on .
But we 'd come through some areas there was no way we could go back through , so we just had to keep going .
There was no bravery involved .
It was just naivety .
I thought I could get in easily .
And then when I got in I found I could n't get out . "
Anthony worked in Baghdad for six months , during which time he transformed the fate of the zoo , in the ruins of the city 's once majestic al - Zawra park .
Of 650 animals at the zoo before the invasion , just 35 were still alive when he arrived .
The rest had died in their cages of thirst and hunger , or had been stolen .
There was no food , no water and the remaining animals , the ones with teeth and claws to defend themselves from hungry looters , were lame , starving and dying of thirst .
By the time he left , the animals were healthy , the cages clean and the zoo a viable operation once again .
The story , outlined in Babylon 's Ark , a 2007 book which Anthony wrote with journalist Graham Spence , has attracted the attention of Hollywood , with a major film , Good Luck , Mr Anthony , in the works .
US banks and corporations now pay Anthony to talk to their employees , hoping the lessons of how to bring order from chaos could turn round failing businesses .
And the zoo itself is a thriving attraction in the recovering city , with 5 m visitors last year and regular loans of animals from zoos abroad .
It looked very different when Anthony and his two Kuwaiti guides arrived in 2003 , having picked their way through the bombed city by asking baffled locals and " driving in the opposite direction whenever we heard shooting " .
Met by Husham Hussan , the zoo 's deputy director , who burst into tears when he saw the carload of supplies , Anthony initially saw little hope .
Black clouds of flies swarmed over the carcasses of dead animals that had been tossed into dens to feed the live ones .
Rubbish littered the ground , baboons and monkeys were running free , while parrots , falcons and other escaped birds circled overhead .
Lying near a massive bomb crater , an off - target product of shock and awe , was a decomposing pony .
The surviving animals , including lions , tigers and an Iraqi brown bear , were listless and scrawny .
" I said it was so bad that we were wasting our time , " recalls Anthony .
" I thought we should borrow an M16 from a soldier and just shoot them all .
I 'm not used to seeing animals , lions and tigers looking like that .
Husham persuaded me not to and said we 've got to try .
We started from there . "
With a handful of Iraqi zoo staff , he worked on the vital needs for captive animals : water , food and hygiene .
With the city 's infrastructure smashed , water had to be dragged by bucket from a stagnant canal , while donkeys provided meat for the carnivores .
" We went out and bought donkeys off the street and the donkey always had a cart , so the guys would n't sell the donkey without the cart .
I still think of how we left those carts all over Baghdad . "
Anthony was not the only South African working in the city .
General Jay Garner , the US commander , had a dozen former South African special forces soldiers as personal bodyguards .
" They would come and hang out at the zoo .
And they 'd bring their machine guns . "
US soldiers also pitched in .
" They were amazing .
They were out fighting a war all day and they would come and lay their rifles down , pick up a shovel and ask , ' What can I do ? '
Think about it , America and Britain , two first world countries with the strongest animal rights records .
Everybody 's got pets and everybody understands animals , and they had no provision whatsoever for any wild animals in Baghdad . "
He adds : " Then something amazing happened .
Iraqi civilians started arriving as well , and then the Republican Guard .
We had Republican Guard soldiers working with American troops in the zoo two weeks after they were killing each other on the battlefield . "
As the situation improved , so did outside and official interest .
Anthony convinced the US to revive the adjacent park , while international conservation groups sent staff and supplies .
The zoo reopened in July 2003 and has not been attacked since .
The US spent $ 2.5 m on it last year .
A child of colonial southern Africa , 57 - year - old Anthony grew up in a series of small towns where his father opened insurance offices .
His grandfather , a miner from Berwick - upon - Tweed , emigrated to South Africa to work in the gold mines in the 1920s .
" I remember as a kid you could n't go to the dustbins at night because of the hyenas .
I grew up in the bush and it just stayed with me . "
Property development followed .
" But I was always interested in conservation . "
When the Thula Thula reserve was put up for sale in the mid-1990s , he sold his property business and turned his hobby into an uncertain career .
This is Zulu country .
Rorke 's Drift , the mission station immortalised in Zulu , where 139 British soldiers held firm against 5,000 Zulu warriors in the 1879 Anglo - Zulu war , is less than two hours ' drive across rolling hills that could be Wales or Devon .
Several Zulu tribes farm the surrounding land , and goats wander between the clay and cement buildings that scatter either side of the dusty road connecting the reserve to the local village .
On the far side of the tribal land stands the Umfolozi nature reserve , the oldest game park in Africa .
Originally a hunting ground for Zulu royalty , the park was formed in 1895 and is credited with saving the white rhino from extinction .
A sanctuary in the early 20th century when widespread butchery reduced numbers to a few dozen , Umfolozi has raised and released hundreds of white rhinos throughout southern Africa , helping to bolster numbers to more than 10,000 .
For 15 years ,
Anthony has been trying to convince five surrounding Zulu tribes to pool their land and form a new game reserve .
Called Royal Zulu , it would offer jobs and income through tourism , as well as securing the future of the region 's wildlife from creeping development .
" About 90 % of game reserves are still run on colonial lines with big fences and big guns , " he said .
" Those old days are over .
Conservation is only going to survive if we involve local communities . "
Zulus and other black people were excluded from reserves during colonial times and apartheid , he says .
" Children are growing up having never seen a giraffe or zebra . "
Anthony says poaching from Thula Thula has been controlled by showing the community the benefits tourists bring .
Poachers are tried in the local Zulu court by Nkosi Biyela , a disapproving tribal chief .
At his family home a few miles along the main road from Thula Thula , with a widescreen television showing tribal dances with the volume turned right up , the chief says : " I want to beat them [ the poachers ] .
I beat them a lot . "
Biyela , the great - great grandson of the famous chief , Mkhosana Kamvundlane , who rallied a Zulu army at the battle of Isandlwana , just before Rorke 's Drift , is an important supporter of the Royal Zulu reserve .
The land is better suited to wild animals than for farmed cattle or goat , he says , and they will not need expensive medicine .
Baghdad is n't Anthony 's only experience of working for wildlife in war zones .
In 2006 , he convinced the leaders of the Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) , which has fought a bloody struggle with the Ugandan government for more than two decades , to sign up to a conservation project to save one of the world 's rarest animals .
The LRA , notorious for its use of child soldiers and accused of atrocities including rape , mutilations and the mass murder of civilians , had taken up residence in the Garamba National Park , home to the last of the northern white rhino .
Only four northern white rhinos are thought to remain .
The LRA shot dead 12 of the park 's game rangers and then eight Guatemalan UN soldiers sent to the region to keep order .
" It was a desperate , impossible situation , " Anthony says .
" The UN withdrew from the area and the LRA controlled the park .
The fate of the rhino lay entirely in the hands of this rebel army .
If this species goes extinct they will be the largest land mammal to die out since the woolly mammoth . "
Anthony heard that LRA leaders were meeting the Ugandan government in Sudan and , with no visa and no invitation , gatecrashed the talks .
Ignoring warnings of a possible kidnap plot , he met the rebels on the banks of the White Nile river .
" When I explained there were only four rhinos left in the wild they were genuinely shocked .
They thought there were still hundreds of them . "
The LRA said the rhino was the totem of the largest tribe in their area , giving them an affinity with the animal .
When LRA officials signed a ceasefire with the Ugandan government , it included pledges to protect the endangered rhino and allow the park rangers to resume their work unmolested .
In late 2007 , Anthony visited the LRA senior leadership to discuss the rhino .
He spent several days living with Vincent Otti , LRA deputy commander , and addressed the military high command in their secret jungle camp , the first outsider ever to do so .
" We talked about rhinos and then for many hours about peace . "
The day after Anthony left the camp , Otti was killed .
The ceasefire has since collapsed , but Anthony says he was assured that protection for the rhino granted in the 2007 agreement is holding .
The apparent success , and the interest of international legal experts , has encouraged him to submit a draft resolution to the UN to request that animals in war zones , wild or captive , are given formal protection .
His direct approach does not please everyone .
Conservation and politics go hand in hand in Africa , and some conservationists from larger groups criticised Anthony 's contact with the LRA as dangerous meddling .
" When you do the sort of work I do , you 'll always get criticised , " he says .
" There are a lot of good [ conservation ] people out there who I look up to and respect .
But I do n't want to work with them .
In Baghdad I really learnt a bad lesson about some of the bigger groups and how they operate . "
Representatives of rival groups sent to help the zoo project squabbled over access to the dozens of film crews which , with the invasion over and insurgent violence yet to build , were short of stories .
Then there were the bunny huggers .
" Horrific people .
Crazy bunny huggers .
Guys who felt they were on a mission and if they died on their mission then their lives would have been worth it to save the tiger . "
After his return to South Africa , Anthony founded the Earth Organisation , a conservation group that encourages pragmatic local action .
" The focus is not on getting piles of members , but getting people who are going to do something . "
Anthony does hold controversial views of his own .
" I 've been a Scientologist for 40 years .
My sense of adventure and exploration is not limited to geographical areas .
It 's a subject which I find logical and sensible . "
He does not believe in the " aliens and all that " , but simply liked the way L Ron Hubbard described the concept of the survival of life .
" I very much got the thing that lifeforms are a special entity that are a combination of minerals , chemicals and God , or the lifeforce that animates them .
I like to see the world that way . "
Like many who spend their time in the bush , Anthony talks of a sense of connection with nature .
" There 's some sense that the animals have , and people who spend time with animals get better at tuning into it . "
It 's easy to dismiss such talk , until you see him with the elephants .
His elephants .
Thula Thula has a herd of former delinquent elephants which would otherwise have been shot for dangerous misbehaviour .
Anthony has worked to rehabilitate them , to the extent that they will even come when he calls .
He is convinced the animals , and Nana , the giant matriarch of the herd , in particular , know him .
When Nana gave birth , she brought her three - day - old calf to show off .
When Anthony had his first grandchild , he reciprocated .
Last month , we were granted a rare glimpse of the bond between Anthony and the herd .
We are deep in the African bush when Anthony cups his hands to his mouth and calls : " Come baba , come girls . "
The elephants were last sighted a mile or so away , and for 10 minutes there is silence .
Then , on the far side of a clearing , the trees rustle and the first giant grey head breaks above the bushes .
Another follows , pausing only to rip a branch from a tree .
Soon , as seven or eight of the herd approach , Anthony ushers us from open ground into the relative safety of the vehicle .
Within seconds , the animals are poking their trunks through the open windows , their wrinkled faces and eyelashed brown eyes just yards away .
We pull forward , and the elephants follow .
Only when Anthony guns the engine do they give up the chase .
" This is not a carnival or a circus , these are extremely dangerous wild elephants .
Nobody goes that close to wild elephants .
You just do n't do it , " Anthony says .
He has written a book called The Elephant Whisperer , to be published this summer , about his work .
He is keen to stress that the title refers not to him , but to the way Nana and the others respond .
" When the elephants come to me it is their decision .
It 's always their decision . "
People , he says , have lost a vital connection to animals .
And it could have dire consequences .
" Frogs are dying all over the world , bees are dying all over the world , and nobody gives a shit .
Who 's doing something ?
Why is it a boy from Zululand has to go to Baghdad to save animals ?
It 's the biggest zoo in the Middle East with hundreds and hundreds of exotic animals and nobody was interested .
Why do I have to go and see the bloody LRA ?
If I have to do this stuff then we really are screwed . "
His frustration has a hard , personal edge .
The day Anthony left Baghdad in 2003 , some American soldiers had a barbecue at the zoo .
Accounts differ on what happened , but what is known is that one soldier was drinking and put his hand too close to the cage that held Malooh , a Bengal tiger .
The animal , Anthony 's favourite , bit the soldier 's finger off and mauled his arm .
A second soldier took out his pistol and fired into the cage .
The tiger bled to death overnight .
" Can you believe it , after all the work we did ? "
He heard the news when he arrived home at Thula Thula .
The elephants were waiting at the gate .
March 3 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
Anarchists are typically not friends with the police .
This is both a practical matter of broken windows and broken bones , and also a theoretical one .
If your goal is a society without authority or hierarchy , where does such a hierarchical and authoritarian institution as a police force fit ?
Yet at the same time , such a suggestion often prompts a certain bewilderment in non-anarchists – how will crime be dealt with ?
How will order be maintained ?
A common response of course is to point out how much crime is a social product – most crimes are crimes against property , for a start , and most others are committed by people suffering from socially - constructed affliction like poverty or unemployment .
More generally , it is argued , hierarchy and alienation and a society that conspicuously works for the benefit of someone else are all likely to encourage anti-social modes of behaviour .
However , that response is unlikely to be the desired answer .
It may be true , and important , but it still leaves uncertainty about what could replace a police force in the case of whatever crime remained .
So let ’s ask , what is a police force for ?
I would suggest we can distinguish force broad functions : 1 ) the police meet force with force , 2 ) the police enforce other laws with force , 3 ) the police investigate crime and gather information , and 4 ) the police have a military role .
Now , of these roles , it seems to me that two , ( 2. and 4 . ) should be abolished .
By abolishing 2 . , I mean the idea that when people commit ‘ crimes ’ which are not themselves violent , non-violent methods of deterrence or punishment will usually be adequate : social ostracism , denial of privileges , refusal of services , etc .
In any society these things can be a substantial threat , but especially so in a technologically advanced society ( where we are more dependent upon the services of others ) and in a society with a strong sense of solidarity or community ( as opposed to a divided , bitter , alienating one ) .
By abolishing 4 . , I mean – well , I should explain what I mean by 4 .
I mean that often the police operate in an area where , despite their official role as ‘ defenders of society ’ , a substantial part of the population sees them as enemies .
Probably the most familiar ( even cliche ) example for Westerners is the way that police in ‘ the ghetto ’ operate as representatives not of the ( black ) community , but of the ( white ) government .
In such a situation , crime can prosper precisely because it is n’t really crime – it ’s not acting in defiance of society ’s rules , it ’s acting in accordance with the rules of ( at least much of ) local society , but defiance of the rules of the remote government .
Able to rely on such widespread public support , crime flourishes .
In such a situation , therefore , the police are not really even acting as police , but rather as an occupying army from a foreign country .
So when I suggest abolishing this role of the police , I mean to affirm a principle I have argued for at more length elsewhere – no military solutions to political problems .
If that many people are on the side of the criminals , the problem ( insofar as it is a ‘ problem ’ ) is a political disagreement between or within communities .
Trying to respond with force is thus inappropriate and counter - productive .
Anyway , that ’s those two roles gone .
That leaves two : force against force ( e.g. someone is trying to kill me , the police arrive to physically stop her ) , and information - gathering .
Now the information gathering , broadly speaking , is not necessarily a very hierarchical process – there ’s much less need for some people ( the police ) to have rights and powers that others lack ( like the right to hit people with sticks ) .
The police are n’t hugely different in this respect from private detectives , nor from auditors .
There may be issues around privacy and when people can demand to see some piece of information , but if this role were separated from role 1 , then I do n’t feel it would need a noticeably hierarchical body ( bear in mind also that information is likely to be much more freely available and public in a society of direct democracy and common ownership ) .
Which just leaves the hard kernel of picking up the stick when someone is being attacked .
And here , I would suggest , the simplest and most effective approach would be to seek to rely on people in general to provide this force .
In any fight between an anti-social violent individual and society , society has overwhelming force on its side ( unless the individual is either a superhero or a political conspirator with their own army ) .
Of course random passers by will often either not be there ( if you ’re attacked , for example , in your own home ) or will be unsuited to helping you ( if the assailant is large or armed , and they are small and not ) .
But this can be dealt with simply by having arrangements in place to ensure that at any one time there are people available to be called in .
Maybe not every single citizen need be on - call at some point ( people with very restricted mobility , for example , or a history of violence , might not be suitable ) but if some large chunk of people were ( 40 % or more ) then the result would be radically different from it being confined to a tiny specialised body .
The reason that tiny specialised body is needed is not that it ’s better at deploying force in the ( in any good society , fairly exceptional ) cases where that ’s needed , but that it ’s more useful politically .
It can be used for things that ordinary citizens are too unreliable to use for – such as functions 2 . and 4 . described above .
It has sometimes been suggested that if ordinary people were responsible for enforcing order and peace , there would be a risk of vigilante violence .
I think this is misplaced .
Assuming that there is a system of conflict resolution that protects individual rights and values impartiality , then someone beaten up by vigilantes can take them to court for it .
If every individual is essentially in the same position , then any individual has to act in a way that they are confident would be recognised by a jury as peace - seeking – using only the bare minimum of force necessary to suppress greater use of force .
Because when they and the other person go to court , they ’re on an equal footing .
What happens at the moment is the complete opposite .
The police can basically murder people for no reason and their risk of being tried for murder is miniscule .
They can be basically confident that the odd beating they dish out will have no consequences for them .
Anyone who is more scared of their average fellow citizens than of the police needs to read more about police brutality .

Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union - Tribune .

Ruben Navarrette says Mexico is n't a failed state , but the fate of its drug war is important for US .
SAN DIEGO , California ( CNN ) --
You may have heard the rumor that , as a result of a bloody drug war that has claimed more than 7,000 lives since January 2007 , Mexico is on the verge of being declared a " failed state . "
Drawing a lot of its oxygen from cable demagogues and talk radio , the chatter intensified several weeks ago when the Pentagon issued a report warning that our neighbor -- along with Pakistan , no less -- could face a " rapid and sudden " collapse because " the government , its politicians , police and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels . "
How 's this for pressure ?
The police chief in Ciudad Juarez resigned last week after drug traffickers began to make good on their promise to kill police officers in that city until the chief stepped down .
The Mexican drug war is the real deal , and so is the threat to both Mexico and the United States .
The casualties are mounting .
The killings are becoming more brutal , and now include the beheading of soldiers .
The cartels are essentially terrorizing the Mexican people in the hopes of convincing them to put pressure on the government to relent in its efforts to put the bad guys out of business .
Take it from someone who has known Mexican President Felipe Calderon since before he took the job -- back when we were in graduate school together nearly a decade ago -- that 's not going to happen .
Calderon was brave enough to take on the drug cartels by arresting their leaders , confiscating their product , and -- most importantly -- seizing the large shipments of cash that they need to operate .
And he 's smart enough to know that letting up on the pressure before the task is done would only make matters worse and basically hand Mexico over to the drug lords
Meanwhile , there is no question that Americans will pay a price if the drug violence spills over the border .
Just a few days ago , the U.S. State Department issued a blunt travel advisory warning Americans with plans to travel in Mexico to be extra careful .
" Recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small - unit combat , with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades , " the advisory reads .
" Large firefights have taken place in towns and cities ... and during some of these incidents , U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area . "
Firefights will put a crimp in the tourist industry .
But , Mexicans are quick to point out the irony .
Here Americans are worried about their safety in Mexico when one of the reasons the Mexican government is having such a difficult time fighting the drug cartels is because the enemy has plenty of money and guns .
And both are coming from the north .
According to most estimates , about 90 percent of all the cocaine flowing into the United States comes from Mexico and about 90 percent of the guns seized in drug - related violence come from the United States .
Former President George W. Bush and Congress deserve credit for pushing through $ 400 million in emergency aid in the Merida Initiative to help the Mexican government fight the cartels .
And even though Mexico is still waiting for delivery of most of those funds , there were signals this week that the Obama administration understands the stakes involved .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced new measures to prevent the violence from spreading to this side of the border and told Congress that the issue demands the " utmost attention . "
Attorney General Eric Holder called the drug cartels a " national security threat " to the United States and said Americans " simply can't afford to let down our guard . "
Even so , this business about Mexico on its way to being a " failed state " is just a lot of hot air .
The rumors of our neighbor 's demise have been greatly exaggerated .
A country of 110 million people , Mexico is still a functioning democracy with press freedoms and bold leaders , like Calderon , who are tackling the issue of drug violence head on .
There is plenty of reason for optimism .
Frankly , one reason the doomsday talk about Mexico catches on is because it distracts Americans from our own problems .
I learned a long time ago that , for many of my countrymen , Mexico serves a purpose in tough times by providing something to which we can feel superior .
Even with the banking bailouts , mortgage crisis , a plummeting stock market and rising unemployment , the thinking goes , we can at least be grateful that we 're not Mexico .
For Mexican - Americans like me , that 's cold comfort .
I expect a lot more of my country -- the United States -- than I do the country that my grandfather left behind a hundred years ago when he legally immigrated north .
And right now , what I expect is for all Americans to realize -- and for the Obama administration to never forget -- that it 's impossible to feel safe when there is a wildfire in the neighborhood .

* Illustration : Bryan Christie Design * ... A 16 - by 10.875 - inch rectangle containing precisely 174 square inches of possibility , made from two sheets of paper glued and bound together .
Legendary magazine art director and Pentagram partner D. J. Stout calls the science of filling this box with artful compositions of type and images " variations on a rectangle . "
That is , in any given issue of a magazine — this one , for example — subjects and stories will change , but as a designer , you 're still dealing with the same ol ' blank white box .
At Wired , our design team sees this constraint as our daily bread .
On every editorial page , we use words and pictures to overcome the particular restrictions of paper and ink :
We can't animate the infographics ( yet ) .
We can't embed video or voice - over ( yet ) .
We can't add sound effects or music ( yet ) .
But for all that we can't do in this static medium , we find enlightenment and wonder in its possibilities .
This is a belief most designers share .
In fact , the worst thing a designer can hear is an offhand " Just do whatever you want . "
That 's because designers understand the power of limits .
Constraint offers an unparalleled opportunity for growth and innovation .
Think of a young tree , a sapling .
With water and sunshine , it can grow tall and strong .
But include some careful pruning early in its development — removing low - hanging branches — and the tree will grow taller , stronger , faster .
It wo n't waste precious resources on growth that does n't serve its ultimate purpose .
The same principle applies to design .
Given fewer resources , you have to make better decisions .
For proof , just consider these cultural and technological high points of the last century : Piet Mondrian helped usher in modernism by limiting himself to 90 - degree angles and primary colors .
Miles Davis conceived Kind of Blue without the use of a single chord .
More recently , the very iPhone on which you listen to Davis ' landmark album is a one - buttoned example of restraint in pursuit of an ideal , while the sublimely simple Google homepage is forever limited to 28 words .
The idea of operating within constraints — of making more with less — is especially relevant these days .
From Wall Street to Detroit to Washington , the lack of limits has proven to be a false freedom .
With all the economic gloom , you might not be blamed for feeling that the boundless American frontier seems a little less expansive .
But design teaches us that this is our hour of opportunity .
In the following pages , we explore a few of our favorite constraints .
In each case , the imposition of limits does n't stifle creativity — it enables it .

A few tents cropped up hard by the railroad tracks , pitched by men left with nowhere to go once the emergency winter shelter closed for the summer .
Then others appeared — people who had lost their jobs to the ailing economy , or newcomers who had moved to Reno for work and discovered no one was hiring .
Within weeks , more than 150 people were living in tents big and small , barely a foot apart in a patch of dirt slated to be a parking lot for a campus of shelters Reno is building for its homeless population .
Like many other cities , Reno has found itself with a " tent city " — an encampment of people who had nowhere else to go .
From Seattle to Athens , Ga. , homeless advocacy groups and city agencies are reporting the most visible rise in homeless encampments in a generation .

JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - Greenpeace has blocked three tankers due to transport crude palm oil to China and Europe from leaving an Indonesian port in a bid to highlight deforestation caused by the cash crop , the environmental group said on Monday .
The rapidly expanding palm oil industry in Southeast Asia has come under attack by green groups for destroying rainforests and wildlife , as well the emission of greenhouse gases .
The blocked ships included Gran Couve , owned by the world ’s largest listed palm oil firm Wilmar International Ltd , which had been loading 27,000 tons of crude palm oil bound for Rotterdam , said Bustar Maitar , Greenpeace Southeast Asia , Forest Campaigner .
The other two ships blocked at the port of Dumai in Sumatra were Smooth Sea , owned by PT Musim Mas , and Victory Prima , owned by Sarana Tempa Perkasa , he said .
Greenpeace has used the tactic of seeking to block palm oil tankers previously in Indonesia , the world ’s biggest palm oil producer , in a bid to protest environmental concerns .
Maitar said by telephone that Greenpeace was using three rubber boats for the protest and said an activist was climbing onto the anchor of the ship Gran Couve to try and stop it departing .
Port administration officials in Dumai contacted by Reuters could not immediately confirm whether the ships were blocked .
What is the Sixth Zapatista Declaration ?
A Bit of History as the “ Other Campaign ” Begins in the City of San Cristóbal de las Casas
By Concepción Villafuerte
From Chiapas
The sixth comes before the seventh and after the fifth .
What was the Fifth Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle ?
Few remember , but the history of the Zapatistas is written through the declarations that the EZLN ( Zapatista Army of National Liberation ) has released , beginning with the first : the declaration of war .
The second : a call to civil society .
The third : a call for the creation of a National Liberation Movement .
The fourth : the formation of the Zapatista National Liberation Front .
The fifth : the Consulta Nacional , the great dialog with all Mexicans except the government .
And now , the Sixth , the initiation of the “ Other Campaign , ” the political struggle that exists outside the electoral farce .
In the words of Subcomandante Marcos , “ Together , we ’re going to shake this country up from below , lift it up , and stand it on its head . ”
Mexico ’s geographic shape resembles a cornucopia , the mythological “ Horn of Plenty , ” but in reverse ; the horn ’s fruits tumble out toward the United States of America , toward the gringos .
It is a funnel shape , the top wide and the bottom thin .
Chiapas is the country ’s “ last frontier , ” the north being its “ first ” one .
But on the other hand , Chiapas forms the crown of Central America , the beginning of the great nation ; Chiapas is a strategic point for North American business .
The Sixth Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle proposes realizing a national campaign for the building of another way of doing politics , for a program of national leftwing struggle , and for a new Constitution .
In order to understand what this will entail , one must review the Sixth Declaration ’s twelve pages , which narrate briefly the history of the EZLN , its sufferings , its achievements , its hopes and its dreams .
Later , they relate the state of the insurgent army ’s structure , which has divided itself into three parts .
First , most of the Zapatistas will guard , support and defend the autonomy of the Zapatista villages .
This is the General Command of the CCRI , ( Revolutionary Indigenous Clandestine Committee ) .
Second , another part of the CCRI will be the “ Intergalactic Commission , ” which will take charge of the international aspects of the campaign , while a third will take charge of the national aspects .
This third group has been named the “ Sixth Commission of the EZLN , ” and it is Subcomandante Marcos who , starting July 13 , has led this fraction of the EZLN .
How will they carry out this “ Other Campaign ? ”
Principally , by listening .
That essential part of the six preparatory meetings in the Lacandon Jungle will continue throughout the country .
The Sixth Commission will listen , and in that way it will learn and value the real situation in the country .
Contrary to what partisan candidates do — hauling out a load of people ; buying them off with promises so that they listen to the candidates ’ speeches and , of course , cast their vote next July 2 ; piling on the demagogic rhetoric — Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos will just listen .
That is a different way of doing politics .
Later , in the same Declaration , the Zapatistas say : “ What we are going to do is ask you how your lives are going , your fight , your thoughts about how our country is doing and about what we can do so that they do n’t defeat us .
What we are going to do is listen to your thoughts , those of the simple and humble people , and maybe we will find there the same love that we have for our country . ”
Later , the document relates , simply , what they are going to do .
It demonstrates with examples how they will evoke solidarity , true solidarity , with their resistance all around the world and in this way begin listening , finding points of agreement , and building a “ national program of struggle ” that they will follow through on .
And nearly at the end of the Sixth Declaration , the Zapatistas proclaim , “ No to trying to resolve from above the problems of our Nation , but , rather , they must construct FROM BELOW AND FOR BELOW an alternative to neoliberal destruction , an alternative of the left for Mexico . ”
Finally , they propose brotherhood , support for resistance struggles , mutual respect , and an exchange of experiences , stories , ideas , and dreams …
The “ Other Campaign ” Kicks Off
The Other Campaign begins January 1 , 2006 , and its first phase will conclude on June 25 of the same year .
This latter date coincides with the closing of official electoral campaigns , as this will be an election year in Mexico for the president , congressmen , senators , and , in some states ( including Chiapas ) , governors .
That ’s why it ’s called “ the Other Campaign , ” in parallel to the electoral campaigns of the main political parties .
The PRD ( Party of the Democratic Revolution ) , a leftwing party that has been severely questioned by Subcomandante Marcos , will put forward its only candidate , Andrés Manuel López Obrador .
The PRI ( Institutional Revolutionary Party ) , a losing party after 70 years in power , the party of the “ perfect dictatorship ” as Vagas Llosa called it , will have Roberto Madrazo Pinado , a priista of dubious reputation in every sense and friend of the country ’s top fraudulent bankers , as its presidential candidate .
And the conservative PAN ( National Action Party ) has the very mediocre Felipe Calderón , who was not the first choice of current president Vicente Fox , but was supported by his party .
Not one of the three candidates is worthwhile .
Within this frame of reference , of the doubtful credibility of the political campaigns , “ Delegate Zero ’s ” Other Campaign will be the counterweight .
Nobody can foresee what will come of it all .
And so , the Other Campaign kicks off on January 1 in colonial San Cristóbal de las Casas , the city that was taken over on January 1 , 1994 by some two thousand masked , armed , and defiant indigenous men and women , who from the balcony of city hall sent their message of war to the federal government .
Twelve years later , with their numbers multiplied , it is hoped that they return peacefully to take to take the streets and avenues of this small city that , due to winter vacations , is full of Mexican and foreign tourists , in addition to the adherents to “ the Sixth ” who could pay for the trip to be present for the start of the Other Campaign from the cathedral plaza of this city .
There is no advance information , just like 1994 .
We journalists must wait to see what happens ; nobody knows , and if they do , they ca n’t say .
But the rumors have been flying for some time in this little corner of the world , from which the First Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle was first read .
That declaration of war is still in effect , as the peace accords were never fulfilled despite the federal government having signed them with the EZLN ’s guerilla leaders .
The guerillas were not content with a mere signature ; they demanded the fulfillment of the San Andrés Accords that the government froze in a single amendment to the Mexican Constitution , for “ the development of the Indian peoples . ”
The San Andrés Accords deserved a profound constitutional reform , a nearly total change in order to give life and the right to life to the country ’s Indian peoples , rather than simply reducing them to a declaration of “ development . ”
Here in San Cristóbal de Las Casa , the first talks were held in the Cathedral .
The fact that Bishop Samuel Ruiz García , or Tatic as the indigenous call him , had proposed and accepted that then - President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ’s representative and the Zapatista delegation headed by Subcomandante Marcos meet to negotiate peace accords in the San Cristóbal Cathedral , was denounced as an outrage to authentic “ Coletos ” ( a local name for the city ’s conservative non-indigenous community ) .
These unleashed their fury by creating a spontaneous , short - lived organization that never had a formal structure , led by then - Mayor Jorge Mario Lescieur Talavera .
The violent group attacked the Bishop ’s house a year later , threatening to burn it down .
At that time , current Mayor Sergio Lobato García was among Lescieur Talavera ’s followers , and he drank a good quantity of alcohol that night to give him the strength and courage to shout incoherencies in front of the Cathedral .
These passages , now part of history , will repeat themselves , but in a different form .
Now this spoiled , rude drunk is mayor of the city founded by conquistador Diego de Mazariegos , and tried to make amends with an homage to Bishop Samuel .
The same mayor today offers “ security and sanitation ” for participants in the Zapatista march ; two days before the marchers ’ arrival the city had installed water dispensers , latrines , and a dozen street sweepers , so that the Zapatistas would n’t leave any litter .
While the mayor put on this unimaginative show of offering “ security ” to the twenty or thirty thousand indigenous that could arrive , a lower - level official , tourism director Marco Antonio Santiago , told the press that the Zapatista march will affect tourism and that “ there is a very strong rumor … the question the people have is what is going to happen on January 1 , the beginning of the march , which will hopefully be peaceful and calm … this has been a very important factor in people not coming to San Cristóbal in these days … ”
Nevertheless , the five - star hotels are all filled , there are no vacancies — even the no-star hotels are full .
There are Mexican and international tourists , there are journalists on assignment ; obviously there are government agents and the usual zapateurs , and all those who have arrived by any means possible and will be present .
The Coletos , the city ’s inhabitants , are n’t saying anything , they ’re just wanting for the Zapatistas to arrive , get set up , have their demonstration and leave , as they have done on many earlier occasions .
There has not been ( among the general population of San Cristobal ) much commotion in expectation of the arrival of Delegate Zero .
The march began in the community known as La Garrucha , in the rebel municipality of Francisco Gómez , seat of the Good Government Council for the Tzeltal region .
The official name of the municipality is Ocosingo , and it is one of the gates to the Lacandon Jungle .
The Caravan accompanying Delegate Zero is scheduled to arrive sometime during the day .
It is expected sometime in the afternoon , but they have n’t specified , they ca n’t specify , the road is so difficult to travel that the same trip can last four or twelve hours ( or more in the case of a caravan , as a single car breaking down can make everyone stop ) .
In the first caravan that visited the jungle on August 7 , 1994 , when civil society was invited to hold the National Democratic Convention in Guadelupe Tepeyac , the first village to receive the six thousand delegates from across the country , it was democratic insanity ; democracy obliged all those present to get covered in mud , as the floor sank after the baptizing downpour that sent off the Ship that would travel through the sky , the imaginary ship the Zapatista built between the two hills of the jungle airfield where the first Aguascalientes was christened .
That madness of trying to travel a road full of gaps and holes with 40 - passenger busses lasted 24 hours .
On the trip back , everyone left in any way he or she could .
That was the EZLN ’s first attempt at organizing the unorganized , at bringing together the sectarians , at joining people together and making them respect each others ’ differences ; that was twelve years ago .
Now , the Other Campaign is once again drawing out the more measured , less adventurous opinions of some intellectuals , though those still interested are few and those who speak out even fewer .
Not because Zapatismo has been extinguished , but because it is not easy to talk about lightly .
Neither can these academics carry out detailed studies because the Zapatistas wo n’t let them .
It ’s not that they change their ways , it ’s just that they are very simple , very practical , and do n’t deal in hypocrisy , and so there is no way to make political analysis of them .
The simply speak and what they say is true and that ’s all there is .
That ’s how the autonomous governments of the 38 municipalities finish their communiqués — they say what they have to say and conclude , that ’s all .
We ’re not like that , we mestizos , we always complicate things .
The Coletos , descendants of an ancestral mixing of peoples , born in a city founded by Spanish conquistadors who arrived in the Jovel valley accompanied by Indians from other parts of Mexico , installed themselves and created a feudal city .
The Royal City is now called San Cristóbal de las Casas for the first Bishop that arrived to Christianize the Indians and then became their biggest ally but was , just like Bishop Samuel Ruiz , attacked and defamed by those Coletos who had descended from the conquistadors .
In this city , which has tripled in size since 1994 , irregular human settlements inhabited by people from all over the world have been set up .
Some come to do business , some come for adventure , but most come simply to survive .
Indigenous neighborhoods in the north of the city , mostly made up of Chamulas expelled for apparently religious reasons ( being dissidents from Catholic tradition ) but also political dissidents , have existed since 1974 , twenty years before Zapatismo .
In the 1940s , after the government of General Lázaro Cárdenas , the Indians began to exist as persons in government policy .
This change was spurred by Cárdenas ’ pro-indigenous government , but it was also the beginning of the compromising of indigenous leaders by mestizo ones .
This may seem like a separate story , but it is the same , the same story that has been going on since October 12 , 1492 , when the Spanish discovered América and called its inhabitants Indians , and since March 31 , 1528 , when the conquistadors under the command of Diego de Mazariegos founded this city with centuries of history barely known to its current residents .
Now this city has returned to the center of the country ’s history .
In 1994 began the indigenous uprising , which the politicians and political scientists expected to die within twelve days .
Twelve years have passed and the Indians remain , intact , complete , perhaps greater in number , because in twelve years at least six children will have been born to each of the ’ 94 Zapatistas … and so they will not die but rather keep moving forward .
Now the challenge is before the entire country , and later the whole world , and later …
The story of the last six months begins here , with the Red Alert .
This Alert did indeed alarm many .
When the EZLN declared itself in “ red alert , ” there was uncertainty , a lack of confidence , puzzlement on the part of the government , suspense … .
The EZLN cleared things up a few days later , announcing that the Alert was simply issued in order to bring all their troops together safely .
There was some relief , but later came a series of communiqués ( 1,2,3,4 ) revealing the group ’s positions , finally concluding with the Sixth Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle .

Each software patent blocks software developers from implementing a feature such as a video format , pinch - to - zoom , or nested menus .
For 20 years , no developer can implement that feature without asking the patent holder , who can refuse , or ask for payment and impose conditions .
Today there are tens of thousands of software patents and this harms everyone , because everyone uses software :
Software patents block standards , leading to incompatibility .
If you ca n’t view a video , if a document does n’t look right on your computer , or if two software packages do n’t work well together , it ’s often because a patent prohibits the software developer from making that feature work correctly .
Software patents block individuals from taking part in the development and distribution of software .
This may not seem relevant to most people but it ’s the same as the freedom to write a book .
Most people will never write a book , but some people will , and society as a whole benefits from what is made by the few people who do write books or develop software .
Software patents create legal and financial risks that most companies can’t afford .
The result is monopolies or only two or three companies being active in a given domain .
Software users are left with very little choice , and because the patent - owning software companies know that the users are locked in , there is little incentive to respond to complaints from the users .
What ESP is doing
The End Software Patents ( ESP ) campaign has three focusses :
Wiki :
With more than 600 articles , the ESP wiki ( en.swpat.org ) is the info resource for campaigns against software patents worldwide .
It ’s a public wiki and you ’re very welcome to edit it .
Activism :
When government bodies hold consultations , they generally only inform the patent industries about these consultations .
If we do n’t get involved then governments will think that no one objects to software patents .
ESP regularly searches for new and ongoing consultations , and then contacts local software groups and helps them get involved .
If you know of a consultation anywhere in the world , contact us !
To join in or start a local campaign , join our mailing lists or ask for a list to be made for your region
ESP has already been active on procedures in the USA , the EU , Australia , New Zealand , Brazil , Israel , and Canada as well as the international ACTA treaty proposal .

Why this matters
Every company is in the software business , which means that every company has software liability .
We estimate costs of $ 11.2 billion a year due to software patent suits ( see our 2008 State of Softpatents report ) , and not just by Microsoft and IBM — The Green Bay Packers , Kraft Foods , and Ford Motor are facing software patent infringement lawsuits for their use of the standard software necessary for running a modern business .
Software innovation happens without government intervention .
Virtually all of the technologies you use now were developed before software was widely viewed as patentable .
The Web , email , your word processor and spreadsheet program , instant messaging , or even more technical features like the psychoacoustic encoding and Huffman compression underlying the MP3 standard — all of it was originally developed by enthusiastic programmers , many of whom have formed successful business around such software , none of whom asked the government for a monopoly .
So if software authors have a proven track - record of innovation without patents , why force them to use patents ?
What is the gain from billions of dollars in patent litigation ?
Change is happening now .
The 2008 ruling of the appeals court of the US Federal Circuit on the case in re Bilski narrowed the scope of what is patentable .
Some experts even question if software patents are still valid at all in the US .
ESP , under the direction of Ben Klemens , played a key role in this case .
See our resources for lawyers page for details .
This site is an overview of how courts self - expanded their jurisdiction to include software despite the protests of practitioners such as Bill Gates or Adobe Microsystems , of the economic damage done , how the story is evolving today , and how your company can help to restore the software market to a world run by innovators , not judges .
When I think of England , I think castles .
The first thing a lot of people think about England is castles and medieval fortresses .
Despite England ’s fame for castles , there are n’t actually that many that have survived intact .
I ’ve always dreamed of owning a castle .
Who has n’t ?
But I know that ’s very unlikely with the way the British jealously protect their heritage .
Not to mention the fact that a castle would cost millions upon millions of dollars to purchase !
I ’ve decided to put together a list of my favorite castles in England ( lists for Scotland and Wales are forthcoming ) .
The list is completely arbitrary based on my tastes .
I ’ve only been to two of them myself ( Windsor and Tower of London ) ( since publishing this in 2009 , we ’ve since been to several of these castles ) .
I must give credit where credit is due and I ’d like to thank the Wikipedia for providing such fantastically interesting trivia !
Save for two , all the pictures are from wonderful photographers on Flickr who were willing to share their pictures .
It was a ton of fun to do the research for this post .
I hope you guys enjoy it !
Feel free to tell me about your favorite castles in the comments !
The Top 16 Best Castles in England
Warwick Castle
Photo From Flickr
Wikipedia Description :
Warwick Castle is a medieval castle in Warwick , the county town of Warwickshire , England .
It sits on a cliff overlooking a bend in the River Avon.
Warwick Castle was built by William the Conqueror in 1068 within or adjacent to Anglo - Saxon burh of Warwick .
It was used as a fortification until the early 17th century , when Sir Fulke Greville converted it to a country house .
It was owned by the Greville family , who became earls of Warwick in 1759 , until 1978 .
From 1088 , the castle traditionally belonged to the Earl of Warwick , and it served as a symbol of his power .
The castle was taken in 1153 by Henry of Anjou , later Henry II .
It has been used to hold prisoners , including some from the Battle of Poitiers in the 14th century .
Under the ownership of Richard Neville – also known as “ Warwick the Kingmaker ” – Warwick Castle was used in the 15th century to imprison the English king , Edward IV .
Warwick Castle has been compared with Windsor Castle in terms of scale , cost , and status .
Since its construction in the 11th century , the castle has undergone structural changes with additions of towers and redesigned residential buildings .
Originally a wooden motte - and - bailey , it was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century .
During the Hundred Years
War , the facade opposite the town was refortified , resulting in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th century military architecture .
In the 17th century the grounds were turned into a garden .
Warwick Castle was purchased by The Tussauds Group in 1978 and opened as a tourist attraction .
It is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade I listed building .

Tower of London
Tower of London
Wikipedia Description :
Her Majesty ’s Royal Palace and Fortress , more commonly known as the Tower of London ( and historically as The Tower ) , is a historic monument in central London , England , on the north bank of the River Thames .
It is located within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and is separated from the eastern edge of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill .
The Tower of London is often identified with the White Tower , the original stark square fortress built by William the Conqueror in 1078 .
However , the tower as a whole is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat .
The tower ’s primary function was a fortress , a royal palace , and a prison ( particularly for high status and royal prisoners , such as the Princes in the Tower and the future Queen Elizabeth I ) .
This last use has led to the phrase “ sent to the Tower ” ( meaning “ imprisoned ” ) .
It has also served as a place of execution and torture , an armoury , a treasury , a zoo , the Royal Mint , a public records office , an observatory , and since 1303 , the home of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom .

Bodiam Castle is a quadrangular castle located near Robertsbridge in East Sussex , England .
It is said to be a perfect example of a late medieval moated castle .
While not large enough to garrison many soldiers , the castle was ideally suited for defense against a militant rural populace after the English Peasants ’
Revolt and for the entertainment of foreign merchants or dignitaries .
It was built in 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge , a former knight of Edward III , supposedly at the request of Richard II in order to defend the surrounding area from French invasion .
By 1434 Sir Edward Dalyngrigge ’s nephew Richard was living in the castle .
[ 1 ]
Recent research suggests that the castle was built more for show than as an effective defence .
There is evidence supporting that research , as the walls of Bodiam Castle are only a couple of feet thick .

Windsor Castle
Wikipedia Description :
Windsor Castle , in Windsor in the English county of Berkshire , is the largest inhabited castle in the world and , dating back to the time of William the Conqueror , is the oldest in continuous occupation .
The castle ’s floor area is approximately 484,000 square feet ( 44,965 square metres ) .
Together with Buckingham Palace in London and Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh , it is one of the principal official residences of the British monarch .
Queen Elizabeth
II spends many weekends of the year at the castle , using it for both state and private entertaining .
Her other two residences , Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle , are the Royal Family ’s private homes .
Most of the Kings and Queens of England , later Kings and Queens of Great Britain , and later still kings and queens of the Commonwealth realms , have had a direct influence on the construction and evolution of the castle , which has been their garrison fortress , home , official palace , and sometimes their prison .
The castle ’s history and that of the British monarchy are inextricably linked .
Chronologically the history of the castle can be traced through the reigns of the monarchs who have occupied it .
When the country has been at peace , the castle has been expanded by the additions of large and grand apartments ; when the country has been at war , the castle has been more heavily fortified .
This pattern has continued to the present day .

Wikipedia Description :
St Michael ’s Mount is a tidal island located 366 m ( 400 yd ) off the Mount ’s Bay coast of Cornwall , United Kingdom .
It is united with Marazion by a man-made causeway , passable only at mid to low tide , made of granite setts .
The island exhibits a combination of slate and granite .
Its Cornish language name â€ ” literally , “ the grey rock in the wood ” â€ ” may represent a folk memory of a time before Mount ’s Bay was flooded .
Certainly , the Cornish name would be an accurate description of the Mount set in woodland .
Remains of trees have been seen at low tides following storms on the beach at Perranuthnoe .
The Cornish legend of Lyonesse , an ancient kingdom said to have extended from Penwith toward the Isles of Scilly , also talks of land being inundated by the sea .
Historically , St Michael ’s Mount was a Cornish counterpart of Mont Saint Michel in Normandy , France .
St Michael ’s
Mount is known colloquially by locals as simply the Mount .
The chapel is extra-diocesan , and the castle is the official residence of Lord St Levan .
Many relics , chiefly armour and antique furniture , are preserved in the castle .
The chapel of St Michael , a fifteenth century building , has an embattled tower , in one angle of which is a small turret , which served for the guidance of ships .
Chapel Rock , on the beach , marks the site of a shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary , where pilgrims paused to worship before ascending the Mount .
A few houses are built on the hillside facing Marazion , and a spring supplies them with water .

Wikipedia Description :
Stokesay Castle , located at Stokesay , a mile south of the town of Craven Arms , in South Shropshire , is the oldest fortified manor house in England , dating to the 12th century .
It is currently in the hands of English Heritage .
It is a Grade I listed building .
The origins of this Stoke , or “ dairy farm ” , go back to the Conquest , when the manor was part of the vast holdings in the West of England granted to the family of Lacy .
By 1115 , it had been regranted to Theodoric de Say , of Sai in Normandy , and Stoke Lacy became Stokesay , but the main construction was undertaken by Laurence of Ludlow , based in Shrewsbury , the richest local wool merchant of his generation , who acquired Stokesay in 1281 .

Wikipedia Description :
Skipton Castle is situated within the town of Skipton , North Yorkshire , England .
The castle has been preserved for over 900 years , built in 1090 by Robert de Romille , a Norman baron .
The castle has stood for 900 years , first built as a Motte and Bailey castle in 1090 by Robert de Romille , a Norman baron .
The castle was soon replaced with a stone keep as the old Motte and Bailey constructed was not enough to withstand the attacks from the Scots to the north .
In 1310 , Edward II granted the property of the castle to Robert Clifford who was appointed Lord Clifford of Skipton and Guardian of Craven .
Robert Clifford ordered many improvements to the fortifications of the castle but died in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 when the improvements were barely complete .
During the English Civil War it was the only remaining Royalist stronghold in the north of England until December 1645 .
After a 3 year siege , a surrender was negotiated in 1645 between Oliver Cromwell and the Royalists .
Oliver Cromwell ordered the removal of the castle roofs .
Skipton remained the Cliffords ’ principal seat until 1676 .
Lady Anne Clifford ( 1590 - 1676 ) was the last Clifford to own Skipton castle .
After the 3 year siege , she ordered repairs and as a commemoration she planted a yew tree in the central courtyard to mark the Castle ’s repair from the English Civil War .
Today it stands as one of the most preserved medieval castles in England and is both a tourist attraction and a private residence .

NOBODY WAS BETTER PREPARED FOR THE GLOBAL market crash than clients of Ray Dalio 's Bridgewater Associates and subscribers to its Daily Observations .
Dalio , the chief investment officer and all - around guiding light of the global money - management company he founded more than 30 years ago , began sounding alarms in Barron 's in the spring of 2007 about the dangers of excessive financial leverage .
He counts among his clients world governments and central banks , as well as pension funds and endowments .
" The regulators have to decide how banks will operate .
That means they are going to have to nationalize some in some form . " -- Ray Dalio Matthew Furman for Barron's
No wonder .
The Westport , Conn .- based firm , whose analyses of world markets focus on credit and currencies , has produced long - term annual returns , net of fees , averaging 15 % .
In the turmoil of 2008 , Bridgewater 's Pure Alpha 1 fund gained 8.7 % net of fees and Pure Alpha 2 delivered 9.4 % .
Here 's what 's on his mind now .
Barron's : I can't think of anyone who was earlier in describing the deleveraging and deflationary process that has been happening around the world .
Dalio :
Let 's call it a " D - process , " which is different than a recession , and the only reason that people really do n't understand this process is because it happens rarely .
Everybody should , at this point , try to understand the depression process by reading about the Great Depression or the Latin American debt crisis or the Japanese experience so that it becomes part of their frame of reference .
Most people did n't live through any of those experiences , and what they have gotten used to is the recession dynamic , and so they are quick to presume the recession dynamic .
It is very clear to me that we are in a D - process .
Why are you hesitant to emphasize either the words depression or deflation ?
Why call it a D - process ?
Both of those words have connotations associated with them that can confuse the fact that it is a process that people should try to understand .
You can describe a recession as an economic retraction which occurs when the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy normally to fight inflation .
The cycle continues until the economy weakens enough to bring down the inflation rate , at which time the Federal Reserve eases monetary policy and produces an expansion .
We can make it more complicated , but that is a basic simple description of what recessions are and what we have experienced through the post - World War II period .
What you also need is a comparable understanding of what a D - process is and why it is different .
You have made the point that only by understanding the process can you combat the problem .
Are you confident that we are doing what 's essential to combat deflation and a depression ?
The D - process is a disease of sorts that is going to run its course .
When I first started seeing the D - process and describing it , it was before it actually started to play out this way .
But now you can ask yourself , OK , when was the last time bank stocks went down so much ?
When was the last time the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve , or any central bank , exploded like it has ?
When was the last time interest rates went to zero , essentially , making monetary policy as we know it ineffective ?
When was the last time we had deflation ?
The answers to those questions all point to times other than the U.S. post -World War II experience .
This was the dynamic that occurred in Japan in the '90s , that occurred in Latin America in the ' 80s , and that occurred in the Great Depression in the '30s .
Basically what happens is that after a period of time , economies go through a long - term debt cycle -- a dynamic that is self - reinforcing , in which people finance their spending by borrowing and debts rise relative to incomes and , more accurately , debt - service payments rise relative to incomes .
At cycle peaks , assets are bought on leverage at high - enough prices that the cash flows they produce are n't adequate to service the debt .
The incomes are n't adequate to service the debt .
Then begins the reversal process , and that becomes self - reinforcing , too .
In the simplest sense , the country reaches the point when it needs a debt restructuring .
General Motors is a metaphor for the United States .
As goes GM , so goes the nation ?
The process of bankruptcy or restructuring is necessary to its viability .
One way or another , General Motors has to be restructured so that it is a self - sustaining , economically viable entity that people want to lend to again .
This has happened in Latin America regularly .
Emerging countries default , and then restructure .
It is an essential process to get them economically healthy .
We will go through a giant debt - restructuring , because we either have to bring debt - service payments down so they are low relative to incomes -- the cash flows that are being produced to service them -- or we are going to have to raise incomes by printing a lot of money .
It is n't complicated .
It is the same as all bankruptcies , but when it happens pervasively to a country , and the country has a lot of foreign debt denominated in its own currency , it is preferable to print money and devalue .
Is n't the process of restructuring under way in households and at corporations ?
They are cutting costs to service the debt .
But they have n't yet done much restructuring .
Last year , 2008 , was the year of price declines ; 2009 and 2010 will be the years of bankruptcies and restructurings .
Loans will be written down and assets will be sold .
It will be a very difficult time .
It is going to surprise a lot of people because many people figure it is bad but still expect , as in all past post - World War II periods , we will come out of it OK .
A lot of difficult questions will be asked of policy makers .
The government decision - making mechanism is going to be tested , because different people will have different points of view about what should be done .
What are you suggesting ?
An example is the Federal Reserve , which has always been an autonomous institution with the freedom to act as it sees fit .
Rep. Barney Frank [ a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee ] is talking about examining the authority of the Federal Reserve , and that raises the specter of the government and Congress trying to run the Federal Reserve .
Everybody will be second - guessing everybody else .
So where do things stand in the process of restructuring ?
What the Federal Reserve has done and what the Treasury has done , by and large , is to take an existing debt and say they will own it or lend against it .
But they have n't said they are going to write down the debt and cut debt payments each month .
There has been little in the way of debt relief yet .
Very , very few actual mortgages have been restructured .
Very little corporate debt has been restructured .
The Federal Reserve , in particular , has done a number of successful things .
The Federal Reserve went out and bought or lent against a lot of the debt .
That has had the effect of reducing the risk of that debt defaulting , so that is good in a sense .
And because the risk of default has gone down , it has forced the interest rate on the debt to go down , and that is good , too .
However , the reason it has n't actually produced increased credit activity is because the debtors are still too indebted and not able to properly service the debt .
Only when those debts are actually written down will we get to the point where we will have credit growth .
There is a mortgage debt piece that will need to be restructured .
There is a giant financial - sector piece -- banks and investment banks and whatever is left of the financial sector -- that will need to be restructured .
There is a corporate piece that will need to be restructured , and then there is a commercial - real - estate piece that will need to be restructured .
Is a restructuring of the banks a starting point ?
If you think that restructuring the banks is going to get lending going again and you do n't restructure the other pieces -- the mortgage piece , the corporate piece , the real - estate piece -- you are wrong , because they need financially sound entities to lend to , and that wo n't happen until there are restructurings .
On the issue of the banks , ultimately we need banks because to produce credit we have to have banks .
A lot of the banks are n't going to have money , and yet we can't just let them go to nothing ; we have got to do something .
But the future of banking is going to be very , very different .
The regulators have to decide how banks will operate .
That means they will have to nationalize some in some form , but they are going to also have to decide who they protect : the bondholders or the depositors ?
Nationalization is the most likely outcome ?
There will be substantial nationalization of banks .
It is going on now and it will continue .
But the same question will be asked even after nationalization :
What will happen to the pile of bad stuff ?
Let 's say we are going to end up with the good - bank / bad - bank concept .
The government is going to put a lot of money in -- say $ 100 billion -- and going to get all the garbage at a leverage of , let 's say , 10 to 1 .
They will have a trillion dollars , but a trillion dollars ' worth of garbage .
They still are n't marking it down .
Does this give you comfort ?
Then we have the remaining banks , many of which will be broke .
The government will have to recapitalize them .
The government will try to seek private money to go in with them , but I do n't think they are going to come up with a lot of private money , not nearly the amount needed .
To the extent we are going to have nationalized banks , we will still have the question of how those banks behave .
Does Congress say what they should do ?
Does Congress demand they lend to bad borrowers ?
There is a reason they are n't lending .
So whose money is it , and who is protecting that money ?
The biggest issue is that if you look at the borrowers , you do n't want to lend to them .
The basic problem is that the borrowers had too much debt when their incomes were higher and their asset values were higher .
Now net worths have gone down .
Let me give you an example .
Roughly speaking , most of commercial real estate and a good deal of private equity was bought on leverage of 3 - to - 1 .
Most of it is down by more than one - third , so therefore they have negative net worth .
Most of them could n't service their debt when the cash flows were up , and now the cash flows are a lot lower .
If you should n't have lent to them before , how can you possibly lend to them now ?
I guess I 'm thinking of the examples of people and businesses with solid credit records who can't get banks to lend to them .
Those examples exist , but they are n't , by and large , the big picture .
There are too many nonviable entities .
Big pieces of the economy have to become somehow more viable .
This is n't primarily about a lack of liquidity .
There are certainly elements of that , but this is basically a structural issue .
The '30s were very similar to this .
By the way , in the bear market from 1929 to the bottom , stocks declined 89 % , with six rallies of returns of more than 20 % -- and most of them produced renewed optimism .
But what happened was that the economy continued to weaken with the debt problem .
The Hoover administration had the equivalent of today 's TARP [ Troubled Asset Relief Program ] in the Reconstruction Finance Corp .
The stimulus program and tax cuts created more spending , and the budget deficit increased .
At the same time , countries around the world encountered a similar kind of thing .
England went through then exactly what it is going through now .
Just as now , countries could n't get dollars because of the slowdown in exports , and there was a dollar shortage , as there is now .
Efforts were directed at rekindling lending .
But they did not rekindle lending .
Eventually there were a lot of bankruptcies , which extinguished debt .
In the U.S. , a Democratic administration replaced a Republican one and there was a major devaluation and reflation that marked the bottom of the Depression in March 1933 .
Where is the U.S. and the rest of the world going to keep getting money to pay for these stimulus packages ?
The Federal Reserve is going to have to print money .
The deficits will be greater than the savings .
So you will see the Federal Reserve buy long - term Treasury bonds , as it did in the Great Depression .
We are in a position where that will eventually create a problem for currencies and drive assets to gold .
Are you a fan of gold ?
Yes .
Have you always been ?
No .
Gold is horrible sometimes and great other times .
But like any other asset class , everybody always should have a piece of it in their portfolio .
What about bonds ?
The conventional wisdom has it that bonds are the most overbought and most dangerous asset class right now .
Everything is timing .
You print a lot of money , and then you have currency devaluation .
The currency devaluation happens before bonds fall .
Not much in the way of inflation is produced , because what you are doing actually is negating deflation .
So , the first wave of currency depreciation will be very much like England in 1992 , with its currency realignment , or the United States during the Great Depression , when they printed money and devalued the dollar a lot .
Gold went up a whole lot and the bond market had a hiccup , and then long - term rates continued to decline because people still needed safety and liquidity .
While the dollar is bad , it does n't mean necessarily that the bond market is bad .
I can easily imagine at some point I 'm going to hate bonds and want to be short bonds , but , for now , a portfolio that is a mixture of Treasury bonds and gold is going to be a very good portfolio , because I imagine gold could go up a whole lot and Treasury bonds wo n't go down a whole lot , at first .
Ideally , creditor countries that do n't have dollar - debt problems are the place you want to be , like Japan .
The Japanese economy will do horribly , too , but they do n't have the problems that we have -- and they have surpluses .
They can pull in their assets from abroad , which will support their currency , because they will want to become defensive .
Other currencies will decline in relationship to the yen and in relationship to gold .
And China ?
Now we have the delicate China question .
That is a complicated , touchy question .
The reasons for China to hold dollar - denominated assets no longer exist , for the most part .
However , the desire to have a weaker currency is everybody 's desire in terms of stimulus .
China recognizes that the exchange - rate peg is not as important as it was before , because the idea was to make its goods competitive in the world .
Ultimately , they are going to have to go to a domestic - based economy .
But they own too much in the way of dollar - denominated assets to get out , and it is n't clear exactly where they would go if they did get out .
But they do n't have to buy more .
They are not going to continue to want to double down .
From the U.S. point of view , we want a devaluation .
A devaluation gets your pricing in line .
When there is a deflationary environment , you want your currency to go down .
When you have a lot of foreign debt denominated in your currency , you want to create relief by having your currency go down .
All major currency devaluations have triggered stock - market rallies throughout the world ; one of the best ways to trigger a stock - market rally is to devalue your currency .
But there is a basic structural problem with China .
Its per capita income is less than 10 % of ours .
We have to get our prices in line , and we are not going to do it by cutting our incomes to a level of Chinese incomes .
And they are not going to do it by having their per capita incomes coming in line with our per capita incomes .
But they have to come closer together .
The Chinese currency and assets are too cheap in dollar terms , so a devaluation of the dollar in relation to China 's currency is likely , and will be an important step to our reflation and will make investments in China attractive .
You mentioned , too , that inflation is not as big a worry for you as it is for some .
Could you elaborate ?
A wave of currency devaluations and strong gold will serve to negate deflationary pressures , bringing inflation to a low , positive number rather than producing unacceptably high inflation -- and that will last for as far as I can see out , roughly about two years .
Given this outlook , what is your view on stocks ?
Buying equities and taking on those risks in late 2009 , or more likely 2010 , will be a great move because equities will be much cheaper than now .
It is going to be a buying opportunity of the century .
Thanks , Ray .

Just heard Mitch McConnell
again in his senate press conference .
Let ’s make sure we understand the Republican position .
Tax cuts are far less efficient as stimulus than spending .
In other words , they save fewer jobs .
But McConnell apparently wants all tax cuts and no spending .
He did n’t seem that extreme even a few days ago .
But now that ’s where he is .
In other words , no jobs bill .
So how many millions of Americans have to lose their jobs for Mitch McConnell ’s political gambit ?
The Police Department 's Internal Affairs bureau has reopened an investigation in Saturday 's hit - and - run that killed two parents in Staten Island 's Tompkinsville community , a day after the Advance published surveillance video that appears to cast doubt on police claims no pursuit was involved .
A police spokesman would only confirm that investigators have reopened the probe .
In the days following the deaths of livery cab driver Mohamed Elnahal , 50 , and his wife , Mervat Saad Ibrahim , 52 , the NYPD has insisted that police were not chasing a Mercedes - Benz at any time before it slammed into the couple 's cab on Victory Boulevard and Cebra Avenue at 12:34 a.m. , killing both .
But a surveillance video taken blocks from the scene of the crash and only a few minutes before the accident appears to show a police van speeding after a black sedan on residential Jackson Street with its lights blazing .
Here 's the video :
Surveillance video
The alleged driver of the borrowed 1993 Mercedes - Benz , Theodore Ricks , 24 , of New Brighton , allegedly tried to run from the scene of the accident and later said his victims " should have been wearing seat belts . "
He is charged with two counts of second - degree manslaughter and is being held at Rikers Island without bail .
His passenger , William Knight , 25 , also of New Brighton , is charged with marijuana possession and resisting arrest .
The fatal crash left Elnahal and Mrs. Ibrahim 's twin 13 - year - old sons orphaned .
Elnahal 's sister and her husband hope to gain legal guardianship of the pair .
A family friend visiting from their native Egypt , Nabila Ahmed , 54 , was in the back seat of the cab and was also injured in the crash .
She is in stable condition at Richmond University Medical Center , West Brighton .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
It was described as one of the most grisly scenes Los Angeles police had ever encountered : the bodies of five small children and their parents , all shot to death , in two upstairs rooms of the family 's home .
A photo on Ervin Lupoe 's Facebook page shows his wife and five children .
" The reaction on their faces was not a pretty sight , " neighbor Jasmine Gomez told CNN .
" There was an officer who came out of the house throwing up . "
But even more incomprehensible to some was the story that emerged after the bodies were found Tuesday : A father who , after he and his wife were fired from their jobs , killed all six family members before turning the gun on himself .
In a letter faxed to Los Angeles television station KABC before his suicide , Ervin Antonio Lupoe blamed his former employer for the deaths , detailing his grievance against Kaiser Permanente 's West Los Angeles Medical Center , where he and his wife Ana had worked as technicians .
Watch how the note brought police to the home »
Lupoe , 40 , claimed the couple was being investigated for " misrepresentation of our employment to an outside agency for the benefit to ourselves 's [ sic ] , childcare . "
He said the initial interview was held on December 19 , and when he reported for work on December 23 , " I was told by my administrator ... that ' You should not even have bothered to come to work today .
You should have blown your brains out . ' "
" Oh lord , my God , " the letter concludes .
" Is there no hope for a widow 's son ? "
Kaiser Permanente said in a statement Tuesday night that while the company is " saddened by the despair in Mr. Lupoe 's letter faxed to the media ... we are confident that no one told him to take his own life or the lives of his family . "
The Lupoes ' employment was terminated over a week ago " after an internal investigation , " the company said .
" While we may never fully understand why today 's senseless deaths occurred , everyone who worked with the Lupoes is shocked and terribly saddened by the tragedy , " said the statement .
" It never should have happened . "
Lupoe wrote in the fax , " after a horrendous ordeal , my wife felt it better to end our lives ; and why leave our children in someone else 's hands ... we have no job and 5 children under 8 years with no place to go .
So here we are . "
Ana Elizabeth Lupoe was 38 , according to the Los Angeles County coroner 's office .
The children were identified as 8 - year - old Brittney Nicole ; 5 - year - old twins Jaszmin Lissette and Jassely Lisbeth ; and 2 - year - old twins Christian De Shawn and Benjamin Ryan .
Lupoe and the girls were found in what appeared to be an upstairs bonus room , police said Wednesday .
Ana Lupoe and the boys were found in the master bedroom .
Police believe Lupoe also called KABC and threatened suicide , prompting the station to notify police .
At about the same time KABC contacted police , Lupoe called 911 and reported returning home and finding his family dead , authorities said .
Among those struggling to comprehend the news was Lupoe 's 83 - year - old grandmother , Josephine Lupoe of Atlanta , Georgia .
She sobbed as she told CNN , " I just ca n't believe it . "
She said Lupoe was born in Atlanta , but moved to Detroit , Michigan , with his parents as a child before moving to California .
She recalled visiting the family when they lived in San Jose , California , " but that was years ago , " she said .
" I had n't been to visit them since he got married and moved . "
She said she last heard from him when he called her to say they were having a second set of twins .
" Every time I called , he was at work , " Josephine Lupoe said .
" He worked a lot , and even when I talked with him , he would be at work . "
But she said she had no indication of problems within the family .
She said she spoke with Lupoe 's mother a couple of days ago , and they discussed his sending pictures of the boys .
" And then I hear this , " she said tearfully .
Lupoe 's mother was traveling to California on Wednesday , she said , but Josephine Lupoe said she is unable to travel .
Lupoe 's co-workers told the Los Angeles Times they remembered the Lupoes as cheerful , good workers and caring parents .
Ana Lupoe was " always talking about the kids , " said co-worker Hamlet Narvaez .
On Ervin Lupoe 's Facebook page , which previously displayed pictures of the family , he describes himself as a graduate of the University of Southern California .
The page could not be found Wednesday .
In a written statement , Facebook spokeswoman Rebecca Hahn told CNN , " When it comes to our attention that a user has passed away , we put the profile in a memorial state .
In the memorial state , certain profile sections and features are hidden from view to protect the privacy of the departed .
We encourage users to utilize groups and group discussions to mourn and remember the deceased . "
Cherise Pounders - Caver , principal of the children 's school , Crescent Heights Elementary , said Lupoe showed up to check the three older children out of school about two weeks ago and told her the family was moving to Kansas , the Times reported .
Police said Wednesday school administrators were notified " several weeks prior " to the deaths that the children would no longer be attending .
The deaths sent shock waves across the city and beyond .
Watch how the tragedy unfolded »
" No matter how desperate you are , no matter how frustrated you are , to think this was the only answer -- to take your whole family with you in death -- is just too much to understand , " said City Councilwoman Janice Hahn , who represents the city 's Wilmington neighborhood where the slayings took place .
She and other city officials urged those who may be despondent to seek help from available resources .
" It 's sad that this happens anywhere , you know ? " neighbor Jose Rodriguez told KABC .
" You see it on the news but you never really become accustomed to it .
" I have kids , too , and grandkids , " he said .
" It hits home . "
CNN 's Stan Wilson , Ashley Broughton and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report .

You might be asking yourself why we are calling it the ‘ Ultimate Edition ’ of Red Alert 3 .
I wanted to share some insight into the cool extras and bonus content we are making exclusive for you guys , as well as shed a little light on the development process and our future plans for the title on PS3 .
Red Alert found its humble beginnings over a decade ago on PC and has since seen 2 sequels , several expansion packs , and now , is making its debut on the PS3 console .
Fortunately the power of the PS3 and the Blu-ray medium has afforded us some extra luxuries that were n’t available to us previously .
The most noticeable difference you ’ll see in the Ultimate Edition on PS3 is an increase the visual quality of the game so that it truly stands up to HD Blu-ray definition .
A perfect example of this is what you will see in the game ’s water .
One of the huge new features you ’ll see in Red Alert 3 is an increase in naval warfare and amphibious units .
Most strategy games in the past have never paid much attention to navy but we ’re bringing it to the center .
As such , we paid close attention to detail with it and ensured that we maximized its visual aspects , without penalizing game performance even under the most intense of battles .
Another great thing about the PS3 is its use of Blu-ray .
We are taking as much advantage as we can of the extra storage space , cramming it full of exclusive features and in game content , including some exclusive new maps for you wage you and your buddies to skirmish battles on over PSN .
There is also a ton of videos , giving you a behind the scenes look at the development of the game and the making of our live - action cinematics , a hallmark of the Command & Conquer series .
Red Alert 3 features one of the biggest casts in the history of games , including legends like Tim Curry , George Takei , J.K. Simmons , MMA superstars Randy Couture and Gina Carano and a host of starlets including Jenny McCarthy , Kelly Hu , Autumn Reeser and Gemma Atkinson ( speaking of which , my personal favorite extra is a look at the “ Women of Red Alert 3 ” video we ’ve included ) .
Our Command & Conquer TV team also produced two episodes of the network ’s favorite programs , BattleCast PrimeTime and Command School which are totally dedicated to the Ultimate Edition .
And to top it all off , we ’ve also included the entire Red Alert 3 soundtrack for your listening pleasure , including the theme song “ Hellmarch . ”
Red Alert 3 also brings another first to strategy games : a fully co-operative campaign .
With the PlayStation Network , you and your friends will be able to play through the entire campaign together .
There was a strong effort to make sure that each mission was designed for two commanders working together and in making sure that the experience was engaging and challenging .
And with the extra time we were given , we were also able to fine tune and balance each mission specifically for the console to ensure that players have the best experience possible .
Of course all of this does n’t matter if you do n’t have a fun game and one of the most important aspects of a fun RTS is how you control your army .
After all , you ca n’t conquer the battlefield , if you ca n’t get your tanks in first gear .
The dev team here has been working on console RTS since Battle for Middle Earth II on through Tiberium Wars and Kane ’s Wrath , all for the Xbox 360 .
Now we ’re proud to be bringing what we think is the smoothest , easiest - to - grasp control set up we have ever designed to the PS3 with the CommandStick 2.0 interface .
You ’ll be able to easily group units , jump around the battlefield , stage attacks and defenses , and manage their bases , all with a couple flicks of the thumbsticks .
Once you get your hands on it , you will be crushing noobs in no time .
We ’re also planning on supporting Red Alert 3 : Ultimate Edition through the PlayStation Store and with downloadable content .
Even now as we are finishing the game , we have a team hard at work on content packages and live support for the PS3 .
We plan on releasing multiple map packs through the PS Store ; in fact , the first one will be available for free right about the time the game comes out in March .
Following that we should have some real cool content for you to download in the future , but for now check out the Red Alert 3 page on the PS Store for the Ultimate Edition
Theme and our first sneak peak trailer of the PS3 version .
This is the first classic RTS for the PS3 , and the first strategy game that the development team at EA Los Angeles has brought to this console .
We are all proud of how it turned out and we ca n’t wait to hear what you , the fans , think of it .
Please send us your comments and leave us feedback , we love hearing from you and your suggestions !
Check us out on the PS Store , or go to www.redalert3.com for more info .
Thanks again fellow Comrades , see you on the Battlefield !
As offshore wind continues to accelerate growth into new markets , the industry must keep looking to the future and anticipate growth to avoid any potential bottlenecks and be able to fulfil a growing demand for offshore wind .
One potential bottleneck which could slow offshore wind installation is the availability of vessels that are critical for offshore wind turbines installation execution , which is why GWEC Market Intelligence has published its first ever Global Offshore Wind Turbine Installation Database as an important resource for the industry .
So - called " whole - home " audio systems that allow users to rock out to their music in multiple rooms via remote controllers have , so far , not quite caught on with the public .
While a variety of options have existed for some time between the high end , like Sonos , and the low end , like the Roku SoundBridge or even Apple 's AirPort Express , a new study claims that 2009 may be the year that whole - home systems get their groove on .
Forrester 's study , called " How Whole - Home Audio Products Can Find Their Rhythm , " argues that two primary barriers to entry for these systems are finally at their tipping points now : networked homes and DRM .
According to the report , 28 percent of US homes are now networked properly to provide the bandwidth required to push audio all over the house .
Further , Apple 's announcement in January that it is finally removing all DRM technology from iTunes Store music purchases means that the most popular music store in the US is finally selling the same clean music as its many competitors .
Compiled alongside other factors in a new " Convenience Quotient " methodology , Forrester believes networked homes and the freedom provided by music DRM 's demise allows manufacturers to shift their battle to the most important factor for new product adoption : convenience .
From a survey of 4,464 online adults in the second quarter 2008 , Forrester 's research reveals that the majority of consumers have stuck with " no- tech " solutions like cranking up a stereo's volume in one room to hear it in another or carrying CDs and iPods back and forth .
Only seven percent have gone " low - tech " by running speaker wires from one room to another , with another six percent who own stereos with MP3 player docks .
Less than four percent use some kind of " high - tech " wireless speaker system ( such as an AirPort Express ) , with just two percent going all - out with a high - end whole - home system like Sonos .
In 2009 , though , Forrester thinks the high - tech numbers that involve wireless , whole - home audio systems could see a significant jump .
Converging factors like DRM - free stores ( and the ability to upgrade old libraries ) , more affordable competition , easier universal controllers from more manufacturers ( and even iPhone apps ) , and unfettered access to one 's entire music library could finally spur growth .
Forrester singles out systems like Logitech 's Squeezebox line for their reasonable $ 200 - 400 price range and rich set of features like Internet radio station support and wireless remotes .
The report also touts the high - quality experience and broad feature set of Sonos ' system , but notes that consumers are not likely to consider it an option due to an extremely high cost barrier that begins at $ 999 .
Ultimately , Forrester predicts competition to begin heating up this year in the whole - home audio market due to the tumbling of aforementioned barriers and a renewed manufacturer focus on greater convenience .
I had to spend a couple hours this morning footnoting my next column for Discover so that it can be fact - checked .
I had to assemble the papers I read , the web sites I visited , and the contact information for scientists who helped me understand the subject .
One of Discover 's intrepid fact - checkers will then spend many hours following in my footsteps and discovering where I tripped .
He or she will have no compunction about writing up a detailed report of my mistakes .
I 'm sure some mistakes will turn up , and I wo n't be angry to see them in a fact - checking report .
I 'll be grateful that my column wo n't inadvertently misrepresent someone 's research .
And I 'll be personally glad to have any misunderstanding of mine put straight .
Fact - checking is an underappreciated art .
As John McPhee explains in his recent essay , even a legendary fact - monger like himself benefits from the relentless skepticism of the New Yorker 's fact - checkers .
I got my own start as a fact - checker , and it was the best training I could imagine for science writing .
Even when I do n't have the luxury of fact - checkers vetting my own writing , I have an inner skeptic that drives me to double - check whatever I feel unsure about .
One of the things I like most about blogging is the after - the - fact fact - checking that comes from commenters who catch mistakes .
While accuracy is important for any kind of factual writing , it 's particularly important in science writing , because there are just so many ways to get a story wrong .
( Trust me , I know . )
This old fact - checker gets rankled fairly often when I read about science on op - ed pages , because there does n't seem to be much fact - checking going on there .
It 's not necessary for anyone to fact - check subjective statements like , " We must unleash the inventive genius of America , " or " Harry Potter is boring . "
But imagine that someone writing a column about global warming ( or the supposed lack thereof ) wrote the following :
According to the University of Illinois ' Arctic Climate Research Center , global sea ice levels now equal those of 1979 .
Surely somebody should actually check with the people at the center to make sure that statement is true .
If not the writer , then somebody whose job it is to make sure that paid columnists do not just make stuff up .
Would n't the columns be better ?
Would n't the publication be better for such standards ?
Unfortunately , this is not just an imaginary scenario .
George
Will delivered this bit of information in his most recent column .
And , as Talking Points Memo reports , the research center felt the need to post this statement on their own web site :
In an opinion piece by George Will published on February 15 , 2009 in the Washington Post , George Will states " According to the University of Illinois ' Arctic Climate Research Center , global sea ice levels now equal those of 1979 . "
We do not know where George Will is getting his information , but our data shows that on February 15 , 1979 , global sea ice area was 16.79 million sq. km and on February 15 , 2009 , global sea ice area was 15.45 million sq. km .
Therefore , global sea ice levels are 1.34 million sq. km less in February 2009 than in February 1979 .
This decrease in sea ice area is roughly equal to the area of Texas , California , and Oklahoma combined .
It is disturbing that the Washington Post would publish such information without first checking the facts .
This is not a matter of the complex choices between cap - and - trade , carbon taxes , or other responses to global warming .
This is a matter of exquisitely simple facts .
16.79 does not equal 15.45 .
Of course , this glaring error helps George Will make his case that global warming is nothing to worry about .
But it is not true , and two seconds of fact - checking by the Post could have discovered that .
It 's fine for op - eds to be a place for opinions .
But that does n't mean they should be a vacation from facts .
Update , 4/7 : In fact , there is no such thing as the University of Illinois Arctic Climate Research Center .
Details here .

See , I 'm a little confused .
Because for years , big companies like IBM have insisted there were so few talented IT workers in the U.S. , they had to import them from India .
And yet now we have so many , we can send them to India !
Is n't that funny ?
If I were a suspicious sort ( and God knows , I 'm not ) , I 'd wonder if this is n't really a way to keep experienced American workers while artificially suppressing their wages .
And of course , I 'd also have to wonder :
If you 're offered one of these jobs and you decline , are you then ineligible to collect unemployment compensation ?
Because that already happens with big companies in the U.S .
Is n't this new personal responsibility thing fun ?
Who knew we'd get to see the world at company expense ?
The US Supreme Court has ruled that a Utah city did not violate the free speech rights of a religious sect when it refused to place the group 's monument beside an existing Ten Commandments monument in a public park .
Lawyers for the Summum religion insisted in a lawsuit that the placement of the Ten Commandments monument in a Pleasant Grove City park created a public forum that required the city to accept other kinds of monuments and messages .
When Pleasant Grove refused to accept Summum 's monument , the group sued the city for engaging in unconstitutional censorship .
A federal appeals court agreed .
The city was ordered to erect the Summum monument .
In a unanimous decision announced Wednesday , the Supreme Court reversed that decision .
The high court said that when a government entity decides to place a privately donated monument on public land , the display represents the government 's own speech and does not require government acceptance of any and all other monuments conveying competing messages private groups may want displayed .
" Government decisionmakers select the monuments that portray what they view as appropriate for the place in question , taking into account such content - based factors as esthetics , history , and local culture , " Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court in an 18 - page decision .
" The monuments that are accepted , therefore , are meant to convey … a government message , and they thus constitute government speech . "
The decision in Pleasant Grove City v. Summum is important because it marks the latest expression of an emerging doctrine in Supreme Court jurisprudence setting the limits and powers of government speech .
" The decision gives government the right to speak for itself and the ability to communicate on behalf of its citizens , " said Jay Sekulow , chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice , who argued the case for Pleasant Grove .
" It 's a landmark decision that clears the way for government to express its views and its history through the selection of monuments – including religious monuments and displays , " Mr. Sekulow said in a statement .
The decision is raising concern among some analysts that it might encourage government officials to approve religious displays on public land .
" Government has no business erecting , maintaining , or promoting religious symbols or codes , " said the Rev. Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State .
" The answer in this case is to remove the Ten Commandments from the public park , not compound the problem by adding more sectarian material , " he said in statement .
Although the Pleasant Grove case was litigated under the First Amendment 's free speech clause , both sides waged the battle with an eye toward the First Amendment 's establishment clause .
At first , Pleasant Grove was reluctant to claim responsibility for the religious message associated with the Ten Commandments monument in its park .
City officials were concerned that if they made their case too vigorously , the courts would find that the monument amounted to an unconstitutional establishment of religion and order it removed .
Lawyers for the Summum religious group said the Ten Commandments and other monuments in the park created a public forum and that the First Amendment prohibited the government from picking and choosing which messages to display .
Summum is a religious group founded in 1975 in Salt Lake City .
Its followers believe that in addition to the Ten Commandments , Moses also brought ' Seven Aphorisms ' down from Mt. Sinai .
In 2003 , the group asked to erect a ' Seven Aphorisms ' monument beside the city 's Ten Commandments monument .
They said they had a free speech right to do so .
A panel of the Denver - based 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Summum .
Pleasant Grove appealed that decision in the Supreme Court .
Summum warned that the government speech argument could be used as a subterfuge to allow public officials to use public land and resources to advance messages of favored religions over messages of other faiths .
Such favoritism is unconstitutional .
Justice Alito said Summum had raised a legitimate concern .
But he said privately donated monuments on public land frequently convey more than one message .
" By accepting such a monument , a government entity does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any particular donor sees in the monument , " he wrote .
Alito said erecting monuments in a public park is not the equivalent of delivering speeches or holding demonstrations in a public park .
" Speakers , no matter how long - winded , eventually come to the end of their remarks ; persons distributing leaflets and carrying signs at some point tire and go home ; monuments , however , endure . "
He added : " It is hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every person or group wishing to engage in that form of expression . "
Lawyers for Pleasant Grove and friend of the court briefs filed on the city 's behalf warned that if Summum 's position was upheld , all public parks would potentially become cluttered with monuments containing competing messages .
When France gave the United States the Statue of Liberty , would the government have been obliged to accept a ' Statue of Autocracy ' from the German Empire or imperial Russia , Alito asked .
" If government entities must maintain viewpoint neutrality in their selection of donated monuments , they must either brace themselves for an influx of clutter or face the pressure to remove longstanding and cherished monuments , " Alito wrote .
" The obvious truth of the matter is that if public parks were considered to be traditional public forums for the purpose of erecting privately donated monuments , " Alito said , " most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such donations . "
Although the case was decided unanimously , four justices wrote separate concurrences to express individual concerns .
Justice David Souter did not join the majority opinion .
Instead , he concurred in the judgment only .
He said although he agreed with the outcome he had qualms about suggesting that public monuments are government speech categorically .
Justice Souter warned of potential difficulties ahead .
" The interaction between the ' government speech doctrine ' and establishment clause principles has not … begun to be worked out , " he said .
" The case shows that it may not be easy to work out . "
In his own concurrence , Justice Antonin Scalia was less concerned about looming free speech and establishment clause clashes .
In a two - page concurrence joined by Justice Clarence Thomas , he sought to reassure Pleasant Grove officials .
" The city ought not fear that today 's victory has propelled it from the free speech clause frying pan into the establishment clause fire , " he wrote .
" There are very good reasons to be confident that the park displays do not violate any part of the First Amendment . "
Sender - inner Shelly P. sent her pooch Augustus to play outdoors , and things just kind of snowballed from there .

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
The unemployment rate is creeping up and home prices keep falling :
Two great reasons why it might be best to put your home buying plans on hold .
After all , your own job could be the next on the chopping block .
Plus , why not wait until home prices have reached their bottom and you can safely buy knowing your new house wo n't depreciate like a car coasting out of the dealership ?
" It may be 2010 or 2011 before the general public believes it 's safe to go back into housing , " said Steve Fifield , president of Chicago - based Fifield Companies , a firm that builds condominium , apartment , and office buildings .
" You do n't want to be the first guy to go back in . "
Keep in mind , for some Americans buying wo n't even be an option due to stricter mortgage underwriting standards that require bigger down payments and higher credit scores .
But if you think you might qualify and you 're tempted to test the market , consider these five reasons for staying on the sidelines instead :
1. Prices are still dropping
Data shows that prices are still dropping in many markets .
If you buy today , your home could be worth less in a year or even two .
" People do n't like to buy depreciating assets , " said David Berson , chief economist for The PMI Group .
According to PMI 's most recent U.S. Market Risk Index , reported last month , the risk of lower prices two years from now has increased across the country .
Half of the country 's 50 largest cities had an elevated or high probability of seeing lower house prices by the end of the third quarter of 2010 , compared with the third quarter of 2008 .
Other home price measures have n't painted a rosy picture either .
According to the Case - Shiller home price index , values in 20 major U.S. cities fell 18.5 % in December , compared with December 2007 .
Read more on the record drop in home prices .
Steep discounts in some of the hardest hit housing markets have some people wondering if prices could be starting to bottom .
But some markets saw price drops later on than others -- and it could take longer for those latecomers to improve , Fifield said .
2 . This sale will be on for a while
From a pure investment standpoint , you 'd probably be better off investing in stocks , said Nancy Flint - Budde , a Salem , N.Y. - based certified financial planner .
In a normal market , real estate appreciates about 5 % a year , she said .
But even if prices stop falling this year , as Moody 's Economy.com is predicting , price appreciation could be weak for a while .
In fact , while some recoveries resemble a " V " - shaped pattern , this housing recovery could look like an " L " -- once a bottom hits , prices will flat line , said Jay Papasan , one of the authors of the book " Your First Home . "
Prices likely wo n't rocket to housing - boom levels soon , as conditions are exacerbated by rising unemployment and foreclosure inventory .
The lesson :
This housing sale could go on for a while , so there is no need to rush .
" Even if in December of 2009 the first stories appear that sellers are n't lowering prices any more ... you need that uptick and information showing that not only are sales increasing , but prices have stabilized and are starting to go up , " Fifield said .
3 . You may not stay put
If prices continue to drop , you might have to be in that home for longer than you thought in order for the investment to make financial sense .
In any market , it 's best to buy a home with the intention of staying there five to 10 years , said Flint - Budde .
This guideline is even more important today , when you might have to absorb more price drops and weather a couple years of slow price growth .
First - time buyers must be listening to that rule of thumb : According to research from the National Association of Realtors , the typical first - time home buyer in 2008 planned to stay in their new for 10 years , up from seven years in 2007 .
Brian Rayhack , for example , is renting an apartment in Chicago because he 's just not sure how long he'd be living in the city .
" If I was going to be here more than five years I definitely would have bought , " he said .
For the flexibility that comes with renting , it 's was worth it for him to wait .
4 . Your job could be the next to go
Maybe you 're spooked by the headlines of job cuts .
Perhaps you have friends who have recently been laid off .
If you think your own job might is in danger , stop right there -- and stay put .
But even if you 're comfortable with your own job security , investigate how your future neighbors are faring .
Your real - estate agent will tell you to pay attention to local market conditions instead of national trends .
But do n't stop by only looking at neighborhood home prices ; the health of the local job market is also important to consider .
Have there been many layoffs in the area recently ?
What are the largest employers , and are they in industries that are suffering severely ?
Is the local economy diversified ?
" What is the state of the job market in my area , and my metro area in general ?
That 's going to impact overall demand , " said Richard Moody , chief economist with Mission Residential .
At the very least , get a sense of what the local inventory situation is like , relative to demand , to anticipate the pressures on prices over the coming months or years , he added .
It 's best to get a broad picture of the housing market , rather than simply asking yourself " can I afford it or not , " Moody said .
5 . Your cash reserves will be eaten up
Given the recession and the fragile economy today , even if you feel confident about your job it's wise to have a cushion to land on in the event you get hit with a financial broadside , a divorce or a major health bill , for instance .
If your down payment would deplete your rainy day fund , keep saving for a while before house hunting .
" Even if you feel like you 're secure in your job , it 's much smarter to have five or six months of expenses to have aside .
A reserve is a wise thing in this economy today , " Papasan said .
If you have n't owned a home in the past three years , you may be eligible for an $ 8,000 tax credit to buy a home .
The money does not have to be paid back , if you live in the home for at least 36 months .
See full story .
But that credit is only available to first - time buyers .
And even those who are eligible might have had their hopes up for a bigger incentive -- the $ 8,000 is a far cry from the $ 15,000 credit considered in one of the versions of the stimulus bill .
Since his participation in a FIA European road safety campaign , as part of his punishment after a collision at the 1997 European Grand Prix , Schumacher has continued to support other campaigns , such as Make Roads Safe , which is led by the FIA Foundation and calls on G8 countries and the UN to recognise global road deaths as a major global health issue .
The photographers held a mass photo call in protest at the law Hundreds of photographers have staged a protest outside Scotland Yard against a new law which they say could stop them taking pictures of the police .
The law makes it an offence to gather information on security personnel if that data could be used for a purpose linked to terrorism .
The National Union of Journalists said the law could be used to harass photographers working legitimately .
The Home Office said it was designed to protect counter - terrorism officers .
The NUJ wants the government to issue guidance to police forces on how exactly the law should be used by individual officers on the ground .
' Treated as terrorists '
The photographers , both professional and amateur , held a mass photo - call outside the Met Police headquarters at Scotland Yard on Monday .
They are angry at the introduction of Section 76 of the Counter Terrorism
Act and argue it can be used by police to stop and search them in any situation .
The new offence is intended to help protect those in the front line of our counter terrorism operations from terrorist attack
Metropolitan Police
Is it a crime to take pictures ?
It makes it an offence to " elicit , publish or communicate information " relating to members of the Armed Forces , intelligence services and police , which is " likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism " .
Vice President of the NUJ Pete Murray said it was absurd to treat photographers as terrorists simply for doing their job .
" If the police officer is n't doing anything wrong then what are they worried about ? " he told the BBC .
" I mean , we as citizens constantly get told that these extra security laws , terrorism laws , all of this surveillance stuff , is not a threat to us if we 're not doing anything wrong .
" So why on earth it becomes a threat to a police officer to have a photographer , a working journalist , a photographer taking a picture of them is quite beyond me . "
He said that even if an officer were in the background of a shot - for example , at a football match or street parade - " the photographer may end up on the wrong side of the law " .
Peter Smyth , chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation , backed a call by Grimsby MP Austin Mitchell to introduce a formal code to clarify the position of both the police and photographers .
" Its aim should be to facilitate photography wherever possible , rather than seek reasons to bar it , " he said .
Critics say the law will prevent them reporting on legitimate protests " Police and photographers share the streets and the Met Federation earnestly wants to see them doing so harmoniously .
" As things stand , there is a real risk of photographers being hampered in carrying out their legitimate work and of police officers facing opprobrium for carrying out what they genuinely , if mistakenly , believe are duties imposed on them by the law . "
' Reasonable suspicion '
In a statement , the Home Office said taking pictures of police officers would only be deemed an offence in " very exceptional circumstances " .
" The new offence is intended to help protect those in the front line of our counter terrorism operations from terrorist attack , " it said .
" For the offence to be committed , the information would have to raise a reasonable suspicion that it was intended to be used to provide practical assistance to terrorists . "
The Home Office added that anyone accused under the act could defend themselves by proving they had " a reasonable excuse " for taking the picture .
Anyone convicted under Section 76 could face a fine or a maximum of 10 years ' imprisonment .

乗らなくなった車、どうします？
今では地域によって、車の所有の状況も大きく違います。
特に田舎などでは車が生活するためには必需品となっている場合も多いです。
仕事の通勤に使用したり、近くに買い物に行くにも車を使用する生活環境もあります。
そういった環境では、車の免許を取得している家族の人数分の車が必要になる場合が多いです。
このような場合、車の使用頻度が多いため車の老朽化が早く進みます。
なので、車の買い替えや廃車にする機会が増えます。
それとは逆に交通の便がいいところであれば車の必要がないところもあります。
そういったところの多くは、主要都市部でもあり、車を補完するための駐車場代がとても高い場合があります。
田舎から都会へ引っ越しする際に、車の維持費や経費などを考えて処分することにする人もいます。
乗る機会は少なくなっても、あったら便利だからと所持していても、便利な交通機関があると乗らなくなってしまう車も出てきます。
そうするとそらなくなった車をどう処分するのか、悩んでしまいますよね。
買い替える場合は、下取りに出してしまうため、ほとんど自分で行う作業はありません。
しかし廃車場合は多くの手続きが必要になり、手間暇がかかります。
また廃車の時期によっては、返金されるお金などもあるのでしっかり手続きしなければいけません。
意外に車を所有している人で、そこまでの情報をしている人は少ないのではないでしょうか。
実際そういう状況にならなければ、あまり考えないことかもしれません。
しかし前から情報としておくことで、少しでもお得に処分することができます。
処分するためには、お金を払って処分しなくてはいけません。
数万単位で必要になるので、思ったりより痛い出費になります。
そんな人にとって、お薦めなのが乗らなくなった車を買い取ってくれる業者があります。
本来ならお金をはらって処分しなくてはいけない車を無料かもしくは買い取ってもらうことができます。
そして乗らない間支払わなくてはいけない、自動車税、自賠責保険、車検代が負担しなくて済みます。
もしのらない車があったら、そのままにしておくのではなく、まずは無料査定を出してみて処分する方向で進めていいましょう。

In Praise of Elitism
Posted on
A respondent to one of my earlier posts complained that approaching Haskell by way of category theory is a " radical approach that would lead to elitism " , since such an approach is likely to scare off all but the mathematical sophisticate .
That may or may not be true - in my opinion a well - written CT - oriented intro to Haskell need be no more terrifying than any other - but I take mild exception to the implied assertion that " elite " is somehow bad .
The community of Haskell programmers ( and functional language programmers in general ) is a natural , self - selecting elite .
There 's nothing wrong with that ; on the contrary , the elite status of the Haskell Master should be celebrated .
Haskell is hard , there 's no sense in denying it , but so are most things worth doing .
It 's hard to master the piano , or fly - fishing , or brain surgery , or a foreign language , and nobody sensible would pretend otherwise .
Why should the highly sophisticated art of functional programming be any different ?
Elite does not mean snide , or exclusionary , or condescending , or selfish ; it means excellence , and the truly elite are open - minded , inclusive , and generous with their hard - earned knowledge .
I came to Haskell with years of imperative programming under my belt .
I became a pretty " advanced " programmer , but I never really felt like I was doing anything a clever monkey could n't do .
A C programmer spends most of his time doing much what an auto mechanic does - diagnosing and fixing problems in a sophisticated machine .
There 's nothing wrong with being an auto mechanic or a C programmer ; but it 's not exactly an elite .
On my third try I 've finally begun to appreciate the beauties of Haskell .
The turning point for me was category theory , which lead to a sea change in my thinking .
I 'm not sure I 'll ever become a master Haskell programmer - one of the great things about it is you can acquire a pretty good understanding of how the language works without writing Haskell programs - but it 's clear that those who do master it are a different kind of programmer .
Show me a great C programmer and I 'll show you a Thomas Edison ; show me a great Haskell programmer and I 'll show you a J. S. Bach .
( Idea for a logo : a measure of musical notation with a lambda clef , and notes tied by arrows . )
The message to newcomers should not be " do n't worry , it 's just like PHP , only different " .
It would be more honest to state right up front that this is a different game : entree to the elite is open to anybody , but not for free .
You have no right to demand excellence without effort .
You have to work ; you have to master some mathematical ways of thinking that can in fact be difficult even for those with a good deal of math .
You can do this ; many others have .
But if you 're the type to throw a fit the first time you discover that your customary ways of thinking wo n't work , then please , go away .
This is for grown - ups .
If you value excellence , and are motivated by the prospect of rising above the common dross and attaining excellence yourself , then you are in for a great intellectual adventure of deep insights and dazzling discoveries .
And you will find lots of help .
There is a plethora of material on the web that will help you , and the community of those who have gone before you is open and more than willing to help those in their apprenticeship .
In my experience the best , most imaginative and talented people are stimulated by a challenge to excel .
They want the hard stuff , and they 're the ones who should be evangelized .
The message to business people should be similar .
No , Haskell is not PHP on steroids , it 's a different beast altogether .
It 's a major paradigm shift , with major benefits that are well worth the costs .
You hire expensive , highly - trained MBAs to professionally manage your company 's financial assets ; why would you not hire elite programmers to manage its information assets ?
The importance of husbanding knowledge assets to gain competitive advantage is only going to increase ; treat it as mere data processing and your competitors will eat you alive .
Yes , it 's harder to find a good Haskell programmer than it is to find 100 mediocre PHP hackers , but aside from being more productive , the Haskell programmer comes with a disciplined , highly sophisticated way of thinking about information structures and algorithms .
This makes it much more likely that your Haskell staff will do a much better job of figuring out how to turn your raw data into real capital that returns value .
( Fortunately I do n't have any money riding on my sales pitch . )

WHITE ROCK–A B.C. man probably wishes he had given his 11 - month - old son a set of keys to play with instead of a phone , after the infant accidentally dialled 9 - 1 - 1 and brought police to dad 's marijuana grow operation .
Mounties say a 9 - 1 - 1 call came in from a White Rock , B.C. residence Friday morning but whoever was on the other end of the line hung up .
Officers arrived at the residence and after numerous knocks on the door went unanswered , they entered the home .
" The gentleman was quite surprised , " said White Rock RCMP Const .
Janelle Canning .
She said the 29 - year - old male , startled by the sudden sight of police , insisted he had n't made the call .
When it was suggested a child might have dialled , the father objected and said his son was far too young .
That 's when police spotted the baby boy , phone in hand .
" We saw him playing with the cordless phone and just pressing all the buttons , so evidently he had called 9 - 1 - 1 , " Canning said .
With that mystery solved , officers began inspecting the residence and soon discovered a 500 - plant marijuana grow operation .
The father was arrested and will appear in court in early April on charges of production of a controlled substance and mischief .
The boy was removed from the home by the Ministry of Children and Family Development , though he was later released into his mother 's custody .
The mother does not live in the residence and Canning says she had no idea what was going on at the home .
Author ’s note :
This was originally written months ago .
I have decided that the time is right to post this before MM sneaks in and fills the front page with more recipes ( who ever heard of recipes on a cooking blog ?!? )
While on a flight to California for the ultimate in geeky conferences ( Blizzcon ) , I decided to try to explain a fascination that I have had for years .
While I have been geographically close , I have never been to Scotland , nor do I have ( as far as I know ) any Scottish blood flowing through my veins .
But since I have been a teenager , I have had a fascination with Scotch Whiskey .
That is not to suggest that I started drinking Scotch as a teenager , because I did n’t .
Heck , I did n’t hardly drink anything ( Dad , I hope you are reading this , and believe me ) .
As a teenager , I actually had a part in a play which mentions “ Chivas Regal ” as a sign of “ making it ” in life , as in “ sitting back and sipping Chivas ” .
I always had this picture in my head of a dignified gentleman , sitting in a high backed leather chair with a small string quartet playing Mozart in the background as the man sipped a small glass of Scotch , smirking , very pleased with himself , all the while .
My first experience with Chivas Regal , a blended Whiskey ( not from a single malt , more later ) , was not the idyllic situation that I had planned .
I poured a glassful ( perhaps a water glass was too big ) of Chivas and took a big gulp .
Up until that point in my life I had tasted pretty normal liquors .
Dr. McGillicuty ’s , Jaegermiester , Goldschlager , Beer , Wine Coolers , etc. are pretty normal upper teens and lower 20 ’s fare , right ?
But , I can not possibly describe the burning and coughing and hacking that followed my first taste of Scotch .
If any of you have thought , “ I like Rum and Cokes … I should just try Rum straight up ! ” you may have experienced something close .
The fact was , I HATED it .
I thought to myself , “ If this is making it , I do n’t want to . ”
That first bottle of Chivas , minus that virginal glassful , lasted me many , many moons after I first tasted it .
But so powerful is memory that I could n’t get my original , utopian , vision of what Scotch was supposed to represent in my life out of my head .
Then I discovered the real truth .
The key to unlocking the secrets of Scotch : 7 - up and ice !
( Or , Sprite if you prefer . )
These wonderful add - ons to my Chivas tastings prevented ( or allivated , a much more desired effect ) the burn of the alcohol of the whiskey , while sweetening it and making it much more palatable .
For those of you , like me , who feel strongly that you have become an adult ( finally ! ) , and that you should be able to enjoy sip of Whiskey ( Bourbon , Irish , Scotch or Kentucky ) without gasping for breath for 10 minutes afterward , try a little 7 - up and a couple of ice cubes with it .
Things will proceed much more smoothly .
Ok ..
Here ’s the basics that you need to know about Scotch Whiskeys ( as a beginner myself , I would never try to advise a true connoisseur of the libation , I let a wiki do that …
http://www.wikihow.com/Taste-Single-Malt-Scotch):
1 ) There are , to an American , two different types of Scotch Whiskey .
The first , and most common , is the “ blended ” Scotch .
Dewers and Chivas are two examples of a blended Scotch .
The second type , while much more pricey and snooty , are not that different .
They are called Single - malt Scotches .
The difference between these two is pretty easy to distinguish .
Blended whiskeys come from more than one different kind of malt and / or barrel of whiskey .
Single malts are made with a single malt ( usually grown nearby ) and casked all at once , however there can be flavor differences even between two different casks ( again , more later ) .
The biggest thing to remember about point one is that Single - malt Scotches are usually MUCH more expensive and usually have a defining characteristic that make them specifically tasty for a certan palate .
Blended Whiskeys are usually a good place for beginners , smoother and not as full of character , and then you can move into single - malts as you decide what you like and do n’t .
2 ) There are about as many different kinds of Scotches as there are Scotsmen .
Actually …
There may be more Scotches ( especially if you include butterscotch ) .
Scotland itself recognizes 6 different varieties of single - malt Scotch .
These are based on where , in Scotland , the Whiskey is made .
Here ’s a tip :
If you are new to Scotches , avoid Speyside or Islay scotches , unless you have a weird craving for sucking on bandaids ( I kid you not ! ) .
The reason for all of the variations ?
Malt , peat and mixture .
When you mix different malts with different peats and waters , the outcome in favors can be varied from the aformentioned bandaids to the smoky salitness of the sea .
The Scots also have this talent for taking used things , in this case , barrels , and re-suing them , and potentially making them better .
What they do is take wine or sherry or even bourbon casks and fill it with the new Scotch .
These all wood barrels can’t help themselves , they let out some small bits of their previous inhabitants flavor .
So you get sherry oak notes in the tasting , or you will taste the chocolatey goodness of a fine Pinot in your Scotch .
These casks become standards that also give you different tastes .
This is the point where you have to buy many different scotches and see what you like and do n’t like and start doing your research to see what else you might like .
Drinking Scotch begets drinking more Scotch .
Consider yourself warned !
3 ) More expensive scotches do not mean better scotches .
Remember that bandaid thing I mentioned above ?
That comment came from the fact that I bought and tried a couple of Scotches that I really thought were going to be something special because they were priced that way .
Spending $ 75 / bottle on a Scotch is a good way to drink a bottle that you think you have to like , but do n’t .
Then again …
When I was younger and more easily impressed with my accomplishments , I passed some certification exams and obtained my MCSE from Microsoft .
( This was back in the NT 4.0 days for those of you who know what that means ) .
After getting my cert , I decided to reward myself with a bottle of 25 year - old MacCallan .
At the time , that bottle cost $ 175 .
So , how good does something have to be to warrant spending $ 175 / bottle ?
Well .
This bottle was so TOTALLY worth it !
One of the bestest ( note : do not use this word at wine or Scotch tastings ) , smoothest , mellowest , yet with character , liquors I have ever drank .
This was before the distillery was bought out by Japanese investors , which has n’t degraded the flavor , merely changed it and the price .
That bottle lasted me over a year and unfortunately , it was not shared with my friends .
Mostly because my friends did n’t want to appreciate the sublte flavors and texture , or like Citizen Chef , has yet to meet a Scotch they liked .
But also because I had n’t realized the cardinal rule of all Whiskeys , which is that they are much better shared with friends .
Was that bottle worth the much higher price than $ 40 - $ 50 / bottle of most single malts ?
You bet your sweet bippy it was .
I still rank that beverage as one of the best that I have ever had the honor of tasting .
Does that mean you have to spend $ 175 / bottle in order to enjoy scotch .
Not hardly .
Find yourself a good cheap “ house ” brand and go for it .
There is no shame in getting yourself a merry little buzz on Dewer ’s at $ 15 / bottle instead of buying the 30 year - old MacCallan or other high faulutin’ brand .
Long story short …
Buy yourself a fine Scotch and enjoy .
Just remember the basics .
Good Scotch should be enjoyed and shared .
It should not be a “ Bataan death march ” for your , or your friends ’ mouth and throat .
Add some soda if you need to .
Ice also helps .
A little water is often used , even by Scotsmen .
But in its purest form , a good Scotch in a nice glass ( you do n’t have to use crystal or anything fancy , but avoid plastic or paper for this ! ) really does help you feel like you have “ made it ! ”
Enjoy !

There has been high drama on the second day of the Pirate Bay trial .
Due to serious shortcomings in the prosecution evidence , around 50 % of the charges in the case are going to have to be withdrawn .
The defense describes it as a ' sensation ' , seeing half of the charges being dropped on the second day .
What has been shown in court today is that the prosecutor cannot prove that the .torrent files he is using as evidence actually used The Pirate Bay ’s tracker .
Many of the screenshots being used clearly state there is no connection to the tracker .
Additionally , prosecutor Håkan Roswall did n’t adequately explain the function of DHT which allows for so called “ trackerless ” torrents .
The flaw in the evidence was pointed out by Fredrik Neij ( TiAMO ) , who requested to comment on Roswall ’s explanation of how BitTorrent actually works .
Fredrik said that the prosecution misunderstood the technology , and told the court that the evidence does n’t show that the Pirate Bay ’s trackers are used .
This has resulted in prosecutor Håkan Roswall having to drop all charges relating to “ assisting copyright infringement ” , so the remaining charges are simply ‘ assisting making available ’ .
“ Everything related to reproduction will be removed from the claim , ” he said .
The defense was happy to see that already half of the charges were dropped during the morning session of the second day .
“ This is a sensation .
It is very rare to win half the target in just one and a half days and it is clear that the prosecutor took strong note of what we said yesterday , ” said defense lawyer Per E Samuelson .
Peter Althin , representing Peter Sunde said , “ It is clear that this is an advantage for the accused . ”
“ EPIC WINNING LOL , ” Peter himself later commented on Twitter .
IFPI was quick to release a statement where they try to spin the dropped charges into something good .
“ It ’s a largely technical issue that changes nothing in terms of our compensation claims and has no bearing whatsoever on the main case against The Pirate Bay .
In fact it simplifies the prosecutor ’s case by allowing him to focus on the main issue , which is the making available of copyrighted works , ” IFPI ’s legal counsel said .
During the remainder of the morning session it was mostly prosecutor Håkan Roswall talking .
Among other things he explained in detail how email works ( made no mistakes there ) .
Several details on the hardware that was taken during the raid in 2006 were discussed , as well as invoices and email conversations about server costs .
After the lunch break , around 1:30 pm the court decided to end the day early .
Tomorrow morning the prosecution will continue to build ( or break ) their case and on Thursday the defense will have its say .
How Not To Sort By Average Rating
By Evan Miller
February 6 , 2009 ( Changes )
Translations : Dutch Estonian German Russian Ukrainian
PROBLEM : You are a web programmer .
You have users .
Your users rate stuff on your site .
You want to put the highest - rated stuff at the top and lowest - rated at the bottom .
You need some sort of “ score ” to sort by .
WRONG SOLUTION # 1 : Score = ( Positive ratings ) − ( Negative ratings )
Why it is wrong : Suppose one item has 600 positive ratings and 400 negative ratings : 60 % positive .
Suppose item two has 5,500 positive ratings and 4,500 negative ratings : 55 % positive .
This algorithm puts item two ( score = 1000 , but only 55 % positive ) above item one ( score = 200 , and 60 % positive ) .
WRONG .
Sites that make this mistake : Urban Dictionary
WRONG SOLUTION # 2 : Score = Average rating = ( Positive ratings ) / ( Total ratings )
Why it is wrong : Average rating works fine if you always have a ton of ratings , but suppose item 1 has 2 positive ratings and 0 negative ratings .
Suppose item 2 has 100 positive ratings and 1 negative rating .
This algorithm puts item two ( tons of positive ratings ) below item one ( very few positive ratings ) .
WRONG .
Sites that make this mistake : Amazon.com
CORRECT SOLUTION : Score = Lower bound of Wilson score confidence interval for a Bernoulli parameter
Say what :
We need to balance the proportion of positive ratings with the uncertainty of a small number of observations .
Fortunately , the math for this was worked out in 1927 by Edwin B. Wilson .
What we want to ask is :
Given the ratings I have , there is a 95 % chance that the “ real ” fraction of positive ratings is at least what ?
Wilson gives the answer .
Considering only positive and negative ratings ( i.e. not a 5 - star scale ) , the lower bound on the proportion of positive ratings is given by :
( Use minus where it says plus / minus to calculate the lower bound . )
Here p̂ is the observed fraction of positive ratings , z α/2 is the ( 1 - α / 2 ) quantile of the standard normal distribution , and n is the total number of ratings .
The same formula implemented in Ruby :
require ' statistics2 ' def ci_lower_bound ( pos , n , confidence ) if n == 0 return 0 end z = Statistics2.pnormaldist(1-( 1 - confidence ) /2 ) phat = 1.0 * pos /n ( phat + z*z / ( 2*n ) - z * Math.sqrt ( ( phat * ( 1 - phat ) +z*z / ( 4*n ) ) /n ) ) /( 1+z*z/n)
end
pos is the number of positive ratings , n is the total number of ratings , and confidence refers to the statistical confidence level : pick 0.95 to have a 95 % chance that your lower bound is correct , 0.975 to have a 97.5 % chance , etc .
The z - score in this function never changes , so if you do n’t have a statistics package handy or if performance is an issue you can always hard - code a value here for z .
( Use 1.96 for a confidence level of 0.95 . )
UPDATE , April 2012 : Here is an illustrative SQL statement that will do the trick , assuming you have a widgets table with positive and negative ratings , and you want to sort them on the lower bound of a 95 % confidence interval :
SELECT widget_id , ( ( positive + 1.9208 ) / ( positive + negative ) - 1.96 * SQRT ( ( positive * negative ) / ( positive + negative ) + 0.9604 ) / ( positive + negative ) ) / ( 1 + 3.8416 / ( positive + negative ) ) AS ci_lower_bound FROM widgets WHERE positive + negative >
0 ORDER BY ci_lower_bound DESC ;
If your boss does n’t believe that such a complicated SQL statement could possibly return a useful result , just compare the results to the other two method described above :
SELECT widget_id , ( positive - negative ) AS net_positive_ratings FROM widgets ORDER BY net_positive_ratings DESC ; SELECT widget_id , positive / ( positive + negative ) AS average_rating FROM widgets ORDER BY average_rating DESC ;
You will quickly see that the extra bit of math makes all the good stuff bubble up to the top .
( But before running this SQL on a massive database , talk to your friendly neighborhood database administrator about proper use of indexes . )
UPDATE , March 2016 : Here ’s the same formula in Excel :
= IFERROR ((([ @ [ Up Votes ] ] + 1.9208 ) / ( [ @ [ Up Votes ] ] + [ @ [ Down Votes ] ] ) - 1.96 * SQRT ( ( [ @ [ Up Votes ] ] * [ @ [ Down Votes ] ] ) / ( [ @ [ Up Votes ] ] + [ @ [ Down Votes ] ] ) + 0.9604 ) / ( [ @ [ Up Votes ] ] + [ @ [ Down Votes ] ] ) ) / ( 1 + 3.8416 / ( [ @ [ Up Votes ] ] + [ @ [ Down Votes ] ] ) )
,
0 )
I initially devised this method for a Chuck Norris - style fact generator to honor of one of my professors , but it has since caught on at places like Reddit , Yelp , and Digg .
OTHER APPLICATIONS
The Wilson score confidence interval is n’t just for sorting , of course .
It is useful whenever you want to know with confidence what percentage of people took some sort of action .
For example , it could be used to :
Detect spam / abuse :
What percentage of people who see this item will mark it as spam ?
Create a “ best of ” list :
What percentage of people who see this item will mark it as “ best of ” ?
Create a “ Most emailed ” list :
What percentage of people who see this page will click “ Email ” ?
Indeed , it may be more useful in a “ top rated ” list to display those items with the highest number of positive ratings per page view , download , or purchase , rather than positive ratings per rating .
Many people who find something mediocre will not bother to rate it at all ; the act of viewing or purchasing something and declining to rate it contains useful information about that item ’s quality .
CHANGES
Apr. 20 , 2016 : Added Excel implementation ( thanks to Alessandro Apolloni )

Flock Contemplates Migrating from Mozilla Code to Chrome
by Ostatic Staff - Mar. 03 , 2009
According to Mike Arrington at TechCrunch , several sources say that the Mozilla - based " social " browser , Flock , will soon shed its Mozilla code base and start using Google 's Chrome framework for future releases .
Flock 's CEO , Shawn Hardin , responded to Arrington 's post , saying that the browser 's upcoming 2.1 release is being developed , and will be released with , its traditional Mozilla underpinnings .
Hardin does not explicitly say that Flock will move to Chrome , only that the browser space has been " heating up " rapidly in the last few months , and that the Flock development team " will continue to make architectural decisions that balance what 's best for our users and what 's best for Flock as a business . "
It seems safe to say that even if Flock has n't finalized any decisions on whether or not ( or when ) to adopt a Chrome base , it has come up for discussion .
Even if moving Flock from a Mozilla to Chrome foundation is , programming - wise , fairly straightforward , there are other issues to ponder .
Chrome , of course , is very new .
It 's officially out of beta , but it 's still new .
This is n't necessarily a bad thing , but it could complicate , at the very least , Flock 's planning process in the short term .
Chrome is still a Windows - only browser , for instance ( though early summer should bring Chrome 's first Linux and Mac builds ) .
Flock has dubbed itself " the social web browser . "
In many ways , it 's very much Firefox with numerous social networking and content creation tools already built in .
This is a strong point for Flock , as it runs significantly faster and more smoothly than a Firefox installation retro- fitted with a lot of add - ons , extensions , and plug-ins enabled .
Moving this to the Chrome framework would be an effort at the outset , but when the migration was complete , code upkeep and development would n't be radically different .
The tricky part would be not losing any of Flock 's current features in the move -- instead ( hopefully ) improving existing functions and adding new features .
How well will it make the transition , and if any features are not quite what they were on the Mozilla code , will users understand why ?
Will users wait even an incremental release or two to get any transitional bugs out ?
It 's possible they would .
Flock seems to have a different user base than Firefox .
Flock has had seven million downloads over the past few years , and Hardin attributes most of these to " word of mouth " recommendations .
It 's not at all a slouchy browser .
It 's fast , it 's easy to use -- and though it specifically focuses on social aspects of web browsing , the smaller pool of users seem , generally , more technically inclined than the Firefox crowd .
Another area of consideration for Flock 's developers has to be the lack of extensions in the Chrome world .
Though this should change in the near future , Flock 's ability to run most of Firefox 's extensions is a plus for the browser .
Consider , though , the idea that Flock developers might produce a browser that runs on Chrome that pulls the best from that framework , yet manages to bring Firefox - esque strengths and a familiar - but - different - enough user interface and feature set to it .
One of the most heated areas of discussion in the Chrome on Linux camp is making it feel native .
Flock , with its Mozilla history , could quite possibly bring something new and unique to the Chrome development arena .
After all , it managed to do so with Firefox .
UPDATE TO THIS STORY : Om Malik , on GigaOm , covered this story yesterday as well .
For his post , " Who Says Flock Switching to Chrome ?
Not Flock , " he notes a Tweet from Flock employee and director of engineering Matthew Willis saying this : “ No , we have n’t switched .
We ’ve looked at it , just as we ’ve looked at Mozilla 2 , and will look at whatever else is promising . ”
Check out more details in the GigaOm post .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stump , a mellow 10 - year - old Sussex spaniel , made history on Tuesday as the oldest dog and first of its breed to win the coveted Best In Show at the prestigious 133rd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
The new U.S. top dog overcame formidable odds , emerging victorious after five years of retirement from the show dog ring , and a protracted illness in the interim which his handler said nearly claimed his life .
Stump , formally named “ Ch Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee , ” spent two years recovering from the illness “ and this was his outing .
It turned out to be a big one , ” Scott Sommer said of the champion with whom he lives in Houston .
Sommer , who also handled the 2001 winner JR , a bichon frise who is Stump ’s housemate , said he had no grand visions of winning when he decided just last week to bring the plodding spaniel to the show , which had more than 2,500 entrants representing 170 breeds and varieties from as far away as Russia and Brazil .
“ It was like going for a walk with my pet , ” he said of the high - profile canine competition , which is broadcast live on cable television .
“ It was just fun . ”
The light brown 10 - year - old Sussex spaniel , a relatively rare breed , wowed the sold - out crowd at Madison Square Garden , which through cheers and applause signaled its preference for the lumbering dog , who had won the club ’s sporting group title in 2004 , among the seven best in show competitors .
Judge Sari Brewster Tietjen said Stump “ is just everything you ’d want .
In the end , I just could n’t say no to him . ”
After awarding the dog his 51st best in show , she said he was a stellar example of the breed , and added that she was totally unaware of his advanced age .
Before Tuesday , the oldest best in show victor was an 8 - year - old papillon .
In the coming days , Stump will bask in the kind of limelight traditionally reserved for more established single - named celebrities like Madonna or JLo as he embarks on a round of national television appearances .
But Sommer said this is definitely his swan song in the ring .
“ Oh yes , without a doubt , this is it , ” he said .
Upon returning home , the dog will go back to favorite activities such as “ meeting people , sleeping , saying hello to people , and sleeping , ” as well as playing with his favorite green Grinch toy , said Sommer , who co-owns Stump with Connecticut residents Cecelia Ruggles and Beth Dowd .
The other breeds vying for the big prize on Tuesday were a standard poodle , a Scottish terrier , a Scottish deerhound , a pulik , a Brussels griffon and giant schnauzer .
Terriers have won best in show most often , prevailing nearly half the time throughout the club ’s history .
The BBC has been forced to apologise to an acclaimed psychologist and writer after editing her derogatory comments about religion so that a radio programme broadcast " the opposite " of what she had said .
Dorothy Rowe complained to the corporation that her interview on the Radio 2 programme What Do You Believe ?
had been so heavily edited that the final version misrepresented her views .
During a 50 - minute recorded interview , Rowe , best known for her work on depression , had attempted to comment on the subject proposed by the programme 's producer : " Why so many people want to believe in God and search for faith . "
But she was aghast to hear how her words were eventually used .
In an email to the corporation , published on her website , Rowe stated : " My words were edited to make it sound that I held a favourable opinion of religion in that it gave a structure to a person 's life .
What was not broadcast was what I had said about how such structures can be damaging to people .
Being misquoted in this way concerned me greatly . "
Rowe , who says she is one of the BBC 's biggest fans , was never likely to keep her complaints private .
An Australian who spends much of her time in the UK , she has become one of the most respected modern - day thinkers , named as one of the six wisest people in the UK by a magazine and voted one of the world 's 100 living geniuses in a global poll .
Rowe , who is in Australia promoting a new book , said on her website she had no option but to complain as she was acutely aware of the dangers of " having something in the public domain that did not represent my views " and which would " could cause me considerable problems , particularly when the subject matter was religion " .
She said the interview " sounds like I am giving unqualified praise to religious belief .
There is no mention of what I talked ... about at length , that religious belief can cause immense misery .
I often summarise this with : ' The church keeps me in business ' . "
The latest row over the BBC 's production methods comes soon after the Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand saga and a string of phone voting scandals which have undermined confidence in the corporation .
The BBC has promised to introduce tighter editorial controls .
After hearing the broadcast , Rowe emailed David Barber , the BBC 's head of compliance .
Barber , who later resigned over the Ross - Brand furore , passed the complaint to Christine Morgan , executive producer at the BBC 's religion and ethics department , who apologised to Rowe , saying she was " very concerned to find that , as you say , the programme did not accurately reflect the view you expressed " .
But on her website Rowe accuses Morgan of " saying she was sorry I was distressed , not that she was sorry that I had suffered an injury " .
The row has provided ammunition for secular critics who accuse the BBC of using its programmes to promote religion .
Terry Sanderson , president of the National Secular Society , who was interviewed for the same programme as Rowe , said : " I gave a long interview , but when I listened to the finished product it contained just a couple of very brief soundbites from me which were not representative of the thoughts I had expressed ...
This programme was the most blatant piece of religious propaganda I have heard for a long time . "
A reply to a Freedom of Information request passed to the Observer reveals that the corporation spent almost £ 10 m last year on its religious affairs unit in Manchester .
According to the BBC 's annual report , religious broadcasting on BBC radio rose from 1,078 hours in 2006 - 07 to 1,114 hours in 2007 - 08 .
A spokeswoman for the corporation said : " The BBC 's religion and ethics department acknowledged that extracts from an interview with Dorothy Rowe - broadcast in the programme What Do You Believe ?
- misrepresented her views on religion and has apologised to her . "
Rowe was also invited to write an article published on the BBC 's religion and ethics website explaining her views .

At his first presidential press conference , Helen Thomas asked President Obama if he knew of any Middle East nation that had nuclear weapons .
He knew the answer but he dodged the question .
When it comes to the issue of nuclear weapons in the Middle East , there is an elephant in the room that nobody wants to acknowledge and that elephant is Israel 's large nuclear bomb arsenal .
First we went after non-existent nuclear weapons in Iraq and now we are consumed with the possibility that Iran might develop nuclear weapons in the future .
But what nobody wants to talk about is the fact that Israel has had a secret nuclear weapons program for over 30 years that has produced well over 200 nuclear bombs .
Ever since Mordechai Vanunu , the Israeli nuclear technician , confirmed the existence of Israel ’s nuclear weapons program with his photographs of the secret underground bomb facility that were published in the London Sunday Times in 1986 , the world has known that Israel has been making nuclear bombs but has pretended that they do not exist .
If we truly want to stop the nuclear arms race in the Middle East , we must require that Israel open its nuclear weapons program to inspection .
Israel is not a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refuses to officially confirm or deny having a nuclear arsenal , or to having developed nuclear weapons , or even to having a nuclear weapons program .
If we want Iran to renounce nuclear weapons , we must also get Israel to stop building bombs in secret and begin dismantling its large nuclear arsenal .
Our goal must be a nuclear free Middle East and this must include Israel .
I talked with Mordechai Vanunu in Jerusalem in March , 2005 and here are my notes from that interview :
" I worked from 1976 to 1985 at the Israeli secret underground nuclear weapons production facility at the Dimona nuclear plant in the Negev desert .
During my time there , I was involved in processing plutonium for 10 nuclear bombs per year .
I realized that my country had already processed enough plutonium for 200 nuclear weapons .
I became really afraid when we started processing Lithium 6 which is only used for the hydrogen bomb .
I felt that I had to prevent a nuclear holocaust in the Middle East so I took 60 pictures of the underground nuclear weapons processing plant some 75 meters under the Dimona plant .
I resigned my post and left Israel in 1986 .
I first went to Australia and then made a connection with the Times in London .
After a group of nuclear scientists verified my photos as proving Israeli nuclear weapons production , my story was published in England .
A few months later , I was kidnapped by the Israelis in Rome and sent secretly by ship to Israel where I was subjected to a closed military trial without counsel .
I was sentenced to 18 years in prison .
I spent 12 years in solitary confinement .
Now I am trapped inside Israel and I ’m being threatened with more prison time for speaking to people like you .
I want to leave Israel and come to America where I can live as a free human being . ”
( Vanunu was released from prison in April 2004 but was prohibited from leaving Israel .
The Israeli government continues to keep him in Israel against his will .
He was again imprisoned for 6 months in 2007 for speaking to journalists and foreigners . )
Update Wednesday , 9:19 a.m. : Our own Michael
Yo just broke this news to Portia de Rossi !
Her response ?
" That 's crazy that you just told me that .
Thank you . "
( Such a polite cast ! )
So what was the holdup with Michael ?
Says Portia , " I do n't know , I honestly do n't .
I spoke to Jason Bateman and Will Arnett ; I think it was just a matter of timing .
I do n't know . "
Portia reports that she does n't have a script yet , but she is on board even though all the contracts still need their T's crossed and I 's dotted : " I just verbally said , ' Hey , I 'll do it too . ' "
As for plot twists , Michael wanted to know : Would there be a Jason / Portia hookup in the movie ?
Says Portia , " Oh , we 're not siblings anymore !
That 's weird .
I do n't know about that .
That 's creepy . "
She says creepy .
What say you ?
Post in the comments !

Oh happy day !
Inside sources close to the negotiations of the upcoming Arrested Development movie tell me that Superbad and Juno star ( and before that , hello , George - Michael Bluth ! )
Michael Cera has finally agreed to do the feature film project .
Cera had been the lone holdout among the show 's stars for several weeks .
All other Bluths , including Jason Bateman , Portia de Rossi , Will Arnett , Tony Hale , Jessica Walter , Jeffrey Tambor and David Cross , are already game , according to sources .
So when exactly will the movie happen ?
Here ’s why , in no particular order , we think the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ( XMPP ) will rock your world soon :
Real - time web applications are in high demand , and XMPP fits the requirements perfectly — it excels in rapid peer - to - peer or broadcast messaging .
Response times are crucial for the new breed of web applications , and polling - based solutions are very suboptimal .
Enter XMPP and BOSH .
The maturing of the BOSH protocol , coupled with the resurgence of excellent Javascript libraries have , IMHO , opened up extremely cool new worlds via the browser .
Strophe , in itself , is a treasure .
XMPP servers , which are essentially make or break an XMPP application , are rapidly maturing beyond instant messaging .
Especially eJabberd .
It ’s possible to deploy a custom eJabberd module based on the XMPP protocol but tailored specifically for your application in a matter of hours .
The initial learning curve is offset by the rapid development speed of the Erlang language ( thanks to its immutability ) afterwards .
While there ’s a lot of focus on developing pure web applications , as of now nobody has figured out a great way to make money off the Instant Messaging protocol .
This will be a boon for XMPP development very soon as new startups try to tap into that market .
The web framework wars are slowly winding down , and in the end developers are left with the classic problems — many will now be turning to alternative tech for the problems that most web frameworks do n’t even attempt to solve ; XMPP is the solution for many of these problems .
The community , albeit small , is growing and passionate .
Extremely passionate .
Search for XMPP on Twitter .
The mailing lists are very active as well .
Apart from all of these , as a developer I find writing XMPP applications to be a very engaging and enjoyable activity .
Word will spread , and there will be new converts .
At Intridea , we ’ve been actively developing and integrating XMPP into our products , and we will be leveraging it on a case - by - case basis for our client work .
You ’ll be hearing more about that shortly .
Red Pandas are only distantly related to their better known black and white Giant Panda cousins , but they do share the panda name and a love of bamboo .
While these little furballs were born back in June of 2008 at the Red River Zoo in North Dakota , they are news to us here at ZooBorns and we figured we should share them .
Named Xiao Li ( male ) and Li Ming ( female ) , more pictures and information are available on the Zoo 's Red Panda blog .
From the Red River Zoo 's red panda cub blog :
On June 10 , 2008 one male and one female red panda baby were born at the Red River Zoo .
Early that morning , our female panda Shan Tou was acting different .
She was in her nest box and had brought various toys and branches in with her .
She would n't come out of the nest box and was not interested in food .
I decided to leave her off exhibit and check in on her later .
When I went to check on her that afternoon , I heard a baby panda as soon as I came into the holding area .
( They make a high pitched " wheet " sound ) .
I looked in the nest box and saw at least one baby .
I immediately left to tell the staff the good news .
Later on that evening , I got her to come out of the nest box .
Thats when I saw that there were 2 babies !
It has been 6 years since the zoo last had baby red pandas and the entire staff is thrilled .
The Red River Zoo is very careful with the new cubs .
The first concern is whether the babies are nursing and if the female is producing enough milk .
To check this , the cubs are weighed daily for the first few days , then every 3 days for a month , then weekly after that to make sure they are gaining enough weight .
The second concern is stress on the mother .
If she is stressed she could start moving the babies and accidently injure the babies in the process .
For this reason , since the pandas are most comfortable with me , I am the only one allowed in the holding area for the first couple of weeks .
I also limit the time I am in there - only going in to feed Shan Tou or weigh the cubs .
As I dived in , I took the village youths ' advice – closing my mouth and keeping my eyes firmly shut .
When I surfaced , about 30 yards from where I had hit the chocolate - coloured ferment , my stomach and arms felt as though I had body - surfed down the escalator at London 's King 's Cross station .
That was my first experience of the 800 - mile - long Narmada river that flows through three Indian states – Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra and the often drought - afflicted Gujarat , before flowing into the Indian Ocean .
The purpose of my visit to Gujarat had been to research the plight of 40,000 indigenous people who found themselves imprisoned in the Shoolpaneshwar wildlife sanctuary , which was designed for animals rather than people .
They are victims of an environmental campaign , conducted by groups such as the World Wildlife Fund and its sister organisation , The World Conservation Union , to stop the damming of the Narmada river .
More than 3,000 dams of varying sizes , which would control the Narmada and its 41 tributaries , were proposed by Nehru 's government in the 1940s .
Thirty of these are large projects , including the Sardar Sarovar Project ( SSP ) .
But the SSP quickly became the focus of opposition from international and Indian environmental campaigners , who believed it represented all that is bad about mega- projects in the developing world .
The sanctuary was created as a sop to those who opposed the mega - project and its supposed environmental destruction .
Its creation has robbed thousands of tribal people of their basic rights .
The collection of firewood ( essential for fuel ) was outlawed , as was repairing roads and bridges , as was installing badly needed electricity .
They were all seen as development , and were forbidden under India 's draconian wildlife protection laws .
In researching the sanctuary I made contact with both local people opposed to it and those who wanted the Narmada dam to be finished after decades of delays .
It is often only locals opposed to mega- projects – given access to the media and an international platform by western non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) – whose voices are heard .
This frequently distorts the picture – it was refreshing to find groups and local people who saw the benefits of the dam .
Now has come news of yet another delay in the building of the dams that have been planned since 1946 .
In an interstate dispute , the Congress - led Maharashtra government are halting the installation of gates for the dam and restricting work to a height of 138 metres .
That height is key ; it allows water to flow down channels and canals to the areas affected by drought .
India 's supreme court has to be consulted for every successive five - metre increase in the height of the dam .
The losers in what has become a bitter local and international political struggle are the poor living alongside the river .
They have become little more than a stage army , marched out and back by those who do not want the project completed .
The Indian government has a poor track record in resettling those affected by the construction of dams .
This brought local opposition from tribes expected to move as the Narmada valley flooded .
Urban - based Indian intellectuals such as Vandana Shiva opposed the dam , fearing its impact on traditional rural life .
Novelist Arundhati Roy has suggested that the effect on those being moved was akin to the Holocaust , and that suggesting that this project could benefit millions was " fascist maths " .
Salman Rushdie has also joined the anti-campaign .
Western environmental NGOs , such as the Environmental Defence Fund ( EDF ) and the International River Network ( IRN ) , joined the anti-dam crusade .
The EDF argued that important biodiversity would be lost if the Narmada valley was flooded .
For the US - based NGO , the IRN , " a river is a thing of grace and beauty , a mystery and a metaphor " .
This romantic nonsense has helped slow down a project that could help alleviate millions from poverty .
This opposition became an effective barrier to the dam .
The campaign led by the Narmada Bachao Andolan ( Struggle to Save the Narmada River ) , funded by the EDF , has held up the project 's completion .
NBA supporters have physically attacked local people who accepted compensation for moving .
To an outsider , the dam 's benefits to local people seemed obvious .
It will provide drinking water for an area with a population of 18 million – and for a prospective population that has been projected to reach over 40 million by 2021 .
The dam has a power generation capacity of 1,450 megawatts .
It will provide irrigation facilities to an area the size of the south - east of England .
The project aims to make the area " drought - proof " : and 75 % of Gujarat and 100 % of Rajhastan are prone to droughts .
As the illuminating new book Energise ! , by James Woudhuysen and James Kaplinsky , points out , dams are what we make of them .
Loss of wildlife , the generation of greenhouse gases and even resettlement are a small price to pay compared with the benefits of a dam – if they are well planned and run .
If opponents of the dam had fought for proper resettlement and rehabilitation packages , instead of an unrealistic programme of outright opposition , including the creation of a white elephant of a wildlife sanctuary , then local people would be seeing the benefits of the dam and not contemplating an uncertain future .
Revealed : The ' big - drinking ' son who is in line to inherit control in North Korea
The youngest son of Kim Jong
Il has emerged as hot favourite to take over his ailing father 's dictatorship , it has emerged .
Sources close to the South Korean leader have said Kim Jong
Un is the ideal candidate to take over once his father steps down from power - at least in part because he is a big drinker .
Last month , South Korean news agency Yonhap said Kim Jong Un , was named Kim 's heir apparent .
This TV grab from South Korean TV station KBS shows Kim Jong Un as an 11 - year - old boy
Conservative protesters burn pictures of North Korean leader Kim Jong II and his heir apparent Kim Jong Un
And yesterday Yonhap said Kim Jong
Un had registered his candidacy for March 8 parliamentary elections in a further sign the son is poised to become the country 's next leader .
North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il is reportedly becoming increasingly frail
Jong
Un is due to be formally nominated as successor following the elections and is expected to take on key posts after April .
U.S Secretary of State Hilary Clinton has already expressed concerns over a potential power struggle in the country .
She said the Obama administration was deeply concerned that a potential change in Pyongyang 's ruling structure could raise already heightened tensions between North Korea and its neighbours .
But Kim Jong
II 's closest allies and generals have already promised the army 's loyalty to the ' country 's bloodline ' .
Pak Jae Kyong , a senior general in the defence ministry , promised to defend and honour the ' leadership of our supreme commander . '
Jong
Un emerged as the favourite to succeed his father over his two elder brothers who are seen as weaker rulers .
The family 's chef Kenji Fujimoto was quoted in The Times as saying it was obvious from a young age that Kim Jong Un would replace his father over his brothers Kim Jong Nam and Kim Jong Chul .
' If power is to be handed over then Jong Un is the best for it , ' he said .
' He has superb physical gifts , is a big drinker and never admits defeat .
The SOM ( self organizing maps ) are some very intuitive neural networks .
There are a lot of more detailed description of these networks but here is a more intuitive description .
You have a number of neurons usually arranged in a 2D or 3D grid , each neuron has an associated weight vector .
The input , which is a vector of the same size as the weight vector is connected to each neuron .
The natural association is that each vector is a point in an n-dimensional space .
By providing , during the learning phase , an uniformly distributed number of n-points to the network the neurons will arrange themself uniformly in the n-dimensions hypercube from which the n-points come from .
Otherwise said , the neurons will classify the ( sub ) space , each neuron representing a partition of that ( sub ) space .
When provided with a new point the network will act such that a single neuron will fire and that neuron will be the one closer to the provided sample .
The network will classify the new point in an appropriate partition .
As simple , graphical , example is the one provided bellow where a 2D space is classified using the euclidian distance .
By starting with neurons with random weights the network learns itself into an uniform grid by providing random 2D points in the ( 1,1 ) – ( - 1 , - 1 ) square .
My interest in these networks was primary classification related and I tried to use them for image classification .
By using a weight vector consisting of the 16 point histogram in the LAB colorspace I achieved some interesting results .
The method works very good for color comparison of the images but surely it is incomplete as more features are needed to classify an image : texture , object information etc .
Here are some positive results based only on color histogram space :
I implemented everything in python and you can find the base network and the 2d example attached .
I am curious about any ideas on this subject .
update : 11-02-2009
There has been some demand for the image algorithms and since the image code is quite a mess of various tries here are the ideas I had , in order to find “ the way ” to define “ features ” for an image which I can then use as coordinates in the som space :
histogram [ H1 , … H8 ] => no color data combined color histograms [ Hred1 , …. Hgreen1 … ] => some strange effects because the RGB is no a natural colorspace moving to LAB space ( these are the results here ) => does not count for granularity ( you can have the same result for on big blue blob and 10 small blue blobs ) image segmentation and applying the algorithm to most representative segments => does not count for texture haar wavelets , …
I think that in the case of images the biggest problem is to find some “ coordinates ” which define them as required for the comparison and not to compare the images after based on these coordinates .

What webhooks are and why you should care
Webhooks are user - defined HTTP callbacks .
Here ’s a common example :
You go to github .
There ’s a textbox for their code post webhook .
You drop in a URL .
Now when you post your code to github , github will HTTP POST to your chosen URL with details about the code post .
There is no simpler way to allow open ended integration with arbitrary web services .
This tiny interface is used in obvious ways : bug tracking integration , sms messaging , IRC and twitter .
The same tiny interface is also used in non-obvious ways , like Run Code Run which offers to build and run your project ’s tests for you .
All by just plugging a runcoderun.com URL into GitHub .
Webhooks today offer a lot of value as an instant notification mechanism .
Have events your users care about ?
Give them a webhook for those events and you ’ve given them the power and flexibility to integrate that event stream into their life .
For all of that power , webhooks are impressively simple to implement .
It ’s a one liner in almost every language .
urllib .
urlopen ( user .
webhook . url )
While there ’s a lot of value in webhooks today , it ’s the future that really interests me .
Webhooks are composable .
You ’ll point a webhook at a site that will call other webhooks .
It might process the data , record it , fork it off to multiple webhooks or something stranger still .
Yahoo
Pipes tried to do this , but ultimately you were limited to what Yahoo Pipes was designed to do .
Webhooks can be integrated and implemented everywhere .
They piggyback the fundamental decentralized nature of the web .
I imagine a future where twitter feed updates instantly call a webhook .
I ’ve pointed that webhook at a service that does bayesian filtering .
The filtering has been set up to determine if the tweet looks time - sensitive “ Anyone interested in getting dinner tonight ? ” vs time - insensitive “ Webhooks are cool . ”
Time sensitive posts call another webhook , this time set to sms my phone .
Note that nowhere in this future am I writing any code .
I do n’t have to .
It ’s important that we get to this level of customization for the masses .
It ’s also important for adoption that we use the web ’s native verbs .
We understand HTTP on a fundamental level .
It ’s simple , scales and makes sense .
You should care because webhooks will be ubiquitous .
You should care because they ’re going to reshape the internet .
You should care because webhooks are the next step in the evolution of communication on the internet and nothing will be left untouched .

IN THE beginning there was the atheist bus campaign .
And it was good .
Unless , that is , you were one of the many God-fearing folk who considered it blasphemy .
They , however , are planning to get their own back .
A trinity of Christian groups has created its own series of advertisements .
The original ads , from the British Humanist Association , had insisted : " There is probably no God .

Russia accused the US last night of " orchestrating " Europe 's gas crisis as gas deliveries to the EU were halted hours after they resumed , amid venomous exchanges of accusations between Moscow and Kiev .
Gazprom , Russia 's gas company , said its pumping stations began sending gas through Ukraine early yesterday , following a monitoring deal signed in Brussels on Monday .
But hours later , Gazprom said Ukraine was blocking the flow of gas - adding that the US was to blame .
The EU said " little or no gas " flowed yesterday to countries in central and southern Europe suffering acute energy shortages .
Gazprom said Ukraine had stopped shipments and prevented Russian observers from entering its gas stations .
Ukraine said Russia had " provocatively " sent the gas the wrong way , and compared Moscow 's actions to the Nazi siege of Leningrad .
" We believed yesterday that the door for Russian gas was open but again it 's been blocked by the Ukrainians , " said Gazprom 's deputy chairman , Alexander Medvedev .
" It looks like ... they are dancing to the music which is being orchestrated not in Kiev but outside the country . "
The state department dismissed the accusation .
Medvedev later explained he was referring to Ukraine 's strategic partnership deal with the US , which was signed in Washington last month by the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice .
That pact enhances co-operation on defence , energy and trade , including the delivery of gas .
The agreement will also see the US set up a diplomatic mission in the Crimean regional capital of Simferopol - a move likely to infuriate the Kremlin .
The ethnic Russian region has been at the centre of claims that Moscow is trying to fuel separatist sentiments in order to undermine Ukraine 's pro-western leadership .
Last night Medvedev said it was " pretty strange " the charter envisaged co-operation between Ukraine and the US on gas since Ukraine " did n't produce gas " .
" Ukraine has discredited itself .
It 's like a madman with a razorblade in its hands , " he said .
But Ukraine blamed Russia .
Its state energy firm , Naftogaz , said there had not been enough co-ordination over the routes chosen for the gas and the volumes shipped .
" This seriously violates the established practice of reliable functioning of the gas transit system , " Naftogaz said .
Ukrainian officials said Gazprom had " deliberately " sent the gas by a route that would have meant switching off gas to Ukrainian consumers in the east of the country .
Instead of supplying gas via the traditional route , through Russia 's Belgorod and Rostov region , it had been sent on a bypass route which would paralyse supplies to the towns of Donetsk and Luhansk .
" This is just provocation against Ukraine , " said Bohdan Sokolovsky , Ukraine 's commissioner for energy security .
Ukraine 's president , Viktor Yushchenko , went further .
His office compared Russia 's actions to those of the Nazis during the wartime siege of Leningrad .
Andrei Kislinksy , deputy head of Ukraine 's presidential secretariat , said the gas war " increasingly resembles the blockade of Leningrad after the failure of the blitzkrieg " and added that its primary purpose seemed to be about making Yushchenko step down from office .
• This article was amended on Thursday 15 January 2009 .
We originally referred to " Ukraine 's Belgorod and Rostov regions " ; in fact they are part of Russia .
This has been corrected .
Craigslist sued over erotic - services ads

The online forum and classified site Craigslist is once again under fire from law enforcement for running advertisements for erotic services .
This time , the Cook County Sheriff 's Department is going after the site .
On Thursday , Sheriff Thomas Dart filed a federal lawsuit in Illinois accusing Craigslist of " knowingly promoting and facilitating prostitution . "
" Craigslist is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation , " Dart said Thursday .
" Missing children , runaways , abused women and women trafficked in from foreign countries are routinely forced to have sex with strangers because they 're being pimped on Craigslist . "
Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and CEO Jim Buckmaster did not return calls for comment .
Instead , the San Francisco company issued a statement .
" Misuse of Craigslist to facilitate criminal activity is unacceptable , and we continue to work diligently to prevent it , " the statement said .
" Misuse of the site is exceptionally rare compared to how much the site is used for legal purposes .
Regardless , any misuse of the site is not tolerated on Craigslist . "
This was not the first time the company has been accused of allowing its
Web site to be misused .
In November , the attorney general of Connecticut threatened legal action after receiving complaints about photographs depicting nudity .
Eventually , Craigslist came to an agreement with 40 attorneys general around the United States .
The company instituted policies aimed at reducing the amount of prostitution , including requiring advertisers for erotic massage , strippers , escort services and the like to pay a fee with a credit card - fees the famously profit - averse company promised to donate to charity .
Dart said the agreement between Craigslist and the attorneys general has resulted in no appreciable reduction of ads for prostitution on the site .
Furthermore , he said , Craigslist does not monitor the " erotic services " section of the site , and when his officers have attempted to contactCraigslist they have been ignored or not gotten the kind of help they need .
Dart is asking a federal judge to order Craigslist to eliminate its " Erotic Services " section , where most prostitution ads are posted .
He also is seeking reimbursement for tax dollars spent paying the salaries of officers who investigate and arrest those responsible for trafficking women on the Web site .
Craigslist 's Buckmaster said previously that the company is trying to strike a balance , keeping the erotic services section - in part to keep such ads from appearing elsewhere on Craigslist - while also protecting free speech and preventing exploitation .
He hopes Craigslist can be a pioneer in this kind of cooperation as it has been on the Internet .
In its statement Thursday , the company warned that " Craigslist is an extremely unwise choice for those intent on committing crimes , since criminals inevitably leave an electronic trail to themselves that law enforcement officers will follow .
On a daily basis , we are being of direct assistance to police departments and federal authorities nationwide . "
Matt Zimmerman , senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said it is unlikely that the sheriff will win the suit because the Communications Decency Act of 1996 explicitly protects
Web site owners from culpability for criminal activity perpetrated by third parties .
Romney took 20 percent of the vote , followed by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal with 14 percent and Texas Rep. Ron Paul with 13 percent .
Romney wins CPAC straw poll
In one of the opening skirmishes in the long – and almost certainly bloody – GOP battle for the 2012 nomination , former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney won the annual Conservative Political Action Convention straw poll Saturday .
While hardly a scientific poll , the CPAC straw vote offers early insight into conservatives ’ thinking as Republicans find themselves shut out of power in the White House and Congress for the first time in 16 years .
And Romney 's victory will give some credence to growing sentiment that he has quietly put himself in strong position for the 2012 contest after losing to John McCain last year .

Romney took 20 percent of the vote , followed by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal with 14 percent , Texas Rep. Ron Paul with 13 percent , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin with 13 percent , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich with 10 percent and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 7 percent .
Others on the ballot included South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist .
Nine percent were undecided .
With no unifying Republican figure to rally around after the desultory 2008 elections , the straw poll results reflect tensions among conservatives about how best to oppose the Obama Administration ’s agenda – through openly wishing for failure , a sentiment voiced recently by talk show host Rush Limbaugh , or working with the new president at a time when the American public seek a larger role for government amid the deepening recession .
Neither Palin or Jindal were in attendance at the CPAC conference , which likely had an impact on their showings .
CPAC organizers suggested the straw poll also aimed to gauge conservatives ’ views on issue positions Republicans should adopt in the coming years .
The straw poll gathered participants ’ views on matters like the wisdom of “ establishing direct U.S. dialogue with countries like Iran and groups like Hamas . ”
Still , attendees very much had 2012 on their minds .
Matt Lewis , a conservative writer for AOL ’s “ Political Machine ” said he wanted to back Gingrich , but does n’t think the former speaker will actually run in 2012 .
So he went for Palin instead .
“ Whether it ’s Jindal , Romney or Palin , there are quality conservative candidates that I would be excited to support , ” Lewis said .
“ At this moment , she ’s as close as we get to a frontrunner and national leader . ”
“ I think she ’s a solid conservative .
I was a huge supporter of her during the presidential campaign .
I think she ’s the fresh face that offers change , but conservative change , ” Lewis said .
“ I also think she learned a lot of lessons on the campaign trail last time .
I know some people think she might not have preformed as well as she might have , but that ’s part of her education . ”
CPAC balloting is only a crude barometer of Republican sentiment three years ahead of the next GOP presidential primary scrum .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney claimed the mantle the last two years , but foundered in his presidential bid .
In fact he used his 2008 CPAC speech to drop out of the race even as he edged out eventual GOP nominee John McCain .
And the 2006 winner was then - Virginia Republican Sen. George Allen , who took 22 percent of the votes cast .
Allen was defeated by Democrat Jim Webb that November and has since largely disappeared from the political scene .
Rank - and - file conservatives attending the convention suggested the 2012 race is still wide open .
Ernie Simmons , owner of Diener Consultants , in Lancaster , Pa. , said he voted for Jindal , though he liked the other candidates .
He said the Louisiana governor would best protect gun rights , one of the main focuses of his marketing firm .
“ I like Palin , but I do n’t know how she could possibly survive ” a one - on - one race against Obama .
“ I like Huckabee a lot .
But he might be too soft to win .
Jindal ’s the future . ”
Jenna Robinson , a graduate student in North Carolina , who works at the Raleigh - based John William Pope Center for Higher Education , said she voted for Ron Paul .
The libertarian - leaning lawmaker has been proven right about the nation ’s precarious financial situation , she said .
“ I feel like he ’s the candidate most likely to stick to his convictions on individual liberty . ”
SELinux
1. Introduction
Security - Enhanced Linux ( SELinux ) is a mandatory access control ( MAC ) security mechanism implemented in the kernel .
SELinux was first introduced in CentOS 4 and significantly enhanced in later CentOS releases .
These enhancements mean that content varies as to how to approach SELinux over time to solve problems .
1.1 . Some of the Problems
In order to better understand why SELinux is important and what it can do for you , it is easiest to look at some examples .
Without SELinux enabled , only traditional discretionary access control ( DAC ) methods such as file permissions or access control lists ( ACLs ) are used to control the file access of users .
Users and programs alike are allowed to grant insecure file permissions to others or , conversely , to gain access to parts of the system that should not otherwise be necessary for normal operation .
For example :
Administrators have no way to control users :
A user could set world readable permissions on sensitive files such as ssh keys and the directory containing such keys , customarily : ~/.ssh /
Processes can change security properties : A user 's mail files should be readable only by that user , but the mail client software has the ability to change them to be world readable
Processes inherit user 's rights : Firefox , if compromised by a trojaned version , could read a user 's private ssh keys even though it has no reason to do so .
Essentially under the traditional DAC model , there are two privilege levels , root and user , and no easy way to enforce a model of least - privilege .
Many processes that are launched by root later drop their rights to run as a restricted user and some processes may be run in a chroot jail but all of these security methods are discretionary .
1.2 . The Solution
SELinux follows the model of least - privilege more closely .
By default under a strict enforcing setting , everything is denied and then a series of exceptions policies are written that give each element of the system ( a service , program or user ) only the access required to function .
If a service , program or user subsequently tries to access or modify a file or resource not necessary for it to function , then access is denied and the action is logged .
Because SELinux is implemented within the kernel , individual applications do not need to be especially written or modified to work under SELinux although , of course , if written to watch for the error codes which SELinux returns , vide infra , might work better afterwards .
If SELinux blocks an action , this is reported to the underlying application as a normal ( or , at least , conventional ) " access denied " type error to the application .
Many applications , however , do not test all return codes on system calls and may return no message explaining the issue or may return in a misleading fashion .
Please note , however , that the hypothetical examples posed to provide possible greater safety of e.g. , constraining programs authorized to a limited set of programs permitted to read a user 's ~/.ssh / directory , preventing a Mail Delivery Agent from tampering with group owernship or setting on group or other file read permissions , or a web browser being constrained from reading the user 's home directory have not been implemented in SELinux policies accompanying any version of CentOS up to version 6 . CentOS 6 and 7 have limited support for confining user programs as described above , but does n't have as much coverage over user programs as targeted system daemons .
If an admin wishes to change from the default unconfined login configuration , they can see the section below on Role - Based Access Control .
2. SELinux Modes
SELinux has three basic modes of operation , of which Enforcing is set as the installation default mode .
There is , however , an additional qualifier of targeted or mls which control how pervasive SELinux rules are applied , with targeted being the less stringent level .
Enforcing :
The default mode which will enable and enforce the SELinux security policy on the system , denying access and logging actions
Permissive :
In Permissive mode , SELinux is enabled but will not enforce the security policy , only warn and log actions .
Permissive mode is useful for troubleshooting SELinux issues
Disabled : SELinux is turned off
The SELinux mode can be viewed and changed by using the SELinux Management GUI tool available on the Administration menu or from the command line by running ' system - config - selinux ' ( the SELinux Management GUI tool is part of the policycoreutils - gui package and is not installed by default ) .
Users who prefer the command line may use the ' sestatus ' command to view the current SELinux status :
# sestatus SELinux status : enabled SELinuxfs mount : / selinux Current mode : enforcing
Mode from config file : enforcing Policy version : 21 Policy from config file : targeted
The ' setenforce ' command may be used to switch between Enforcing and Permissive modes on the fly but note that these changes do not persist through a system reboot .
To make changes persistent through a system reboot , edit the ' SELINUX= ' line in /etc / selinux / config for either ' enforcing ' , ' permissive ' , or ' disabled ' .
For example : ' SELINUX=permissive '
Note :
When switching from Disabled to either Permissive or Enforcing mode , it is highly recommended that the system be rebooted and the filesystem relabeled .
3. SELinux Policy
As noted , SELinux follows the model of least - privilege ; by default everything is denied and then a policy is written that gives each element of the system only the access required to function .
This description best describes the strict policy .
However , such a policy is difficult to write that would be suitable in the wide range of circumstances that a product such as Enterprise Linux is likely to be used .
The end result is that SELinux is likely to cause problems for system administrators and end users and rather than resolve these issues , system administrators may just disable SELinux thereby defeating the built - in protections .
By design , SELinux allows different policies to be written that are interchangeable .
The default policy in CentOS is the targeted policy which " targets " and confines selected system processes .
In CentOS 4 only 15 defined targets existed ( including httpd , named , dhcpd , mysqld ) .
Later , in CentOS 5 this number had risen to over 200 targets .
All other system processes and all remaining userspace programs , as well as any in - house applications , that is everything else on the system , runs in an unconfined domain and is not covered by the SELinux protection model .
One goal might be for every process that is installed and , by default , running at boot should be run in a confined domain .
The targeted policy is designed to protect as many key processes as possible without adversely affecting the end user experience and most users should be totally unaware that SELinux is even running .
4. SELinux Access Control
The targeted SELinux policy on CentOS ships with 4 forms of access control :
Type Enforcement ( TE ) : Type Enforcement is the primary mechanism of access control used in the targeted policy
Role - Based Access Control ( RBAC ) : Based around SELinux users ( not necessarily the same as the Linux user ) , but not used in the default configuration of the targeted policy
Multi-Level Security ( MLS ) : Not commonly used and often hidden in the default targeted policy .
Multi-Category Security ( MCS ) : An extension of Multi-Level Security , used in the targeted policy to implement compartmentalization of virtual machines and containers through sVirt .
All processes and files have an SELinux security context .
Let 's see these in action by looking at the SELinux security context of the Apache homepage : '/var/www/html/index.html ' {{{$ ls - Z /var/www/html/index.html -rw-r--r-- username username system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/index.html
}}}
Note :
The - Z switch will work with most utilities to show SELinux security contexts ( e.g , 'ls - Z ' , 'ps ax Z ' etc ) .
In addition to the standard file permissions and ownership , we can see the SELinux security context fields : system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t .
This is based upon user : role : type:mls .
In our example above , user : role : type fields are displayed and mls is hidden .
Within the default targeted policy , type is the important field used to implement Type Enforcement , in this case httpd_sys_content_t .
Now consider the SELinux security context of the Apache web server process : ' httpd '
$ ps axZ | grep httpd system_u:system_r:httpd_t 3234 ?
Ss 0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd
Here we see the from the type field that Apache is running under the httpd_t type domain .
Finally , let 's look at the SELinux security context of a file in our home directory :
$ ls - Z /home/username/myfile.txt -rw-r--r-- username username user_u:object_r:user_home_t /home/username/myfile.txt
where we see the type is user_home_t , the default type for files in a user 's home directory .
Access is only allowed between similar types , so Apache running as httpd_t can read / var/www/html/index.html of type httpd_sys_content_t .
Because Apache runs in the httpd_t domain and does not have the userid: username , it can not access / home / username / myfile .
txt even though this file is world readable because / home / username / myfile.txt SELinux security context is not of type httpd_t .
If Apache were to be exploited , assuming for the sake of this example that the root account right needed to effect a SELinux re-labeling into another context were not obtained , it would not be able to start any process not in the httpd_t domain ( which prevents escalation of privileges ) or access any file not in an httpd_t related domain .
4.1 . Role - Based Access Control ( RBAC )
Although the default configuration of the targeted policy is to use unconfined logins , the administrator can quite easily switch to the Role - Based Access Control model .
This model also switches to ' strict ' mode for user domains , to allow targeting each program individually .
To enable this , use semanage - login to add a login mapping for your user .
semanage login - a -s " staff_u " -r " s0-s0:c0.c1023 " < username >
The semanage - login command maps a Linux username to an SELinux user named " staff_u " , with an MLS / MCS range of " s0-s0:c0.c1023 " .
After this , logging in will result in id - Z returning staff_u:staff_r:staff_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 opposed to unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0 .
Though staff_r is not a role meant for administration , it is a role that allows the user to change to other roles .
When an admin would like to do system administration tasks they should switch to the sysadm_r role using the -r flag in sudo ,
sudo -r sysadm_r -i
This can be automated by adding a configuration file under / etc / sudoers.d/ , to map the user to a default admin role .
% wheel ALL=( ALL ) TYPE=sysadm_t ROLE=sysadm_r ALL
It is still possible to login as an unconfined user or switch to the unconfined role via newrole , although the benefits of confined user domains are then lost .
It is also possible to remove the ability to do this by creating a new SELinux user associated with only a select set of roles ,
semanage user - a - R " staff_r sysadm_r system_r -r " s0-s0:c0.c1023 " my_staff_u
Then substituting staff_u for my_staff_u in the semanage - login command .
Now attempting to switch to the unconfined_r role will result in an AVC and SELINUX_ERR message .
If the admin wishes to remove the ability to login as an unconfined user completely , they should remap the __default__ login to a more suitable SELinux user , again using semanage - login .
semanage login -m -s " user_u " -r " s0 " __default__
If a user wishes to login as a role other than their default it is up to the login program to provide this functionality .
SSH allows logging in with an alternative SELinux role by specifying it as part of the login identifier ( e.g. , as a staff user logging in as unconfined_r ) .
ssh < username>/unconfined_r@hostname.net
The strict model that comes with Role - Based Access Control is n't perfect from a perspective of least privilege ; running a quick search using policy analysis tools we can see that several confined programs can still read a users private SSH keys .
sesearch - ACS -t ssh_home_t -c file -p read Found 132 semantic av rules : allow snapperd_t file_type : file { ioctl read getattr lock open } ; allow oddjob_mkhomedir_t user_home_type : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ; allow mplayer_t non_security_file_type : file { ioctl read getattr lock open } ; allow sendmail_t user_home_type : file { ioctl read getattr lock open } ; allow systemd_tmpfiles_t non_auth_file_type : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock relabelfrom relabelto append unlink link rename open } ; allow login_pgm ssh_home_t : file { ioctl read getattr lock open } ; allow ssh_keygen_t ssh_home_t : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ; allow colord_t user_home_type : file { read getattr } ; ... snip ...
mplayer_t likely does n't need to read SSH private keys , but it is granted access to that transiently by being allowed to read types of content associated with non_security_file_type that is allowing mplayer to read any content that is n't security related so the user can play multimedia from anywhere on the filesystem .
This could be further constrained in the base SELinux policy , but as previously mentioned is not a major focus for the Upstream Vendor .
Beyond the strict model , Role - Based Access Control also provides a mechanism for limiting the scope of what a user can do when they use sudo to switch to root .
It is often desirable to enforce least privilege on users with specific roles like DBAs or auditors and the targeted policy includes several user roles for purposes like those , with documentation in their respective manual pages as mentioned in Policy Documentation .
seinfo -r Roles : 14 auditadm_r dbadm_r guest_r staff_r user_r logadm_r object_r secadm_r sysadm_r system_r webadm_r xguest_r nx_server_r unconfined_r
To map a user to one of these admin roles , the same semanage - user command is used as before to create a new SELinux user associated with the desired roles , and then semanage - login to associate the Linux login with the SELinux user .
If the user should also be able to start system daemons they administrate from their user domain ( i.e. , to start mysql as dbadm_r for debugging from a shell ) the system_r role should be included in their list of associated roles .
semanage user - a - R " staff_r system_r auditadm_r " -r " s0-s0:c0.c1023 " auditor_u semanage login - a -s " auditor_u " -r " s0-s0:c0.c1023 " < username >
4.2 . Multi-Category Security ( MCS )
Multi-Category Security provides a way to associate a set or range of compartments with SELinux contexts .
The targeted policy model implements compartmentalization of types associated with mcs_constrained_type .
To understand how this works , it 's required to know how to inspect the MLS part of security contexts .
This is the part after the user : role : type section , and includes a range , which indicates a low and high security level .
system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 - s0:c0.c5 ▼ ▼
Low security level , High security level , also associated with no associated with compartments compartments .
c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 and c5 .
One thing that is noticeable above is the lack of compartments on the low security level , as well as both security levels being the same .
The first point is an implementation detail of the MCS model in the targeted policy .
When an access vector is computed for a process that is associated with mcs_constrained_type , only the MCS compartments of the high level are compared .
The second point is due to the fact that MLS is not in use .
The compartment part of the above security context is a category range , but can also be a set of categories separated by commas .
A range of categories results in the context being associated with an inclusive set of categories in that range .
Understanding how access is computed for two processes with a set of categories requires looking at the dominance rules for SELinux security levels ( access is only allowed if the source type 's high security level dominates the target type 's high security level ) .
Those rules are as follows ( only accounting for categories , and not MLS security levels )
Source dominates the target if the categories in the source context are the same as or a superset of those in the target context .
Source is dominated by the target if the categories in the source context are a subset of the categories of the target context .
Source and target are equal and dominate each other if the set of categories are the same in each context .
With that in mind , we know that a context with a category set of c0.c5 will be granted access to a context with a category set of c0,c3 , but not a category set of c0 , c6 , or c0.c1023 .
This rule is the reason that sVirt generates a random set of categories , so there will be no overlap where one virt domain will dominate another .
The Android project also does the same thing , to put applications in isolated domains .
An example use of Multi-Category Security could be using NGINX with multiple vhosts that connect to backend servers that are also running as httpd domains ( e.g. , PHP - FPM ) .
Normally these instances of the backend servers would be able to modify and manage each others domains simply due to type - enforcement rules .
If they 're associated with categories , they can only do so if one backend server dominates the other .
Since NGINX itself is a HTTPD domain , it should dominate all backend servers , so if we have categories c0 through c5 available for HTTPD domains we would want to run NGINX as system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0-s0:c0.c5 , so it could connect to the upstream servers .
Each backend server would run with a single category within c0 - c5 , and a context such as system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0-s0:c1 .
There are a couple of presequities to achieving this .
First , httpd_t must be associated with the mcs_constrained_type attribute that is currently only associated with the following types on CentOS 7 :
seinfo -xamcs_constrained_type mcs_constrained_type netlabel_peer_t openshift_t openshift_app_t sandbox_min_t sandbox_x_t sandbox_web_t sandbox_net_t svirt_t svirt_tcg_t svirt_lxc_net_t svirt_qemu_net_t svirt_kvm_net_t
To add to this list of types it is necessary to create a local policy module that associates the desired type with the attribute .
This is done using the typeattribute statement , and can be done like so :
policy_module ( httpd_mcs , 1.0 ) gen_require ( ` type httpd_t ; attribute mcs_constrained_type ; ') typeattribute httpd_t mcs_constrained_type ;
See Customizing Local Policy for instructions on building policy modules .
Once the type is associated with mcs_constrained_type each backend server must have their content relabeled to include the respective categories in their file context specifications .
This can be achieved by adding the file types to /etc / selinux / targeted / contexts /customizable_types , but this can potentially break on a policy upgrade .
An alternative is to add new file contexts specifications that include categories using semanage - fcontext :
semanage fcontext - a -t httpd_sys_content_t -r " s0 - s0:c1 " " / srv/backend 1 ( /.* ) ? " semanage fcontext - a -t httpd_sys_content_t -r " s0-s0:c2 " " / srv/backend2 (/.* ) ? "
The next step is making sure the backend servers are started with the correct security context .
On CentOS 7 with systemd this can be achieved with the SELinuxContext= directive in the unit file , and in previous versions can be achieved using the runcon command .
runcon " system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0-s0:c1 " " /usr/local/bin/backend - server "
Or in the systemd unit :
SELinuxContext=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0-s0:c1
Now each backend server should be isolated from the other , while allowing NGINX access to manage and send messages to both of them .
5. Troubleshooting SELinux
Sooner or later you may run into situations where SELinux denies access to something and you need to troubleshoot the issue .
There are a number of fundamental reasons why SELinux may deny access to a file , process or resource :
A mislabeled file .
A process running under the wrong SELinux security context .
A bug in policy .
An application requires access to a file that was n't anticipated when the policy was written and generates an error .
An intrusion attempt .
The first 3 we can deal with , whereas giving alarm and notice in the 4th case is exactly the intended behaviour .
To troubleshoot any issue , the log files are key and SELinux is no different .
By default SELinux log messages are written to / var / log / audit / audit.log via the Linux Auditing System auditd , which is started by default .
If the auditd daemon is not running , then messages are written to / var / log / messages .
SELinux log messages are labeled with the " AVC " keyword so that they might be easily filtered from other messages , as with grep .
Starting with CentOS 5 the SELinux Troubleshooting tool can be used to help analyze log files converting them into a more human - readable format .
The tool consists of a GUI tool for displaying messages in human - readable format and possible solutions , a desktop notification icon alerting of new issues and a daemon process , setroubleshootd , that checks for new SELinux AVC alerts and feeds the notification icon .
Email notifications may also be configured , as for those not running an X server .
The SELinux Troubleshooting tool is provided by the setroubleshoot package .
The tool may be launched from the X Window GUI manager System menu or from the command line :
sealert -b
Those not running an X server may generate human - readable reports from the command line :
sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log > / path/to/mylogfile.txt
5.1. SELinux And Auditd
As described above , SELinux interacts with auditd to generate messages that aid in both auditing and troubleshooting of a system .
The most common types of messages seen in the audit log from SELinux are AVCs .
They describe operations that were denied ( or allowed ) by the SELinux security server .
Although AVC messages are the most common , they are n't the only types of messages generated by SELinux and sent to the audit subsystem .
Auditd Record Type Description AVC
Messages that are generated by the kernel whenever access to an operation is granted or denied .
Audit messages can be generated when access is granted by using auditallow policy rules , and messages can also be prevented from being logged when access is denied by using dontaudit rules .
USER_AVC Similar to AVC messages , but are generated by userspace programs that use the SELinux security server .
These programs are known as userspace object managers , and includes D - Bus and systemd .
SELINUX_ERR
An error emitted by the SELinux security server in cases where an operation fails and an AVC does n't sufficiently describe the issue .
This typically occurs when systemd tries to transition to a service that has NoNewPrivileges
=
True in it 's unit file , but does not have type bounds in the SELinux policy between systemd and its own type .
This specific issue can also occur if a process wishes to setcon ( 3 ) to change the context of one of its threads .
It can also occur when a program tries to set an invalid context , e.g. , PAM uses setcon ( 3 ) to change to the login users domain and misconfigured SELinux logins can result in an incorrect context being returned from SELinux userspace .
USER_SELINUX_ERR
Similar to SELINUX_ERR , messages of this type are logged when a userspace object manager experiences an SELinux related error .
MAC_POLICY_LOAD , USER_MAC_POLICY_LOAD
A message that is logged when a SELinux policy is loaded .
The USER variant is also emitted by userspace object managers to notify that they have processed the policy load .
MAC_CONFIG_CHANGE
A message that is logged when an administrator changes the value of an SELinux boolean using setsebool .
MAC_STATUS
When the status of SELinux is changed from enforcing to permissive or vice versa .
USER_ROLE_CHANGE
A message that is logged when a user changes role via the newrole ( 1 ) command , at login time , or by using sudo .
Only applicable to Role - Based Access Control .
USER_LABEL_EXPORT
Logged whenever a user exports a labeled object using CUPS .
NOTE : There are several other SELinux related audit events that are used in IPSec / NetLabel that are not covered here at this time .
Those events are MAC_UNLBL_ALLOW , MAC_UNLBL_STCADD , MAC_UNLBL_STCDEL , MAC_MAP_ADD , MAC_MAP_DEL , MAC_IPSEC_EVENT , MAC_CIPSOV4_ADD , MAC_CIPSOV4_DEL .
While sealert can be slightly useful for interpreting AVC records , the audit tools can give the admin a more powerful view of the audit log .
ausearch can be used to search for specific events in the audit log , and has a variety of options available for working with audit records .
So instead of interpreting messages using sealert , it is possible to examine any potential causes of problems from SELinux using ausearch .
The types we usually want to look at when troubleshooting a problem are AVC , USER_AVC , SELINUX_ERR , and USER_SELINUX_ERR .
ausearch provides an - m option that takes a comma-separated list of audit record types to filter by , as well as an - i flag that causes numeric values to be interpreted into strings depending on the system .
This includes converting UID / GID 's to user and group names , as well as mapping a syscall and architecture pair to the syscall name :
ausearch -m AVC , USER_AVC , SELINUX_ERR, USER_SELINUX_ERR
-i
Searching for records and creating a checkpoint , to ensure that audit records that have already been seen do n't show up again on the next search :
ausearch -- checkpoint= "./audit-checkpoint " -m AVC , USER_AVC , SELINUX_ERR, USER_SELINUX_ERR
-i
Searching for records based on the processes comm name , this is the executable name from the task in the kernel :
ausearch -c " httpd " -m AVC , USER_AVC , SELINUX_ERR , USER_SELINUX_ERR
-i
Finding events where an admin ( or program ) changed the enforcing state of SELinux :
ausearch -m MAC_STATUS -i
Since it is possible to prevent audit records from being logged using dontaudit , it is possible that not all AVC or USER_AVC messages will be seen .
To prevent dontaudit rules from hiding these messages the administrator can run semodule - DB to rebuild their SELinux policy without the dontaudit rules .
After reproducing the issue there should be more messages available than before , as well as some records that are n't relevant to the problem ( noatsecure , rlimitinh , and siginh are permissions that are always checked when a program is executed and can generally be ignored ) .
When finished with reviewing records prevented from dontaudit rules , run semodule - B to rebuild the policy with dontaudit roles included again .
The inverse of this is the ability to log operations that are successful using auditallow .
These logs can be searched for by filtering by successful operations ( though this will also return successful events in permissive mode ) :
ausearch -m AVC , USER_AVC - i -- success yes
5.2 . Relabeling Files
The ' chcon ' command may be used to change SELinux security context of a file or files / directories in a similar way to how ' chown ' or ' chmod ' may be used to change the ownership or standard file permissions of a file .
Let 's look at some examples .
Using Apache as an example , suppose you want to change the DocumentRoot to serve web pages from a location other than the default / var / www / html / directory .
Assume we create a directory ( or maybe a mount point ) at / html / and create an index.html file there :
# mkdir / html # touch /html/index.html # ls - Z /html/index.html -rw-r--r-- root root user_u:object_r:default_t /html/index.html # ls - Z | grep html drwxr - xr-x root root user_u:object_r : default_t html
We see that both the directory / html / and file / html/index.html have the security context type : default_t .
If we start our web browser and try to view the page , SELinux will properly deny access and log the error because the directory and file (s ) have the wrong security context .
We need to set the correct security context type for Apache of : httpd_sys_content_t .
# chcon -v --type=httpd_sys_content_t /html context of /html changed to user_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t # chcon -v --type=httpd_sys_content_t /html/index.html context of /html/index.html changed to user_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t # ls - Z /html/index.html -rw-r--r-- root root user_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t /html/index.html # ls - Z | grep html drwxr - xr-x root root user_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t html
Equally we could have set both in one go using the - R recursive switch :
# chcon - Rv --type=httpd_sys_content_t /html
Modifying security contexts in this manner will persist between system reboots but only until the modified portion of the filesystem is relabeled .
This is a not uncommon operation and the proper solution , after testing , is to write a local custom rule ( a so - called Policy Module ) and merge it into the base local rules .
This will be an additional rule on top of the 200 + rules mentioned above .
To make the security context changes permanent , even through a complete filesystem relabel , we can use the SELinux Management Tool or the ' semanage ' command from the command line :
semanage fcontext - a -t httpd_sys_content_t " / html ( / .* ) ? "
to add a file context of type httpd_sys_content_t for everything under / html .
5.3 . Restore Default Security Contexts
The ' restorecon ' command may be used to restore file ( s ) default SELinux security contexts .
Again , let 's use Apache as an example .
Suppose a user edits a copy of index.html in his / her home directory and moves ( mv ) the file to the DocumentRoot / var / www / html .
Whilst the copy ( cp ) command will typically adopt the destination directory 's or file 's security context , move ( mv ) will maintain the source 's security context .
We could use the ' chcon ' command to change the security context of the file ( s ) in question but as the file (s ) are now in the default Apache DocumentRoot ( / var /www / html ) we can just restore the default security contexts for that directory or file (s ) .
To restore just the index . html file , we would use :
# restorecon -v /var/www/html/index.html
or to recursively restore the default security contexts for the whole directory :
# restorecon - Rv /var/ www/ html
Additionally , if we simply wanted to examine the security contexts of the / var / www / html directory to see if any files needed their security contexts restored , we can use restorecon with the -n switch to prevent any relabelling occurring :
# restorecon - Rv -n /var/www/html
In some cases it might also be the case that the user has moved files with a type that is listed in /etc / selinux / targeted /contexts/customizable_types .
These types are treated as special by restorecon , in that they wo n't usually be relabeled by restorecon unless the extra -F flag is passed .
This is because these types are either associated with categories ( as mentioned in Multi- Category Security ) , or they are user content types that the user is allowed to customize .
To relabel content that has a customizable type associated with it , run restorecon as above with the extra flag :
# restorecon - RvF / var / www / html
5.4 . Relabel Complete Filesystem
Sometimes it is necessary to relabel the complete filesystem although this should only be necessary when enabling SELinux after it has been disabled or when changing the SELinux policy from the default targeted policy to strict .
To automatically relabel the complete filesystem upon reboot , do :
# touch /.autorelabel # reboot
Sometimes a complete filesystem relabel will fail if the system has been upgraded to CentOS - 5.2 with SELinux disabled , and SELinux is then enabled .
If the above procedure does n't correctly perform a complete filesystem relabel , try issuing the ' genhomedircon ' command first :
# genhomedircon # touch /.autorelabel # reboot
5.5 . Allowing Access to a Port
We may want a service such as Apache to be allowed to bind and listen for incoming connections on a non-standard port .
By default , the SELinux policy will only allow services access to recognized ports associated with those services .
If we wanted to allow Apache to listen on tcp port 81 , we can add a rule to allow that using the ' semanage ' command :
# semanage port - a -t http_port_t -p tcp 81
A full list of ports that services are permitted access by SELinux can be obtained with :
# semanage port -l
5.6 . Gathering Audit Logs In Permissive Mode
When a program is being denied an operation repeatedly by SELinux , it is sometimes easier to continue debugging while in permissive mode .
The usual operation for this is setenforce 0 , however that puts all domains on the system into permissive mode rather than just the domain of the process encountering an issue .
To avoid this , SELinux supports the concept of permissive types , allowing the administrator to put just a single domain into permissive mode rather than the entire system .
To do this based on an audit log entry , look at the type in the context of the scontext field :
type=AVC msg=audit( 1218128130.653:334 ) : avc : denied { connectto } for pid=9111 comm=" smtpd " path= " /var/spool/postfix/postgrey /socket " scontext=system_u:system_r:postfix_smtpd_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:system_r:initrc_t:s0 tclass=unix_stream_socket
Here it is : postfix_smtpd_t .
To temporarily grant access to any operation this domain wants we can use semanage to add a new permissive type :
semanage permissive - a postfix_smtpd_t
Now we can watch the audit logs to see what postfix_smtpd_t needs to be allowed to do in order to succesfully operate .
Once we 're finished we can put that type back into enforcing mode :
semanage permissive -d postfix_smtpd_t
This approach does n't suffer from the heavy - handedness of setenforce 0 and allows all other services on the system to keep benefiting from the access controls of SELinux .
Quite often when encountering SELinux denials it will be the case that the operation that is denied is actually allowed in policy , but was n't permitted due to a file not being labeled correctly or a process not transitioning to the correct domain .
Issues like these are best reported to the policy authors and maintainers , but are not impossible to figure out using the analysis tools provided by the setools - console package .
For an AVC record in the audit log we can use sesearch to identify any type - enforcement rules that permit the requested access to the target , as well as any rules that are toggled by booleans that would enable the access .
The important parts of the AVC record message for us to look at are the scontext , tcontext , tclass fields as well as the requested permission in the denied : < permission > message .
Using an example AVC denial record with scontext=antivirus_t , tcontext=antivirus_t , tclass=process and a message of { denied : execmem } that is likely due to an anti-virus program wishing to do JIT compilation , we can identify any type - enforcement rules dependant on booleans that could allow the requested access :
sesearch - AC -s antivirus_t -t antivirus_t -c process -p execmem Found 2 semantic av rules : DT allow antivirus_t antivirus_t : process execmem ; [ antivirus_use_jit ]
DT allow antivirus_t antivirus_t : process execmem ; [ antivirus_use_jit ]
Note :
The options in use here are documented in the sesearch ( 1 ) manual .
-s and -t specify source and target types , -c specifies an SELinux objet class , - p can be specified multiple times to search for rules with those permissions , while - A searches for allow rules and - C expands that to search for conditional allow rules .
This was an easy one .
The identifier in square brackets is the name of the boolean that would allow this access , and the DT prefixing the rule indiciates it is currently disabled .
We can turn this on using setsebool - P antivirus_use_jit=1 , but we might also want to inspect exactly what this boolean is allowing first , and the same sesearch utility lets us do that :
sesearch - AC -b antivirus_use_jit Found 2 semantic av rules : DT allow antivirus_t antivirus_t : process execmem ; [ antivirus_use_jit ]
DT allow antivirus_t antivirus_t : process execmem ; [ antivirus_use_jit ]
In this case the antivirus_use_jit boolean only allows exactly what we want , but in the future we could use sesearch like this to discern between 2 booleans that allow the same access , where one of them might also allow other undesirable operations .
An example of this is where we have HTTPD content labeled as httpd_sys_content_t that we wish to write to .
A recommendation for this might be to enable the httpd_unified boolean , so we can look at what that would do for us :
sesearch - AC -b httpd_unified -c file -p write Found 5 semantic av rules : DT allow httpd_sys_script_t httpdcontent : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ; [ httpd_enable_cgi httpd_unified && ]
DT allow httpd_user_script_t httpd_user_content_t : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ; [ httpd_enable_cgi httpd_unified && ]
DT allow httpd_t httpd_sys_rw_content_t : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ; [ httpd_enable_cgi httpd_unified && httpd_builtin_scripting && ]
DT allow httpd_user_script_t httpd_user_ra_content_t : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ; [ httpd_enable_cgi httpd_unified && ]
DT allow httpd_t httpdcontent : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ; [ httpd_enable_cgi httpd_unified && httpd_builtin_scripting && ]
There are only a few rules associated with this boolean related to writing to files , so it is easy to analyze what it allows .
The above rules tell us that while it allows writing to this the file the AVC record is for , it also allows r/w access to previously append - only and read - only content .
We can see above that there is a httpd_sys_rw_content_t type that , based on the name , would likely solve the problem .
However , we could also identify on our own what types of file that httpd_t is allowed to write to .
Note that there may be a lot of types that httpd is allowed to write to transiently via attributes , or disabled booleans so we use the - R flag that indicates that the symbol names we 're providing are regular expressions and filter the target types by types starting with httpd .
sesearch - ACR -s httpd_t -t " httpd . * " -c file -p write DT allow httpd_t httpd_sys_rw_content_t : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ; [ httpd_enable_cgi httpd_unified && httpd_builtin_scripting && ]
ET allow httpd_t httpd_sys_rw_content_t : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ; [ httpd_builtin_scripting ]
DT allow httpd_t httpd_sys_rw_content_t : lnk_file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename } ; [ httpd_enable_cgi httpd_unified && httpd_builtin_scripting && ]
ET allow httpd_t httpd_sys_rw_content_t : lnk_file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename } ; [ httpd_builtin_scripting ]
ET allow httpd_t httpd_sys_rw_content_t : sock_file { read write getattr append open } ; [ httpd_builtin_scripting ]
A couple of these rules are disabled , but 3 of them are enabled by default .
So based on that we can conclude that the type for content that is read - write by HTTPD domains should be httpd_sys_rw_content_t .
Using this knowledge , we can follow the same steps to figure out what domains are allowed access to other target types to assist in identifying programs that are running with the wrong context .
6. Customizing SELinux Policies
Minor modifications to SELinux policies can be made without modifying and recompiling the policy source by setting boolean values for optional features .
Such features include allowing users to share their home directories under Samba or allowing Apache to serve files from users home directories that would otherwise be denied by the SELinux policy .
There is a separate Wiki page dealing with booleans .
7. Creating Custom SELinux Policy Modules with audit2allow
Sometimes there are occasions when none of the above methods deal with a given situation and we need to extend the SELinux policy by creating a custom policy module to allow for a certain set of conditions .
For example , consider the postgrey service add - on for an smtp mail server .
Our smtp server needs to communicate with postgrey over a Unix socket and that is something the default SELinux policy for our smtp server does not allow .
Consequently the service is blocked by SELinux .
This is an issue that can not be fixed by changing or restoring file type security contexts and is n't something that has a boolean value we can toggle to allow .
We could disable SELinux protection of the smtp server through a boolean , which would be better than disabling SELinux completely , but that is still far from ideal .
If we switch SELinux into Permissive mode and run our mail server for a set period of time , we can log SELinux issues whilst still permitting access ( as mentioned in Gathering Audit Logs in Permissive Mode ) .
Checking our logs , we see the following SELinux AVC messages :
type=AVC msg=audit( 1218128130.653:334 ) : avc : denied { connectto } for pid=9111 comm=" smtpd " path= " /var/spool/postfix/postgrey/socket " scontext=system_u:system_r:postfix_smtpd_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:system_r:initrc_t:s0 tclass=unix_stream_socket type=AVC msg=audit( 1218128130.653:334 ) : avc : denied { write } for pid=9111 comm=" smtpd " name = " socket " dev=sda6 ino=39977017 scontext=system_u:system_r:postfix_smtpd_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:postfix_spool_t:s0 tclass=sock_file
Then we can use ' audit2 allow ' to generate a set of policy rules that would allow the required actions .
We can generate a local postgrey Type Enforcement policy file ( postgreylocal.te ) :
# grep smtpd_t /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m postgreylocal > postgreylocal.te # cat postgreylocal .te module postgreylocal 1.0 ; require { type postfix_smtpd_t ; type postfix_spool_t ; type initrc_t ; class sock_file write ; class unix_stream_socket connectto ; } #============= postfix_smtpd_t ==============
allow postfix_smtpd_t initrc_t:unix_stream_socket connectto ; allow postfix_smtpd_t postfix_spool_t : sock_file write ;
Above we see that we can grep the audit.log file for issues relating to our smtp server and pipe those issues to audit2 allow which generates a set of rules that it thinks would permit the actions currently denied by the SELinux policy .
Reviewing these rules we see our smtp server wants to connect and write to a Unix socket which we see from out logs is the Unix socket that the postgrey service is listening on .
As this seems perfectly reasonable , we can go ahead and use audit2 allow to make a custom policy module to allow these actions :
# grep smtpd_t /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M postgreylocal
We then load our postgrey policy module using the ' semodule ' command into the current SELinux policy :
semodule - i postgreylocal .
pp
which will add our postgrey policy module to /etc/ selinux / targeted /modules/active/modules/postgreylocal.pp .
We can check the policy module loaded correctly by listing loaded modules with ' semodule - l ' .
We can then continue to monitor our SELinux log files to check that our custom policy module works and once we are satisfied we can re-enable SELinux Enforcing mode and again benefit from SELinux protection of our now fully functional smtp server .
7.1 . Manually Customizing Policy Modules
Often audit2 allow will automatically create a custom policy module that will resolve a particular issue , but there are times when it does n't get it quite right and we may want to manually edit and compile the policy module .
For example , consider the following AVC audit log :
Summary : SELinux is preventing postdrop ( postfix_postdrop_t ) " getattr " to / var / log / httpd/error_log ( httpd_log_t ) .
Detailed Description : SELinux denied access requested by postdrop .
It is not expected that this access is required by postdrop and this access may signal an intrusion attempt .
It is also possible that the specific version or configuration of the application is causing it to require additional access .
Allowing Access : Sometimes labeling problems can cause SELinux denials .
You could try to restore the default system file context for / var / log / httpd/ error_log , restorecon - v '/var/log/httpd/error_log '
If this does not work , there is currently no automatic way to allow this access .
Instead , you can generate a local policy module to allow this access - see FAQ ( http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/selinux-faq-fc5/#id2961385)
Or you can disable SELinux protection altogether .
Disabling SELinux protection is not recommended .
Please file a bug report ( http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi) against this package .

# grep postdrop / var / log/ audit/ audit.log | audit2allow -M postfixlocal # cat postfixlocal .te module postfixlocal 1.0 ; require { type httpd_log_t ; type postfix_postdrop_t ; class dir getattr ; class file { read getattr } ; } #============= postfix_postdrop_t ============== allow postfix_postdrop_t httpd_log_t : file getattr ;
Hopefully the first thing to strike us here is why does postdrop needs access to / var / log / httpd / error_log ?
Presumably this is n't something we would expect so we have to assess if this is an action we wish to allow or not .
We have a number of options .
We could just ignore the error and allow SELinux to continue blocking and logging access attempts or we could allow the action by creating the custom policy module as suggested by audit2 allow .
Alternatively we can edit the custom policy module .te file to prevent auditing of this particular error whilst still allowing SELinux to continue preventing access .
We do this by editing the allow line , changing it to dontaudit :
#============= postfix_postdrop_t ==============
dontaudit postfix_postdrop_t httpd_log_t : file getattr ;
Now we can manually compile and load the edited custom policy module :
# checkmodule - M -m -o postfixlocal.mod postfixlocal.te # semodule_package -o postfixlocal.pp -m postfixlocal.mod # semodule - i postfixlocal .
pp
Access to / var / log / httpd/error_log by postdrop will still be prevented by SELinux but we wo n't receive constant alerts and error messages filling up our log files each time access is blocked .
8. Policy Documentation
A lot of SELinux policy is abstracted through GNU m4 macros , which is why the devel packages are required to build new modules that are dependant on the existing policy API .
To see a listing of macros and modules available in the installed policy , you can install the selinux - policy - doc package that will install HTML documentation to /usr / share / doc / selinux - policy / html / .
It also provides manual pages for each SELinux module that provides a brief overview of the booleans , file contexts , and types declared in the module .
These are available as manual pages with names in the format of " < module > _selinux " .
For example , the documentation for the HTTPD module is available as httpd_selinux ( 8 ) and the documentation for the audit administrator role is contained in auditadm_selinux ( 8 ) .
9. Summary
This article is intended to give an overview of working with SELinux for users new to SELinux .
SELinux is installed and enabled by default , and for most users it will function without issue affording an enhanced level of security .
SELinux is suitable for all classes of installation including servers , workstations , desktops and laptops .
Although SELinux can appear quite daunting and complex to users not familiar with it , that is no reason to disable it at installation .
If SELinux does present issues then it is easy to switch into Permissive mode at which point issues are only logged and not blocked .
When issues do arise the techniques presented in this article can be used to troubleshoot and resolve them .

11 . User Notes and Gotchas
This section is provided by a user who learned most of what he knows of SELinux from this document .
This document is a wonderful and detailed resource .
However , it is somewhat dry .
It misses a couple of practical points I found rather frustrating as I tried to actually get stuff done .
Note this is all for CentOS 6 .
semanage is found in the package policycoreutils - python which is not installed by default .
Note there is a separate policycoreutils package .
semanage appears to be installed by default in CentOS 7 .
It is still located in policycoreutils - python .
Finding the right context to use as you manage a system is difficult .
One place to start is ls - Z .
Look at the directories and data pre-installed by a package and copy the contexts already used .
The next tool is seinfo -t which lists all contexts currently in use on your system .
grep for the name of your application .
The use of the public_content_rw_t context is a fix for some situations .
This user has directories that need to be shared by NFS , Samba and Apache .
This context seems to allow this to happen .
It 's probably also a security hole so beware on security conscious systems .
Do n't forget about the -t parameter to chcon .
It sets just the type context which is generally all you want to do and is easier than specifying the entire string as reported by ls - Z. audit2 allow is actually easier to use than presented here .
When you have a conflict between two contexts , find the error messages in audit.log and extract them to a separate text file .
Feed the errors back to audit2 allow like this :
audit2allow -M mynewpolicyname < errors.txt
What will be generated is mynewpolicyname.te and mynewpolicyname .pp along with helpful instructions on how to import the new policy .
This new policy will enable whatever was previously conflicting .
I discovered this process attempting to get a script running under postfix that was previously installed on a non-SELinux system .
Under SELinux , the script needs to run under the postfix_pipe_exec_t context and it's spooling directory needs the postfix_pipe_tmp_t context .
However the script also calls the spamc binary of spamassassin for processing .
Alas , this binary runs under spamc_t and thus could n't read or write into the spool directory .
I found two error messages in audit.log : one for spamc_t trying to read in the spool directory and one for trying to write .
After executing this process on the extracted error messages we get a .te file that looks like this :
module mynewpolicy 1.0 ; require { type spamc_t ; type postfix_pipe_tmp_t ; class file { read write } ; } #=============
spamc_t ==============
allow spamc_t postfix_pipe_tmp_t : file { read write } ;
I reported back in February on the case of Gary Gensler , the former Goldman Sachs employee and derivatives cheerleader who President Obama nominated to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) .
Gensler ’s nomination sailed through the Senate Agricultural Committee but Senator Bernie Sanders has placed a hold on the nomination ( as has a second senator who is as yet unnamed ) .
A statement from Sanders ’s office said :
While Mr. Gensler is clearly an intelligent and knowledgeable person , I cannot support his nomination .
Mr. Gensler worked with Sen. Phil Gramm and Alan Greenspan to exempt credit default swaps from regulation , which led to the collapse of A.I.G. and has resulted in the largest taxpayer bailout in U.S. history .
He supported Gramm - Leach - Bliley , which allowed banks like Citigroup to become “ too big to fail . ”
He worked to deregulate electronic energy trading , which led to the downfall of Enron and the spike in energy prices .
At this moment in our history , we need an independent leader who will help create a new culture in the financial marketplace and move us away from the greed , recklessness and illegal behavior which has caused so much harm to our economy .
Many people rely heavily on their sight to determine who they are attracted to .
But they probably do n’t realize how their sense of sound may be indicating who is more compatible .
A new study backs up what men have said all along : Women are difficult to read .
And the women agree .
Researchers at Indiana University showed video clips from 24 different speed dates and asked male and female participants two simple questions : “ Do you think the man was interested in this woman ? ” and “ Do you think the woman was interested in this man ? ”
Their answers were then compared with the responses of the speed daters themselves .
The results , published in the January issue of the journal Psychological Science , show that both men and women are able to gauge a man 's interest in a woman , but are equally baffled when it comes to figuring out if a woman is interested in a man .
In fact , a flip of a coin would be almost as accurate in predicting a woman 's romantic interest on a date .
Skyler S. Place , who headed up the study , says that the biological drive behind dating — finding an optimal mate for gene promotion — gives women reason to be elusive .
" Being coy forces the men to spend more time interacting with the woman , because they are unsure if they have successfully courted her , " Place said .
" Therefore , the woman has more time to gather information about her date . "
Ultimately , women have more at stake while dating because they face higher " sunk costs " — a woman can carry the child of only one man at a time , while a man can impregnate many women .
Video clips taken from the middle and end of dates provided the most accurate assessments , Place said , suggesting that the daters ' true feelings became more evident as they collected information throughout their encounter .
The speed dates were conducted in Germany as part of Humboldt University 's Berlin Speed Dating Study .
None of the Indiana University study participants understood German , and were using only visual cues and tone of voice to determine daters ' interest .
The findings might be sound , but what about the old dating adage to just be yourself ?
" From an evolutionary perspective , there is nothing wrong with a woman being ' open ' and ' honest ' about who she is — it is simply in her best interest not to present herself as actually interested immediately , " Place said .
Getting to the second date , however , is still a good sign .

The weirdest and coolest aspect of this unusual shark is its retractable jaw , which resembles that nasty critterÂ Sigourney Weaver zonked out of the spacecraft in that old horror classic , Alien .
It really seems to leap out of its mouth in order to catch its unsuspecting prey , which include : squid , crabs and fish .

UNICEF , December 22 , 2007
The American photographer Stephanie Sinclair is the winner of the international photo competition " UNICEF Photo of the Year " .
Her photo shows a wedding couple in Afghanistan who could not be more opposite .
The groom , Mohammed , looks much older than his 40 years .
The bride , Ghulam , is still a child ; she just turned 11 .
" The UNICEF Photo of the Year 2007 raises awareness about a worldwide problem .
Millions of girls are married while they are still under age .
Most of theses child brides are forever denied a self - determined life " , says UNICEF Patroness Eva Luise Köhler at the award ceremony in Berlin .
According to UNICEF , there are about 60 million young women worldwide who were married before they came of age , half of them in South Asia .
He 's forty , she 's eleven .
And they are a couple – the Afghan man Mohammed F.* and the child Ghulam H.*.
" We needed the money " , Ghulam 's parents said .
Faiz claims he is going to send her to school .
But the women of Damarda village in Afghanistan 's
Ghor province know better : " Our men do n't want educated women . "
They predict that Ghulam will be married within a few weeks after her engagement in 2006 , so as to bear children for Faiz .
During her stay in Afghanistan , it consistently struck American photographer Stephanie Sinclair how many young girls are married to much older men .
She decided to raise awareness about this topic with her pictures .
Particularly as the official minimum age for brides in Afghanistan is sixteen and it is therefore illegal to marry children .
Early marriages are not only a problem in Afghanistan : worldwide there are about 51 million girls aged between 15 and 19 years who are forced into marriage .
The youngest brides live in the Indian state of Rajasthan , where 15 % of all wives are not even 10 years old when they are married .
Child marriages are a reaction to extreme poverty and mainly take place in Asian and African regions where poor families see their daughters as a burden and as second - class citizens .
Already in their younger years , girls are given into the " care " of a husband , a tradition that often leads to exploitation .
Many girls become victims of domestic violence .
In an Egyptian survey , about one - third of the interviewed child brides stated that they were beaten by their husbands .
The young brides are under pressure to prove their fertility as soon as possible .
But the risk for girls between the ages of 10 and 14 not to survive pregnancy is five times higher than for adult women .
Every year , about 150,000 pregnant teenagers die due to complications – in particular due to a lack of medical care , let alone sex education .
For her project , Stephanie Sinclair also traveled to Nepal and Ethiopia .
She wants to do research on the topic of child marriage in other regions as well and then publish a book on the issue .
ALBANY — Democrats took control of the State Senate last month after more than four decades of Republican rule , then set out to determine how the Senate ’s own budget of nearly $ 100 million and its attendant perks were being distributed .
They are still trying to figure it out .
They recently realized there are some 75 employees working at the Senate ’s own printing plant , a plain brick building on the outskirts of Albany .
On Long Island , they found a small television studio , which had been set up — all with public money , with two press aides on hand to help operate it — for the exclusive use of Republican senators to record cable TV shows .
Democrats also came across what they are calling the “ Brunomobile , ” a $ 50,000 specially outfitted GMC van , with six leather captain ’s chairs ( some swiveling ) , a navigation system , rearview camera and meeting table .
Joseph L. Bruno , the former Senate majority leader who was recently indicted on corruption charges , traveled in the van after his use of state helicopters sparked a feud with the Spitzer administration .
Then there are the parking spots , always at a premium near the Capitol .
Democrats had been given roughly one spot per senator — there were 30 Democrats last year — and guessed there were perhaps double or even triple that controlled by the majority .
Instead , they have learned , there are more than 800 .
The electric garbage truck and charging post .
The vehicle runs on electricity produced from the garbage it collects , after being recycled at the nearby Energy from Waste power station .
Image : Register Hardware .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A town in Britain has recently demonstrated its new " ' leccy vehicle " - an electric garbage truck that is fueled by the garbage it collects .
The Kirklees Council presented the waste - powered Ford Transit garbage truck at Huddersfield town center last week .
The vehicle will collect garbage from 25 newly installed split bins and take it to the Energy from Waste power station and recycling center nearby .
The power station burns the garbage to generate electricity , and the truck recharges at a charging post to be ready for the next day 's route .
The garbage truck is a modified Smith Edison 3.5 - ton Ford Transit with a 40 kWh lithium - ion battery pack .
The vehicle has a top speed of 50 mph , a 100 - mile range , and takes about six to eight hours to charge .
The only reported downside is that the quiet electric truck may present safety issues for unsuspecting pedestrians .
Besides powering the garbage truck , the Energy from Waste station also pumps about 10 megawatts of electricity into the grid per day .
All the power is generated from burning local garbage .

From Mop :
While working this afternoon [ 20 December 2008 ] , I received a telephone call saying that a batch of cats were going to be shipped to Guangzhou , asking everyone to bring cat food , water , etc. and go rescue the cats .
Even though we are Guangdong people [ Cantonese ] , we long ago despised those heartless Guangdong people who eat cats , these people having made all of us lose face .
Cats , dogs , all are very kind - hearted , affectionate animals , and absolutely should not be eaten .
Moreover , eating cats or dogs is not healthy and not hygienic , none of them having been inspected by the Food Safety Administration , so who knows why these damned people would go eat them .
Today , we want to go stop these cats pitiful fate , using all of our power to go save them .

Cats are our friends , not food !
The police will not let us gather .
After looking at our fliers , they left .
Entering the train station to find the cat shipment train .
Uncertain which end the cat shipping train is at , everyone split into two directions .
Seeing the animal shipping train , “ Angle ” and I dashed over to it .
So many so many train cars .
“ Angle ” cannot find the train car shipping the cats , very dejected .
Have not seen the cat shipping train car .
Disappointed “ Angle . ”
Train manager staff says :
There have been shipments of cats before .
Netizen provided picture of train station cat shipment car .
Poor kitty cats piled layer upon layer .
Kitty cat ’s expression is so sad ~
What are you thinking about , my poor kitty .
Poor kitty - cat ~ you must be thinking of escaping these crowded cages of death .
These cruel people treat kitty - cats just like this .
Please spare them , do not eat them !
Comments from Mop : ( over 1400 comments )
If they were serious , they would not eat anything with a face , on one hand eating mutton and on the other hand discussion how to stop others from eating cats , NB people .
You people , with your so - called compassion , why do you not go help disaster areas or with Hope projects ?
You people , with so much time on your hands , why do you not go study hard or work hard ?
You people , with such an intense sense of justice , why do you not go crack down on crime or prevent corruption ?
A 17 - year - old MM as the leader ?
Have you graduated from middle school yet ?
Only knowing how to blindly cause disturbances !
If you saw someone stealing a pursue , robbing , or bullying others , would you go stop them ?
You guys have too much time on your hands , do not use your hypocrisy to show off your guys ’ compassion !
You not eating cats does not mean you are great and pure !
Although I have never eaten cat meat , I never felt that cats can not be eaten .
After seeing this post , I decided that I must try the taste of cat meat in the future .
Would it not be easier to just kill all Guangdong people ?
Wasting all that energy just to go stop a train …
SB250 , if you have the compassion , go be concerned about the disaster areas , okay ?
Kitty cats are so cute , how can you manage to eat them ?
Who will come rescue our cute pigs ?!
Pigs , my poor pigs !
You cruel people !
How can you do this to pigs ?!
I call forth all Moppers who love pigs to also come surround and forcibly stop trains !
The big pig rescue operation / movement !
I do not promote nor am I against eating cat , but when a few people stopping others from eating cats I bet the pigs , cows , and sheep all feel puzzled .
When sleeping at night , do not TMD swat mosquitoes .
Such false kind - heartedness .
The reason humans raise animals is to resolve the problem of finding food .
When food became sufficient , it gave rise to pets and related things .
So , eating cats is actually not a problem , not worth going against or worth supporting .
Treat it as normal .
When a cat is your own pet , take good care of it , but when it becomes food , it is also not worth fighting against .
If she brings it home , would she be able to raise it ?
Where would she raise it ?
If you do not cull cats [ for epidemic prevention ] , they will the same as mice as a source of disease .
Those people who eat [ cats ] will all get their just deserts .
I support that young girl ’s actions , but depending on just her efforts as one person simply will not change much .
If the government does not care , our concern as ordinary people is not much use .
Cats have souls , those who eat them will get retribution …
The main thing is that their way of eating cats is too cruel , so I suggest killing them more quickly [ humanely ] .
Boiling them alive … too “ KB ” [ 恐怖 = kongbu = terrifying ] !!!
Kill them quickly like the way pigs are killed , then eat them ~ ~ ~cows , horses , pigs , sheep , which of these are not known as humanity ’s friends ?
So why do we not see people go rescue them ?!
Unless you are a vegetarian , you have no qualifications to say anything .
Too cruel , can it be that they do not know ecological balance ?
Either you buy them and take him home to raise , or you shut your mouth and quietly stay at home .
NB people , you guys pay so much attention to a single cat ’s fate , yet there are so many homeless bums on the streets of Guangzhou , so many laid - off unemployed workers , but do you pay attention to them ?!?
Stop pretending like you guys have so much compassion .
Remember , that is not called compassion .
When you do not even go pay attention to human conditions , do not tarnish the word “ compassion ! ”
I agree with most of the above people ’s views , this MM is indeed a S… B… , with nothing better to do .
You see so many pigs , sheep , chickens , ducks , they are also pretty cute animals , so why do you not also go stop their [ shipping ] trucks / trains ?
Is it only because cats and dogs are a bit more cute ?
Also , do not compare cats and dogs with humans .
You guys probably have never raised cats before ~ ~underestimating their reproduction abilities … if people do not eat them .. they will eat people into poverty … even though I do not eat cats and dogs …
There are no Guangdong people who do not eat [ cat meat ] !
To protect these little animals only depending individual people ’s strength is difficult to implement / realize ~
I hope everyone can unite together to fight against this kind of disgusting behavior !
Poor cats and dogs .
Specially set up a cat - raising factory / farm , that is specially responsible for raising cat - meat .
If you want people to treat eating cat meat the same as eating pork and beef , first set up a cat - raising factory / farm .
I do not like cats , I like dogs , hehe , but I too have never eaten cat meat , and feel it is pretty cruel .
In the past , I had dog meat once , but after that , I have never eaten it again .
It is too too too cruel , and I could not swallow it .
They are all the same as humans , have thoughts , have brains , and have souls .
I am truly afraid they will come find us after they are dead [ as ghosts ] ~
Only those who have seen dogs and cats being killed believe it is cruel .
Poll Cats are ... Friends .

A YEAR ago , when the financial crisis was in its infancy , the euro area enjoyed a brief moment in the sun .
Its peers in the rich world — including Britain , the largest European Union economy outside the euro — had enjoyed faster growth and lower unemployment but now looked vulnerable .
Britain was everything a country should not be in a credit crunch : debt - ridden , reliant on foreign savings , chock - full of banks and estate agents , and short of firms that made tangible stuff .
America ticked many of those boxes too .
In contrast , Europe 's past vices now seemed like virtues : rigidity recast as solidity , risk - aversion as prudence .
When the crisis got worse in the autumn , the euro was a shelter for its members from the storms .
It is clear that America and Britain are indeed suffering badly .
But so now is all of the rest of Europe .
Figures due out on February 13th are expected to show that euro - area GDP shrank at an annualised rate of around 5 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 , worse even than the grim numbers from America , although not quite as bad as those for Britain .
Business indicators have stabilised but this suggests only that the economy is likely to shrink at a similar rate in the current quarter , not that activity has stopped falling .
The IMF forecasts that euro - area GDP will decline by 2 % this year and barely recover in 2010 .
More irksome still is that profligate America is able to borrow on better terms .
Despite a sell - off ( see article ) , the yield on a ten - year US Treasury bond is still half a percentage point lower than that on a German bund , which comes from the euro - area 's most creditworthy country .
Yields are lower partly because the Federal Reserve has driven America 's short - term interest rates close to zero .
It may yet buy up government bonds to push down long - term interest rates as well .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) is reluctant to go down that path , partly for fear that it might be seen to be bowing to political pressure .
It is chary about more monetary stimulus of the normal kind , too : as The Economist went to press , it was expected to keep its benchmark interest rate at 2 % .
For some governments , the ECB 's foot - dragging is not the biggest worry .
A greater concern is the extra reward that bond markets are demanding to hold their debt .
Before the credit crunch , investors seemed scarcely less keen to lend to Italy than to Germany .
Germany 's ten - year bunds yielded as little as 0.2 percentage points less than the equivalents for Italy , despite a smaller public - debt burden .
But that spread — like those of Ireland , Greece , Spain and Portugal — has widened ( see chart ) .
Adding to the strains , Standard & Poor 's , a credit - rating agency , has recently downgraded Spain , Portugal and Greece , and issued a warning that Ireland 's public debt may lose its triple - A stamp .
The odds of a sovereign - debt default have shortened , making other risks seem less improbable as well .
Might the euro crack apart ?
The jump from possible default to break - up is a big one .
And any country that had trouble financing itself within the euro would surely find life outside even less hospitable .
Yet such talk shows just how troubled the euro countries now are .
In truth many of the euro area 's supposed strengths were always more apparent than real .
At the start of the financial crisis , there was much talk of the absence of “ imbalances ” in the euro area — unlike America , which had ( and has ) to borrow so much abroad .
Yet the euro 's external balance concealed a huge internal divide between places like Germany , with excess savings , and countries such as Spain and Greece , with huge current - account deficits .
Such countries are most exposed in a credit drought , as they rely on foreign capital .
So the hope had been that weaker demand in deficit countries would be offset by faster spending from hitherto prudent German firms and consumers .
Unfortunately , the instinct to save grows stronger in a downturn .
The response of German firms to weaker export demand has been to cut investment plans .
Consumers are warier too .
So Germany 's reliance on foreign demand has proved more of a drag even than other countries ' reliance on foreign savings .
The IMF forecasts that GDP will shrink more this year in Germany than in France , Italy or Spain .
The manufacturing bent of the big euro - area economies has also left them looking cumbersome rather than strong .
Goods producers are hit hardest in downturns : consumers are more likely to defer spending on big - ticket items , such as cars and home appliances , than on the frequent small purchases that keep service industries ticking over .
And firms are loth to lay out for plant and machinery — a German niche — when demand is so uncertain .
For all the pain endured by companies and the big drop in euro - area output , the region 's unemployment is rising more slowly than in America or Britain .
One argument is that Europe 's tendency to hoard jobs in downturns may be a boon .
Forced layoffs can feed a downward spiral of weaker spending and job losses .
But recovery is also more likely to be delayed if weak firms in overstaffed industries are too slow to shed workers .
So far , joblessness has risen a lot mainly in Spain and Ireland , because of their large layoffs in the construction industry .
But there are signs that job losses are accelerating in France and Germany as well .
What default might look like
To some , the boast last autumn that the euro is a haven from financial storms was hubristic .
The sharp rise in bond spreads for Greece , Italy , Ireland , Portugal and Spain shows that capital markets are now less forgiving of high public debt or rising budget deficits .
It is likely , however , that borrowing costs would be even higher if any of these countries were outside the euro area , since an extra premium would then be required to compensate investors for currency risk .
Italy 's public debt is more than its annual GDP , yet it can still borrow for ten years at around 4.6 % a year .
It needs to raise €377 billion in capital markets this year , according to a report by Fitch , another rating agency , equivalent to some 23 % of GDP , a huge number ( though it has had to raise even more in the past ) .
One reason for rising credit spreads is the huge stock of bonds in the pipeline .
Almost € 2 trillion of public debt has to be raised by the euro area , Britain and Switzerland this year , equivalent to 17 % of their combined GDP .
Ireland alone needs about € 47 billion to cover its yawning budget deficit , its bank bail - outs and to pay off maturing debts ( see article ) .
With so much supply to be absorbed by finicky markets , there is a worry that some bonds may go unsold .
Yet that risk is easy to overstate , says Brian Coulton at Fitch , because there is little competition for funds from private borrowers .
Even a failed bond auction need not be a disaster .
Countries have liquid reserves to tide them over while they reprice bonds , says Mr Coulton .
Bond investors might still take fright if there is an unexpected rush of new borrowing — for a fresh bank bail - out , say .
Were markets to lose patience , a country could for a while arm - twist local banks into buying its debt , though that would curb other loans , hurting the economy .
But it can not ask the central bank to tide it over .
The ECB is forbidden from buying debt directly from governments ( though it can intervene in bond markets ) .
Eventually the only option might be to default on maturing bonds .
This need not imply exit from the euro ; the political , budgetary , economic and legal costs of such a course are too high for it to be sensible .
More likely , a failure to pay off a loan on time would trigger a rescue package , perhaps led by the IMF but financed by richer EU states .
It would be a messy business that would harm all euro members , says Daniel Gros of the Centre for European Policy Studies , a think - tank in Brussels .
He believes the prospect of default is small .
But since it could have such big costs , it might be safer to be prepared for it .
HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) --
Zimbabwe 's prime minister believes the driver of the truck that struck his car , killing his wife , deliberately drove toward them , his party told CNN .
Morgan Tsvangirai leaves the hospital Saturday after being treated for injuries from a car crash .
Members of his political party , the Movement for Democratic Change , and former U.S. diplomat also say the crash raises suspicions of foul play .
The prime minister left a hospital Saturday , a day after his wife , Susan , was killed in the collision , officials said .
A ball cap covered Tsvangirai 's bandaged head .
Tsvangirai was taken to a hospital in Gaborone , Botswana , on Saturday for medical treatment , a Botswanan government source and a source with the prime minister 's party .
" He 's badly bruised and is receiving treatment , " the Botswanan government source said .
The source with the prime minister 's party said Tsvangirai will return to Zimbabwe on Wednesday to attend the funeral of his wife .
The couple , who were married in 1978 , have six children .
The crash happened on a two - lane highway between Tsvangirai 's hometown , Buhera , and the capital , Harare .
It comes only weeks after the start of a power - sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival , President Robert Mugabe .
Tsvangirai 's political party said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash was anything other than an accident .
But on Saturday , MDC members told CNN that Tsvangirai thought the crash was deliberate .
Tendai Biti , the MDC secretary - general , speaking during a tearful press conference , said Tsvangirai should have had better security .

" If there had been a police escort maybe what happened yesterday could have not have happened , " Biti said .
" ( A ) police escort would have warned oncoming vehicles of a VIP arriving .
I think authorities must understand the omission .
" We hope that this omission will be rectified , that the prime minister must be given the protection that ought to be accorded to a prime minister . "
Biti said the MDC would launch its own investigation .
Analysts say the crash raises suspicions of foul play .
One former U.S. diplomat called for an outside investigation , saying it was not the first time one of Mugabe 's political foes had been killed or injured in a car crash .
Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader , took office last month under a power - sharing deal with Mugabe following a contentious election .
The MDC reached the agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence .
More than 200 deaths , mainly opposition supporters , were reported leading up to and after the election .
" I 'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure , " said Tom McDonald , the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001 .
" President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it 's sort of his M.O. , of how they get rid of people they do n't like . "

McDonald cited the car crash deaths of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi in 2001 , Employment Minister Border Gezi in 1999 and Elliot Manyika , a government minister and former regional governor , last year .
" So when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident , it gives me pause , " McDonald said .
Now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler , he urged a full independent investigation .
However , he added that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe .
The highway Tsvangirai was traveling on was only two lanes and tractor - trailers were common , McDonald said .
Vehicles in the country were often in bad shape and drivers inexperienced .
" It 's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things , " he said .
CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report .
All About Zimbabwe • Robert Mugabe • Morgan Tsvangirai
Wow .
When I ’m wrong I ’m the first eventual one to admit it , so I ’ll go ahead and say it , “ I was wrong . ”
Yes , I doubted that Obama could bring about the “ change ” I needed to not have to worry about paying bills anymore like Peggy The Moocher told us .
Well Barack Obama has put my money where his Cabinet is with the news that his newly minted Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel , has possibly been evading taxes on his home for years .
How could he do it ?
Easy !
He created a sketchy charity in 2002 , named it after him and his wife , set its address as his personal residence , and voila , taxes could be gone :
According to the Cook County Assessor ’s website , the Chicago home of four - term Democrat Congressman and likely new White House Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel , does n’t exist .
While the address of 4228 North Hermitage is listed as Emanuel ’s residence on the Illinois State Board of Elections ’ website , there seems to be no public record of Emanuel ever paying property taxes on this home …
Why would 4228 North Hermitage property owners Rahm Emanuel and wife Amy Rule not pay property taxes ?
One reason could be because Emanuel and Rule declared their 4228 North Hermitage home as the office location for their non-profit foundation appropriately called the “ Rahm Emanuel and Amy Rule Charitable Foundation ” .
As a non-profit headquarters , they may consider their home as exempt from paying taxes .
Skeptical ?
You should n’t be !
After six years , the “ Rahm Emanuel and Amy Rule Charitable Foundation ” has had only two donors .
Can you guess who ?
The Rahm Emanuel and Amy Rule Charitable Trust was formed in 2002 , when the Chicago lawmaker was first elected .
The former Clinton White House aide and his wife , Amy Rule , are its only donors .
USA Today has a great article about Rahm and other Dems , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who are illegally operating charities under their own names while failing to report that information .
Congratulations , America , you ’ve just elected another corrupt politician who surrounds himself with corrupt supporters .
“ Yes we can ” steal from the government and those we represent !

Sick and uninsured in the US
BBC North America editor Justin Webb spares a thought for the 15 % of Americans without health insurance , after his son needed hospital treatment - and the bills started arriving in the post .
The US spends about $ 2 trillion ( £ 1.37 trillion ) per year on health Washington Children 's Hospital could easily be part of the British National Health System .
The staff are helpful enough , but brusque and overworked .
There is a lot of waiting .
The lifts do not all function .
There are signs scribbled on paper and stuck on doors .
And there are doctors trying , amid the hurly - burly , to do what they want to do - to treat patients , to ease suffering .
I was there , traumatised as any parent would be , with my eight - year - old son who had just been diagnosed with a chronic and life - changing illness : Type One diabetes .
It was just before Christmas .
A piece of paper on the bed informed us that we were entitled to select a present for Sam , free of charge , from a room in another part of the hospital .
I imagine the NHS has similar kindnesses at that time of year and I imagine the parents ' tears and the doctors ' efficiency are also much the same .
But there the similarity ends .
Mounting bills Late on Christmas Eve - with Sam out of hospital - I went to the chemist to pick up the kit : the syringes and emergency injections that will now be part of our life .
We are very well insured but I still paid more than $ 200 ( £ 134 ) in so - called co-pays ... amounts for each medicine that an individual is expected to fork out for , even when the recipient is a child .
Fifteen percent of Americans - including eight million children - have no insurance
For a person with no insurance or inadequate cover , amid the sadness and the stress of the diagnosis , this would have been a further blow .
To be followed by more .
Days after Christmas , as we were still struggling with our syringes and Sam was still wondering innocently if his disease might soon be cured , the real bills started arriving : $ 2,700 ( £ 1,815 ) ... then another $ 800 ( £ 538 ) .
" Urology " , it says starkly .
I assume that was a urine sample .
It seems a bit pricey but there is no way of challenging this tsunami of reckoning .
The insurers wrote as well to say they had decided to pay the first bill .
On the other - urology - they are so far silent .
Fifteen percent of Americans - including eight million children - have no insurance .
Diagnosed with diabetes , as Sam was , they would have been treated at Washington Children 's Hospital - it insists proudly that it turns no - one away - but probably only after collapsing , because uninsured people tend not to go to the doctor to investigate symptoms .
And the parents would now be facing the kind of added burden that I find almost unimaginably awful : a sick child and a dependence on charity .
Gifts from churches and drug companies , or a life of increasingly threatening letters , ending in bankruptcy .
Wealth divide
And so to my other Christmas destination , the Four Seasons Hotel in Miami , where we decided to go to cheer ourselves up and spend the money we had been saving for a later longer holiday .
" Carlos , I will not fly commercial !
I just wo n't do it - it 's too far . "
What highs and lows there are in the America Obama is inheriting
This is not an argument .
Carlos appears to know he has lost and he is looking indulgently at his gorgeously turned - out wife .
We are in a lift , my three children open - mouthed at this intrusion of wealth and glamour into our little world .
The deal was settled by the 11th floor .
She would fly in his private jet .
I noticed that Carlos had a very expensive watch , but I doubt he would have to sell it to pay for her trip .
These folks - America 's uber - rich - have certainly lost money in recent months but most of them are still pretty comfortably off , and there are many of them .
What a nation !
With sick children chased for money while the rich bicker about their flying options !
What highs and lows there are in the America [ President - elect Barack ]
Obama is inheriting !
Cautious changes
As it happens we could see from our hotel the glittering tropical sand bar of South Beach - the art deco part of Miami - which is , in an unequal nation , the most unequal place .
It has the highest income disparity of any corner of the United States .
Would changes to US tax polices help bridge the wealth divide ?
The enamel white yachts - some of them the size of cross channel ferries - are in sight of rooms , tiny rooms , literally under roads in some cases , where the poor live .
America is a place where money can be amassed and frittered away on private plane travel - a place where grieving parents face unpayable medical bills .
Obama will tax the plane owners more , and help the parents more , but within limits .
Because he will not want to mess with the essential fact of American life , that the cruelty and the hedonism are a by - product of an extraordinary energy , freedom and sense of ambition .
Places like Miami - as meretricious as they seem - are also a magnet for the world 's doctors , researchers , investors , thinkers and dreamers .
Obama knows that .
He will change the US over the next four or eight years but he will not want to flatten its spirit .
A British friend who is a paediatrician tells me that the US is the place where the cure for type one diabetes will be found .
And when it is found , millions will benefit .
And I would add that the researchers or the bosses of the drug company that funds the research , will never fly commercial again .
Which is fine by me .
